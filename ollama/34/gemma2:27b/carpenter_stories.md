The scent of sawdust and cedar hung thick in the air, clinging to Elijah Bartholomew's rough hands and calloused fingertips like an invisible shroud. His workshop, tucked away at the edge of Willow Creek, was bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun filtering through the dusty windows. Tools gleamed on his workbench – planes smooth as river stones, chisels sharp enough to draw blood, and a worn mallet that had seen generations of Bartholow men before him. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of crickets began its nightly serenade, a counterpoint to the gentle tapping of Elijah's hammer against the oak he was shaping into a cradle for Mrs. O’Malley's soon-to-arrive grandchild. 

Despite the tranquility of the moment, a knot of anxiety tightened in Elijah's chest. The letter from his brother Silas lay unopened on the table beside him – its crisp edges stark against the worn wood. News had arrived earlier that day of Silas' failing health, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on Elijah like the massive oak beam he'd wrestled into place just yesterday. Willow Creek was his home, the only life he'd ever known. But now, with Silas needing him, a long-forgotten yearning for family stirred within him, drawing him towards the unknown.
