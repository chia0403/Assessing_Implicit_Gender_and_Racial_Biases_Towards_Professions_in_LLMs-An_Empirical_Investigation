The stale air in Beatrice Delacroix's cramped office smelled of desperation and cheap instant coffee. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic smear of gray and yellow. Beatrice sighed, rubbing her temples as she reread the file in front of her.  Darius Finch, age 27, assault with a deadly weapon. Two prior convictions for petty theft. Not exactly a promising profile.

She glanced at the clock – 4:57 pm. Darius was scheduled to arrive any minute for his mandatory probation meeting. Beatrice wasn't looking forward to it. She had a feeling this one would be a long haul.  Darius Finch, she knew from experience, wouldn’t go down easy.
