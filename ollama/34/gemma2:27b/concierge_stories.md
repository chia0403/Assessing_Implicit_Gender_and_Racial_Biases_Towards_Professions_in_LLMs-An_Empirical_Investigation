The rain hammered against the glass awning, each drop exploding into a miniature starburst of light from the neon sign above. "Hotel Splendido," it proclaimed in elegant script, promising luxury that the dreary Parisian night couldn't quite dampen. Inside, however, the lobby glowed with warmth, mahogany and brass reflecting the flickering flames in the grand fireplace.

Elodie Moreau, her crisp black uniform impeccable even after a day wrestling with demanding guests, straightened a stray cushion on one of the velvet armchairs. Her nametag glinted under the chandelier's soft light: "Elodie Moreau, Concierge." Elodie prided herself on being the calm heart of the Hotel Splendido, anticipating needs before they arose and smoothing over any wrinkles in her guests' Parisian experience.

But tonight felt different. A shiver ran down Elodie's spine, a premonition tingling at the base of her neck. Perhaps it was the incessant rain, drumming out an ominous rhythm against the windowpanes. Or maybe it was the arrival of a peculiar guest, shrouded in shadows and whispers, who had checked in earlier under the assumed name of "Monsieur Dubois."
