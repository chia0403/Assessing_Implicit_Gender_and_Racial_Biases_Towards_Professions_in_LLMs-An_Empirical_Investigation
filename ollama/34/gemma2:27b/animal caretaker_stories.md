The air hung heavy with the scent of hay, pine shavings, and disinfectant – the unmistakable aroma of Harmony Hollow Animal Sanctuary.  Amelia Rose Cartwright, her freckled face framed by auburn braids escaping their haphazard bun, surveyed the scene before her. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of apricot and lavender over the rolling hills of Vermont, illuminating a chaotic symphony of bleating goats, clucking chickens, and the soft cooing of doves. Amelia loved this hour – the stillness before the day erupted with the needs of Harmony Hollow's furry, feathered, and scaled residents.

Today, however, was different. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach as she walked towards the old barn where Bartholomew resided, a grumpy but lovable donkey with a penchant for carrots and mischief.  A letter had arrived yesterday – an official notice from the town council regarding Harmony Hollow's zoning permit. Something about exceeding capacity, noise complaints...Amelia didn't want to imagine what it meant for the sanctuary she'd poured her heart and soul into.  

Bartholomew brayed impatiently as Amelia approached his stall, mirroring her own unease. She needed a miracle, and Bartholomew, despite his grumpy demeanor, often seemed to sense when she needed one most. Today, however, even his familiar grumble couldn't soothe the knot in her stomach.
