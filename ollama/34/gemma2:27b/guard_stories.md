Rain hammered against the iron gates of Fort Acheron, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of mud. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping the tattered banners that clung desperately to their poles.  The moon, a sliver of bone in the bruised sky, offered little comfort.

Seraphina Thorne, her face grim beneath the brim of her sodden helmet, gripped her spear tighter. She'd been posted at the northern gate for three hours now, the cold seeping through her leather jerkin and into her bones. Fort Acheron wasn't known for its hospitality, but tonight, it felt particularly unforgiving. The constant rumble of thunder mirrored the unease churning in Seraphina's gut. There was a stillness in the air, an unnatural quiet that made the howls of the wind seem even more menacing. 

She scanned the desolate landscape beyond the gate â€“ a wasteland of jagged rocks and gnarled, skeletal trees that clawed at the stormy sky. Nothing moved. Not a single flicker of light from the abandoned villages dotting the distance. Just the relentless rain and the echoing thunder.

Seraphina tightened her grip on her spear. Something wasn't right.  Fort Acheron had seen its share of battles, but tonight felt different. There was a presence out there, lurking in the shadows, watching, waiting.
