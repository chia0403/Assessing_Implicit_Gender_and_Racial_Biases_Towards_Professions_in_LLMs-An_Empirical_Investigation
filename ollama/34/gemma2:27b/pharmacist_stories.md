Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of "Apothecary's Corner," blurring the vibrant hues of the phoenix rising from the ashes. Inside, Eleanor Winthrop meticulously counted out pale blue capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic clinking of pills against glass was a familiar comfort, a counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind outside.

The apothecary, with its worn oak shelves overflowing with jars filled with dried herbs and tinctures, felt like a sanctuary â€“ a place where time seemed to stand still amidst the chaos of modern life.

But tonight, a different kind of storm was brewing. A curt message delivered by a messenger boy earlier that evening had thrown Eleanor's world into disarray. It read simply: "Come urgently. The lighthouse keeper is ill."
