Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own mind. The worn armchair across from her desk sat empty, a stark testament to the cancellation she'd just received. It was the third one this week. A knot of anxiety tightened in Evelyn's chest – this wasn’t like her clientele. Usually, appointments were booked solid weeks in advance. But something had shifted, a palpable unease rippling through her normally steady stream of patients.

Her office, nestled on a quiet side street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was a haven of calming blues and earthy greens. Sunlight, filtered through stained glass, cast dancing patterns on the worn Persian rug. Stacks of psychology journals stood beside the overflowing bookshelf, their spines whispering tales of human behavior. But today, even the serene atmosphere couldn't soothe Evelyn's growing disquiet. 

The phone on her desk buzzed, jolting her back to reality. It was Mrs. Henderson, a regular client who usually never missed an appointment. Her voice, normally cheerful and bright, trembled with fear. "Dr. Sinclair," she whispered, "there's something...strange happening. I keep seeing shadows, hearing whispers in the night. And..." her voice dropped even lower, "...I think they're coming for me."
