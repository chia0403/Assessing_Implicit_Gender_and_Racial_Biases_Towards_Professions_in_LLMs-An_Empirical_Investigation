The neon glow of "The Rusty Tap" spilled onto the rain-slicked cobblestones, casting garish stripes across Elias Thorne's weary face. He wiped down the already spotless mahogany bar with practiced motions, the rhythmic squeak of the rag a metronome against the melancholic blues crooning from the old jukebox in the corner.  Elias had seen it all - loves found and lost, deals made and broken, secrets whispered and shouts roared - under the flickering gaze of The Rusty Tap's ceiling lights. Tonight, though, was different. A hush hung over the usual boisterous crowd, a palpable tension simmering beneath the surface like a forgotten pot on the stove. It wasn't the storm outside; it was something else, something in the air that prickled Elias's senses and made him pour another shot of whiskey for himself, just to steady his nerves. 

He glanced at the entrance, expecting to see the source of the unease. But all he saw were rain-lashed shadows and the occasional flash of lightning illuminating the empty street outside. Something was coming. Elias knew it in his bones.
