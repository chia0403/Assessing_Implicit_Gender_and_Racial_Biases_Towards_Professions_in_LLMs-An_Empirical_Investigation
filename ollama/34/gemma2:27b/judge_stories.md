The scent of old parchment and beeswax hung heavy in the air of Judge Alistair Finch's chambers. Sunlight, filtered through stained glass depicting scales of justice, painted geometric patterns across the worn oak floor. Outside, the ceaseless hum of carriages and hawkers filled the London afternoon, but within these hallowed walls, silence reigned.

Alistair stared out the arched window, his reflection a ghostly apparition against the vibrant cityscapes. His face, normally etched with steely determination, bore an unusual furrow. The case before him – the trial of Lord Ashworth, accused of embezzling funds from the Crown – gnawed at him. While the evidence seemed irrefutable, something felt amiss. A prickle of doubt, like a stray thread snagging on his conscience, refused to be ignored.  He tapped a gnarled finger against the mahogany desk, its surface cluttered with legal tomes and half-written notes. 

The trial was scheduled to begin tomorrow, and Alistair knew he needed answers – answers that lay hidden somewhere beneath the layers of wealth, privilege, and deceit that shrouded Lord Ashworth's life.
