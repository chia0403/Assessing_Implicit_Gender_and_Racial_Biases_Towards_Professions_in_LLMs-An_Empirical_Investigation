The rusted clang of Reginald "Reggie" Finch's hammer echoed through the cavernous skeleton of the half-built skyscraper. Sunlight slanted through gaps in the steel girders, painting dusty stripes across the concrete floor. Reggie wiped sweat from his brow with a forearm thick as a man's thigh, squinting at the blueprints spread out on a rickety wooden table. Another day, another floor, another endless climb up the skeletal spine of this behemoth. He wasn't afraid of heights, not anymore. Years spent dangling from cranes and scaling scaffolding had cured him of that fear.

But today, something felt different. A prickle ran down his spine as he surveyed the dizzying drop below. The wind, usually a welcome reprieve from the city's stifling heat, carried an unsettling chill. Reggie glanced around at his colleagues, burly men with faces weathered by sun and toil, but none of them seemed to notice the shift in atmosphere.

He shook off the feeling, chalking it up to fatigue. After all, they were nearing the final stages of construction, and everyone was eager to be done. Still, a nagging unease lingered as Reggie hefted his toolbox onto his shoulder and headed towards the elevator shaft, the groan of metal echoing ominously behind him.
