Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Tax Haven" sign above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. April 15th loomed like a guillotine, its blade poised to sever the financial sanity of anyone who hadn't filed their taxes yet.

Amelia sighed, pushing her glasses further up the bridge of her nose.  She glanced at the clock – 7:42 pm. Another late night hunched over spreadsheets and W-2 forms. Her cramped office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of a strip mall, felt more like a dungeon than a place of business. But Amelia persevered. She knew the panic that gripped people this time of year, the fear of audits and penalties. It was her mission, however unappreciated, to guide them through the labyrinthine tax code and emerge on the other side with their sanity – and wallets – intact.
