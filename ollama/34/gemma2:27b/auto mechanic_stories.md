Grease clung to Elara Vargas’s fingernails like stubborn barnacles. The midday sun beat down on her back as she wrestled with the rusted bolt holding a 1967 Mustang's engine block in place.  Her garage, "Vargas Auto," wasn't much to look at - just a corrugated metal shed tucked away behind her grandfather’s rambling Victorian house in the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven.  But it was hers. A haven filled with the comforting scent of gasoline and oil, the rhythmic clinking of tools, and the guttural growl of engines brought back to life. 

Today's project, however, wasn't cooperating. The bolt refused to budge, mocking Elara with its unwavering resistance.  Frustration gnawed at her, but she refused to give in. She grabbed a breaker bar, channeling all her strength into twisting it clockwise.  Suddenly, the bolt gave way with a sharp crack, sending shards of rust flying through the air.  Elara wiped her brow, a triumphant grin spreading across her face. Just another day in paradise.
