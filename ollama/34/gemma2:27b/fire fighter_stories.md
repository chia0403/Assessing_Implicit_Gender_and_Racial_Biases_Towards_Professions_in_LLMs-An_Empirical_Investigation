Smoke clawed at Beatrice "Bea" Alvarez's face mask, acrid and hot even through the thick filter. The warehouse throbbed with a guttural roar, flames licking hungrily at the rafters, casting grotesque shadows that danced around her team. They were pinned down by a wall of fire, the only exit blocked by collapsing debris. Sweat stung Bea's eyes, but she couldn't afford to blink. Panic gnawed at the edges of her mind, threatening to overwhelm her years of training. This wasn't like the controlled burns they practiced back at the station. This was real. Lives hung in the balance.

The warehouse was a hulking behemoth in the industrial district, its rusty metal skin scarred with soot and graffiti.  A derelict relic from another era, it now housed forgotten dreams â€“ dusty furniture, stacks of old newspapers, and boxes overflowing with unidentified junk. Tonight, those forgotten dreams had ignited into a raging inferno.
