Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Lucky Cat" diner, blurring the neon sign into an anemic smear. The smell of stale coffee and frying onions battled for dominance in the air, punctuated by the occasional clatter from the back kitchen. Eloise Beatrice Finch, her trench coat dripping onto the threadbare vinyl seat, hunched over a notebook, scribbling furiously. Outside, the city of Newhaven snarled and hissed under a deluge that promised no respite. But Eloise barely noticed; she was consumed by the story unfolding in front of her â€“ a tale whispered in hushed tones, hidden beneath layers of rumour and fear.

It had started with a tip from an anonymous source: whispers of strange lights seen hovering over the abandoned shipyard at the edge of town, stories of missing fishermen and eerie noises echoing through the fog-shrouded docks. Eloise, known for her tenacity and willingness to chase down even the most outlandish leads, couldn't resist the pull of the unknown. Now, armed with a handful of shaky eyewitness accounts and a gnawing sense of unease, she was determined to uncover the truth, no matter how deep it lay buried beneath the city's rain-soaked grime.
