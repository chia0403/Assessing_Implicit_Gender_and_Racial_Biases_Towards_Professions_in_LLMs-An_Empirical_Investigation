The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Elm Street, turning the air thick and heavy. A symphony of cicadas thrummed from the overgrown oak trees lining the street, their incessant chirping only amplifying the oppressive silence that hung over Agnes Beaumont's workshop.

Agnes, a woman whose calloused hands and grease-stained overalls spoke volumes about her profession, sat hunched over a rusted pipe fitting, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her tools – wrenches, pliers, and a battered toolbox overflowing with mismatched parts – lay scattered on the workbench beside her, reflecting the disarray of her thoughts. Business had been slow lately. Elm Street was slowly dying, its aging residents moving to assisted living facilities or passing away altogether, leaving behind empty houses with leaky faucets and neglected gardens.

Today, however, Agnes held a sliver of hope. A call had come in that morning – a young couple, new to the neighborhood, with a stubborn blockage in their kitchen sink. It wasn't much, but for Agnes, it felt like a lifeline in a sea of stagnation.
