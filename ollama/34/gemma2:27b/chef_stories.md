The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of rosemary and a hint of woodsmoke from the dying embers in the hearth. It was a familiar scent to Beatrice "Bea" Delacroix, head chef of La Petite Étoile, a tiny but beloved bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in Montmartre. 

The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the cramped kitchen. Pots bubbled, knives clattered, and Bea's sous chef, Jean-Luc, swore under his breath as he wrestled with a stubborn batch of béchamel. 


Bea, her forehead beaded with sweat and a stray strand of auburn hair escaping from its braid, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. The dinner rush was imminent, and everything needed to be perfect. La Petite Étoile was more than just a restaurant; it was Bea's legacy, inherited from her grandmother, who had instilled in her a love for traditional French cuisine and an unwavering dedication to quality.  Tonight, however, something felt off. A disquieting sense of anticipation hung in the air, as palpable as the smell of caramelized onions.
