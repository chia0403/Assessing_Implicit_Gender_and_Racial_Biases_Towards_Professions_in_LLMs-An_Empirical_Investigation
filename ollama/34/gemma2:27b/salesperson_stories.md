The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and lemon-scented cleaning spray â€“ a sterile perfume designed to evoke cleanliness and trust. Evelyn wasn't fooled. She knew the real smell of "Appliance Palace" was desperation masked by polish, the faint whiff of dreams deferred clinging to every stainless steel refrigerator and chrome oven.

No, this month's target loomed large over her like a hungry beast, threatening to swallow her hopes of finally affording that little cottage by the sea she'd been dreaming of since childhood.
