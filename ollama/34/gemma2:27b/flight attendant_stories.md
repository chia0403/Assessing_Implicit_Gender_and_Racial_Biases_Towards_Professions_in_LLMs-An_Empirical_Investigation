Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 747, blurring the twinkling city lights beneath them. The turbulence was nothing unusual for this transatlantic route, but it did little to soothe Evelyn Amelia Davenport’s frayed nerves.  Evelyn, with her perfectly coiffed auburn bun and crimson lipstick, exuded an air of practiced calm. But beneath the surface, anxiety gnawed at her. 

She wasn't afraid of flying – years as a flight attendant for Aerilon Airways had long since dispelled that fear. No, what troubled Evelyn was the cryptic note she'd received earlier that morning, tucked anonymously into her locker: "The sky holds secrets. Beware." It was childish, almost laughable, yet it left a chilling premonition in its wake.  

Evelyn glanced at her reflection in the galley mirror, trying to smooth away the worry lines that had etched themselves around her emerald green eyes. She straightened her crisp navy uniform and took a deep breath. Duty called. The passengers needed reassurance, not their flight attendant spiraling into paranoia over an anonymous threat.

As Evelyn wheeled her trolley down the aisle, offering warm smiles and calming words to the anxious travelers, she couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that something was amiss.
