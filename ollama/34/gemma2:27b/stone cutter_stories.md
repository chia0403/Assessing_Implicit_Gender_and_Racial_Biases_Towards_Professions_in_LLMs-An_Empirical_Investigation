The air hung heavy with dust motes dancing in the weak morning sun that slanted through the open doorway of Elias Blackwood's workshop.  The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel reverberated off the rough-hewn stone walls, a familiar symphony to Elias' ears. For forty years, this sound had been his constant companion, the heartbeat of his existence. He inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of granite and sweat, the tang of metal on stone. 

Outside, the bustling marketplace of Stonemantle was already alive with vendors hawking their wares and children chasing pigeons through the cobbled streets. But Elias remained within his sanctuary, a world of cool grey stone and the satisfying bite of his chisel into a block of marble. Today, he was shaping a gargoyle for the cathedral spire â€“ a creature both grotesque and majestic, its wings outstretched as if to ward off evil spirits.
