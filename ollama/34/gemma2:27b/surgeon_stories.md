The fluorescent lights of the operating theatre buzzed overhead like angry wasps, their hum a counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor beside Eleanor Vance's left ear.  Eleanor, her forehead slick with sweat despite the chilled air conditioning, focused intently on the delicate web of veins and arteries laid bare before her. The patient, a young woman named Isabella, lay still beneath the harsh glare, her chest rising and falling in shallow breaths.

It was a complex procedure – a triple bypass on a heart weakened by a rare congenital defect. Eleanor's hands moved with practiced precision, each stitch a testament to years of relentless training and countless hours spent honing her craft. The weight of Isabella’s life rested on Eleanor’s shoulders, a burden she carried with stoic determination. Outside the sterile walls of the operating room, the city of London bustled with its usual frenetic energy, but here time seemed suspended, measured only by the steady drip of saline and the unwavering pulse of hope.

Eleanor had always been driven by a deep-seated need to heal, to mend the broken threads of life. But lately, a nagging sense of doubt had begun to creep into her meticulously ordered world. Was she truly making a difference? Or was she simply patching up wounds destined to reopen, playing God in a game with no winners?
