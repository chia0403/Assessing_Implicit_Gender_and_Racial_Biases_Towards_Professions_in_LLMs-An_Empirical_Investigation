The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Silas Blackwood's office, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the already cracked glass.  A neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the cluttered desk piled high with dusty files and empty coffee mugs.  Smoke curled lazily from the perpetually lit cigarette dangling between Silas's lips, momentarily obscuring his sharp, hawk-like features. His office, located in a dimly lit alleyway off Bleecker Street, was as much a character in this noir tale as Silas himself.

The door creaked open with a groan, admitting a sliver of cold, wet air and the silhouette of a woman cloaked in shadows. "Mr. Blackwood?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper against the ceaseless drumming of the rain. 


Silas leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowed, taking in her hesitant demeanor. He tapped the ash from his cigarette into a chipped ashtray overflowing with butts. "That's me, ma'am.  What can I do for you?"

The woman stepped inside, revealing a face etched with worry and the glimmer of unshed tears. "My name is Eliza Thorne," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "And I need your help."
