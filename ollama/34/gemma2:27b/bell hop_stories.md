The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung thick with the cloying scent of lilies and regret.  Elias Jasper Finch III, or "Eli" as the few regulars who remembered his name called him, heaved a sigh as another gilded carriage pulled up to the portico. He straightened his already impeccable uniform – navy blue with gleaming brass buttons – and plastered a smile onto his face that felt more like a grimace.

It was another day in the opulent purgatory that was the Grand Blackwood. Tourists gawked at the marble floors and ornate chandeliers, oblivious to the dust motes swirling in the golden light and the faint smell of mildew clinging to the velvet drapes. They were here for the illusion of grandeur, for the whispers of a bygone era when fortunes were built on railroads and empires rose from blood and bone. Eli, however, saw through the facade. He'd seen the chipped paint beneath the gilded frames, the frayed edges of the once-plush carpets, the weary eyes of the staff who toiled behind the scenes, their own dreams fading like the wallpaper in the neglected guest rooms. 


Today, though, something felt different. A shiver snaked down Eli's spine as he watched a cloaked figure emerge from the carriage. The visitor’s face was obscured by shadows, but there was an aura of power emanating from them, something that made even the seasoned bellhops pause and stare.  Eli knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this guest wouldn't be like the others. This arrival promised trouble, the kind that whispered in forgotten corners and lingered in the hallways long after guests had departed.
