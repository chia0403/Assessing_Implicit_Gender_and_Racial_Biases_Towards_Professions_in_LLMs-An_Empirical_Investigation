The air in "The Flour Child" was thick with the scent of cinnamon and caramelized sugar. Amelia Rose Blackwood, her flour-dusted apron as familiar as her own skin, hummed along to the radio playing softly in the corner. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, illuminating motes of dust dancing over trays piled high with croissants, pain au chocolat, and crusty baguettes. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek bustled with morning life, but inside Amelia's world was one of measured movements, precise folds, and the quiet satisfaction that came from transforming simple ingredients into something beautiful and delicious. Today, however, the usual rhythm felt off-kilter. A note pinned to the door caught her eye: "Urgent Meeting - Town Hall - 10am."  Amelia frowned, her kneading hand pausing mid-stroke. Meetings rarely meant good news in Willow Creek, a town clinging fiercely to tradition and wary of change. What could possibly be so urgent?
