The air hung thick with pine sap and the earthy scent of damp woodchips. A fine mist clung to the towering redwoods, blurring their edges into ethereal giants. Jeremiah “Jerry” Blackwood squinted through the haze, his calloused hand shielding his eyes from the weak morning sun filtering through the canopy. He surveyed the scene before him: a tangle of fallen giants, freshly felled and awaiting their journey to the sawmill. 

Jerry ran a calloused thumb across the worn handle of his axe, feeling its familiar weight settle into his grip. The rhythmic thudding of chainsaws echoed in the distance, a symphony of destruction and creation that was the soundtrack of his life. This ancient forest held both beauty and danger, and Jerry knew it intimately. He'd spent his whole life amidst these towering trees, learning the language of their creaks and groans, understanding the silent warnings whispered by the wind rustling through their needles.
