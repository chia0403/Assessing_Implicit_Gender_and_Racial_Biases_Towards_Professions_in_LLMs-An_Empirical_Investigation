The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof like angry fists, each blow echoing through the ramshackle workshop that was Edgar "Eddie" Thompson's only haven. A symphony of dripping pipes and sighing water heaters filled the air, mingling with the sweet, spicy aroma of his grandfather's old chili sauce simmering on the stovetop. Eddie, his grease-stained overalls stained with the same deep red as the sauce, squinted at the leaking pipe under a flickering fluorescent light. This wasn't just another leaky faucet; this was the heart of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion, its groaning pipes whispering tales of past winters and forgotten dreams. 

Eddie had grown up in this place, learning his trade from his grandfather's weathered hands and the worn, leather-bound plumbing manuals stacked precariously on a wobbly workbench. His world was one of grime, grit, and the satisfying clink of copper pipes as he diagnosed each new problem with the precision of a surgeon. 

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sense of unease settled over Eddie like a damp sheet. The incessant drumming of the rain couldn't mask the eerie silence that followed each gurgling burst of water.  It was almost as if the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
