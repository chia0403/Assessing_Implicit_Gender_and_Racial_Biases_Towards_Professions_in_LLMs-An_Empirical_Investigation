The fluorescent hum vibrated through Amelia's bones as she wiped down the checkout counter for the tenth time in the last hour.  Her calloused fingers traced the familiar grooves carved by countless sticky-fingered customers, their anxieties and triumphs echoing in the steady rhythm of the register. This was her life, a never-ending cycle of greeting smiles, managing grumpy returns, and calculating change.

His eyes darted back and forth, searching for anything that might escape his grasp – a misplaced receipt, a forgotten bag, maybe even a stray thought.  "Amelia," he repeated, his voice growing increasingly frantic, "There's been a...well…a situation."

He shuffled closer, his face contorted with worry. Amelia glanced at the overflowing grocery bags in front of her and sighed. It was going to be another Tuesday.
