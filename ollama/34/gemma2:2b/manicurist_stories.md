The air hung thick with the sweet scent of jasmine and acetone as Amelia "Amy" Everly smoothed out her worn terrycloth towel. Her tiny nail salon in the heart of bustling Little Havana was always humming - the rhythm of it soothing, almost like a lullaby.  Outside, the Florida sun beat down on the terracotta tiles, casting long shadows from the palm trees swaying gently. Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic clicking of her electric file and the quiet hum of anticipation as she waited for her next client – Mrs. Garcia, whose calloused hands held the secrets of generations of Cuban cuisine. 

It wasn't just the stories in Mrs. Garcia's hands that Amy cherished; it was the way her hands reminded her of the endless possibilities life offered, even amidst the mundane grind of manicures and pedicures. Life, like a well-crafted manicure, needed to be treated with care and precision – a little bit of polish here, a touch of strength there, always ready to face whatever came next.
