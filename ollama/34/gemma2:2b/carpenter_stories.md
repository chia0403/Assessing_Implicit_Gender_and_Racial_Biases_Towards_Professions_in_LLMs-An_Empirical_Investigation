The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised violet as if trying to apologize for the day's stinginess. Ethan "Woodhand" Miller, his calloused hands slick with sweat and sawdust, surveyed his handiwork: a sturdy oak workbench he'd finished earlier that afternoon.  For years, this small workshop nestled between towering pines had been his sanctuary, a refuge from the cacophony of the city.

The air, heavy with the smell of pine and burning wood, felt almost tangible in Ethan's lungs. This wasn't just sawdust; this was memories. Each plank he'd cut, each screw he'd driven, told a story â€“ tales of forgotten dreams, of love lost and found, of hardships overcome. He traced the grooves in the worn surface of his bench with his calloused thumb, a silent prayer for the days when the forest wouldn't demand so much of him.

His gaze drifted towards the rising moon, bathing his shop in a silvery light that seemed to hold the weight of all the stories he had yet to tell.
