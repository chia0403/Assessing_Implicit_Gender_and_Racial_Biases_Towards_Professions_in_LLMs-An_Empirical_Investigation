## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur Finch's office, each drop exploding into a miniature geyser of water as it hit the glass. The wind howled like a banshee outside, mirroring the unease swirling in Arthur's gut.  He stared at the overflowing coffee mug on his desk, its bitterness a reflection of the day that had already gone from bad to worse. The usual cheerful hum of client calls and the soothing scent of cinnamon air freshener were swallowed by the storm and replaced with an unsettling quiet.

Arthur Finch, licensed agent extraordinaire and resident expert in anything from home insurance to pet health policies, was staring at a file that felt thicker than a stack of old tomes. This wasn't just another claim; this was Mrs. Peabody's house, her prized possessions piled high in the living room –  and now, the very house itself seemed to be crumbling under the weight of the storm and an unknown tragedy.

**Setting:** Arthur Finch runs his insurance agency from a cozy office nestled on a quaint street in Providence, Rhode Island. The shop is filled with the comforting smell of old wood polish, vintage posters advertising "The Perfect Life," and the faintest hint of burnt cinnamon. Despite the storm raging outside, a sense of routine reigns within these walls – a routine that Arthur desperately clings to as he attempts to navigate this latest, uncharted territory.
