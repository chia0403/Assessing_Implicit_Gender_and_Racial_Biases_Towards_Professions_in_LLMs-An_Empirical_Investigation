The smell of stale cigarettes and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air of the Majestic Hotel. It clung to the worn plush carpets and whispered secrets in the echoing hallways. This was the life of Jasper "Jay" Montgomery, bellhop extraordinaire of Room 307. For years he'd known every creak of the grand staircase, every flicker of a forgotten light, every hushed whisper that escaped the velvet-curtained rooms. Tonight, however, felt different. The usual hum of city life was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence. 

Jay's boots clicked against the marble floor as he approached room 310. It belonged to Mrs. Evelyn Winthrop, a woman who’d been known for her opulent parties and even more opulent eccentricities. Tonight, however, even Mrs. Winthrop seemed subdued, her usual sparkle replaced by an icy pallor. As Jay entered the room, he noticed a single rose lying on the pristine white bedsheets, its petals wilting but its crimson hue vibrant against the starkness of the room. 

A sense of foreboding settled over Jay's heart like a cold draft in the dead of winter. He felt a knot tightening in his stomach as he took one last look at Mrs. Winthrop’s portrait: a woman with haunting blue eyes and lips perpetually pursed. It had been his only comfort for years, a silent witness to her solitary life.
