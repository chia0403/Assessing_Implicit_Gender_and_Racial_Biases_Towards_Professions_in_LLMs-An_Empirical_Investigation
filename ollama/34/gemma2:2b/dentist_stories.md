The air hung thick with the scent of formaldehyde and anxiety, a familiar cocktail in Dr. Evelyn Thorne’s small, meticulously kept office. The city hummed outside her window: a constant symphony of sirens, rumbling buses, and distant laughter echoing from park fountains.  Evelyn adjusted the silver-rimmed spectacles on her nose, squinting at the file in front of her. It was titled “Mr. O'Malley – Routine Extraction,” but the name didn’t feel right. The man had been a regular for years, his routine smiles and polite greetings never quite matching the anxiety etched across his eyes when he sat down in Evelyn’s chair. He always left, like many others did, with a forced cheeriness that felt hollow, leaving behind a faint echo of unease. 

It was those subtle signs, the unspoken anxieties beneath the surface, that drew Evelyn into the intricate dance of dentistry – the act of not just fixing teeth but mending broken smiles and restoring shattered confidence. She had grown tired of the sterile efficiency of corporate practices where faces went in and out like sheep through a meat grinder. Here, in her tiny clinic nestled between a vintage bookstore and a bustling Indian restaurant, she felt the possibility of something more -  something that touched lives beyond just cleanings and fillings.
