The rain hammered against the conservatory roof like tiny fists, each blow shaking loose tendrils of ivy clinging to the ornate wrought-iron frames.  Amelia Thistlewick, her forehead slick with sweat despite the frigid air, navigated the precarious landscape of dusty porcelain and wilting orchids. Her boots splashed through puddles forming on the worn Persian rugs, a symphony of dampness that echoed the heavy rhythm of sorrow in her heart.

Today's tasks were as demanding as they were depressing: polishing the silver collection that glinted with an unnatural gleam after years of neglect, scrubbing the grime off Mrs. Winthrop’s prized rose bushes in desperate hope for a single blossom to grace the dreary windowsill.  For Amelia, the manor house felt less like a testament to opulence and more like a mausoleum, each room filled with echoes of forgotten joy and faded dreams.

Amelia was no stranger to sorrow, but it clung to her like a second skin after she lost her husband, Thomas, just before Christmas two years ago.  He’d left her with nothing but their worn-out quilt and an empty promise: "Keep the house humming, Amelia." Now, every floorboard creaked with memories of his presence, every corner whispered of shared moments he'd never return to share again.
