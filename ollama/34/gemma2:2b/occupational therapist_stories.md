The worn vinyl chair creaked under Amelia Thorne’s weight as she surveyed the bustling playroom. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass window in the corner, casting kaleidoscopic shapes on the scattered toys and climbing frames.  It was a familiar scene – one that had brought her joy for years – yet today felt different. The usual cheerful hum of children interacting with each other was replaced by an unsettling quiet, punctuated only by the occasional cough or sniffle from a distance.

Amelia was no stranger to families grappling with their child's challenges, especially after the recent influx of neurodiverse kids into their community's special education program. Today felt heavier, the weight of unseen difficulties pressing down on her like the heavy drapes in the playroom itself.
