The wind, smelling faintly of dust and salt, whipped through Elias Thorne’s worn straw hat as he stood surveying his fields. The sun, sinking low in the sky, bled orange into the canvas of the western horizon. He was known throughout the county as "Old Man Elias," not for any age, but for the weathered hands that coaxed life from the earth and a spirit as stubborn as the roots of the ancient oaks that lined his property’s edge. Elias Thorne was the last true farmer on Widow's Ridge, and the land he tended spoke volumes about him: a patchwork quilt of dirt, scrubby weeds, and resilient crops.

His worn farm tools lay scattered around him like forgotten memories, each bearing silent stories of years spent in this unforgiving but beautiful landscape.  But there was something unsettling tonight. A darkness lingered where the day should have brought warmth. And the whispers on the wind seemed to carry a message – one that went beyond just the rustle of leaves and the cries of crickets.  Tonight, Widow’s Ridge felt charged with an unseen energy.
