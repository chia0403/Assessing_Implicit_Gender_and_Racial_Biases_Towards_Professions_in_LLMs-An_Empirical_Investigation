## The Crash

The air hung thick with tension in Marcus Blackwood's office, a tangible weight pressing against the glass facade overlooking Wall Street.  Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Marcus himself. He ran a hand through his perpetually disheveled hair, trying to tame the chaos that seemed to cling to his life like an unwelcome shadow. His reflection in the window was grim; lines etched into his normally handsome face spoke of sleepless nights and countless spreadsheets. 

Today's market crash had been devastatingly abrupt, leaving Wall Street reeling, investors screaming, and Marcus trapped at the heart of it all. He glanced at his clock - 3:17 PM. Just past closing, yet every minute felt like an eternity. The numbers on his screen were a blur; he could barely process them, only feel the crushing weight of responsibility that had become his constant companion these last few years. 

He'd built a career on calculated risks and measured strategies, but now those strategies seemed to be crumbling before his eyes. He was supposed to guide his clients through this treacherous landscape, not sink alongside them in its wreckage. Marcus Blackwood, the renowned stock broker, felt like he was staring down the abyss.  His phone vibrated - another panicked message from one of his clients. The echoes of their despair mingled with the howling wind outside, forming a symphony of chaos that threatened to consume him.
