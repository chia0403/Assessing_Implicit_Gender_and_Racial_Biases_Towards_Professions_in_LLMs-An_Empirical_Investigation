The flickering neon sign above "Johnny's Electrical Emporium" buzzed like a trapped wasp, its sickly green glow casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered parking lot. A wall of heat pressed against the shop's front door, even with the open window. Johnny Miller, his thick, curly hair sweat-slicked and clinging to his brow, felt the weight of another day already pressing down on him.  

He was twenty-five years old, a rough man built like an oak tree - strong limbs that ended in calloused hands. The air thrummed with the hum of faulty wiring, the crackle of dying bulbs, and the constant drone of his worn tool belt. This was his world, one of flickering lights and sputtering motors, where the silence between sparks felt louder than a storm. 

His workshop, crammed into a dusty corner of the building, was a chaotic symphony of copper, screws, and memories. A faded photo of his childhood home, a brick bungalow with chipped paint, hung crookedly on the wall.  He knew he'd never be able to escape this life, but sometimes, under the harsh fluorescent glare of his workshop, he wondered if maybe there was another world out there waiting for him.
