The wind off the pines was sharp and clean like a blade, slicing through Jasper “Hawk” Hawthorne’s worn leather jacket as he stepped into the clearing. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the forest floor, dappling everything in gold and red. He wasn’t one for the quiet of the woods. But the silence here had been broken by something else – a sharp whine that seemed to vibrate through the ground itself. 

Hawk squinted into the thick undergrowth. The sound was coming from somewhere just beyond the edge of the clearing, near the old, gnarled stand of cedar trees where his grandfather had taught him everything he knew about felling a tree. This wasn’t the usual buzzing of bees or chirp of crickets. It was something… other. Something with an urgency and ferocity that sent a prickle down Hawk's spine.
