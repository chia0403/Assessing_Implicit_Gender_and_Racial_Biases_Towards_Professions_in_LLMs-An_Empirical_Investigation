## Setting

The humid air clung to Amelia Thorne like a second skin, clinging onto her already damp clothes as she navigated the labyrinthine alleyways of New Shanghai's Chinatown. Neon signs painted vibrant dreams on the grimy brick walls, but Amelia only saw shadows and whispered voices behind them. Her worn fedora shielded eyes from the ever-present glare, and she felt like a ghost herself, blending into the throngs of people who hustled by with hurried steps and tightly woven smiles. 

**Character:**

Amelia Thorne - A sharp, tenacious journalist, known for her relentless pursuit of truth, even when it landed her smack-dab in the middle of a dangerous situation.  Her eyes, perpetually narrowed over a pair of thick-rimmed glasses, watched the city unfold with a keen awareness that bordered on obsession. 

**Opening:**

"The Jade Dragon Casino is where whispers turn to screams," Amelia muttered under her breath, her gaze fixated on the shadowy entrance of the casino's back alley. The air buzzed with unease; it wasn't the usual clamor of gambling and laughter. This was a different kind of energy, one that pricked at Amelia's senses like an unwanted prickle.  It had been six months since her last article on the infamous 'Ghost City', a sprawling urban myth whispered about in hushed tones - a city said to be inhabited by ghosts and shrouded in secrets as dark as the shadows themselves. Tonight, she was closing in on the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it might get. 
 
Amelia adjusted her worn leather satchel and took a deep breath of stale cigarette smoke â€“ a scent that usually filled her with dread, but tonight, seemed strangely fitting for this undercurrent of anticipation that crackled through the air like static electricity.  This wasn't just another story; it was about finding something real - something tangible.  Something human.
