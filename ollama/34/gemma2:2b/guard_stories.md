The crimson sun bled into the horizon, staining the sky with streaks of fire and leaving a chilling chill in its wake.  Sergius Thorne, or "Thorny" as he preferred, tugged his threadbare cloak tighter around himself against the biting wind whipping off the North Sea. He stood at the precipice of the Grand Gate, his thick, calloused hand gripping the hilt of his worn sword.

He was stationed here as one of the many guards protecting the ancient library - home to untold secrets whispered from generations past. For years, he'd been a silent guardian within its hallowed halls, his duty a solemn promise etched into his soul: to protect the knowledge and shield the city from those who sought to exploit its power.

The usual hush of anticipation before the night shift's beginning had been replaced by a palpable fear, a sense of foreboding that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the library itself.
