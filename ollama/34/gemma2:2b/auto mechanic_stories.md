Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into smudged halos. Inside "Rusty Wrench" Auto Repair, the air was thick with oil fumes and the low hiss of compressed air from the compressor.  A lone figure hunched over a sputtering red pickup truck, grease-stained overalls clinging to his lean frame like second skin. His name was Elias Thorne, and he’d been tinkering with engines since he could grip a wrench, born into the greasy world of auto mechanics and raised on its rhythms and secrets. The smell of burnt oil filled him, a comforting aroma that resonated deep within him like a symphony played only for his ears.

He knew this truck – Rusty's '78 Chevy Silverado – better than he knew himself. Its worn paint job was a testament to years spent battling the elements and countless miles driven on sun-baked asphalt and snow-covered mountain passes. The engine, however, was its heart, a thunderous beast that coughed and sputtered under Elias' careful touch.  He swore he could hear the truck’s soul struggling for breath – a silent plea from his hands as they wrestled with the carburetor. Tonight, though, felt different. It wasn't just the weather or the endless symphony of gears and sprockets. A feeling, deeper than grease and oil, hummed in Elias’ bones. Something was coming... something that would change everything.
