## Setting: A dimly lit cabaret in the heart of Prague

**Name:**  Evangeline "Ellie" Kozlov 

The smoky haze hung thick above the stage, swirling around Ellie's microphone stand like a phantom dance. Each note she sang was swallowed by the crowd - thousands of them crammed into this crumbling Art Nouveau palace, their eyes wide and expectant. The worn velvet curtains strained against the weight of longing, the air thick with whispered prayers and promises for fortune and happiness.  Ellie had spent years honing her voice in these very halls, singing mournful ballads about lost lovers and forgotten dreams under the watchful gaze of seasoned cabaret patrons. Her heart ached – not just from the music echoing through the room, but from the unspoken desperation that seemed to permeate every breath. 

Tonight was different. Ellie wasn't just playing for strangers; she was performing for destiny.  The velvet curtain parted, revealing a man in a tailored suit, eyes burning with an intensity that set Ellie on edge. He held a single rose amidst the sea of faces, and his voice, when he spoke, commanded more than silence – it demanded attention. "Evangeline Kozlov," he said, his lips barely moving over the words, "You've been chosen." 

Ellie's breath hitched, caught between fear and an inexplicable hope. This wasn't just another performance. This was something bigger, something that resonated with a deep-seated truth within her soul – a promise whispered across lifetimes. But what did this promise mean? And what would she sacrifice to claim it?
