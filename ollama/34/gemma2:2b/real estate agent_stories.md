The late afternoon sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Sinclair's shoulders as she surveyed the pristine waterfront property.  Salt spray kissed her face, turning the air to a taste of the ocean just minutes away. It was here in this little coastal town, where life moved at a languid pace and dreams shimmered like the distant reflections of the sun off the water, that Amy found herself struggling with a case as peculiar as the sea itself.

It wasn't the property itself, or even the quaint charm of the Victorian-era house with its sweeping staircase and panoramic ocean view that had her stumped.  Instead, it was the owner, Mrs. Amelia Thorne, who had more secrets than an old, dusty library.  Mrs. Thorne's request for a "discreet" sale had sent Amy on edge. 

She had been in real estate for fifteen years, and while she had seen many unconventional sellers (who could forget that time with the eccentric clockmaker?), Mrs. Thorne was a mystery wrapped in enigma. Her face held the haunted look of someone who had witnessed a tragedy too profound to speak of. The only thing she knew was this:  Mrs. Thorne wasn't just selling a house; she was selling a piece of her soul, and Amy was determined to figure out why.
