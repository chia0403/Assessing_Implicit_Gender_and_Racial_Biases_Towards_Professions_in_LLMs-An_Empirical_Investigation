## The Setting

The hum of the machinery was almost drowned out by the gentle symphony of traffic outside Dr. Thompson's office window.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the bustling cityscape into an abstract watercolor of grey and silver.  The year was 2047, and this quaint Victorian building in a forgotten corner of London felt worlds away from the neon-drenched metropolis that stretched out beyond its worn stone facade. Inside, the air was heavy with the aroma of antiseptic and peppermint, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of porcelain on stainless steel as Evelyn "Eve" Cartwright, a dental hygienist with more than 50 years of service under her belt, finished polishing the last molar.  

## The Opening

"Mrs. Hawthorne, darling, you've got to stop chewing your nails!" Eve chided gently, peering at Mrs. Hawthorne's nervous fingers as she gripped the edge of the chair in front of her. "That will only lead to more problems down the line." 
Eve was accustomed to calming anxieties, but this visit felt different. Something about Mrs. Hawthorne’s strained expression and the way her eyes darted around the room like a caged bird, unsettled Eve.

Mrs. Hawthorne started, startled by Eve's observation.  “Oh, nothing... just a little worried," she mumbled, glancing nervously towards the door. 


This is only a taste of their story!  Eve will face an unexpected challenge in this quiet corner of London as something shifts beyond the walls of her practice.
