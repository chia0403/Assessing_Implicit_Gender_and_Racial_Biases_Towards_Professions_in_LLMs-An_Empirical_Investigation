Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Thorne's clinic, each drop like a tiny hammer blow on the glass.  It was the kind of downpour that sent most city dwellers seeking shelter, but inside her modest practice in the heart of Oakhaven, the air hummed with the low purr of equipment and the comforting scent of disinfectant. 

Amelia, tall and slender, with hair as dark and fiery as her late mother's, knelt by a gurney, gently probing the abdomen of a mangy terrier mix named Sparky.  His soulful brown eyes stared back at her, filled with both fear and a quiet trust Amelia cherished in all creatures she healed. He was one of many strays that found themselves caught in Oakhaven's underbelly, victims of neglect and abandonment.

She sighed, brushing the soft fur around his ribs. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil in her own heart: grief still lingered, a heavy fog in the sunny corners of her memories. Just yesterday she had received news that would shake Amelia to her core - her father's passing was now an undeniable reality.

 **Character:** Dr. Amelia Thorne -  A veterinarian who finds solace and purpose in caring for the animals she sees.
