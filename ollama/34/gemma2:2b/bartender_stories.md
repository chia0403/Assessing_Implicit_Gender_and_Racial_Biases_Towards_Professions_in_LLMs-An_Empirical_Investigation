## Setting: The Rusty Nail

The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer in "The Rusty Nail," a dive bar tucked away on a cobbled side street. Neon signs flickered above the worn wooden bar and chipped vinyl booths. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow into an erratic dance of color. 

**Name:** Jasper Thorne, a man whose weathered face mirrored the chipped paint and faded wood of the bar he ran for the last fifteen years. His hands, calloused from decades of shaking glasses and serving weary souls, moved with practiced ease as he poured another drink - a bourbon neat for Mrs. Peterson, whose husband had passed away weeks ago.

A low murmur echoed around the room, punctuated by the clinking of ice cubes in his hand and the occasional burst of laughter from groups huddled around worn-out televisions flickering between old wrestling matches and grainy baseball games. 

Jasper wasn't exactly a stranger to heartbreak. He'd seen it reflected in the eyes of countless regulars, each story etched into their weary smiles. It was a familiar ache that settled deep within him, a quiet hum against the background chaos of his life at "The Rusty Nail."  


But tonight felt different. The usual unease was gone, replaced by a palpable tension that prickled the air like static electricity. Jasper knew something was about to happen. He just couldn't put his finger on it.
