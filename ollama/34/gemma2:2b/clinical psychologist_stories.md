The steam rose from Amelia Thorne's lukewarm coffee as she stared out the window, watching the sun bleed into the horizon, casting long shadows across her office. It wasnâ€™t just the usual melancholy that clung to the air, but something deeper, something akin to anticipation that made her stomach twist with unease.  She was about to meet him: Mr. Edward Blackwood, a man whose case file lay open on her desk like an unassuming enigma. 

Her office, nestled within the quiet cobblestone streets of Edinburgh's historic district, felt more like a sanctuary than a workspace. Every inch was adorned with bookshelves crammed with the weighty tomes of psychological theory and vintage clocks chiming out forgotten melodies. Amelia preferred it this way - a comforting chaos that allowed her mind to wander into the depths of human experience. But even she could feel the weight of anticipation settling on her like a fog as she opened the door, a shiver running down her spine.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and unspoken stories.
