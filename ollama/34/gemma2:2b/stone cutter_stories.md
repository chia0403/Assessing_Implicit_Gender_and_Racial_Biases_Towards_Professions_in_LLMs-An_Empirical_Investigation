The wind whipped across the face of Mount Solara as Elora Stonehand gripped her chisel, her knuckles white against the rough-hewn wood. The jagged peaks mirrored the storm brewing in her chest – she was on the verge of losing everything. A single drop of sweat rolled down her cheek, leaving a trail in the dust that clung to her weathered face. It was as unforgiving as the mountain itself, this place where dreams cracked and ambitions crumbled like the ancient basalt cliffs. 

Elora had spent years carving these very stones, each one imbued with stories whispered by the wind: tales of forgotten gods and brave warriors lost in time's embrace. But lately, she’d been sculpting not just stone but despair – a gnawing emptiness that threatened to engulf her entire world. The workshop, once a beacon of light and craft, had fallen into darkness, its warmth replaced by the bitter chill of losing faith. Her last commission, the ambitious monument for the newly elected King, had been rejected after months of painstaking work. His words, harsh and devoid of any genuine appreciation, stung like winter's first frost. Now, her supplies dwindled, the silence louder than the mountain wind as she looked out at the vast expanse of nothingness.
