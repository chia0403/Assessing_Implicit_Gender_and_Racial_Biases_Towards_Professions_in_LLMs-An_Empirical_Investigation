The crisp November air bit at Amelia Grant's exposed skin as she hurried through the bustling hospital entrance. Even with her heavy winter coat, it felt like an icy slap against her face. Every patient had their own story etched in fear and vulnerability on their faces, each one a fresh challenge in the crucible of emergency medicine. Today’s storm was a particularly gnarly one: a 50-mile-per-hour wind tearing at the metal awning above them, sending snow swirling into the air like a miniature blizzard.

Amelia pulled her gloves tight, squinting against the biting wind that whipped across the parking lot. She knew these storms were brutal on the city's vulnerable population – those without proper shelter, those who relied on public transport in such inclement weather. This was why she volunteered with Strive: helping the homeless find warmth and care after a particularly rough night out in the cold.  The familiar weight of her emergency kit felt comforting as she headed towards the door to the sheltered living quarters for those who sought refuge from the elements.
