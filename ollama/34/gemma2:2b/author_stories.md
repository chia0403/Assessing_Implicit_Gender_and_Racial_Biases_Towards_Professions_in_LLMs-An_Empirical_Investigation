Rain hammered against the cracked windowpane of Amelia Thorne’s study, each drop echoing like tiny gunshot cracks on the warped wood. Outside, London was drowning in an urban torrent; the cobbled streets were slick rivers, and gas lamps struggled to pierce the swirling greyness.  

Amelia Thorne, author of the beloved Gothic fantasy series "The Shadow Crown," hunched over her desk, her fingers flying across the keyboard like a frantic hummingbird amidst a storm. Each word she penned was fueled by the tempest outside; each sentence spun from the raw power of a city drowning in its own misery. 

She wasn't writing about the London flood this time. This was for "The Unwritten," a collection of untold stories, whispered secrets left behind by long-dead authors, all destined to become forgotten footnotes until she breathed life into them.  Her muse tonight, however, felt particularly dark and brooding - a swirling black pool mirroring the city's relentless downpour. 
 
Amelia rubbed her eyes, squinting at the screen as it flickered to life, the last line of her story still glowing, a crimson ember against the grey backdrop. A whisper brushed past her ear, "You are lost in your work, Amelia."

The voice was barely audible, yet chillingly clear. The room grew colder and darker, as if the shadows themselves were holding their breath waiting for her next move.
