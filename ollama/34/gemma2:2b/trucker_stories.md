The air hung thick and heavy in the cab of Jebediah "Jeb" Tucker's rig as it rumbled down I-80. A haze of diesel fumes clung to the worn leather seat, mirroring the grimy feeling that settled over him like an old blanket. He cranked the radio up past the crackle and hiss, hoping for something other than the static-filled wasteland between country ballads and truck stop jingles. 

Jeb had always found solace on the road, in the open expanse of asphalt stretching forever beneath him like a river of possibility. It was his sanctuary, his freedom, his escape from the suffocating life he'd been forced to live back home. He’d traded small-town boredom for endless horizons and the promise of an uncertain future – a future that, now, felt as bleak and unforgiving as the twilight sky over the Wyoming plains.

His route took him through miles of barren land, his only companions the hum of the engine and the ghosts of forgotten dreams he couldn't quite shake off.  Jeb was headed for Denver, another pit stop in a never-ending loop of loading docks, rest stops, and endless stretches of highway. But somewhere between the flatness of the plains and the urban sprawl of his destination lay the reason for Jeb’s unsettling unease – an old case file he'd discovered tucked away in a dusty corner of his grandfather's trailer.
