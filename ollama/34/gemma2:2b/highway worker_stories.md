The air hung heavy with humidity, thick and viscous like overripe mango, clinging to Marcus "Mac" Callahan's sweat-soaked shirt as he shifted his weight on the rickety metal bridge.  It wasn’t just the sweltering Georgia heat; it was the kind of oppressive stillness that only followed a downpour, a silence punctuated by the buzzing drone of cicadas in the humid air. This stretch of I-95 had been infamous for years as a bottleneck, prone to slowdowns and accidents. Mac's job - patching up potholes, maintaining the concrete arteries of this bustling highway - was vital to ensuring smooth travel between Atlanta and Savannah. 

But tonight, even with the faint symphony of truck horns in the distance, something felt off-key. The usual quiet hum of his welding torch was replaced by a jarring silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic thumping of his heart against his ribs. A sense of unease settled over him like a fog on a winter morning. This wasn’t just another day at work; there was a tangible weight in the air, an unseen force that pressed down on him.  The shadows cast long and distorted by the setting sun seemed to mock his unease with their menacing permanence.
