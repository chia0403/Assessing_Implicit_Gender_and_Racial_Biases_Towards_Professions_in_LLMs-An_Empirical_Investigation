Rain hammered against the window of "Tax Haven" like tiny fists pounding on glass. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Peterson hunched over a mountain of tax forms, her brow furrowed in concentration. It was January, and the storm outside mirrored the chaos in her office.  She sighed, pushing a stray strand of blonde hair out of her tired eyes. Another year, another battle against Uncle Sam's ever-increasing demands. 

Amy had been doing taxes for ten years now, starting as a junior clerk at a local firm before branching out on her own. Her small but cozy office was a haven for the stressed and bewildered.  It was filled with stacks of paperwork, tax forms, calculators, and a surprisingly large collection of coffee mugs that served as silent reminders of long nights spent in front of flickering computer screens.

The year had started off rough – unexpected layoffs at her regular client's firm and the sudden death of an elderly relative left the filing room overflowing.  Amy wasn’t just dealing with the financial woes of her clients, she was fighting her own demons too.
