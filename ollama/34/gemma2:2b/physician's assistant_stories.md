She took a deep breath, letting the spray of the crashing waves wash over her face. 

Amelia Pierce, PA-C, had spent her life navigating the delicate balance between human vulnerability and the unforgiving demands of medicine.

This coastal town was a far cry from the bustling metropolis where she’d trained, yet it held a strange kind of peace, a quiet hum that resonated deep within her soul.  Today, however, even the familiar beauty of the crashing waves felt heavy with anxiety. A new case had landed on her desk - a missing child, whispered rumours of a sinister cult, and a family clinging desperately to hope.

As Amelia glanced at the worn photo in her pocket, showing a young girl with bright eyes and a mischievous grin, she knew this was no ordinary mystery. The weight of the unknown pressed down, blurring the edges of reality into a dizzying haze of possibility.  It was time to step beyond the precipice and plunge headfirst into the sea of uncertainty.
