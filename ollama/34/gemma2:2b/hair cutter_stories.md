The air hung thick with the scent of citrus and despair in "Cut Above" barbershop, a haven for men seeking to escape the harsh realities outside its weathered oak door. It was a place where time seemed to stretch, each client's story unfolding in languid silence as Elias Blackwood, owner and sole operator, worked his magic through clippers and shears. 

Elias, known by patrons simply as "El," had seen it all during the years he'd spent honing his craft.  He’d cut a shy first-time father's son into a crew cut fit for his first school play, comforted a grieving widower with a meticulous trim that somehow managed to evoke comfort and order in the chaos of life, and even fashioned a last defiant mane for a young man facing an uncertain future as he navigated the turbulent waters of a new city. 

He was more than just a barber; El was an artist crafting destinies, a confidante weaving tales of hope and resilience through every stroke of his scissors.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of quiet whispers had been replaced by a discordant hum – the low hum of a storm brewing outside, echoing in Elias's soul as he watched a man pacing in front of him, his face etched with worry.
