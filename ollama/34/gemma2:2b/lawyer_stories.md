Rain lashed against the windowpane of Amelia "Amy" Finch's office in Manhattan, blurring the glittering skyline into an impressionist smear.  The air hung thick with the weight of impending doom and a lingering scent of stale coffee, a familiar combination for Amy. Her sleek mahogany desk, normally adorned with pristine files, was now cluttered with scattered legal briefs and hastily scribbled notes.  She stared at the latest client roster spread across her desk, each face a stark reminder of the high-stakes game she played every day: "The Lost Children of Gotham," their motley crew of forgotten orphans fighting for justice in a city that seemed determined to sweep them under its rug. 

Tonight was particularly harrowing.  She had been tasked with representing a young boy named Lucas, who claimed his parents were kidnapped by shadowy figures during a routine police raid on an illegal orphanage. Amy could feel the weight of responsibility pressing down on her chest like a physical burden. This wasn't just another case; it feltâ€¦ personal. Her own childhood was steeped in similar tales of abandoned children and forgotten promises. The scars from those years ran deep, but tonight they fueled a fierce determination to fight for Lucas, even if it meant risking everything she held dear.
