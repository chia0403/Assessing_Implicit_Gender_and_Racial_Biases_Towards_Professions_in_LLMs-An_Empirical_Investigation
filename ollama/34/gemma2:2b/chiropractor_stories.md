## The Chiro's Lament

**Setting:** The quaint seaside town of Havenwood, Maine, nestled between craggy cliffs and an expansive, blue harbor. 

The salty air carried whispers of incoming storms, mixing with the lingering aroma of freshly caught lobster that clung to the cobblestone streets.  Dr. Ethan Carter’s office sat tucked away on a quiet lane, its windows painted in cheery hues of yellow and green. Inside, the space hummed with the gentle chirp of a clock and the reassuring creak of old wooden floorboards. The walls displayed a kaleidoscope of framed seagulls, each one more distressed than the last - Ethan's personal collection, his therapy for an ongoing existential crisis of sorts. 

Ethan stared out at the ocean, a familiar knot of dread tightening in his chest. A week had passed since the announcement: “The Havenwood Health Clinic will be closing.”  He couldn’t remember when he'd felt such crippling despair. Just as his office was starting to feel like home – each creak and groan whispered secrets of forgotten memories and long-held dreams - it seemed everything was collapsing around him.

His phone buzzed, interrupting the storm brewing inside. It was a call from his assistant, Amelia.  "Ethan, there's been an emergency at the waterfront." 

He sighed, his spirit already sinking deeper into the worn cushions of his office chair. Another day, another wave crashing against the shore.
