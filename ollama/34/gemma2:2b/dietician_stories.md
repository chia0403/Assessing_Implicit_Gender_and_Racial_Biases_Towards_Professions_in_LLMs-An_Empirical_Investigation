The sun bled orange across the horizon, painting the cityscape in hues of fire and shadow as Amelia "Amy" Vance turned her back on the last sliver of daylight. The bustling streets of New Orleans, usually a vibrant melody of jazz and street vendors, were cloaked in an early evening hush, punctuated only by the rhythmic thrum of the city's heartbeat - the ambulance siren that screamed past like a banshee every other minute.  This was her world now: the sterile white walls of St. Antoine Hospital's Nutrition Department, the smell of disinfectant and the echoes of frustrated sighs.  

Amy Vance, M.D., hadn't chosen this life; it had chosen her after a tragedy ripped through her family, leaving her with an unshakable sense of purpose - to fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves, to bring order to the chaos within their bodies and minds. It wasn't easy, though. Not when every day brought new challenges, patients suffering from the ravages of addiction, the guilt eating away at her own soul, a constant reminder of what she had lost and what she wouldn't be able to save.  But Amy Vance was determined, driven by an inner fire that refused to be extinguished by grief or despair. 

Tonight, though, even her resolve seemed to falter under the weight of another patient's tale:  a young man, barely out of his teens, battling the insidious grip of Crohn's disease. His world was crumbling around him, and Amy knew she held the only thread left in his tattered life.
