Rain lashed against the windows of Penelope Ainsworth's studio apartment, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  She stared at the mood board for Mrs. Van Derlyn's living room, a riot of clashing colors and textures that made her stomach churn. Turquoise walls? Zebra print cushions? It was an interior design nightmare waiting to happen.

Penelope loved her job - transforming bland spaces into havens of beauty and functionality. But sometimes, clients came with pre-conceived notions that were...challenging, to say the least. Mrs. Van Derlyn, with her penchant for all things ostentatious and her insistence on incorporating her late husband's collection of taxidermied exotic birds, was proving to be one such client.


Penelope sighed, running a hand through her auburn curls that always seemed to defy gravity.  The city lights blurred through the rain-streaked windows of her high-rise apartment overlooking Central Park, a testament to both the beauty and chaos she navigated daily. The phone on her desk buzzed, interrupting her thoughts. It was Mrs. Van Derlyn, ready for their next design meeting. Penelope took a deep breath, steeling herself for the whirlwind that was about to descend upon her.

"Hello, Mrs. Van Derlyn," Penelope said, forcing a cheerful tone. "I'm so glad you called."

Little did she know this meeting would set off a chain of events that would challenge everything she thought she knew about design, desire, and the secrets hidden within the walls of opulent Manhattan homes.
