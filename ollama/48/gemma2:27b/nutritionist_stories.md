Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive", blurring the vibrant mural of overflowing fruit baskets and leaping salmon that adorned the storefront. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging up the glass partition separating her consultation room from the waiting area. She glanced at the clock: 4:57 pm. Five minutes until closing, and no sign of Mr. Henderson, her final appointment of the day.

Amelia ran a hand through her auburn curls, frustration battling with fatigue. It had been a long week filled with picky eaters, fad diet fanatics, and clients who swore their "gluten intolerance" was a figment of Big Pharma's imagination. She longed for the days when nutrition felt like a calling, not a constant uphill battle against misinformation and ingrained habits.

Just as she contemplated packing up early, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a late arrival. A tall, gaunt figure shuffled in, his face hidden beneath the brim of a worn fedora. He clutched a crumpled paper bag in one hand, its contents emitting a faint, greasy odor. This had to be Mr. Henderson, she thought, steeling herself for another potentially challenging session.

The man approached hesitantly, casting furtive glances around the room before settling into the chair opposite Amelia's desk. The fluorescent lights glinted off a pair of watery blue eyes framed by deep wrinkles. "Ms. Hawthorne?" his voice rasped, barely audible above the relentless drumming of rain against the window. 

Amelia offered him a gentle smile, hoping to put him at ease. "That's right, Mr. Henderson. Please, call me Amelia."
