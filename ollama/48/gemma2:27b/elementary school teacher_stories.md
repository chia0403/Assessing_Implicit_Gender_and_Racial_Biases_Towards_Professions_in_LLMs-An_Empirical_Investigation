The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom, casting long shadows across the mismatched desks and stacks of hastily graded papers. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree outside, its branches scraping against the windowpanes like eager fingers begging for entry. The air was thick with the scent of chalk dust and crayon wax, a familiar aroma that Eleanor had come to associate with both comfort and exhaustion.

She sighed, rubbing her tired eyes as she surveyed the chaotic aftermath of her third-grade class's art project. Glitter sparkled ominously on every surface, paint smeared vibrant streaks across the floor, and half-finished papier-mâché volcanoes threatened to erupt at any moment. The cacophony of laughter and excited chatter had faded, replaced by an unsettling quiet that prickled Eleanor's skin. 

Something wasn't right.
