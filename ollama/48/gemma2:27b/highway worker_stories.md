The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with a dented orange cone, trying to wedge it upright into the scorching asphalt. The endless ribbon of Highway 66 stretched out before him, shimmering in the heat haze.

Silas squinted at the horizon. Nothing but scrub brush and an occasional tumbleweed dared break the monotony. He'd been working this stretch for months now, patching potholes and replacing signage – a solitary existence punctuated only by the roar of passing trucks and the chirping of unseen desert birds. 


Today, however, felt different. A tension hummed in the air, a prickle on Silas's skin he couldn't quite explain. Maybe it was the way the wind whipped around him, carrying whispers of something unknown. Or perhaps it was the unsettling glint he’d spotted earlier – a flash of sunlight reflecting off something metallic deep in the brush just beyond the shoulder. Whatever it was, Silas couldn't shake the feeling that today wouldn't be like any other day on Highway 66.
