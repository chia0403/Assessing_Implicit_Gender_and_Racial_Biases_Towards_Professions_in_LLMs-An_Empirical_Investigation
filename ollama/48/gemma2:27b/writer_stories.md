The late afternoon sun, slanting through the dusty attic window, illuminated motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering stars. Elara Blackwood, hunched over her battered typewriter, grimaced at the page before her.  Words, once flowing effortlessly from her pen (or rather, fingers) now felt leaden and lifeless. The rhythmic clatter of the keys seemed to mock her writer's block, echoing through the cavernous space that smelled faintly of mothballs and forgotten dreams. 

This attic, a haven tucked away in her grandmother's rambling Victorian house on the windswept Cornish coast, had always been Elara's sanctuary. But today, inspiration felt as elusive as the seagulls circling high above the cliffs outside.
