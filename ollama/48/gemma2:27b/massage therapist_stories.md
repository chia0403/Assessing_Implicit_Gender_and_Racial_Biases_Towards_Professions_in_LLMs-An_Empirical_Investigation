The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a soothing counterpoint to the incessant drizzle outside. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Serenity Now," Penelope Hawthorne's cozy massage studio tucked away on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina. 

Penelope, with her warm hazel eyes and hands that could knead tension out of granite, was setting up for her next client. The gentle clinking of glass as she refilled the diffuser with essential oil blended with the soft melody playing from her Bluetooth speaker – a calming instrumental piece she'd discovered on a recent hike in the Blue Ridge Mountains. 

She glanced at the clock: 3:55 pm. Her appointment was for 4:00, and Penelope prided herself on punctuality. Just as she finished arranging the fluffy towels on the massage table, the doorbell chimed, announcing the arrival of her client – a man named Arthur Finch, who Penelope had never seen before.  

A sudden shiver ran down Penelope's spine. The rain wasn't just drumming against the window; it felt like something else entirely was tapping at the glass, something urgent, something… unsettling.
