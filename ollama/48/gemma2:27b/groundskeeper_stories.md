The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Thaddeus Bartholomew "Tad" Higgins surveyed his domain. Emerald green lawns stretched before him, meticulously striped and trimmed to perfection.  Towering oaks cast dappled shadows on vibrant flower beds bursting with color: crimson roses, sunshine yellow daffodils, and deep indigo irises. This was Whispering Pines Estate, a grand old manor nestled amongst rolling hills in the heart of Vermont. Tad, its solitary groundskeeper for the past thirty years, knew every inch of its sprawling gardens like the back of his calloused hand.  Today, however, something felt different. A subtle unease prickled at his skin, amplified by the distant rumble of thunder. It wasn't just the storm approaching; a sense of hidden tension lingered in the air, an unspoken secret whispering among the leaves.
