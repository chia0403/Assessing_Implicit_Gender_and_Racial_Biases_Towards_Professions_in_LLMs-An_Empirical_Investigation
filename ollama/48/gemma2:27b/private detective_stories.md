Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the Lucky Clover Diner across the street. The incessant drumming echoed Teddy's growing headache, a dull ache throbbing behind his eyes like a disgruntled tenant refusing to pay rent. His desk was a chaotic tableau: overflowing ashtrays, crumpled case files threatening to spill onto the worn linoleum floor, and an empty bottle of whiskey mocking him with its vacant grin. 

He swirled the lukewarm dregs in his coffee mug, the bitter liquid doing little to quell the storm brewing inside him. He hadn't taken a proper case in weeks, the last one ending in a fistfight and a bruised ego rather than a fat paycheck. His phone, usually buzzing with desperate housewives and cheating husbands, lay silent, mocking his dwindling fortunes.

Just then, a sharp rap on the door sliced through the oppressive silence. Teddy straightened in his chair, pushing aside a stack of dusty books that threatened to topple over. He knew better than to hope for good news. In this part of town, hope was a luxury few could afford.
