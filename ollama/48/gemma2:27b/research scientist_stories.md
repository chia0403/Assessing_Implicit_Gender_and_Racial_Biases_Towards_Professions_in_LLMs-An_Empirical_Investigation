The acrid smell of ozone clung to Elara Vance's lab coat like a persistent shadow. Outside the panoramic window of her bioengineering lab, the Alaskan aurora borealis blazed, emerald and amethyst ribbons dancing across the night sky. It was a breathtaking sight, one that usually calmed Elara’s restless mind. But tonight, her gaze remained fixed on the glowing petri dish in front of her, its contents shimmering with an unnatural luminescence.

Inside, a colony of genetically modified algae pulsed rhythmically, absorbing light at an unprecedented rate. This was Elara's life's work: harnessing the power of photosynthesis to create a sustainable biofuel capable of powering entire cities. Years of grueling research, countless setbacks, and sleepless nights had culminated in this moment.

But something felt off. The algae’s glow seemed brighter than usual, almost feverish. A prickle of unease ran down Elara’s spine. Was it simply exhaustion playing tricks on her, or was there something more sinister at play?
