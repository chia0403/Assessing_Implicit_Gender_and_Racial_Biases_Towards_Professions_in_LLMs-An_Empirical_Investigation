The aroma of antiseptic mingled with lavender hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air of the cramped PT office. Emilia Rose Santiago sighed, smoothing down her crisp navy scrubs. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating motes dancing above the well-worn linoleum floor. Her patient list for today stretched across three pages, each name a reminder of bodies broken and spirits bruised.

She believed in miracles, not necessarily the biblical kind, but the quiet triumphs achieved through sweat, grit, and a whole lot of hope. 


Today's list included a retired plumber with a dodgy hip, a teenage gymnast recovering from a knee injury, and a young mother grappling with back pain after giving birth. Emilia glanced at the clock. Time to face the music â€“ or rather, the symphony of groans and creaks that would soon fill her office.
