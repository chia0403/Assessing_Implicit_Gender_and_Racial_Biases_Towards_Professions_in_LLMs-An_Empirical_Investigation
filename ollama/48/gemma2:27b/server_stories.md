The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation. Eloise "Ellie" Montgomery weaved through tables laden with half-eaten plates and sticky remnants of forgotten happy hour cocktails. Her smile, though practiced and wide, couldn't quite mask the exhaustion etched into her features. The neon sign outside "The Rusty Spigot" flickered erratically, mirroring Ellie's own flickering hope for a decent tip tonight. 

It was Tuesday, which meant half-price burgers and a steady stream of regulars who knew her order better than she did.  Still, Tuesdays were notorious for bringing out the worst in people - the ones who grumbled about extra pickles, complained about lukewarm beer, and expected her to solve all their life's problems over a plate of greasy fries. Tonight was shaping up to be no different. Ellie braced herself for another onslaught of disgruntled patrons and the endless cycle of refills and apologies that came with serving them.
