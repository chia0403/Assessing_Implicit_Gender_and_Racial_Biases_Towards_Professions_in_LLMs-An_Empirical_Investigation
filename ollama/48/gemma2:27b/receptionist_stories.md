The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Blackwood Hotel cast long, sickly shadows across Beatrice Evelyn Cartwright's meticulously organized desk. Rain lashed against the grand arched windows overlooking the cobblestone courtyard, blurring the ornate fountain into an impressionistic swirl of grey and white.  Beatrice, her silver hair pinned in a tight bun and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, tapped a crimson nail impatiently against the polished mahogany surface. The phone hadn't rung all morning, leaving Beatrice to stew in the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clatter of rain and the distant rumble of thunder. It was supposed to be a busy weekend – the Blackwood's annual Masquerade Ball was tonight – yet here she sat, a solitary sentinel amidst the echoing grandeur of the hotel lobby.  Beatrice sighed, her gaze drifting towards the grand staircase leading to the opulent ballroom above. A shiver ran down her spine, not from the chill of the autumn air, but from an unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right.
