The incessant wail of sirens pierced through the thin walls of Beatrice "Bea" Eldridge's cramped apartment, a grim soundtrack to her already sleepless night. Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the bodega sign across the street. Bea sat at her kitchen table, the cheap laminate sticky beneath her palms, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. The flickering fluorescent light above cast harsh shadows on the cluttered surface – a stack of unpaid bills, yesterday's crumpled scrubs, and a dog-eared copy of "Pride and Prejudice." 

Bea was exhausted. Sixteen hours straight at Mercy Hospital had left her physically drained and emotionally raw. The ER that night had been a maelstrom of car accidents, drug overdoses, and domestic violence victims. Each case, a story etched with pain, desperation, and sometimes, fleeting hope. Tonight, though, the memories clung to her like cobwebs, refusing to be swept away by sleep. 

She glanced at her phone – 3:17 am. Another night shift loomed tomorrow, promising more of the same. But Bea wouldn't trade it for anything. Beneath the fatigue and cynicism lay a deep-seated compassion, a fierce desire to alleviate suffering, even if it meant sacrificing her own well-being.  

Suddenly, the phone on the counter buzzed, shattering the silence. It was an unknown number. Hesitantly, Bea picked up.
