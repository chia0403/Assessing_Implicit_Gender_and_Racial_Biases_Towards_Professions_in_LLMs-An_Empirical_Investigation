Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon sign across the street that proclaimed "Lucky's Liquor - Open 'Til Dawn." Eleanor Finch sighed, the sound barely audible over the relentless drumming of water. The clock on the wall ticked with agonizing slowness, each second a hammer blow to her already fraying nerves. Five minutes until closing time. Five minutes until she could escape this stuffy office and its pungent aroma of stale cigarettes and despair.

Eleanor sat perched at her worn typewriter, the keys slick beneath her fingertips. Stacks of unsorted mail towered precariously on her desk, a testament to Mr. Blackwood's utter disorganization. He was a private investigator, though "private" seemed an ironic descriptor for a man whose business dealings were as shrouded in mystery as the fog that often rolled in off the bay.

Eleanor longed for something more. Something beyond deciphering cryptic notes and fielding calls from dubious characters with voices thick with menace. She dreamed of adventure, of escaping the dreary confines of this office for sun-drenched beaches or bustling city streets. But for now, she was tethered to her typewriter, a captive audience to the secrets whispered within these four walls.
