The pre-dawn air in Montmartre was still crisp with the remnants of night, but within the cozy confines of "Le Pain Doré," Eleanor Dubois was already hard at work. Flour dusted her apron like fresh snow, and the yeasty scent of rising dough filled the cramped bakery kitchen, mingling with the sweet aroma of caramelized sugar from yesterday's batch of pain au chocolat. Outside, the cobblestone streets were deserted except for a stray cat weaving between overflowing garbage bins. Eleanor hummed a cheerful tune as she kneaded, her strong arms working rhythmically, shaping the dough into perfect loaves.  The rhythmic thump-thump of her knuckles against the wooden table was a familiar lullaby in this quiet corner of Paris. Today was Bastille Day, and Eleanor had promised herself to bake something special – a towering croquembouche, shimmering with spun sugar, to celebrate France's freedom and her own newfound independence.
