The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of another customer into the chaos that was "Curl Up & Dye." Eloise Marie Beaumont, proprietor and sole stylist, glanced up from her current masterpiece – a bouffant so high it seemed to defy gravity – and smiled, her amethyst-colored lipstick flashing. 

The salon itself was a riot of color and texture: leopard print armchairs jostled for space with neon pink walls, while vintage hairdryers stood sentinel amongst stacks of fashion magazines. A faint scent of lavender hairspray hung in the air, battling valiantly against the underlying aroma of burnt toast (Eloise's breakfast had taken a disastrous turn this morning).

The newcomer hesitated at the threshold, a young woman with nervous eyes and hair that looked like it hadn't seen a brush since the dawn of time. Eloise knew instantly she had a challenge on her hands, but one she was eager to embrace. After all, transforming frazzled tresses into works of art was what she lived for.
