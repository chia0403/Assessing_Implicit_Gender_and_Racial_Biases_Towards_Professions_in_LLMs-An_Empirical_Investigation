The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's head like an anxious swarm of bees.  Her nametag, slightly askew thanks to a rogue shopping cart collision earlier that morning, declared her "Ev," which she secretly loathed. Ev felt about as graceful and energetic as a wilted lettuce leaf on this Tuesday afternoon shift at the Piggly Wiggly. The scent of stale coffee and overripe bananas hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional shriek of a fussy child. 

A line snaked its way towards her register, a motley crew of exhausted-looking shoppers clutching coupons and bags overflowing with discounted groceries.  Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Just another day in paradise, she thought wryly.  

But then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a newcomer. Evelyn straightened up, plastering on her best customer service smile. The figure who stepped inside was unlike any other shopper she'd seen before. Tall and cloaked in shadows, he seemed to absorb the fluorescent light rather than reflect it. His face was obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, but Evelyn could sense a pair of piercing eyes studying her from beneath its rim.
