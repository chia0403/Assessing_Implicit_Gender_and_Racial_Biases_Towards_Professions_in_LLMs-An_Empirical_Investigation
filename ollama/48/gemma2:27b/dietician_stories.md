Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Eleanor Ainsworth's quaint little office, nestled above Mrs. Peabody's antique shop on Elm Street. The scent of old paper and beeswax polish drifted up from below, mingling with the aroma of chamomile tea brewing in Eleanor's mug. Outside, the world was a symphony of grey, but inside, her space was a haven of warmth: sunshine yellow walls adorned with botanical prints, a plush armchair draped in a hand-stitched quilt, and a wooden table piled high with nutritional charts and colorful recipe cards.

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, tapped a pen against her lips, her hazel eyes focused on the patient file before her. A sigh escaped her, a mixture of frustration and concern. This wasn't going to be easy.
