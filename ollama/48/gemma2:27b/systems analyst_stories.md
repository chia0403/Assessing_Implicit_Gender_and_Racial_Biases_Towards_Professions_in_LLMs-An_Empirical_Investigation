Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Cartwright's cramped apartment, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. Lines of code scrolled across her monitor, each one a tiny testament to the impending disaster.

Amelia, a systems analyst for Zenith Corporation, was staring down the barrel of a catastrophic system failure. The company's entire online platform – from e-commerce to customer service – relied on her intricate network of algorithms. And right now, those algorithms were spitting out error messages faster than she could decipher them. 

The deadline loomed: midnight. If Amelia didn't find the source of the glitch and fix it before then, millions of transactions would be lost, leaving Zenith Corporation vulnerable to lawsuits and financial ruin. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, a symphony of clicks and clacks echoing in the dimly lit room, but the solution remained frustratingly out of reach.
