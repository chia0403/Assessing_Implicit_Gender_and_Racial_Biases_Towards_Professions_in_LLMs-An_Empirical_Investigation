The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, battling for dominance with the chemical tang of hair dye. Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez expertly maneuvered her comb through Mrs. Henderson's thick silver curls, humming along to the 80s pop song crackling from the salon speakers. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting Esme's workspace in a warm glow. Her little salon, "Esmeralda's Elixir," was tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Savannah, its floral-painted facade a beacon of beauty amidst the cobblestone alleys and wrought iron balconies. 

Today, however, something felt off. A prickle of unease danced along Esme's spine as she caught sight of a man standing across the street, staring intently through the window. His face was obscured by the shadow of a fedora, but his piercing gaze made Esme instinctively pull Mrs. Henderson's chair closer to her own station.
