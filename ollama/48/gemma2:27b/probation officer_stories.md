The flickering fluorescent lights of the cramped office did little to dispel the stale smell of despair that permeated the air. Penelope "Penny" Albright sighed, pushing away a stack of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the concrete jungle of Newark, turning the city into a shimmering mirage.

She believed in rehabilitation, truly she did, but lately, it felt like she was bailing water from a sinking ship. Today's case file sat open before her â€“ Miguel Diaz, 24, convicted of petty theft and possession. His face, young and weary, stared back at her from the grainy mugshot. He had already violated his probation once, raising a familiar knot of apprehension in Penny's gut.  

A knock on the door jolted her back to reality. "Come in," she called out, steeling herself for whatever awaited.
