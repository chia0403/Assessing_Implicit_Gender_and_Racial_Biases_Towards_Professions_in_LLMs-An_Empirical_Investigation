The insistent chirping of cicadas punctuated the humid air, heavy and thick like molasses poured over the cobblestone streets of Vieux Carré. Antoine Marcel Thibodeaux leaned back against his worn leather barber chair, the scent of bay rum and talcum powder battling for dominance with the sweet decay of jasmine wafting in from a nearby courtyard. 

His shop, "Antoine's Sharp Edge," was tucked away on a side street, its faded green awning barely visible beneath the Spanish moss draped over the ancient oak tree. Despite the lackluster façade, Antoine prided himself on his craft. His hands, calloused and strong, could coax curls into submission, sculpt beards into masterpieces, and wield a straight razor with surgical precision. Today, however, business was slow. The tourists, usually drawn to the allure of a traditional shave in New Orleans' oldest quarter, were scarce due to a lingering summer storm that threatened to unleash its fury any minute.

As Antoine idly twirled a lock of his own salt-and-pepper hair, a figure emerged from the downpour, seeking refuge beneath his awning. A woman, cloaked in shadows and carrying a worn leather satchel, her eyes fixed on the flickering neon sign above the door: "Open."
