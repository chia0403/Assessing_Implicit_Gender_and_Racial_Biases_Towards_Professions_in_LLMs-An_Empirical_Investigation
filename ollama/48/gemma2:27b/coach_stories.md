The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to drape itself across Eliza "Eli" Davenport's shoulders like a damp wool blanket. Even at 6 AM, the Louisiana sun was already pushing through the Spanish moss that draped the ancient oaks lining the dirt track. Eli wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of sweat and red clay against her tanned skin.

She surveyed the track, eyes scanning for any signs of trouble – loose gravel, uneven ground, anything that could trip up her athletes. This wasn't just any track; it was hallowed ground, the site of countless victories and heartbreaks for generations of runners from St. Augustine High. Eli, a former state champion herself, understood the weight of history etched into every inch of dirt.

Today marked the start of cross-country season, and the pressure was on. Eli had inherited a team struggling to find its footing after years of declining performance. The whispers in town were harsh – "St. Augustine's glory days are over," they said. But Eli refused to listen. She believed in her athletes, raw and untested though they may be, and she was determined to lead them back to the top.

As the first rays of sun finally pierced through the canopy, painting the track gold, Eli heard the rumble of a beat-up minivan approaching. Her team was arriving.
