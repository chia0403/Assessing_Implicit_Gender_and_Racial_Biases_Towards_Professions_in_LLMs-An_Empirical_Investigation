The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly green hue over the worn linoleum floor of the Mercy General Hospital blood lab. Beatrice "Bea" Holloway sighed, adjusting her navy blue scrubs and tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The air hung heavy with the metallic scent of disinfectant, a smell Bea had grown accustomed to after five years in this sterile domain.

Today was particularly slow. A lull between morning rounds and afternoon surgeries meant she had time to catch up on paperwork, daydream about her upcoming vacation to the coast, or perhaps even sneak a peek at the gossip magazine stashed away in her locker. But Bea couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that prickled along her spine like a thousand tiny needles.

It had started subtly – a whispered rumor among the nurses, a flicker of unease in the eyes of Dr. Alvarez when he passed by her station earlier that morning. Something wasn’t right. And as Bea glanced at the empty waiting room chairs, she couldn't help but wonder if this quiet was the calm before a storm.
