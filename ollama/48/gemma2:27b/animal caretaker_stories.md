Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cavernous space.  Elara Finch, her face illuminated by the single flickering bulb above, shivered despite the layers of woolen clothing she wore. She knelt beside a shivering foal, its coat still wet and tangled from birth earlier that morning.

The old mare, Buttercup, had delivered without fuss, but the little colt was struggling to latch onto his mother's milk-laden teats. Elara murmured soothing words, her hands gentle as she helped the foal find its footing, guiding its tiny muzzle towards the warm milk. The pungent scent of hay and manure hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this haven for rescued animals nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.
