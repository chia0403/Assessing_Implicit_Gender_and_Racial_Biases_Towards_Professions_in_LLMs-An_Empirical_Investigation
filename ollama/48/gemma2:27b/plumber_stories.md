Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Gus "The Wrench" Worthington's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of solder and engine oil. Gus himself, a burly man with hands like weathered bricks and a perpetually grease-stained apron, squinted at a particularly stubborn pipe joint, his brow furrowed in concentration. The radio crackled on the workbench, spitting out static and snatches of news about a city-wide power outage. 

Gus scoffed. "Power outage," he muttered to himself, tightening his grip on the wrench. "More like they're scared of a little rain."  He wasn't afraid of anything. Not leaky faucets, not clogged drains, not even the occasional grumpy customer. Gus Worthington was a plumber, dammit, and he could fix anything. 


The sudden, insistent ringing of the phone jolted him from his thoughts. He wiped his hands on a rag and answered gruffly, "Worthington Plumbing. What's your leak?"

A nervous voice crackled through the receiver. "It's not a leak, exactly... It's more like..."  The voice trailed off into a strangled sob. Gus sighed, bracing himself for another one of those 'ghost in the pipes' calls.
