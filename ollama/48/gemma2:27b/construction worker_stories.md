The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias Santiago's broad back as he wrestled with a stubborn length of rebar. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy desert horizon. Dust devils danced across the skeletal frame of the half-built office complex, mocking him with their carefree movement. This wasn't the life Elias had envisioned for himself – he dreamt of designing buildings, not hauling steel and concrete. But after his father's accident left him the sole provider for his family, dreams took a backseat to reality.

Today, however, felt different. A strange energy thrummed beneath the surface of the usual construction site cacophony. It started subtly – a flicker in the periphery, a whispered voice on the wind. As Elias wrestled the rebar into place, he felt an undeniable pull towards the dusty lot bordering their project. The air shimmered there, distorted by heat and something else, something unseen but undeniably present. Curiosity warred with his ingrained caution. He knew better than to stray from the site, especially with the foreman breathing down everyone's neck. But that shimmering anomaly held him captive, whispering promises of something extraordinary.
