The midday sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah "Si" Blackwood's weathered neck as he wrestled another shingle into place. The old Victorian on Elm Street was groaning under the weight of years and neglect, its roof a patchwork quilt of fading asphalt and rusted tin. Si preferred older houses; they had stories to tell. He imagined families gathered in the parlor below, their laughter echoing through the rafters he was now repairing.

Si inhaled deeply, the scent of hot tar mingling with the sweet perfume of honeysuckle drifting from the overgrown garden. This was his sanctuary: high above the bustle of the world, surrounded by the rhythmic tapping of his hammer and the cries of gulls circling overhead. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he noticed a glint of something metallic wedged between the eaves.

He carefully maneuvered himself closer, heart thudding against his ribs. It was a small, silver locket, tarnished and dented but undeniably beautiful. Curiosity tugged at him. He gently pried it loose, brushing away years of dust and cobwebs. As he flipped open the locket, a faded photograph stared back at him â€“ a young woman with hauntingly familiar blue eyes and a wistful smile. Si's breath caught in his throat. He knew those eyes.

He had seen them reflected in his own mirror every morning for as long as he could remember.
