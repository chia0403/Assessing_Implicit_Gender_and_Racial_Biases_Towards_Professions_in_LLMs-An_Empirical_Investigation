The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Silas Blackwood hefted his axe, its familiar weight settling comfortably in his calloused hand. Dawn was just breaking through the towering redwoods, casting long shadows that danced across the forest floor. A thin mist clung to the ancient giants, shrouding them in an ethereal glow.

Silas squinted towards the crest of the ridge, where the faint outline of other loggers already moving amidst the trees signaled the start of another grueling day. His own patch lay nestled between two colossal redwoods, their trunks so massive they seemed to hold up the very sky. He took a deep breath, feeling the crisp air fill his lungs, and braced himself for the familiar rhythm of swing and chop that would echo through the forest all day long.
