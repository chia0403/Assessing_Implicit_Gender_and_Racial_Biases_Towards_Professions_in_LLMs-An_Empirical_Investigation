Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 747, blurring the city lights below into a shimmering, chaotic watercolor. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she adjusted the miniature champagne bottles in the galley. Turbulence rattled the plane like a toy in a giant's hand, sending nervous murmurs rippling through the cabin. Ellie smiled tightly, plastering on her practiced mask of calm assurance.

"Just a bit of weather," she announced over the intercom, her voice smooth and reassuring despite the knot tightening in her stomach. "We'll be cruising smoothly soon."

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced on the back of her neck, a strange premonition that this routine flight wouldn't end like the others.
