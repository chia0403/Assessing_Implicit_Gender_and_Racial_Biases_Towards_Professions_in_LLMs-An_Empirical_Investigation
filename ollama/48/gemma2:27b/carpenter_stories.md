The scent of sawdust and beeswax clung to Thaddeus Blackwood like a second skin. It permeated his calloused fingers, his thick brown beard, even the folds of his worn leather apron. The midday sun streamed through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Outside, the bustling port town of Saltwind hummed with activity – fishermen unloading their catch, merchants hawking their wares, children chasing seagulls along the cobblestone streets. But inside Thaddeus's sanctuary, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic rasp of his plane against wood and the steady tap-tap-tap of his hammer. Today, he was crafting a cradle for the blacksmith's newborn daughter – a delicate piece of cherrywood with hand-carved seashells adorning its sides. 

Thaddeus paused, tilting his head to inspect his work. A frown creased his brow. The curve of one shell seemed off, the delicate lines not quite flowing as they should. He set down his tools and stepped back, letting his gaze wander over the workshop. Everywhere he looked, there were reminders of past projects: a sturdy oak table destined for the tavern, a finely-detailed ship's wheel still awaiting its varnish, even a whimsical wooden bird perched on a shelf, its wings spread in perpetual flight. Each piece held a story, a testament to Thaddeus's skill and dedication. But today, a sense of unease gnawed at him. It wasn't just the imperfect seashell; something felt amiss in the air, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of his life.
