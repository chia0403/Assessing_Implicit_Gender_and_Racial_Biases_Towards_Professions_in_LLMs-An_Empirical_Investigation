The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic purple glow onto Jasper Thorne's weary face as he wiped down the mahogany bar for the hundredth time that night.  Smoke hung heavy in the air, a greasy veil tinged with the bittersweet aroma of cheap whiskey and forgotten dreams. The Rusty Trumpet wasn’t exactly a beacon of hope in this corner of the city – more like a den where shadows gathered and secrets whispered on the breath of stale beer. 

Jasper knew every creak of the floorboards, every stain on the cracked leather booths, every nuance of his regulars' orders. He was a master bartender, not because he mixed fancy cocktails or had an encyclopedic knowledge of spirits (though he did), but because he listened. He saw through the facades people wore like ill-fitting coats, offering a sympathetic ear and a stiff drink in equal measure. Tonight, though, even the familiar rhythms of The Rusty Trumpet couldn't soothe the restless ache in Jasper's chest.
