The humid air hung thick in the salon, heavy with the scent of acetone and lilac polish. Sunlight slanted through the dusty window, illuminating motes dancing above Esmeralda "Esme" Flores' head as she meticulously shaped Mrs. Garibaldi's nails into perfect ovals. 

Esme worked with a practiced ease, her fingers moving like hummingbirds over the wrinkled skin. She loved this part - the transformation from gnarled claws to smooth canvases ready for color. It was artistry, really, making each nail a tiny masterpiece. Yet today, even the vibrant fuchsia Esme chose couldn't lift the weight settling in her chest.

The eviction notice stuck on the fridge door at home kept replaying in her mind like a broken record. Three months behind on rent and no steady clientele since COVID hit. This salon, nestled in the heart of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, was her lifeline, her only source of income. But with new nail bars popping up every week, competition was fierce. And Esme, despite her talent, lacked the flashy advertising budget of her rivals. 

She glanced at Mrs. Garibaldi's reflection in the mirrored wall. The elderly woman’s face was etched with worry lines, mirroring Esme’s own anxieties. It was time for a change, a bold move. Something had to give before Sunset Park swallowed her whole.
