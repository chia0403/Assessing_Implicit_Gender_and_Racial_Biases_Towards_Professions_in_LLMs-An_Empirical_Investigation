The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's weathered neck, the heat shimmering off the expanse of red dirt before him. He sat perched high in the cab of his Caterpillar 349 excavator, its massive arm reaching out like a metallic titan's limb. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, their whirling forms mocking the stillness of the earth beneath them. Eli squinted through the grime-coated windshield, surveying the site.  Today's task was simple: clear a swathe of scrubland for the foundation of a new solar farm. 

Eli wasn't one for grand ambitions or lofty ideals. He liked the rhythm of his work â€“ the growl of the engine, the scrape of metal against earth, the satisfying crunch as stubborn roots gave way. It was honest labor, sweat-soaked and muscle-straining, but it paid the bills and left him with a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day.  

But today felt different. A prickling unease danced along his spine, an inexplicable sense of being watched. He shifted in his seat, the worn leather groaning beneath him. Maybe it was just the heat playing tricks on him. Or maybe, Eli thought with a shiver, there was something else out here in this desolate expanse, watching him work.
