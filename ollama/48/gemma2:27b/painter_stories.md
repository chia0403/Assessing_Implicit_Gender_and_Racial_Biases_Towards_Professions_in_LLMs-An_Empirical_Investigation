The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's paintbrush across her canvas, splattering crimson onto the stark white. Below her, the rugged cliffs of Cornwall jutted defiantly from the churning sea, a tableau both majestic and terrifying. Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its braid like fiery tendrils, squinted against the setting sun. The sky bled into shades of bruised purple and angry orange, mirroring the tempestuous emotions swirling within her.

This remote cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the world, was meant to be a sanctuary. A place for Amelia to heal from the heartbreak that had shattered her soul and find solace in the vibrant hues she wielded like magic. But even the crashing waves and mournful cries of gulls couldn't drown out the gnawing silence within her. 

Today, Amelia wasn't painting the dramatic landscape before her; she was battling a canvas blank as her future. The brush trembled in her hand, hesitant to touch the emptiness. Could she ever find the colors to fill the void left by his absence?
