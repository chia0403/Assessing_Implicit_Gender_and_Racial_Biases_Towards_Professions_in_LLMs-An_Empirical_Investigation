The scent of jasmine and freesia hung thick in the air, punctuated by the sharp, citrusy tang of grapefruit zest. Elara Thornbloom hummed softly as she weaved vibrant sunflowers into a towering arrangement destined for a summer wedding. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Thornbloom's Blooms," casting long shadows across the overflowing buckets of lilies and the mounds of crimson roses waiting to be transformed.

Elara, with her freckled nose dusted in pollen and hands stained emerald green from hours spent coaxing fragile orchids to bloom, paused to admire her work. A pang of longing tugged at her heart. The wedding promised a celebration of love and laughter â€“ things Elara longed for but hadn't yet found in her own life. Still, she poured her soul into every bouquet, hoping to bring a touch of beauty and joy to the world, even if it meant vicariously experiencing those emotions through her creations.
