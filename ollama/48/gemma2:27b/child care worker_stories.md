The aroma of cinnamon rolls baking in the communal kitchen mingled with the faint scent of disinfectant, creating a uniquely daycare smell that Amelia Rose Cartwright had long since come to associate with both comfort and chaos. It was 8:15 a.m., and already a symphony of giggles, shrieks, and the thudding footsteps of miniature humans echoed through "Little Wonders," the brightly colored daycare center she'd called her workplace for the past five years.

Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows overlooking a small playground filled with giggling children chasing bubbles blown by Ms. Johnson, Amelia's eternally cheerful co-worker. Inside, Amelia wrestled a sticky finger-painted handprint off a table while simultaneously trying to soothe a wailing toddler whose prized teddy bear had gone missing. 

It was going to be one of those days.
