Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "Murphy's Liquors" across the street. The scent of stale whiskey and damp paper hung heavy in the air of Bartholomew Finch's cramped office. Bartholomew, a man whose neatly combed hair couldn't quite conceal the encroaching grey at his temples, meticulously tallied figures in a ledger book.

The rhythmic tapping of his fountain pen against the worn wooden desk was the only sound piercing the otherwise oppressive silence. Outside, thunder rumbled like a disgruntled god, shaking the ancient building to its core. Bartholomew flinched, momentarily losing his place on the page. He sighed, pushing a stray lock of hair back into place.

His client, Mr. Alistair Hawthorne, was notorious for being late with his payments – and tonight was no exception. Bartholomew glanced at the battered clock on the wall. 10:42 pm. Hawthorne was already two hours past due.  A gnawing anxiety started to twist in Bartholomew's gut. This wasn't just about a missed payment; it was about the looming threat of eviction hanging over his own head, and the increasingly desperate hope that this client wouldn’t be the one to push him over the edge.
