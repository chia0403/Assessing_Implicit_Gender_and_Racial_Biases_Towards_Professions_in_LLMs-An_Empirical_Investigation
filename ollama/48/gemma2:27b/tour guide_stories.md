The midday Cairo sun beat down on Beatrice "Bea" El-Amin's shoulders as she herded her gaggle of tourists towards the entrance of the Egyptian Museum. Sweat prickled beneath her crisp linen shirt, but Bea kept her smile wide and bright. After all, these were her people now, these wide-eyed travelers eager to glimpse ancient wonders.

She could practically feel their anticipation thrumming in the air like a living thing. They jostled each other playfully, snapping photos of the museum's imposing façade – a grand, neoclassical building that looked straight out of a history book. Bea took a deep breath, relishing the familiar scent of dust and antiquity that clung to the air around them. This was her domain, her stage; she knew every nook and cranny of this magnificent museum, every hieroglyph etched into its walls.

Today's group was a motley crew: a boisterous family from Texas, a quiet couple from Japan delicately holding hands, and a lone, silver-haired gentleman who seemed lost in his own thoughts. Bea had learned over the years that each group brought its own unique energy, its own story waiting to be told. 

As she ushered them through the grand archway and into the cool, dimly lit interior, Bea felt a familiar thrill course through her. Today was going to be an adventure.
