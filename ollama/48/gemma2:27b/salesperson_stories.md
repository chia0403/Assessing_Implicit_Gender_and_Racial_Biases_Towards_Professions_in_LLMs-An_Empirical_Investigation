Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Wheels & Deals," the used car lot shimmering like an oil slick under the sodium lamps. Amelia Rose Finch, her red hair plastered to her forehead by sweat and humidity, stared out at the desolate scene. A lone dog, skeletal and shivering, picked its way through the puddles, a testament to the forgotten corners this part of town seemed to inhabit. Amelia sighed, adjusting the itchy polyester of her uniform. Today had been another bust â€“ not a single customer brave enough to venture into the downpour. 

She'd been at "Wheels & Deals" for six months now, trying to claw her way out of the mountain of student debt that threatened to bury her whole. Amelia dreamed of something better: a sleek, modern office downtown, a desk with a view, and clients who didn't haggle over every dollar like it was their last.  But for now, she was stuck selling rust buckets to anyone desperate enough to buy them.
