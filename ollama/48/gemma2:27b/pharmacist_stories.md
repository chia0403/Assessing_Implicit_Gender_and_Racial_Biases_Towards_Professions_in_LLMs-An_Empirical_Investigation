The bell above the door chimed a cheerful melody, jarring Eleanor Rosalind Blythe from her meticulous counting of ibuprofen tablets. She looked up, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear, and saw Mrs. Henderson shuffling in, her arthritic knees protesting with every step. 

Eleanor's apothecary, tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, was a haven from the bustling city beyond.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating shelves stacked with glass jars filled with herbs and powders. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and chamomile, mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly ground ginseng. 

Eleanor smiled warmly at Mrs. Henderson. "Good morning," she said, her voice as soothing as honey. "What can I do for you today?"
