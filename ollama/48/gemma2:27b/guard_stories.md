The wind howled through the skeletal branches of the Deadwood Forest, whipping snow into Elias Blackwood's face. He hunched further into his furs, cursing the biting cold that seeped through every layer.  Elias wasn't built for this weather, with his wiry frame and hands more accustomed to tending a forge than wielding a sword. But duty called, and as a Nightwatchman of Silverpeak Keep, he was responsible for patrolling the perimeter even in the harshest storms.

Silverpeak Keep loomed ahead, a jagged silhouette against the bruised sky. Its ancient stone walls, scarred by centuries of siege and storm, seemed to groan under the weight of the snowdrift accumulating on its ramparts. A solitary beacon flickered atop the highest tower, casting a pale, anemic light that barely pierced the swirling whiteness. 

Elias trudged onward, his boots crunching through the knee-deep snow, his breath fogging in the frigid air. He scanned the treeline for any sign of movement, his hand resting nervously on the pommel of his sword. The forest was a silent menace tonight, its secrets buried beneath the blizzardâ€™s fury. Elias knew that beyond the Keep's walls lurked dangers unseen - feral creatures drawn by the storm and whispers of darker things that haunted the fringes of civilization. 

Tonight, he felt an unsettling chill crawl down his spine, a premonition that something was amiss. The wind carried not just the howling blizzard, but a low, guttural growl that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the forest.  Elias tightened his grip on his sword and quickened his pace, praying he wouldn't be alone tonight.
