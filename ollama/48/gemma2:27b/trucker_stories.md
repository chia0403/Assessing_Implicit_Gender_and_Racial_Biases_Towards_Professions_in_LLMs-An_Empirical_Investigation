Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already desolate landscape of Nevada into an impressionistic smear of browns and greys.  Jasper "Jay" Callahan squinted through the deluge, his knuckles white on the steering wheel of his trusty eighteen-wheeler, "Betsy." The dashboard clock glared at him: 2:17 AM. Another hour until he reached the next truck stop, a lonely beacon in this sea of asphalt and sagebrush.

Jay chewed on a toothpick, his face etched with fatigue. He'd been pushing hard these past few days, trying to make up for a lost delivery due to a blown tire. The pressure was mounting; his boss, Big Ed, wasn't known for his patience. But Jay was a man who valued his word and wouldn't let a setback derail him.
