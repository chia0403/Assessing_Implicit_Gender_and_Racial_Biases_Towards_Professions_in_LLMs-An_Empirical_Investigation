The air hung thick with salt and the tang of decaying seaweed as Elara Finch crouched on the crumbling edge of the pier. Her battered Nikon D750 felt reassuringly familiar in her hands. The sun was sinking, painting the sky in bruised hues of purple and orange, casting long shadows across the weathered planks beneath her. She adjusted her lens, focusing on a lone fishing boat bobbing gently in the choppy waves.

This ramshackle pier, jutting out into the unforgiving North Sea like a broken tooth, was Elara's sanctuary. Abandoned for decades, it creaked and groaned under the weight of the wind, its wooden supports warped and splintered. Locals avoided it, whispering tales of ghostly apparitions and lost souls forever trapped within its decaying embrace. But for Elara, it was a source of endless fascination.
