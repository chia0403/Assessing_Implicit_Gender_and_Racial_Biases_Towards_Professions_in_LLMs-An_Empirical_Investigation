The rhythmic clang of chisel against granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the rasping hiss of Silas Blackwood's whetstone as he honed its edge. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the grimy windows high above, illuminating the intricate patterns Silas was carving into a block of pale grey marble. Sweat beaded on his brow, reflecting the flickering gaslight that hung precariously from a beam overhead. The air, thick with the scent of stone dust and sweat, clung to him like a second skin.

Silas wasn't born into this life. He came to it late, after years spent as a cartographer, his maps meticulously charting the unexplored corners of the world. But the pull of something more tangible, something he could touch and shape with his own hands, had been too strong to resist. He'd traded his compass for a chisel, his inkpot for a whetstone, and found solace in the unforgiving but honest nature of stone.


Today, however, a strange unease gnawed at Silas. The commission - a gargoyle to adorn the new cathedral being built on the hill overlooking the city - was unlike anything he'd attempted before. The design, brought to him by a shadowy figure cloaked in midnight blue, seemed to pulsate with an unseen energy, its wings outstretched as if poised for flight.

As Silas carefully chipped away at the marble, he couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't simply carving stone, but something far more ancient and powerful. Something that was watching him...waiting.
