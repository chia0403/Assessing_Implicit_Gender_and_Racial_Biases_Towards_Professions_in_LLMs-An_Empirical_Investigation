Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, each drop an icy hammer blow on the centuries-old glass. Inside, Emilia Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, the warm glow of a reading lamp casting flickering shadows across the stacks of ancient tomes surrounding her.  The air hung thick with the scent of aged paper and leather, a comforting aroma that always calmed Emilia's soul.

Tonight, however, the usual peace was shattered. An unsettling stillness had descended upon the library, broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain. The grand oak doors, usually bustling with patrons seeking knowledge or solace, stood silent and forbidding. Even the resident tabby cat, Mr. Whiskers, was nowhere to be seen, his favourite sunbeam abandoned in favour of some unknown hiding place.

Emilia shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that whispered of hidden dangers lurking in the shadows.  As she reached for a volume on local folklore, hoping to distract herself from the growing unease, a strange sound drifted through the hushed aisles â€“ a muffled whisper, barely audible above the storm's fury, yet undeniably there.
