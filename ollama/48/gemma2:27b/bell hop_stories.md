The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung thick with the scent of lilies and desperation. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins III adjusted his burgundy uniform cap, the gold braid digging into his forehead like an unwelcome reminder of his lineage. He was a Higgins, dammit, descended from generations of hoteliers, yet here he was, relegated to bell hop duty.

The lobby glittered under the watchful gaze of a thousand chandeliers. Marble floors reflected the nervous shuffling of guests arriving for the Blackwood Ball, their faces etched with anticipation and thinly veiled ambition. Bart hated it all. The ostentatious displays of wealth, the suffocating air of propriety, the endless stream of demanding luggage - it was all so utterly pointless. He longed for something more, something real, something beyond these gilded cages. 

As he braced himself for another onslaught of suitcases and snooty smiles, a figure emerged from the swirling crowd, their face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat.  Bart felt an unfamiliar tingle run down his spine. This wasn't just another guest. This was someone different. Someone intriguing.
