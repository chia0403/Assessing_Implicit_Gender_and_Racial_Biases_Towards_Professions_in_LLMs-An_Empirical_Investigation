Rain hammered against the warped windowpane, blurring the already dreary view of the high school parking lot. Eleanor Vance sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before dissipating into the humid air.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the cluttered desk in front of her. Scattered across its surface were college brochures, crumpled tissues, and a half-eaten granola bar – the detritus of another emotionally charged day at Northgate High. Eleanor was used to dealing with teenage angst, but today felt different. A gnawing unease settled in her stomach, fueled by the unsettling dream she’d woken from just hours ago.

It featured a swirling vortex of numbers and faces, culminating in a single chilling image: her own reflection distorted into something monstrous. Shaking off the memory, Eleanor reached for a file labeled “Lucas Montgomery,” hoping the meeting would bring some sense of normalcy back to her day. Lucas was a bright kid, struggling with anxiety about college applications, and Eleanor was determined to help him navigate this tumultuous period.  But as she flipped open the folder, a shiver ran down her spine. The dream, the rain, the oppressive atmosphere - it all felt eerily connected.
