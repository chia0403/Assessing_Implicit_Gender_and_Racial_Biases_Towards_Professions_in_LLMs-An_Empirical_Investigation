Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm drumming in Dr. Evelyn Thorne's chest. The antique Victorian house creaked and groaned around her, its bones settling under the onslaught of the storm. Shadows danced across the dusty floorboards, cast by the flickering gas lamp she'd lit moments before. 

Evelyn ran a hand through her auburn braid, tugging at the stray strands that escaped. She was alone in the cavernous attic, surrounded by forgotten relics and shrouded in an eerie silence punctuated only by the storm's fury. Tonight, she was no longer just Dr. Evelyn Thorne, esteemed clinical psychologist. Tonight, she was a reluctant inheritor, facing down the mysteries of her grandmother's past.
