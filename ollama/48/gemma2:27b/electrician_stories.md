Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth, punctuated by the sharp tang of soldering flux. Elias Finch adjusted his safety goggles, squinting through the gloom at the tangled mess of wires before him. 

He wasn't a man easily fazed. Years spent wrestling faulty wiring in dilapidated Victorian houses had forged a stoicism within him. But this project â€“ rewiring the ancient clock tower in the heart of Ashton - was proving particularly stubborn.  The original wiring, a haphazard network of cloth-covered cables and archaic switches, seemed determined to resist his every attempt at order.

Elias sighed, running a calloused hand through his greying hair.  He needed a break. Stepping outside, he braced himself against the wind that whipped through the deserted industrial estate. 

Across the road, the skeletal silhouette of the clock tower loomed, its face obscured by swirling mist. The rhythmic clang of the bell, usually a comforting sound marking the passage of time, was strangely absent tonight.  As Elias stared up at the silent monument, he felt a prickle of unease. Something wasn't right.
