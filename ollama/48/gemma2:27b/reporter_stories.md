Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias "Eli" Finch's cramped apartment, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. His fingers tapped a frantic tattoo on the chipped surface of his desk, eyes fixed on the blinking cursor mocking him from the screen. The deadline for his expos√© on the city's corrupt councilman loomed, and Eli was running out of time.

He lived in the heart of Newhaven, a decaying industrial city where the air tasted of coal smoke and desperation. Rusting factories cast long shadows over crumbling brick tenements, their windows like vacant eyes staring into a bleak future. The relentless drizzle mirrored the city's perpetual gloom, seeping into its bones and dampening even the most resilient spirit. Eli knew this city better than anyone; its secrets whispered to him in the hiss of steam pipes and the mournful wail of distant sirens. 

Tonight, however, those whispers weren't enough. He needed a smoking gun, concrete proof that Councilman Thorne was funneling public funds into his own pockets.  Eli had followed the trail for months, piecing together scraps of information from anonymous sources and hushed conversations in smoky backrooms. But he still lacked the definitive evidence that would bring Thorne down.
