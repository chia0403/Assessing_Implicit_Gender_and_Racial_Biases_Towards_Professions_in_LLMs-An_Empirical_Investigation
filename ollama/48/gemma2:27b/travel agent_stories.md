The aroma of burnt coffee mingled with jasmine incense, assaulting Emilia Winthrop's nostrils as she unlocked her office door. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the Parisian cityscape beyond into an impressionistic watercolour. A sigh escaped her lips - another dreary Tuesday in the City of Lights, a far cry from the sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains she sold to eager tourists.

Emilia, a petite woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its bun, surveyed her cluttered desk. Guidebooks spilled onto the floor like forgotten dreams, postcards from exotic locales mocked her with their vibrant colours, and a half-eaten croissant sat forlornly beside a chipped mug. Today was a day for paperwork - invoices, confirmations, the mundane reality of running "Wanderlust," her tiny travel agency tucked away in a cobblestoned alleyway.

But Emilia yearned for adventure, for the thrill of exploring unknown territories, not just vicariously through brochures and online reviews. Her heart ached with a wanderlust she couldn't satisfy.
