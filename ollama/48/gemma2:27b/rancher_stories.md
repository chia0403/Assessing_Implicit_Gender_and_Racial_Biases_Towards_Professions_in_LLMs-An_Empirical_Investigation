The wind whipped across the dusty plains, biting at Thaddeus "Tad" Callahan's weathered face as he squinted towards the horizon. The sun, a pale disc through the haze of dust kicked up by a week of relentless drought, offered little warmth. Tad adjusted his Stetson, its brim casting a meager shadow over his eyes the color of faded denim. He surveyed his sprawling ranch, "The Lazy C," with a weary sigh.

Once, the land had been lush and green, teeming with cattle. Now, skeletal trees clawed at the unforgiving sky, their branches stripped bare by the relentless sun. The creek that snaked through the property, once a lifeline for his herd, was reduced to a trickle, barely enough to quench a thirsty sparrow. Tad knew he was running out of time. If the rains didn't come soon, "The Lazy C" would wither and die, taking with it generations of Callahan history.
