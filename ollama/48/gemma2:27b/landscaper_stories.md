The humid air hung heavy over Amelia Rosewater's shoulders as she wrestled with a tangled rosebush. Sunlight dappled through the canopy of ancient oaks, casting dancing shadows across the sprawling lawn of the Vanderlyn estate. The scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the sweet perfume of honeysuckle, creating an intoxicating aroma that usually soothed Amelia's soul. Today, however, her mind was elsewhere, preoccupied by the letter clutched in her apron pocket â€“ a summons to appear before the town council regarding the mysterious wilting of Mrs. Hawthorne's prized orchids.

Amelia loved her work. Transforming neglected gardens into vibrant havens brought her immense satisfaction. Yet, accusations of horticultural sabotage were something she hadn't anticipated. The Vanderlyn estate, with its manicured lawns and meticulously pruned hedges, was a welcome reprieve from the brewing storm in her life.
