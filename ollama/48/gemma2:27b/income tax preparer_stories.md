Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Geraldine "Geri" Cartwright's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Tax season had officially begun, unleashing a torrent of receipts, W-2s, and bewildered clients upon her doorstep. The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar scent this time of year. Geri sighed, pushing aside a stack of forms threatening to topple over. Her normally tidy desk resembled a battlefield strewn with crumpled paper and half-eaten granola bars. 

The phone shrieked its insistent cry, jolting her back to reality.  Geri braced herself for another frantic taxpayer begging for last-minute miracles. "Cartwright & Co., how can I help you?" she answered, forcing cheer into her voice. But even as the words left her mouth, Geri couldn't shake the feeling that this tax season might be different. This year, something felt...off.
