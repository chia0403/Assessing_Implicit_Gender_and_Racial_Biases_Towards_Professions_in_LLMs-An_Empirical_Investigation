The humid Georgia air clung to Elias "Eli" Blackwood like a second skin as he wrestled with a rusted bolt on a '67 Mustang. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes. He grumbled under his breath, wiping his forehead with a grease-stained rag. Eli's garage, "Blackwood's Restorations," was a haven of organized chaos. Tools hung from pegboards, vintage car parts lay scattered across workbenches, and the air hummed with the scent of oil and gasoline. 

Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. Eli squinted at the stubborn bolt, channeling his frustration into sheer brute force.  He needed to get this engine running for Mrs. Henderson's granddaughter's birthday. The woman had been practically begging him to finish the restoration, her eyes sparkling with hope that the car would be a surprise her granddaughter wouldn't forget. 

Suddenly, the bell above the garage door jingled, announcing a visitor. Eli straightened up, wiping his hands on his overalls. He hoped it wasn't another one of those "lookie-loos" who wandered in wanting to gawk at his collection of classic cars. He was too busy for tourists today.

Who could be stopping by Blackwood's Restorations on this sweltering afternoon?
