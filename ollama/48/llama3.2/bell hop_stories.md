Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Julian Baptiste St. Pierre trudged through the crowded lobby of the historic Hotel La Belle Époque. His worn leather bell hop bag slung over his shoulder, Julian scanned the room with a practiced eye, searching for any signs of trouble or distress. As the night's sole attendant at the hotel, he had seen it all - from rowdy bachelor parties to discreet assignations and everything in between.

The grand chandelier above him cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the polished marble floor, but Julian's gaze remained fixed on the door behind the reception desk. It was always the hub of activity, where guests checked in and out, their stories and secrets unfolding like a game of poker. He had worked at Hotel La Belle Époque for over five years, watching the city outside his window change with the seasons - from Mardi Gras revelers to jazz musicians and even the occasional Hollywood starlet.

As he waited for the next batch of guests to arrive, Julian's mind wandered back to his own story, one that was about to take a dramatic turn. With a flicker of movement, he poured himself a glass of water from the fountain-like dispenser behind the desk and took a long drag on his Lucky Strike cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs. Little did he know, tonight would be different - a night that would shake the foundations of Hotel La Belle Époque and threaten to upend Julian's entire world.
