Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving during the night of the autumnal equinox. It was as if the very fabric of the town seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, like the hum of a thousand tiny guitars played in discordant harmony. In this eerie atmosphere, Dr. Elara Alistair, a talented and meticulous pharmacist, stood behind the counter of her family's historic apothecary shop, watching as the last customers of the day filtered out into the downpour.

As she tidied up the remains of the evening's sales, Elara's eyes lingered on the antique glass jars containing various remedies that had been passed down through generations of Alistairs. The soft glow of the streetlamps outside cast a warm light on the shelves, illuminating rows of dusty bottles and peculiar artifacts that seemed to hold secrets and stories of their own. The scent of sandalwood and lavender wafted from the display case, mingling with the faint tang of old books and the whispered rumors of the town's history.

Elara's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of the doorbell above the entrance, signaling the arrival of a customer on a night like this. With a quiet sigh, she straightened her apron and began to prepare for whatever lay ahead – perhaps a customer seeking a remedy for their aches and pains, or maybe something more... unexpected.

And yet, as she gazed out into the darkness, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that tonight would be different. Tonight, the shadows seemed to be watching her with an air of quiet expectation, waiting for her to uncover some hidden truth – one that only she might be able to discern, behind the counter of her beloved apothecary shop.

How's this? I tried to create a spooky and atmospheric setting for your story, while also introducing your main character, Dr. Elara Alistair, as a smart and resourceful pharmacist with a connection to her family's history.
