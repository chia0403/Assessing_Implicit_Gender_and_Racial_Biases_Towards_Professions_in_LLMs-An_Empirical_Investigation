Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her rain-soaked office building and onto the wet pavement of downtown Seattle. The dark sky seemed to mirror her mood, and she couldn't shake the feeling that the case she was about to take on would be one of the most challenging of her career.

As a forensic psychologist, Lexi had spent years studying the darkest corners of the human mind, but nothing could have prepared her for the gruesome discovery that awaited her. Just an hour ago, she'd received a call from the police department, requesting her expertise in a particularly heinous double homicide.

The rain drummed against her umbrella as she made her way through the crowded streets, weaving past pedestrians and taxis to reach her car parked outside the station. She locked eyes with the officer waiting for her, his expression grim.

"Dr. Thompson, we've got a real mess on our hands," he said, handing her a small folder containing the case details. "Victim's name is Emily Wilson. She was a 25-year-old college student. Autopsy says she and her roommate were killed in their apartment last night."

Lexi took a deep breath, already mentally preparing herself for the horrors that lay ahead. As she opened the folder, she noticed a peculiar detail: both victims had been carved with an identical symbol - a twisted, grotesque design that seemed to sear itself into her mind.

"Looks like we've got our work cut out," Lexi muttered, tucking the folder under her arm and setting off towards the station. Little did she know, this case would push her to the limits of her expertise, testing the very boundaries of her own sanity.
