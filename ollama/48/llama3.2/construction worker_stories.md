Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Red Rock, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn buildings. The air was thick with the smell of sweat and grease from the local construction site, where 32-year-old Jackson Ryder "Hawk" Hawkins was elbow-deep in drywall, hammering away at a freshly installed panel.

As a seasoned construction worker for the past decade, Hawk had seen it all - from the grandest skyscrapers to the humblest one-room cabins. But there was something about Red Rock that drew him back, maybe it was the familiarity of the worn sidewalks and the camaraderie of his coworkers at Joe's Construction Co., where he'd worked since high school.

Hawk wiped the sweat from his brow, his weathered denim shirt clinging to his broad shoulders as he took a moment to survey his domain. The house they were building for the young family, the Smiths, was coming along nicely - the roof was on, the electrical was in, and the drywall was starting to go up fast. But Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, like a lingering storm cloud on the horizon.

And then, just as he was about to take another swing with his hammer, Hawk's radio crackled to life, sending a shiver down his spine: "All units, this is Dispatch. We've got a code 3 at the old mill on Highway 12. Reports of a suspicious fire. Respond immediately."
