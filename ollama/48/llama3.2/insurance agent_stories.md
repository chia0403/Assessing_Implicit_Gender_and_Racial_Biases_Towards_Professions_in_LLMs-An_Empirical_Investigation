Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Agent Emily Rose Thompson stepped out of her office building and onto the sidewalk. The neon signs of the nearby bars and restaurants reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the deserted street. A chill ran down Emily's spine as she pulled her navy blue trench coat tighter around her shoulders. It was going to be one of those nights.

Emily had just finished a long day of meetings with clients, peddling policies and premiums like they were lottery tickets. Her agency, Thompson & Co., was doing well, but the pressure to meet sales targets was starting to take its toll. As she gazed up at the towering skyscrapers, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The city seemed darker, more menacing than usual.

She took a deep breath and started walking towards her car, parked in a crowded lot on First Avenue. Her eyes scanned the rows of vehicles, searching for hers â€“ a 2015 Honda Civic with a dented bumper and a faded insurance company sticker. As she reached her car, Emily noticed something that made her heart skip a beat: a piece of paper stuck to the windshield, fluttering in the wind.

It was an envelope, addressed to her in bold black letters: "Meet me at the Space Needle at midnight. Come alone." Emily's instincts screamed warning signals, but her curiosity got the better of her. Who could have sent this? And what did they want with her?

With a sense of trepidation, Emily carefully pulled out the envelope and tucked it into her purse, deciding to keep the mysterious message to herself for now. She slipped behind the wheel of her car, started the engine, and peeled out onto the wet streets, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
