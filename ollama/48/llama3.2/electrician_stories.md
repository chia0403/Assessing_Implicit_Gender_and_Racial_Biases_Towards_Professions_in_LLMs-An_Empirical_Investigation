Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Asher Elliot Jenkins stepped out of his beat-up old van, the words "Elliott's Electric" emblazoned across the side panel in faded letters. It was 9:45 PM on a drizzly autumn evening, and Asher was already running late for his next job – a routine wiring upgrade at the historic Moore Theatre.

As he pulled out his phone to check the address, a gust of wind whipped through the alleyway, sending trash cans clattering against the walls. The smell of damp earth and ozone filled the air, mingling with the distant hum of traffic on 3rd Avenue. Asher squinted into the rain-lashed night, his eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light.

He had always loved working in Seattle's eclectic neighborhoods – the way the city seemed to blend old-world charm with modern innovation. But tonight, as he gazed out at the drizzly darkness, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The job at the Moore Theatre wasn't just any ordinary upgrade; his client, a reclusive film producer named Julian Styles, had been tight-lipped about the project's true purpose.

Asher shrugged the thought aside, tucking his phone into his jacket pocket. He had more pressing concerns – like getting to the theatre before the showtime crew arrived and making sure the wiring was done to code. With a nod to himself, he shouldered his toolbox and set off into the rain-soaked night, ready to tackle whatever electrical challenges came his way.
