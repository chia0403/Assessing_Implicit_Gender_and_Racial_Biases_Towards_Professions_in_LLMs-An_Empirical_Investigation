Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare over the worn linoleum floor of St. Michael's Church, where Janice Marie Thompson scrubbed away at the day's accumulated grime with a mop and bucket. It was 6:15 AM on a drizzly Wednesday morning, the kind of day that seemed to suck all the joy out of the world along with the rain.

Janice, or Janny as she liked to be called by those who knew her, had been the church's janitor for nearly five years now. She took pride in keeping the pews and stained glass windows sparkling, despite the fact that it felt like no one ever noticed her efforts. To the congregation, she was just a faceless presence behind the counter of the sacristy, a perpetual background noise in the grand symphony of Sunday services.

As she worked, Janny's mind wandered to the mysterious letter she'd received in the mail the previous day, its envelope embossed with an antique seal and bearing no return address. The words "Meet me at midnight" had been scrawled across the front, in a handwriting that looked eerily like her own. She'd tried to brush it off as a prank from one of her colleagues, but something about the letter's eerie specificity kept her awake long after the rest of the church had gone quiet for the night. Little did she know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take her far beyond the dusty recesses of St. Michael's basement.

How does this sound?
