Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Interstate 40, casting a pale orange glow over the desert landscape. Highway Worker Ryder Jackson gazed out at the endless stretch of asphalt, his eyes squinting against the glare as he sipped his lukewarm coffee from a thermos.

It was going to be a long day ahead - Ryder's crew had been called in to repair a section of the highway that had been damaged during last night's storm. The forecast promised more rain and wind by mid-morning, making the task even more daunting. But Ryder wasn't one to shy away from a challenge. He'd spent years working on the highways of New Mexico, and he knew every curve and pothole like the back of his hand.

As he stood there, the silence was only broken by the distant rumble of traffic and the occasional chirp of a bird taking flight. The desert air was crisp and clean, with just a hint of diesel fumes from the cars speeding past outside the makeshift construction zone. Ryder took another sip of his coffee, feeling the caffeine kick in as he scanned the horizon for signs of trouble.

Little did he know, this day would be unlike any other on the job...
