Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Willow Creek, where the smell of fresh-cut grass and warm coffee wafted through the air. Inside his family-owned barbershop, "Snips & Clips," 32-year-old barber Julian Everett carefully steamed a customer's hair, listening intently as they shared their troubles over the hum of the clippers.

Julian had grown up in Willow Creek, learning the art of barbering from his father and grandfather before him. He took pride in making every client feel like part of the family, no matter how eccentric or demanding they might be. As he worked on Julian's latest client, a burly man with a thick beard, he couldn't help but think about the strange request he'd gotten earlier that day - to cut his mustache into a shape resembling a pair of scissors.

As the evening wore on and the shop emptied out, Julian took a moment to tidy up before closing time. The rain pattered against the windows like a gentle drumbeat, casting a soothing melody over the quiet streets. Outside, the streetlights flickered to life, casting long shadows across the sidewalk as people hurried home from their daily routines.

Little did Julian know, his peaceful evening was about to take an unexpected turn...
