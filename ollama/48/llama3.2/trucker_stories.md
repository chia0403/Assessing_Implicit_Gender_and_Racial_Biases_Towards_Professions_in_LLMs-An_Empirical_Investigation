As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, casting a golden glow over the desolate stretch of interstate, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins fired up the diesel engine of his trusty Peterbilt 359, affectionately known as "Bertha." The rumble of the engine was music to Hawk's ears, a familiar sound that had accompanied him on countless miles of American highways for over two decades.

With a practiced eye, Hawk surveyed the landscape unfolding before him - the endless expanse of asphalt, the skeletal silhouettes of roadside billboards, and the occasional cluster of trees marking the boundaries of small towns or rural communities. He was a man of the open road, with no fixed address but his own two wheels, Bertha, and the ever-changing scenery that came with her.

A former Army veteran, Hawk had traded in his combat boots for a set of scuffed up work shoes, and his MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) for a steady diet of diner coffee and greasy truck stops. He had built a reputation as one of the most reliable drivers on the route, earning a loyal client base of shippers and haulers who appreciated Hawk's no-nonsense attitude and unwavering commitment to getting the job done.

Tonight was like any other - Hawk had just received a call from an old friend and fellow driver, Mike "Sawdust" Saunders, asking him to meet up at a truck stop in rural Oklahoma. Something about a mystery package that needed to be delivered to the other side of the country, and Sawdust's cryptic warning about "the guy who didn't want it." Hawk had always been one for taking on odd jobs, but this one had him itching for his wallet and ready to get Bertha rolling into the night. Little did he know, tonight would be a ride like no other.
