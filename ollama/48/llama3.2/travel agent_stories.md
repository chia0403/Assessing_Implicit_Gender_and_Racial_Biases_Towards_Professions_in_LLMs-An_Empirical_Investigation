As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, Emiko Yamada locked up her small travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co." The scent of freshly brewed matcha wafted from the nearby café, enticing passersby to step inside and indulge in a traditional Japanese tea. Outside, neon lights reflected off the wet pavement, casting a vibrant glow over the crowded sidewalks.

Emiko took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the towering skyscrapers. She loved this time of day – the moment when the city's energy began to ebb, and the sounds of car horns and chatter grew quieter. As the owner of Wanderlust & Co., Emiko had spent countless hours researching destinations for her clients, from the ancient ruins of Kyoto to the vibrant streets of New Orleans.

With a satisfied smile, Emiko slipped off her bright yellow raincoat, revealing a crisp white blouse underneath. Her curly brown hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright green eyes sparkled with excitement as she began to tidy up the office. Tonight, she would be working on a new itinerary for a group of adventure-seekers heading to Iceland – a trip that promised breathtaking landscapes, geothermal hot springs, and maybe even a glimpse of the Northern Lights.

As Emiko wiped down the counter, her phone buzzed with an incoming message from an unknown number. She hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering who could be contacting her on such short notice. "Wanderlust & Co." flashed on the screen – she was about to find out that this evening's calm would soon give way to a journey that would take her far beyond Tokyo's city limits.
