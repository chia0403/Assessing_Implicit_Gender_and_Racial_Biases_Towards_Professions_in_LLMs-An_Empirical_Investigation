Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist guides like Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson were used to this sight every day, but she still felt a thrill of excitement as she led her group of visitors through the winding passage.

As a seasoned guide, Lexi had spent years sharing the history and secrets of Petra with visitors from all over the world. She knew every nook and cranny, every hidden gem and every fascinating fact about the ancient Nabatean city. Her group of six tourists, including two couples and a solo traveler, followed closely behind her as she expertly navigated the treacherous terrain.

Lexi had grown up in Jordan, just outside of Petra, and had always been fascinated by the history and culture of the ancient city. She had spent years studying the subject, earning degrees in archaeology and anthropology, and working her way up from intern to lead guide. Now, at 32, she was one of the top guides in Petra, known for her knowledge, enthusiasm, and ability to bring even the most skeptical tourists to life.

As they emerged into the vast expanse of the Monastery's platform, Lexi paused to take a deep breath, surveying the breathtaking view. "Welcome to the Treasury," she said, her voice carrying out across the stillness. "One of the most iconic and awe-inspiring sights in Petra."

But as she looked around at her group, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. One of her tourists seemed nervous, fidgeting with their camera strap like they were waiting for someone to arrive... or leave. Lexi's trained eyes narrowed slightly, but she pushed the thought aside, focusing on the next part of the tour. After all, Petra had secrets enough without adding her own mystery to the mix.
