Here's a potential story opening:

In the scorching summer of 1885, Kaelin "Kae" Thayerson, a rugged stone cutter from the small town of Ashwood, stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon, his eyes fixed on the vast expanse of rust-red rock that stretched out before him. The sun beat down upon his weathered face, its rays dancing across the wisps of graying hair that escaped from beneath his worn leather cap.

Kae had spent countless days honing his craft in this very spot, where the Colorado River carved a serpentine path through the heart of the Arizona Territory. As one of the few stone cutters skilled enough to work with the ancient granite that flowed from the nearby mountains, Kae took pride in crafting intricate facades and monuments for the wealthy elite who sought to stake their claim on this unforgiving land.

Despite his rugged exterior, however, a sense of unease settled in the pit of Kae's stomach as he gazed out at the vast, seemingly endless expanse. Rumors had been circulating through Ashwood's tight-knit community about strange occurrences and unexplained events that plagued the canyons at night - whispers of ghostly apparitions and disembodied howls that echoed off the rocky walls.

As Kae stood there, lost in thought, a faint rustling sound drifted on the breeze, making him wonder if he was truly alone.
