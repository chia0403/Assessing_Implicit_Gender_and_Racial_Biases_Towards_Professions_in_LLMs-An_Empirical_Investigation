Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, casting a gloomy mist over the city's streets and alleys. Private investigator Emilia Ruby Thorne stood outside her small, cluttered office on 2nd Avenue, puffing on a cigarette as she gazed out at the rain-soaked sidewalk. The neon sign of the nearby jazz club, Ruby's own namesake, cast a warm glow over the wet pavement, but it did little to lift Emilia's spirits.

At 35, Emilia was one of the few women working as a private detective in Seattle, and she had earned a reputation for being fiercely independent and uncompromisingly honest. Her sharp mind and quick wit made her a formidable investigator, but also left her with a tendency to push people away â€“ a trait that often left her feeling isolated and alone.

As she stubbed out her cigarette and pushed open the door to her office, a bell above it let out a tired clang. Emilia blinked in the sudden darkness, her eyes adjusting slowly to the faint light of the overhead bulb. The rain drummed against the windowpane like a beat, and for a moment, Emilia felt like she was the only person left in the world.

Just then, the phone on her desk jolted her out of her reverie, shrill and insistent. Emilia picked up the receiver, her voice firm as she replied, "Thorne Investigations."
