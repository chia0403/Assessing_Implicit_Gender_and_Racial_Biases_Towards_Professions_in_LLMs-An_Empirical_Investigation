Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets, 22-year-old Alexis "Lexi" Thompson made her way to the community center where she worked as a child care worker at the local after-school program. The sound of laughter and playful chatter filled the air as she unlocked the door and stepped inside.

The community center was a hub of activity in Willow Creek, providing a safe space for children from families who struggled financially to spend their afternoons playing, learning, and making new friends. Lexi had been working there for two years now, watching countless kids come and go, each with their own unique stories and struggles.

As she began to set up the day's activities - arts and crafts projects, outdoor games, and storytime - Lexi couldn't help but notice that today felt different. There was a sense of tension in the air, a feeling that something was about to shift in this tight-knit community. And when the first group of kids arrived, chattering excitedly about their weekend plans, Lexi's instincts told her that she needed to be on high alert.

Just as she was getting settled, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. Lexi picked it up, expecting it to be a parent calling with an emergency or a question about the program. But instead, the voice on the other end sent a shiver down her spine...

How's that for a story opening?
