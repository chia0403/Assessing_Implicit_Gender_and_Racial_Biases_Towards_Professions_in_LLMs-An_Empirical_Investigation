The rain hammered against the ornate glass of the Grand Hotel lobby like an angry choir.  Each drop that splattered on the polished floor echoed the cacophony in Arthur "Ace" Sterling's mind. Tonight was the night. The night he would make his move, steal a hundred-dollar bill from Mr. Peabody's safe and disappear into the swirling mist of anonymity. Ace was all too aware of the risks. But there was something about the icy blue eyes staring back at him in the reflection of the grand clock that fueled his ambition.  

Ace's job as bellhop for the esteemed Grand Hotel wasn't much to brag about, but it offered a unique opportunity. He knew the layout of every nook and cranny of this opulent palace like the back of his hand, from the dusty corners of forgotten storage rooms to the glittering staircases that led to the ballroom where wealthy dignitaries danced under the chandeliers. Tonight, though, the labyrinthine hallways would be his battlefield. 

He adjusted his fedora, a silent testament to his ambition, and stepped out into the stormy night. The city seemed to shrink beneath him as Ace took a deep breath of fresh air, the scent of rain and wet asphalt clinging to the city's weary soul. It was time to claim his destiny in this symphony of chaos and luxury.
