##  Setting: The School's Underbelly 

**Opening:**  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile sheen on Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carter’s desk. A single stack of reports sat precariously perched in the corner of her room - each one a testament to the delicate dance between childhood and adulthood, the fragile threads connecting the two worlds. She took a deep breath, trying to erase the image of the boy in the back row, the one who never seemed to fit in, whose eyes held a storm brewing inside them. 

Amy had spent years navigating this landscape of youth - helping kids process the anxieties of adolescence, the pressures of academic competition, and the unyielding weight of societal expectations. She was an adept observer, understanding the silent language of body language, the unspoken fears that haunted their young minds. But today, something about the situation felt different. 

This wasn't just another case of social anxiety or learning difficulties. There was a knot in Amy’s stomach she couldn't quite unravel. The boy's report held an undercurrent of something deeper, something more unsettling than mere behavioral quirks. A single word had caught her eye – "haunted".
