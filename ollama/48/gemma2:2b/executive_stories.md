## Opening & Setting

**Opening:**  A lone figure, silhouetted against the city's glittering skyline, stood on the edge of a windswept rooftop. Rain lashed down in sheets, blurring the lights of New York City into an abstract watercolor. The only sound louder than the wind was the incessant drumming of his fingers against his briefcase, a metronome counting down the seconds until the inevitable meeting. 

**Name:**  Adrian Thorne
  
**Setting:** The year is 2047, and New York City has become a vertical metropolis, towering skyscrapers pushing towards the heavens like metallic monoliths. Technological advancements have made the city efficient but isolating, with everyone glued to their personal spheres of reality, only ever truly interacting through digital interfaces. Adrian Thorne, however, was an executive in one of the last remaining, flesh-and-blood networking firms - "The Bridge." His job was to facilitate real, human connections between clients and partners.  

Adrian sighed, a gust of wind carrying a faint scent of ozone and street grime. He wasn't sure if he missed something about the pre-digital era, or if it was just this city's endless drone that was finally getting to him. He adjusted his fedora, its brim casting an erratic shadow over his eyes, as he looked down at the sleek black briefcase nestled under his arm. 

 **Itâ€™s showtime.**  His voice echoed in the vast emptiness of the rooftop, before fading into the wind.
