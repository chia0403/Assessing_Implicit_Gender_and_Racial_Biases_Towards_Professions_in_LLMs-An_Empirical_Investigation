The sun bled orange across the dusty mahogany floorboards as Amelia "Amy" Blackwood meticulously polished the antique silver frame, humming softly to herself. It was the kind of quiet that settled over her little world like a thick fog, each tick of the clock in the hallway marking another moment woven into the tapestry of her life. The opulent mansion loomed around her - a sprawling Victorian monstrosity with creaking floorboards and an echoing grandeur Amy felt only a fraction of herself. Built for the likes of Lord Ashworth, who was as sharp-witted and cruel as he was wealthy, it was a living testament to the kind of wealth she could only ever dream of touching.  

This wasn't just a job; this was her life. A world where dust motes danced in sunbeams, each whisper of wind through the drafty halls told stories of forgotten parties and whispered scandals. And Amy, with her worn apron and gentle touch, kept it all running smoothly. She knew every creak, every secret stain on the floorboards, every hidden room behind a tapestry-covered door.
