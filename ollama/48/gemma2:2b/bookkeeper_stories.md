Rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the familiar storefront of "Three Wishes Bakery" into a watercolour dream. Inside, Evelyn Thorne meticulously counted the day’s receipts on her tiny desk, surrounded by stacks of invoices and the comforting scent of cinnamon rolls. 30 years old, with auburn hair cascading down to her shoulders like a tangled waterfall, she was a quiet bookkeeper with an uncanny talent for finding order in chaos. Yet, tonight, the usual calm felt askew. The storm wasn't just raining, it was howling. Every gust of wind seemed to whisper secrets, each flash of lightning illuminating Evelyn’s worried frown. 

Across town, in her small but cozy apartment, a different kind of storm brewed. A handwritten note lay on the coffee table: "Evelyn," it read in a hurried script, “Please call me.” The name “Thomas” scrawled at the bottom sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine. Thomas Hawthorne, owner of the prestigious Hawthorne & Sons Construction company, had been one of her clients for years. She hadn't seen him since his father passed away and he seemed to have withdrawn from all business dealings. 

Evelyn’s heart pounded a frantic rhythm against her ribs as she picked up her phone, the heavy silence on the other end amplifying every nervous tick in her chest.
