Rain hammered against the worn tin roof of the community center, mimicking the steady drumbeat of Evelyn Thorne's anxiety. Her breath fogged in the stark fluorescent light as she sat across from Joshua "Jay" Carter, her newest client, a 20-something with restless eyes and a nervous twitch that wouldn't quit. It was supposed to be routine probation check-in, but something about Jay's demeanor feltâ€¦ off. 

The probation office, a cramped concrete box in the heart of downtown, reeked of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the city throbbed with an undercurrent of violence that seemed to seep through every cracked windowpane. The air hung heavy with unspoken words and suppressed emotions. Evelyn, known for her quiet strength and unwavering focus, tried to read Jay's story while battling the mounting sense of foreboding. 

Jay was a kid who'd stumbled off the wrong side of the tracks, caught in a whirlpool of petty crime and desperation that seemed to swallow young men whole. He had a talent for charming smiles and even more charm for getting himself into trouble. Tonight, he sat before her with the weight of his choices etched on his face like a weathered map. 

"Evelyn," Jay began, his voice barely above a whisper, "there's something I need to tell you." His eyes darted around the room as if searching for an escape route, for something other than Evelyn's gaze.
