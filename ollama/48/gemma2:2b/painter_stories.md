Rain hammered against Amelia's studio windows, blurring the already muted streetlights beyond. Her canvas lay before her, an empty expanse begging for life. The smell of linseed oil lingered heavy in the air, as if the paint itself held its breath waiting to be unleashed. Amelia adjusted her worn beret, a defiant crimson splash against the grey backdrop, and stared at the blank white wall on her studio floor - a mirror of the emptiness inside her. 

Amelia Bell was no ordinary painter. Her art wasn't merely about capturing reality; it was a desperate attempt to escape it. Each stroke she made was an act of rebellion against the world that seemed to press down, smothering the vibrancy and colour within her soul. The city of Veridian, once a vibrant tapestry of life, had become a swirling vortex of grey concrete and endless drizzle.  Its energy was drained by the relentless work routine, the same grind from dawn till dusk in Amelia's sterile apartment above a bustling factory - where most people found solace. But Amelia saw the world in hues unseen, trapped within her own mind until she could finally paint it onto canvas.
