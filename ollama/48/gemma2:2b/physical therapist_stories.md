Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Thorne's office, blurring the neon sign proclaiming "Rehab Haven" into an erratic kaleidoscope of color. It was the kind of storm that seemed to suck the very air from your lungs, leaving a dampness in its wake. Inside, Amelia sat hunched over a worn stack of patient files, her fingers drumming on the edge of the table as she tried to decipher the jumble of diagnoses and rehabilitation plans. 

The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sterile glow over the room, but Amelia felt anything but comfortable. She wasn't just a therapist; she was a caretaker for these broken bodies, their lives tethered to her every step. Her patients weren’t just injuries, they were fragments of life left unfinished; and each new day brought a fresh puzzle to solve.  

Amelia sighed. The storm outside mirrored the tempest brewing in her own soul – frustration over a new patient, Mr. Evans, who seemed incapable of even holding a simple cup of tea without fear that he'd drop it. And the case files were only adding fuel to the fire; they were filled with stories of pain and struggle, each one weighing heavier than the last.  

The storm raged on, but inside the small office, Amelia fought against her own personal tempest, determined to bring light back to these fragmented lives, one step at a time.
