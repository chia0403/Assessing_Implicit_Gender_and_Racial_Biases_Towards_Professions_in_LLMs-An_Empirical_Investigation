Rain lashed against the windowpanes, each drop exploding in miniature fireworks on the glass. Inside Amelia "Amy" Bell's modest office, a lone fluorescent bulb cast a sickly yellow glow over piles of tax documents and crumpled receipts. It was February 1st – the day she dreaded more than any other. Not because she hated filing taxes, but because it meant another year closer to... well, *him*.

The door creaked open. Her usually jovial coworker, Frank, walked in with a weary grin. "Amy," he rumbled, his voice thick with the remnants of yesterday's whiskey and heavy sighs.  "Heard you got a visit from Mr. Grimshaw this morning." 

Amy sighed, knowing exactly what was coming. The man’s icy eyes had been haunting her dreams for weeks; each late-night session at the library, poring over tax forms under the harsh fluorescent light, seemed to have brought them closer together.  The weight of unspoken tension hung thick in the air like the stale coffee brewing on the office kettle. This year's tax season was more than just a job – it was an intimate dance with fate, and Amy couldn't help but feel that this time, the music had changed its tempo.
