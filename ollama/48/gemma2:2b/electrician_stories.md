## Setting: 

The year is 1984. A sprawling warehouse district in Chicago hums with activity.  Massive cranes heave steel skeletons into place, their metal arms echoing through the air. The faint scent of coal dust and old concrete hangs heavy on the breeze, mingling with the sharp tang of fresh paint that coats newly erected buildings.  It's a city changing as fast as the wind shifts directions, leaving traces of its past in every exposed wire and dusty brick.

## Character: 

**Ethan "Hawkeye" Harris**, his weathered face etched with countless years spent hunched over flickering fluorescent lights, felt the familiar buzz of anticipation crawl up his spine.  He wasn't a man for idle hands; he had a knack for finding both the problems and the solutions nestled within a tangle of wires.  A veteran electrician for 20 years, Hawkeye was known to fix anything from faulty stoves to complex control panels, all with an air of quiet confidence that bordered on arrogance. He carried a toolbox as sturdy as his resolve – each tool a testament to his hard-won skills and years spent mastering the craft.

## Opening:

"Another night, another dollar," Hawkeye muttered to himself, adjusting the worn harness of his safety gear.  The flickering streetlights cast long shadows across the warehouse floor, revealing the skeletal structure of the building under construction – steel bars exposed against the encroaching darkness. A lone figure stood on a scaffold, arms waving like nervous birds as he wrestled with a jammed power line. 

Hawkeye knew this job would be his last before going in for knee surgery, and it felt fitting; like closing a chapter on years of working through the pain. He took a step forward, eyes focused.  "Just gotta keep these wires singing," he whispered to himself, a faint smile tugging at his lips.
