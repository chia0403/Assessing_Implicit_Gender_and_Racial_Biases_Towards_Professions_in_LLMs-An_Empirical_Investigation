## The Setting

The air hung heavy with the antiseptic scent of decay and worry in the cramped, old-fashioned office on Elm Street.  Sunlight filtered weakly through the grimy windows, casting long shadows across Dr. Evelyn Thorne's worn dental chairs and overflowing cabinets. It was a place where time seemed to crawl and patients often felt more like prisoners than visitors.

## The Opening

Dr. Thorne sighed, her tired eyes scanning the latest stack of X-rays.  A wave of nausea washed over her as she looked at the x-ray depicting the gnarled, infected molar of Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman whose teeth had succumbed to decades of neglect. Evelyn was a skilled dentist, she could fix anything but sometimes, some cases felt like staring down the abyss itself – an impossible battle against decay.

"Mrs. Henderson," her assistant's voice startled her from her thoughts, "The surgery is tomorrow morning."

Evelyn knew it wouldn't be easy. Mrs. Henderson was stubborn, clinging to old habits and resistant to change, but this particular molar needed a full extraction – a procedure that brought back the ghosts of her past. Evelyn had been practicing dentistry for over 20 years, yet this case brought with it an unsettling sense of inevitability, a feeling of being trapped by time's relentless march.
