The morning mist clung to the rolling hills of Oakhaven like a ghostly shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of grass as if trying to hold onto secrets. It was this kind of early-morning magic that made Theodore "Theo" Hawthorne's heart sing.  He loved waking up before the world fully woke, inhaling the earthy fragrance of freshly turned soil and taking in the quiet symphony of birdsong before the day's clamor started to rise. 

Theo was a man born for the outdoors - his calloused hands were as familiar with trowel and rake as they were with a loved one's hand.  Years spent shaping nature's canvas into living, breathing art had brought him a quiet peace few could understand. Today, he was in the middle of a sprawling estate belonging to the Blackwood family, tasked with transforming their neglected lawn into a testament to his craft - a lush oasis that would bring joy to the entire estate.
