The early morning sun was already scorching as it hammered down on the steel skeleton of the new mall.  Dust devils danced in its rays, swirling around the towering form like restless spirits. Ethan "Hawkeye" Hayes, his back stiff from hauling heavy concrete blocks all day, wiped sweat from his brow and squinted into the glare. He’d been working on this project for weeks now, and even with the fresh air, he felt a growing sense of claustrophobia. He hated these enclosed spaces, these massive concrete jungles where everyone moved in circles but didn't seem to know what they were doing. 

Hawkeye had worked construction since he was young, starting as a roughneck before he’d learned his way around a crane and started working with the big boys.  He'd always felt most at home in the elements - under the open sky, under the vastness of the earth. Today’s project was different; it felt like an affront to everything he believed in. The silence within the scaffolding wasn't peaceful. It was a hollow echo, punctuated by the occasional crackle from the pneumatic tools and the whine of machinery far off in the distance. 

He glanced down at his worn leather work boots - the soles were scuffed from years on the job, and one strap had come loose - and sighed.  There wasn't anything he could do about it now. The building was already half-finished, ready for its grand opening. Just another cog in this machine. But inside him, a little part of Hawkeye still yearned for something more.
