## Story Opening

The chill morning mist clung to the overgrown rose bushes surrounding Old Willow Manor like a spectral shroud. As the first rays of sunrise pierced through the veil, they lit up dust motes swirling in the air and cast long shadows from the towering oaks that fringed the property. This was the domain of Elias Thorne, groundskeeper extraordinaire - a man who knew every crack in the ancient stone walls, the whisper of the wind through the ivy-choked eaves, and the secrets hidden beneath the gnarled roots of the elm tree by the rose garden.  

Elias, a weathered figure with hands like calloused driftwood and eyes as blue as the forget-me-nots that dotted his beloved rosebushes, squinted at the rising sun. The air hung heavy with the promise of rain, the scent of damp earth mingling with the sweet aroma of honeysuckle - a potent cocktail he usually found soothing but not today. Today was different. There was an undeniable heaviness in the air, a tension that tightened his chest like a rope around it. 

He had always felt safe within these familiar confines of Old Willow Manor. But today, a disquiet settled upon him like a shadow. He knew something was wrong. He just wasn't sure what yet.
