## Story Opening: 

**Setting:** A bustling office in suburban Atlanta. Sunlight filters through large windows onto rows of gleaming white teeth-whitening machines and polished stainless steel instruments. The air hums with the quiet whirring of vacuum cleaners and the occasional, low whistle from a frustrated patient struggling to remove their denture. 

**Main Character:**  Dr. Evelyn “Evie” Parker, a woman who meticulously organized her life down to the color-coded file folders in her desk drawer, seemed surprisingly out of place amidst the chaos.  Her usual calm demeanor was replaced by an anxious flutter as she scanned the waiting room for a sign that their routine patient check-up had begun.

**Opening Sentence:** "Time was always against Evelyn's clock," Evie muttered to herself as she ran her fingers over the familiar contours of her dental hygienist’s kit. She wished the ticking clock on the wall would slow down, but even with a heavy sigh and a weary smile, she couldn't escape the reality of the minutes slipping away like grains of sand through her hands. 


**Note:** This setting and character description provide a foundation for your story. From here, you can build the plot by introducing conflicts, adding dialogue, revealing more about Evie’s character, or exploring the inner workings of the dental office itself.
