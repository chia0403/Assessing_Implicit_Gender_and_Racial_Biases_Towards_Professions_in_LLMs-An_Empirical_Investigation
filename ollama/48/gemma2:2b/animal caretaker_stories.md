Rain hammered against the barn roof, each drop a tiny explosion echoing the frantic beating of Elara's heart. Her weathered hands, gnarled from years of caring for these magnificent creatures, gripped the worn leather reins of Barnaby’s sturdy chestnut mare.  “Easy there, sweetheart,” she murmured, her voice barely audible above the wind and the storm’s relentless assault. She was a whirlwind of motion herself: weaving between rows of stalls, checking water troughs, and meticulously clipping hooves – all under the watchful gaze of the imposing silhouette of Stormwind’s Gate, the sprawling farm where she worked.  

The old barn stood bathed in a sickly yellow light from an ancient oil lamp, casting long shadows that danced like phantom figures on the dusty wooden floor. The scent of hay, straw, and mildew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of wet earth and the metallic smell of blood that seemed to cling to the windswept storm-clouds gathering above. Elara's stomach twisted with a sickening sensation as she felt it again – a familiar pang that could only be described as grief. 

It wasn’t just the relentless, bone-chilling rain or the fact that Stormwind's Gate had been plagued by an endless string of misfortunes lately. It was the disappearance of Jasper. His playful grin and mischievous brown eyes were missing from his usual post in the far corner of the barn, leaving only a void where warmth used to be. Elara closed her eyes briefly, picturing him as he usually was - with his floppy ears flopping around his head as he nudged her hand for a scratch, his tail swishing like a metronome against the wooden floor.  "Jasper," she whispered through the roar of the storm, her voice thick with unshed tears. "Where'd you go?"
