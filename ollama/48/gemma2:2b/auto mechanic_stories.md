The scent of old grease and burnt oil was as familiar to Felix "Lucky" Lavoie as his own heartbeat.  His worn leather jacket hung like an apron on his thin frame, its pockets stuffed with tools that he'd used to build and fix more engines than memories. He ran a calloused thumb over the faded red paint of his trusty '78 Ford pickup, a behemoth nicknamed "Betty" by the folks at the garage.  Lucky's Auto was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Pinewood, Nevada - the kind of town where time had lost its grip and secrets lingered like dust motes in the afternoon sun.

The year was 2047, and the desert winds, as relentless as ever, carried the sound of the wind turbines humming on the horizon.  But in Lucky's world, the past held more sway than progress.  He saw magic in a worn-out spark plug, a song in the whine of an old Ford engine. He knew every squeak and groan, every subtle shudder that whispered a story only he could understand.

Today, however, the usual symphony was drowned out by a strange quiet. The front door creaked open to reveal a figure shrouded in shadow â€“ a girl who looked like she'd stepped straight from a forgotten dream.  Her eyes, as blue as the desert sky, held a spark of something more than fear; a flicker of hope that seemed to match the rusty glow of Lucky's tools.
