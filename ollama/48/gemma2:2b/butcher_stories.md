The stench of blood and cured meat hung heavy in the air of "Cumberland's Cuts," as thick and suffocating as the humidity clinging to the humid summer afternoon.  Inside, Bartholomew Cumberland III (affectionately known as Bart) ran his hands over a gleaming cleaver, the familiar weight comforting in his palm. Outside, the town of Oakhaven was basking under a relentless August sun, oblivious to the turmoil brewing within its walls. But inside the butcher shop, reality was far from idyllic. 

Bart's brow creased as he examined the latest delivery: a slab of venison barely fit for a table in his own family's modest dining room. The meat was dull and lifeless, ravaged by disease that had turned even the finest beasts into shadows of their former selves. It was a harsh reminder that even the most respected name couldnâ€™t always buy quality. His father's legacy, built on tradition and the meticulous handling of prime cuts, lay crumbling like stale bread crusts in his hands. 

As he idly wiped down a cleaver, his eyes caught a flicker of movement at the edge of the butcher block. A figure, cloaked in shadows cast by the afternoon sun, stood unnaturally still, watching him. A shiver ran down Bart's spine.  Something was off, the quiet unnaturalness of their presence an echo of the silent death that hung heavy over Oakhaven.
