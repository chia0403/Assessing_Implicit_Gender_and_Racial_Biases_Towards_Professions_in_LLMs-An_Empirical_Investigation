The neon "Open" sign buzzed overhead, its sickly green light casting an unflattering glow on Dr. Evelyn Reyesâ€™ tired face. Her white coat was rumpled beneath her layers of scrubs, a testament to the long nights and even longer days she had endured in this forgotten corner of the city. 1:45 AM. Another shift, another pile of medical charts growing thicker with each passing hour at Mercy General Hospital's emergency room. 

Evelyn, a PA since her graduation from Harvard Medical School five years ago, knew the routines of this place as well as she knew the back of her own hand.  The hum of machines in the background was like a lullaby - a chorus of suffering and hope played out in hushed tones and frantic shouts. She was used to the chaos, used to the smell of disinfectant and blood mingling with stale coffee, and the weight of responsibility felt heavy on her shoulders, sometimes crushing, sometimes empowering. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual undercurrent of worry had morphed into a palpable sense of unease. A whisper of dread hung in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors, a jarring counterpoint to the quiet despair that clung to Evelyn like a shroud.
