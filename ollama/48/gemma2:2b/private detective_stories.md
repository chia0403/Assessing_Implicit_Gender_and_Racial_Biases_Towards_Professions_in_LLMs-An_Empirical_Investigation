Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of 21B Sycamore Street, blurring the already faded neon glow of "The Lucky Pelican" dive bar across the street.  Inside, the air hung thick with stale beer and cigarette smoke, punctuated by the clatter of empty mugs on the linoleum floor. At his usual corner table, perched precariously like a hawk, sat Detective Alistair Thorne – nicknamed "Thorn" for his piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through people's facades.  

Tonight was different. The usual suspects in this seedy part of town had faded away, leaving only the faint echo of their whispered pleas and veiled threats. Thorn shifted in his worn leather chair, the weight of his fedora pressing down on his forehead. He hadn’t seen a case like this before – not since he’d started his career five years ago, when a stray bullet had changed everything for him and his beloved partner, Liam.  

Thorn's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fist around a crumpled cigarette pack. The case file lay open on the table, its contents more unsettling than any of the seedier bar brawls he’d seen in his past.  A missing person. A family business gone sour. And now… this. He needed to dig deeper, to unravel a mystery as intricate and twisted as the city's underbelly itself. 

"You ever been to a crime scene where the victim was also the mastermind?" Thorn muttered to himself, his gaze fixed on the photo of a young woman in a business suit, smiling brightly behind thick-rimmed glasses.  Her name was Elara Thorne – a ghost from his past, a ghost he couldn’t escape.
