Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Evelyn Everly's tiny cottage, blurring the already fading daylight into an impressionistic watercolour of greys and purples. The wind howled like a disgruntled beast, tugging at the frayed edges of her cardigan as she settled onto the worn sofa in the living room. Her heart sank with each gust that rattled the loose panes. It wasn't supposed to be this bad. Not tonight. 

The rain had always been a symphony for Evelyn - lulling her into a melancholic peace as she cooked for her charges, but tonight, it felt like a harbinger of something darker. Tonight, there was an oppressive stillness in the air that she couldn't quite place.  Evelyn took a deep breath, smoothing the wrinkles on her apron, and ran a fingertip over the chipped porcelain doll nestled on her coffee table. Her name, Emily, still clung to its faded blue dress - a memory from another life, another time when the rain didn't feel so ominous. Tonight, though, she was determined to keep the storm at bay, one tiny hand-drawn picture and whispered bedtime story at a time. 

Her charges awaited; three children, each with their own set of fears and secrets tucked away in their eyes. Evelyn, with her years of experience and an unwavering empathy, knew that tonight's storm wasn't just about the weather. It was about a storm brewing within them, waiting to be understood.
