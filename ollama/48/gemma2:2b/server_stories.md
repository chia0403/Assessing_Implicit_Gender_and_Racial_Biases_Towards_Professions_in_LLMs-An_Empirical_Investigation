Rain lashed against the stained glass windows of The Golden Gryphon, blurring the vibrant colours into shimmering streaks of violet and ruby. Inside, the warmth emanating from flickering candles barely penetrated the chill seeping through worn floorboards and heavy curtains.  Eloise "Ellie" Bellweather wiped her brow, a sigh escaping as she glanced at the overflowing tip jar beside her station. Another Saturday night, another symphony of tired sighs and hushed pleas for "extra whipped cream." 

The air thrummed with the same tired anticipation that always settled upon The Gryphon's patrons during these late-night shifts – a mix of exhausted students clutching lukewarm mugs of coffee and wealthy businessmen escaping the storm in their borrowed coats.  Ellie knew each one of them by heart, or at least by their most familiar haunt: the corner booth for "Professor Bramble," the plush armchair next to the fireplace reserved for the "Phantom of The Opera" (the man himself only ever sat there when he was feeling particularly melancholy), and the boisterous group of friends gathered around the pool table in an endless game of one-upmanship. 

As Ellie poured another cup of lukewarm chai latte, a sharp clink broke her concentration. A woman, tall and elegant in a deep emerald coat that shimmered with flecks of gold, had been staring out at the stormy street for almost five minutes.  Ellie knew the woman's usual haunts -  she always sat alone in the corner booth by the window. 

Her name was Lady Elara Thorne, and she wasn't just another patron; she was a secret whisper amongst the city's elite - an ethereal being who seemed to defy the very laws of reality. And tonight, there was a strange, almost mournful air hanging around her. Ellie had no idea why, but something in the woman’s posture spoke of a hidden storm brewing beneath her elegant exterior.
