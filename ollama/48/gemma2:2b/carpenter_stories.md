The smell of sawdust clung to Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne like an old friend, though lately, it felt more like a bitter enemy. The air in his workshop hung heavy with the weight of unspoken things, mirroring the knot of anxiety that churned in Teddy's stomach.  Sunlight slanted through the warped windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing across the worn floorboards. Outside, the wind howled a mournful symphony against the weathered siding of the old barn where Teddy had built his first masterpiece: a sturdy oak cradle for his newborn daughter Lily. 

He'd spent months on that cradle, every chisel mark and knot meticulously crafted with love and hope. It was meant to be a symbol of strength, of stability in a world teetering on the edge of upheaval. Now, however, that very symbol felt like a mockery – a tangible reminder of everything he could no longer control. 

The letter lay on the workbench, its crisp paper a stark contrast to the rough wood surrounding it. The words were blunt, demanding, and filled with a chilling finality that left Teddy's hands shaking. He picked it up, his fingers tracing the familiar embossed lettering of "The Garrison Family Trust." His heart sank like a lead weight as he read: the old family farm was being sold, and Theodore Hawthorne had been named executor of their will – an undertaking he wasn’t sure how to begin.
