The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window of Dr. Amelia Sinclair's clinic, casting long, distorted shadows across the worn linoleum floor. The aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of old paper and leather - remnants of years spent amidst the fur, feathers, and scales of countless creatures. Amelia ran a calloused hand over her own short-cropped hair, the familiar burn of fatigue setting in as she looked at the file on the desk:  "Mr. Fitzwilliam's cat, Jasper."  

Amelia had been Dr. Sinclair since before the old clinic was even built, her grandfather having founded it upon his return from the war - a place where animals, and their needs, were always put first. Now, years later, with her own life intertwined with the clinicâ€™s history, she found herself battling against the same relentless tide of responsibility that had been her grandfather's compass. It was a quiet Tuesday in the sleepy town of Willow Creek, but for Dr. Sinclair, chaos was brewing, hidden beneath the calm facade of her small office.
