The air hung heavy with the scent of cedarwood and old dreams as Amelia “Amy” Bellrose hurried through the narrow cobblestone streets of Oakhaven. The late afternoon sun was sinking into the town square, painting it in hues of burnt orange and fiery red.  Its gentle warmth did little to ease the chill that ran through Amy’s bones despite her wool coat. She clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – a half-finished wedding gown, a pattern for a child's dress, and a letter – pressing against her stomach with a reassuring weight. 

Amy wasn't just any seamstress. For generations, the Bellrose family had been entrusted with crafting exquisite garments, their needlework whispered about in hushed tones from the royal houses to the humblest of cottages. Amy carried on that legacy, but with each stitch she learned, her own anxieties bloomed like unwatered roses. Oakhaven's recent prosperity had attracted new residents, a tide of bustling merchants and aspiring artists who hadn't quite grasped the delicate balance of the Bellrose craft. Their designs, though charming, lacked the soul that Amelia brought to every piece.  She was about to find out if she could bridge the gap between tradition and innovation in time for her next grand commission - one which held the promise of both financial security and a place within Oakhaven's artistic tapestry.
