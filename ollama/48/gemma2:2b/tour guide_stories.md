The midday sun beat down on the cobblestones, turning the air thick and hazy.  An oppressive heat clung to Amelia Thorne, despite her light cotton blouse and linen skirt. Tourists swarmed around the majestic archways of the Old City, their cameras clicking incessantly, eager to capture its timeless charm. "Welcome to Prague," chirped Amelia, her smile as bright as the sunshine reflecting off the Charles Bridge. She expertly maneuvered a gaggle of teenage girls past the bustling crowds, leading them towards the historic Castle District. 

"So here we are," Amelia declared, holding up a worn map of Prague's old city walls. "Ready for a journey through centuries?" The girls, their eyes wide with anticipation, nodded eagerly. 
 
Amelia was more than just a tour guide; she was a living history lesson, her knowledge woven into every step and anecdote she shared.  Today, however, she felt a strange apprehension, a prickling sensation beneath the summer sun. The air hung heavy not just with the heat, but also with an unspoken tension that pulsed like a hidden heartbeat within the bustling city. She couldn't shake off the feeling that Prague held secrets it was reluctant to reveal.
