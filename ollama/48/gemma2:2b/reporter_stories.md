Ellie had spent weeks following whispers of a burgeoning revolution - whispers fueled by simmering resentment and fear. Now, she was finally standing at the epicenter of it all, armed with nothing but her notebook and a gut feeling that this story wasn’t just another piece in the chaotic symphony of dissent. It was about to become something much bigger.
