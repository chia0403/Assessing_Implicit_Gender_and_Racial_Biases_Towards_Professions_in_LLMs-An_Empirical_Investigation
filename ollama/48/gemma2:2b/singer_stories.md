Rain pattered against the grimy windowpane of Amelia "Echo" Thorne's tiny apartment, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in her chest. The melody was stuck in her throat, refusing to break free even as she stared at the overflowing ashtray and half-eaten pizza box on her worn kitchen table. Every song had this same feeling now, a hollow echo of its former vibrancy. 

It all started three weeks ago: a prestigious open mic night in Austin, Texas, an opportunity Amelia couldn't pass up. The crowd roared, the lights were blinding, and for that moment, she felt like she was flying - singing her soul out, pouring years of suppressed pain and joy into every note. Then came the silence. It wasn't just the stage, it was the band's discordant final chord that left a heavy silence in its wake. An inexplicable pressure had built up, a sudden weight on her chest like an unseen hand squeezing tight. 

She'd stumbled through her next few performances, each attempt at a fresh start tainted by the lingering dread. The once-familiar melodies felt foreign, robotic, stripped of their raw power. Amelia, aka "Echo" – a moniker bestowed upon her after the haunting echoes that reverberated from her first song – was losing her voice. 

Amelia had dreamed of leaving behind the small town life she'd spent her entire life in. This small apartment in Austin held more potential than any childhood dream could offer. Now, with each missed note, the weight of unfulfilled promises pressed down harder on Amelia's soul.
