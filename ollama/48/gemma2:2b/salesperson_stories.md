The midday sun beat down on the ramshackle antique store in the heart of dusty, forgotten Iowa. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cedar and time, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of an old grandfather clock that had long since stopped keeping time accurately.  Dust motes danced in a shaft of light filtering through the grimy window, illuminating the worn faces of countless vintage clocks, faded photographs, and forgotten treasures. 

This was where Elias Thorne, with his carefully manicured mustache and eyes that seemed to hold centuries of untold stories, worked his magic as Salesman extraordinaire. He'd inherited this shop from his late grandfather, who had been known for a knack for knowing the exact moment a buyer would stumble upon a piece he wanted, be it a hand-carved wooden rocking horse or a chipped teacup with an inscription in faded French.

His current customer was young and eager, her eyes wide behind thick glasses as she nervously surveyed Elias's cluttered desk.  "So," she began, "what do you think of this Victorian writing set?" 
 
This was no ordinary sales pitch for the young woman named Amelia. This wasnâ€™t just about selling a piece of furniture. It was about finding something that would tell her own story. And Elias knew it.
