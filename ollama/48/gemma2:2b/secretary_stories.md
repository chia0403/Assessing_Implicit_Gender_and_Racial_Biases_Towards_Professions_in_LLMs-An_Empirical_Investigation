It wasn't her fault she had been thrust into this whirlwind.  Her boss, Mr. Hawthorne, was a renowned historian with an equally notorious temper. But his latest obsession, unearthed from the dusty archives of the University Library, had thrown Amelia's life into disarray.

Her world was one of meticulous spreadsheets and endless coffee runs, a far cry from the glamorous historical mysteries that now seemed so close yet so out of reach. The setting was a historic university in a quaint American town. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten dreams.
