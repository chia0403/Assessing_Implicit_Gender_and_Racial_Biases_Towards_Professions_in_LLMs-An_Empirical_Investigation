The smell of fresh-baked apple pie hung heavy in the air, thick with cinnamon and a hint of woodsmoke that always reminded Ms. Eleanor Evergreen of fall mornings spent foraging for wild mushrooms in her grandfather's backyard. Now, though, surrounded by the chaotic energy of fourth grade, it was nothing more than a distant memory amidst the sticky fingerprints on textbooks and the relentless clamor of 25 eager, questioning students.  Her classroom at Westlake Elementary had always held a special kind of magic, but today, that magic seemed to have taken leave, replaced by a persistent sense of unease that she couldn't quite put her finger on.

Ms. Evergreen adjusted her spectacles, their silver frames reflecting the tired but determined glint in her eyes. She was staring at the board where a seemingly innocuous word puzzle – "Who Am I?" –  was scrawled across it, along with a handful of crumpled crayon drawings from her students. A single name stood out amongst them, a name she’d never dared to utter aloud: "Billy." 

Just yesterday, Billy had been the poster child for normalcy, a boy who blended into the background like an unsung melody. Today, however, he was an anomaly, his silence now as palpable as a thundercloud gathering in the sky.  And for Ms. Evergreen, a faint sense of dread began to tighten her chest.
