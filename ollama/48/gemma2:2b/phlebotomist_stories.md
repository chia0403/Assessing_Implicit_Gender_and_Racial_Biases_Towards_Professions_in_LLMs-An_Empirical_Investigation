The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an almost sickly pallor over the sterile waiting area. Rain lashed against the windows, its constant drumbeat a rhythmic counterpoint to the low murmur of anxious patients.  In the quiet corner beneath a flickering clock with hands that seemed determinedly slow, sat Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne, her weathered brown purse resting on the worn leather armrest of a chair. She was no stranger to anxiety, but tonight it felt particularly thick, clinging like surgical tape to her wrists. It wasn't just the storm outside; tonight was the night.

Amy had been a phlebotomist for 15 years, and she'd seen countless vials filled with blood, each vial a silent chronicle of someone else’s journey through life.  But tonight, it felt different. Tonight, she held a needle-tipped vial in her hand, one destined to carry the story of not just another patient's struggle but also the weight of a future that she herself hadn't even considered until recently: a future filled with secrets and danger. The storm was only beginning to brew, as was the mystery she'd stumbled upon – a mystery that had led her to this very moment, on the precipice of something both terrifying and exhilarating.
