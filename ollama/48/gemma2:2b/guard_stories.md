## The Midnight Hour

**Setting:** The sprawling walls of Castle Aethelred shimmered under a moonless sky, reflecting off its obsidian towers like shards of broken glass. The icy winds howled through the crumbling stones and whistled their mournful song across the deserted courtyard.  It was 12:01 am, the hour known only as "The Midnight Hour" when even the most seasoned guards feared to stray from their posts.

**Character:** Gareth, a hulking guard with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of countless nights spent patrolling these very grounds. He ran a calloused finger along the worn hilt of his sword, its steel gleaming faintly in the fading light. The metal felt reassuringly cold against his rough palm, each bump and scratch a silent testament to years spent battling unseen evils at the fringes of men's existence.  He stood near the heavily barred gate that led into the labyrinthine castle dungeons, his heavy tread echoing on the frozen cobblestones. 


The air hung thick with the smell of brine, salt from the nearby sea clinging to the walls and chilling Garethâ€™s lungs. He shivered involuntarily, pulling his thick woolen cloak tighter around his shoulders. This was no night for ease. Tonight's assignment promised a different kind of challenge - one that lay dormant beneath the surface of normalcy, waiting for the opportune moment to bloom in the darkness. 


A shiver crawled down his spine as he caught sight of the shadow flitting across the courtyard wall. The wind was too calm, too silent. It wasn't the natural movement of a stray tree or an errant crow, but something else - something that whispered of dark secrets and ancient evils.
