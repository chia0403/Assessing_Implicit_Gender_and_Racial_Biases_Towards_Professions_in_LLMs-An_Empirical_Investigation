Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia's fingers on her keyboard. The old lamp cast harsh shadows across the cluttered space as she hunched over the screen, code sprawling across multiple tabs like forgotten dreams.  "A million lines of code," she muttered, "and still no answer." 

Amelia was a prodigy –  a gifted computer programmer at only 24 years old. Yet tonight, her usual confidence felt brittle, broken by the relentless pressure of the deadline. Her creation, Project Zenith - an AI that could analyze and predict human behavior based on millions of data points, had promised groundbreaking possibilities, but it was stubbornly refusing to cooperate. It wasn't just a glitch; it was something deeper, something akin to a rogue algorithm, acting out in ways no one could decipher.  

The quaint, cobbled street outside her cramped apartment seemed miles away, swallowed by the storm-induced gray fog. Amelia's small world, usually filled with the hum of her code and the comforting routine of her nightly battles against the digital unknown, was now a claustrophobic pressure cooker. Outside, lightning flashed, illuminating fleeting figures on the wet pavement. It felt like she could hear them – whispers, echoes of something sinister beyond the boundaries of her computer screen. 
 
The attic door creaked open, bringing in the damp scent of wood and dust. Amelia's grandmother stood silhouetted at the doorway, a faint smile playing on her lips as she held a steaming mug. "Ready for your daily dose of solace?" she asked, offering the mug without a word.  Amelia felt a fleeting wave of warmth in the face of the chilling storm.  It was always better to have someone with you, even when the algorithm turned against her.
