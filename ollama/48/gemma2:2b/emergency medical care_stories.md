The neon glow of "Jimmy's Diner" seemed to mock the grim reality that clung to Dr. Amelia Reyes like an unwelcome shadow.  Rain lashed against the diner windows, mimicking the frantic beat of her heart as she waited for the ambulance to arrive at the scene of the accident.  Amelia, a seasoned emergency medical technician with years of experience under her belt, was all too familiar with these scenes; the flashing lights and screaming sirens were almost hypnotic in their familiarity, but tonight, they seemed to amplify the silent terror that clawed at her insides. 

It was a Wednesday night on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona, known for its sprawling desert landscape and endless sky. Tonight, however, it felt as though the very air held its breath, suffocated by an anxious silence. The diner across the street had been a beacon of comfort during those long nights where Amelia's own anxieties could feel like an overwhelming fog.  Tonight, though, she couldn't even muster the strength to grab her usual coffee and donut, the familiar routine now feeling more like a distant memory than a haven.
