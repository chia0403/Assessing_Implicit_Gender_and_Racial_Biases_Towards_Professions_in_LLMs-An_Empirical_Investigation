Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the city outside. Inside the sterile white room, the only sound was the rhythmic beeping of medical equipment and the muffled sobs of Evelyn Reed, R.N.  Her fingers tightened around her worn leather bracelet, the smooth, cool stone a familiar comfort in this chaotic storm of emotions. 

Evelyn had always felt at home in the hospital. The scent of antiseptic and disinfectant, the hushed voices of patients and doctors, the constant hum of life and death – it all resonated within her, making the chaos a symphony to her soul. But tonight, even the usual calm couldn't wash away the overwhelming weight on her heart. 

Tonight was Mrs. O'Malley's anniversary; the woman she’d tended to since her first day at St. Vincent's, had passed away. Her gentle smile and warm hugs no longer filled this room with a comforting light, leaving an empty space that Evelyn felt like she could never fill.  The hospital felt colder than usual.
