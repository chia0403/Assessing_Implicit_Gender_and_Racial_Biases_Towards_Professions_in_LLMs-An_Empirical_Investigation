Rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the vibrant autumn colors of Maple Street into abstract splashes of yellow and orange. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Finch's world was a far cry from the storm raging outside.  Her small, cluttered office at the back of "Butter & Bloom" was filled with travel brochures, maps drawn on ancient parchment, and stacks of meticulously organized flight tickets. Amy had her nose buried in one of those flights, an elaborate itinerary for a group heading to the Galapagos Islands - she’d be the one orchestrating their every step. 

But tonight, the storm wasn't just weather; it was a reflection of the turmoil brewing inside Amy. The trip to the Galapagos felt like a desperate attempt to outrun her past – or perhaps an escape from something else entirely.  Her dreams were shrouded in fog, filled with whispers and vague images that haunted her every waking moment. 

The bell above the door jingled as a young man hurried in, his jacket damp from the downpour. A nervous tremor ran through him as he glanced around at the bustling scene of tourists picking out pastries. Amy could see the reflection of his troubled eyes in the windowpane – just another soul seeking solace in her world of wanderlust.
