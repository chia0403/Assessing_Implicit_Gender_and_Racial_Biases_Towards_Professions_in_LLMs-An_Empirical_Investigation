The air in Dr. Amelia Hayes' office hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and sandalwood incense.  A lone window, draped in sheer curtains that allowed only soft shafts of afternoon sunlight to filter through, cast dancing patterns on the worn, wooden floor. Outside, the gentle rhythm of raindrops against the glass mimicked the slow, deliberate breaths Dr. Hayes took as she sat across from her newest client, a young woman with eyes that seemed perpetually brimming with sorrow. 

The client's name was Evelyn, and at 25, she bore the weight of an impossible burden on her shoulders. The past few months had been an emotional earthquake, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. Amelia knew this already. Evelyn had laid bare the story during their first session; a story she had meticulously documented with a meticulousness that bordered on obsession. 

"It's like a nightmare," Evelyn whispered, her voice trembling as if the very air itself was cold and unforgiving. "I keep waking up from it but there's still the fear...the feeling of being lost."  


**Setting:** A small, cozy office in a quiet residential neighborhood, with warm wood floors and vintage-style furniture.
