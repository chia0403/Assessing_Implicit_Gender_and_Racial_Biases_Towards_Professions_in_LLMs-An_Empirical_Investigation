Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Thorne's office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the ticking clock on the wall. The scent of old books and pine-scented candles mingled with the dampness that clung to the air.  Amelia rubbed her temples, her eyes heavy despite the early hour. Five hours ago, she'd closed the door on yet another session with Ms. Eleanor Davies. The woman’s unraveling had left a bitter taste in Amelia's mouth. It wasn’t simply the anxiety and fear that clouded Ms. Davies's mind; it was the palpable weight of regret, guilt, and despair. An impossible burden for a single soul to carry.

Settling back into her worn leather chair, Amelia stared out at the grey cityscape beyond the window. It felt as if the rain itself mirrored the turmoil inside her.  Every day, she witnessed patients' vulnerabilities laid bare - the shattered pieces of broken hearts, the scars of trauma that whispered long forgotten nightmares. In this office, a sanctuary for the human soul in its most fragile form, Amelia was tasked with the impossible: to piece them back together, one fragile thread at a time.
