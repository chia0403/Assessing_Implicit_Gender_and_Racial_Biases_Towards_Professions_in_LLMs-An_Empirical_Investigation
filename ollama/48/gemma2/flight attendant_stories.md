The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cramped galley. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously folded napkins into origami swans, her movements precise and practiced after years of service with Stellar Airways. The recycled air smelled faintly of stale coffee and disinfectant, a familiar aroma that she’d grown accustomed to on flights like this – red-eye from LAX to London, packed with tired businessmen and wide-eyed tourists alike. Amelia glanced out the window at the inky black expanse dotted with distant twinkling lights, a silent reminder of the vastness that lay between them and their destination. She took a deep breath, trying to ignore the gnawing anxiety that had been her constant companion since boarding.  

This flight wasn't just another routine leg. A sense of foreboding hung in the air, thicker than the recycled oxygen, whispering secrets about a storm brewing both above and below. The passengers seemed unusually subdued, their faces etched with tension. And Amelia, despite her years of experience handling turbulence and temperamental travelers, couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.
