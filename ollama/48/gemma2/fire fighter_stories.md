The acrid bite of smoke stung Elias Thorne's nostrils even before he saw the flames licking at the sky. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, his jaw clenched against the rising tension in his gut. The roar of sirens echoed off the glass skyscrapers, their reflections distorted by the swirling orange and red haze that hung low over the city. They were responding to a five-alarm fire -  the biggest he'd seen since joining the New York Fire Department six years ago.

Elias lived and breathed this city, its pulse quickening beneath his boots as he navigated the choked streets towards the heart of the blaze. He knew every corner, every shortcut, every shadow that danced in the flickering light of emergency vehicles. But tonight, the familiar felt alien, warped by the heat and the urgency of their mission. This fire wasn't just another call; it was a hungry monster, devouring everything in its path. And Elias Thorne, along with his crew, were about to walk into its belly.
