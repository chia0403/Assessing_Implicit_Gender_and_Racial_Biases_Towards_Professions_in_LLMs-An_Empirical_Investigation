The humid Louisiana air clung to Evangeline "Evvy" Dubois like a second skin as she stood backstage at The Blue Moon Saloon.  A single bulb cast harsh light on her worn-out tap shoes, making them gleam with sweat and grime. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a frantic drum solo in the orchestra of nerves that played inside her. She could hear the murmurs of the crowd filtering through the flimsy door â€“ a cacophony of clinking glasses and raucous laughter.  Tonight was the night. The night she had been dreaming of since she first belted out "Stardust" at her grandmother's kitchen table, using chipped mugs as microphones. Tonight, she wasn't just Evvy Dubois, the girl who cleaned tables at Mama Pearl's diner and sang for tips on street corners.  Tonight, she was Evangeline Dubois, vocalist extraordinaire, ready to steal the spotlight with her soulful voice and fiery passion.


The setting: The Blue Moon Saloon in a small, vibrant town nestled deep within the heart of Louisiana bayou country.
