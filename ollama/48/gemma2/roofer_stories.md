The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, turning the sweat clinging to his forehead into shimmering beads. He squinted through the haze, trying to focus on the ridge of shingles he was meticulously repairing. Below him, the bustling city of New Orleans sprawled like an emerald tapestry, its vibrant colors muted by the midday glare.  

Silas preferred working high above the ground. It provided a certain perspective, a detached view from the everyday chaos that seemed to engulf the French Quarter. From his perch atop this stately Creole townhouse, he could see people scurrying like ants on the cobblestone streets, their voices muffled whispers carried by the languid breeze. He felt a kinship with the sparrows flitting around the chimney, both of them perched precariously on the edge, surveying their domain.

A symphony of clanging metal and rhythmic hammering filled the air, punctuated by the occasional shouted call from a passing delivery boy or the sweet strumming of a jazz tune drifting from an open window.  But Silas remained focused on his work, each carefully placed shingle another piece in the mosaic that protected this house, and perhaps even offered a measure of safety to those who lived within its walls.
