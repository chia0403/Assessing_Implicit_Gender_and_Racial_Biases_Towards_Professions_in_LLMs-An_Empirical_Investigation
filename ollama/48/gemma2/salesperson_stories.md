The air hung thick with the scent of chlorine and desperation in the cramped office. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows, casting long shadows on the waterlogged carpet. Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Cartwright tapped her manicured nails against the worn countertop, drumming out a silent rhythm to the symphony of sizzling hot dogs from the bodega across the street.  

Ellie hated Mondays. Especially Mondays like this, where the quota felt impossibly high and every potential customer seemed to have a reason – any reason – not to sign on the dotted line. It wasn't that she was bad at her job; Ellie was the best darn car salesperson in all of Queens, if you asked her. But today, even her signature charm couldn't seem to penetrate the thick cloud of Monday morning apathy that clung to everyone like a second skin. 


She glanced at the name on the file in front of her: Mr. Antonio Grimaldi. He had a history of buying used cars – always sensible sedans, nothing flashy. Ellie sighed. This wasn't going to be an easy sale.
