The steam from Amelia Rose Hawthorne's hands swirled around her face like ghostly tendrils as she carried another tray of steaming plates through the crowded diner. The clatter of silverware on ceramic, the sizzle of bacon on the griddle, and the incessant murmur of conversation formed a familiar symphony of noise.  

Amelia, all elbows and knees beneath her starched white apron, navigated the narrow aisle between tables with practiced ease. The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee, a comforting aroma that clung to her clothes like a second skin. 

Outside, a relentless summer sun beat down on the asphalt parking lot, baking the worn Ford pickup trucks and faded Cadillacs. Inside, the diner's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a pale glow over the checkered floor tiles and vinyl booths. A lone fly droned lazily above a half-eaten plate of fries, oblivious to the world around it. 

It was a typical Tuesday at The Golden Spoon, Amelia thought, her gaze falling on Mrs. Henderson, a regular who always ordered the same thing: three eggs over easy, toast with butter, and a side of bacon.  Just another day in paradise. Or so she tried to convince herself.
