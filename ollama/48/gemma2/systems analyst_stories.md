The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Harding’s meticulously organized desk. Her fingers danced across the keyboard, eyes glued to the screen displaying lines of code scrolling like an endless river. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the windows of the high-rise office building, drowning out the city's usual symphony of traffic and sirens. 

Amelia, a systems analyst for GlobalTech, was knee-deep in troubleshooting a critical server issue. The company’s online platform was on the verge of crashing, threatening to plunge thousands of clients into digital chaos.  Sweat beaded on her forehead as she navigated through complex algorithms, searching for the source of the anomaly. Time seemed to stretch and warp around her, each keystroke a desperate plea against the impending disaster.

It pulsated with an eerie energy, a digital anomaly that seemed to defy all known logic. A chill ran down her spine. This wasn’t just a server malfunction. Something else was at play.
