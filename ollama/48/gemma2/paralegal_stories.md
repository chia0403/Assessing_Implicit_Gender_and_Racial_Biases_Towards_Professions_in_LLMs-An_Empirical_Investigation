The air in Evelyn Beatrice Blackwood’s cubicle felt thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale ambition.  Sunlight slanted through the blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. It was 7:45 am, ten minutes before her boss, Mr. Thornton, would inevitably bellow his good morning from across the room, followed by a litany of tasks for the day. Evelyn rubbed her temples, trying to banish the persistent headache that had been her unwelcome companion since yesterday’s all-nighter spent meticulously organizing deposition transcripts for their latest high-profile case –  the Peterson v. City of Willow Creek lawsuit, involving allegations of racial profiling and police brutality. 

Evelyn was a paralegal at Blackwood & Thornton, a mid-sized law firm nestled in the heart of Chicago's legal district. The firm, named after her grandfather who’d founded it decades ago, had always been her anchor, a bastion of stability in a life that often felt like it was teetering on the edge. Yet, lately, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that she was drowning – swamped by paperwork, deadlines, and the overwhelming weight of Mr. Thornton’s expectations. 


This case, however, felt different.  The raw emotions poured out in the testimony, the desperate pleas for justice, they had a way of seeping into Evelyn’s soul, leaving her feeling both helpless and profoundly invested. Perhaps that was why she found herself staying late, pouring over documents, searching for the one tiny piece of information that could shift the balance in favor of the Peterson family.
