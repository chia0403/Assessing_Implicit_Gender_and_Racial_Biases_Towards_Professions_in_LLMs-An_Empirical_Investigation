The sun beat down on Beatrice "Bea" Juniper's neck as she knelt beside the enclosure, her calloused hands gently stroking the scaly back of Mr. Squeezy, a particularly grumpy iguana.  The air hung thick with the scent of hay, manure, and something vaguely floral â€“ likely Mrs. Fluffersbottom's prize-winning lilies, which were currently enjoying an uncharacteristic amount of sunshine in their pot by the front door. 

Bea Juniper was the sole caretaker at Willow Creek Animal Sanctuary, a sprawling, ramshackle haven for rescued and retired animals just outside the bustling city of Maplewood.  The sanctuary was Bea's world: a patchwork of overgrown gardens, dusty barns, and makeshift enclosures housing everything from grumpy lizards like Mr. Squeezy to nervous parakeets and one particularly demanding llama named Bartholomew.

Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation ran down Bea's spine, a feeling that something was amiss. It wasn't just the heat; a strange quiet had settled over the usually boisterous sanctuary.  The usual cacophony of barks, chirps, and squeaks seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness.
