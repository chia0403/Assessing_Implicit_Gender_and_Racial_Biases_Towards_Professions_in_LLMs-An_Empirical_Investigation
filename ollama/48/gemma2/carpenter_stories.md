The aroma of sawdust and varnish hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood. His calloused hands moved with practiced ease, smoothing the edges of a delicate mahogany carving, his brow furrowed in concentration. Sunlight streamed through the open windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the golden haze. Outside, the bustling town of Havenwood hummed with life, but within these walls, time seemed to stand still. Elias lived for the rhythm of the hammer and saw, for the satisfaction of transforming rough wood into something beautiful and functional. 

His workshop, a converted barn nestled on the outskirts of town, was his sanctuary, cluttered yet organized in a way only a true craftsman could manage. Tools hung neatly from the walls, their polished surfaces gleaming like jewels. Half-finished projects leaned against every corner, each piece whispering a story waiting to be told.  

But today, the usual peace was disrupted by a frantic knock on the door. Elias paused his work, a flicker of unease passing over his face. 


He set down his carving knife and walked towards the sound, the floorboards groaning beneath his weight. He knew something was amiss.
