The air in the ER was thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. It clung to Amelia "Amy" Claire Hawthorne like a second skin, a constant reminder of the chaos that swirled around her. Tonight, however, it felt particularly potent, a suffocating blanket woven from the frantic whispers of worried families and the metallic tang of blood. 

The waiting room was overflowing with patients -  a fractured leg here, a feverish child there, a man clutching his chest with a look of pure terror. It wasn't just the volume that pressed in on Amy; it was the palpable sense of urgency that pulsed through the air like an electric current. She could feel it in the hurried footsteps of nurses, the clipped commands from doctors, even the trembling hands of those waiting their turn.

Amy adjusted her mask and took a deep breath, trying to center herself amidst the storm.  She needed to be sharp, focused. Lives depended on it. This was the life she'd chosen: navigating the heart-stopping moments of crisis in this bustling city hospital, bringing solace and healing where she could. 


As a physician’s assistant, she wasn’t just another cog in the machine. She was a vital link between doctors and patients, a steady hand amidst the chaos.  She was there to assess, to comfort, to advocate - to make sure every patient felt seen and heard, even in the midst of this overwhelming tide of suffering.
