The stale scent of cinnamon and desperation hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of bleach attempting to mask it. Amelia Rose Davenport, her perfectly manicured nails tapping impatiently against the worn laminate countertop, surveyed the scene before her. This wasn't just any open house. This was 34 Maple Street, a fixer-upper on the cusp of becoming a foreclosure and Amelia's last chance at closing a deal this month.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cracked porch, highlighting the peeling paint and overgrown weeds like gnarled fingers reaching for the sky. Inside, wallpaper threatened to peel off in strips, revealing faded floral patterns beneath, and the once-bright kitchen cabinets were now stained with the ghosts of countless meals gone cold. This house wasn't merely in need of renovation; it was begging for a miracle. 


Amelia took a deep breath, smoothing down her tailored blazer and forcing a smile onto her face. It was time to sell the dream.
