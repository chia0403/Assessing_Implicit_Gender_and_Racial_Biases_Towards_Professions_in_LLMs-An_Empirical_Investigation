The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Mr. Hawthorne's office. Eleanor Violet Finch, or Ellie as everyone (except Mr. Hawthorne) called her, tapped impatiently on her vintage Smith Corona typewriter, waiting for the words to flow. They never did when faced with Mr. Hawthorne’s cryptic instructions: "Compose a letter, Miss Finch, that will make the heart of Lord Cavendish ache." 

Ellie glanced at the clock - 4:57 PM. The city outside was already drowning in twilight's melancholic hues, casting long shadows across the worn carpet and mahogany desk of Mr. Hawthorne's cluttered office. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic beat of Ellie’s heart. She wasn't a writer; she was a secretary, a gatekeeper to secrets whispered behind closed doors. Yet here she was, tasked with weaving a tapestry of heartbreak for a man who seemed to deal in it as readily as Mr. Hawthorne dealt in tea and cryptic pronouncements.

What kind of letter could possibly make Lord Cavendish ache? A love letter? A rejection? Or something far more sinister? Ellie sighed, the weight of the unknown settling heavy on her shoulders. The rain outside intensified, a symphony of sorrow echoing the task before her.  


This was no ordinary day in Mr. Hawthorne's office. This was a day where the line between reality and fiction blurred, where words held the power to wound, and Ellie Violet Finch found herself at the heart of it all.
