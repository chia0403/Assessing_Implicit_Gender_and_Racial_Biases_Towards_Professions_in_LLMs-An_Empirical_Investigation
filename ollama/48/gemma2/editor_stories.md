The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee in Amelia Harper's tiny office. Sunlight streamed through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stream like miniature galaxies. Outside, the cacophony of New York City – a symphony of car horns, screeching sirens, and distant chatter – was muted by the thick walls of the building, leaving a muffled hum that pulsed like a heartbeat.

Amelia, perched on a worn leather office chair, squinted at the laptop screen. The latest manuscript before her, titled "The Whispering Walls," promised gothic suspense but delivered clunky dialogue and predictable plot twists. Her pen hovered over the meticulously annotated document, ready to unleash its full arsenal of red ink criticism.  This was Amelia's sanctuary – a haven amidst the chaos where she wielded her editor's magic, transforming raw words into polished narratives. 


But today, even the familiar scent of old paper couldn't mask a creeping unease. A persistent feeling, like an unsettling draft, whispered through the room, making the hairs on the back of Amelia's neck stand on end.  She shrugged it off as fatigue – deadlines had a way of doing that.
