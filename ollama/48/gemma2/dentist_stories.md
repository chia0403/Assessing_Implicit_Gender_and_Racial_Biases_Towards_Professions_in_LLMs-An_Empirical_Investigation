The scent of antiseptic hung thick in Dr. Eleanor Everly's office, battling for dominance with the faint aroma of chamomile tea wafting from the waiting room. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the quaint town of Willow Creek, painting the dusty street in hues of gold and amber. Inside, Eleanor hummed along to a forgotten 70s pop song as she prepped her instruments, a routine both comforting and mundane. It was another Tuesday, just like any other, until a woman walked through the door, her face etched with worry lines that spoke volumes before a single word was uttered.


Eleanor glanced up from her work, her emerald eyes narrowing slightly in assessment. The woman clutched a worn purse to her chest, her gaze darting nervously around the sterile waiting room. She looked out of place amidst the calming decor â€“ soft pastel walls adorned with framed botanical prints and the gentle tinkling of wind chimes hanging by the window. This wasn't your average Willow Creek patient, Eleanor sensed. 


This was someone who had secrets, and a secret smile might just be all it took to unravel them.
