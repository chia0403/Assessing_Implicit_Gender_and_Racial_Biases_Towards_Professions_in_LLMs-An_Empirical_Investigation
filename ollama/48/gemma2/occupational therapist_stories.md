The smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender hand lotion. Amelia Rose Hawthorne adjusted her stethoscope, its weight familiar against her chest, and peered into the vacant space across from her. A single purple sunflower, wilting slightly, sat perched on a small bedside table, casting a lonely shadow in the sterile white room. 

This was Room 214 at Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center, a place Amelia both loved and dreaded. She loved the quiet determination of her patients, their fight to regain what life had taken from them. But she dreaded the moments when hope flickered and died, leaving behind a residue of sadness that clung to the air like the antiseptic. 

Today, Amelia was meeting with Mr. Thomas Blackwood, a retired history professor whoâ€™d suffered a debilitating stroke three months ago. She wasn't sure if he remembered her visit last week. His eyes had been glazed over then, his pupils unfocused. But she kept returning, clinging to the belief that beneath the fog, the brilliant mind still existed, waiting for the right key to unlock it.  


Amelia took a deep breath and smiled gently. "Mr. Blackwood?" she asked softly, hoping her voice wouldn't shatter the fragile calm of the room.
