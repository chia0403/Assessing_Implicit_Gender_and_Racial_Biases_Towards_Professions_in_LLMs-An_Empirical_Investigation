Outside, the city blurred into a chaotic montage of neon reflections and churning water. Buildings loomed like shadowy giants, their windows dark eyes staring down at the raging tempest. The air crackled with electricity, a tangible manifestation of the impending danger that gnawed at Amy’s gut. This was more than just a storm; it was a battle against nature's wrath.
