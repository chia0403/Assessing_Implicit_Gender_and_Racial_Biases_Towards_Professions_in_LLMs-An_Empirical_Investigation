The humid Louisiana air hung thick as jasmine perfume and regret in Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois's tiny salon on Rue Dauphine.  Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof, each drop a miniature drumbeat to the melancholic rhythm of Edith Piaf wafting from the battered speakers. Esme, her dark braids pulled back tight, meticulously applied a layer of crimson lipstick to Madame Delacroix's bouffant, a towering monument to defiance against the encroaching storm and, perhaps, life itself. The salon, "Esme's Elixir," was as much a sanctuary for its patrons as it was a haven from the swirling chaos outside. Within its brightly painted walls, anxieties faded into whispers under Esme's practiced touch, replaced by fleeting moments of self-assuredness. But even within this oasis, storm clouds were gathering. 


Esme glanced at the rain-streaked window, her heart mirroring the tempestuous sky. News had arrived that morning: Madame Dubois, her beloved grandmother and the salon's namesake, was being admitted to the hospital.  The weight of worry settled on Esme's shoulders, a familiar burden she'd carried since inheriting the salon three years ago. This time, however, it felt heavier, more ominous. The storm outside seemed to be mirroring the one brewing within her.
