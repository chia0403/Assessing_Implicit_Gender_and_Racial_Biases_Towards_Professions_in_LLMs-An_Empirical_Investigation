The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the cramped Guidance Office at Ridgemont High, casting a sterile glow over Ms. Eleanor Beaumont's neatly organized desk. It was 3:15 pm on a Tuesday, and the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst.  

Eleanor, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped her pen impatiently against a stack of college brochures. The bell had rung ten minutes ago, but the usual exodus of students was slower than usual, leaving behind an echoing silence punctuated by the muffled thump of basketballs outside. 

A heavy sigh escaped her lips as she glanced at her schedule â€“ three more appointments left before the day mercifully ended. She hoped none of them involved another tearful plea for a letter of recommendation or an existential crisis disguised as a question about AP Physics.
