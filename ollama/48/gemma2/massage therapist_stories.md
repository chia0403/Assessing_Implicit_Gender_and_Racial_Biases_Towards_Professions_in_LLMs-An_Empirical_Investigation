The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of sandalwood incense. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains, dappling the worn wooden floorboards of Serenity Spa.  Elara Nightingale, her fingers nimbly kneading knots out of Mrs. Petersonâ€™s tense shoulders, listened to the rhythmic sigh of her client's breathing. The afternoon lull was a welcome respite from the usual flurry of appointments. Elara took a moment to close her eyes, savoring the quiet hum of contentment that vibrated through the spa.  Her own tension, a familiar ache in her lower back from years of bending and stretching, eased slightly with each deep inhale. 

But the tranquility was shattered by the insistent buzzing of her phone on the reception table. She excused herself, smoothing down her teal linen tunic, and picked up the call. It was her brother, Liam, his voice tight with worry. "Elara," he said, "there's something you need to see."
