The flickering neon sign of the 'Pink Flamingo' cast an unsettling glow across Detective Evelyn "Eve" Thorne’s face as she stepped out of her unmarked car. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already hazy line between reality and the sleazy underbelly of this part of town. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, desperation, and something else – a metallic tang that Eve immediately recognized as blood.

The Pink Flamingo was infamous. A dive bar catering to the city's forgotten souls – struggling artists, burnt-out musicians, and those who simply couldn't afford the rent in better neighborhoods. Tonight, it had become a crime scene.  


Eve pushed open the door, its rusty hinges groaning like an old man complaining about the weather. Inside, the bar was a tableau of chaos: overturned chairs, shattered bottles littering the sticky floor, and patrons huddled together, their faces etched with fear. A lone figure lay sprawled by the bar, his pale skin illuminated by the flickering neon lights.  Eve knew, without even getting closer, that this was no ordinary drunkard passed out after one too many shots. This man was dead.
