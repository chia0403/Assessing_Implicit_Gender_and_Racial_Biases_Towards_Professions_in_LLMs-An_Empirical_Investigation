The worn leather armchair creaked in protest as Eleanor "Ellie" Vance adjusted its angle, her hazel eyes scanning the room. Rain hammered against the windows of her small, ground-floor office, casting long, dancing shadows across the floral wallpaper that she swore clashed horribly with the minimalist decor. The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine tea and damp earth, a comforting blend familiar to Ellie after five years in this quaint corner of Brooklyn.

She watched as Daniel Miller shuffled into her office, his shoulders hunched like he carried the weight of the world on them. He was young, barely out of college, his face pale and etched with worry lines that seemed too deep for someone so fresh-faced. Ellie had a sixth sense for these things; the way his eyes darted around the room, refusing to meet hers, spoke volumes about the storm brewing within him. This wasn't just another case of student stress, there was something deeper, darker churning beneath the surface.  

Ellie cleared her throat, forcing a smile that felt both genuine and practiced. "Daniel, it's good to see you," she said, her voice a warm balm in the tense silence. "Please, have a seat."


As Daniel slumped into the opposite chair, Ellie knew this wouldn't be just another session. This was a chance for her to delve deeper, unravel the tangled threads of his pain and help him find his way back to the light.
