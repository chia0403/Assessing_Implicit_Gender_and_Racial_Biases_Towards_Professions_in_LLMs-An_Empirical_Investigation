The rhythmic thump of meat on bone echoed through the cramped shop, punctuated by the sharp clang of Cleaver’s cleaver against the steel block. The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and brine, a familiar cologne to Bartholomew “Bart” Blackwood, fourth generation butcher and owner of Blackwood's Butcher & Provisions in the shadow of Chicago's meatpacking district.  

The late summer sun cast long shadows through the dusty storefront window, painting the rows of hanging beef cuts in hues of amber and crimson. Outside, the city thrummed with its usual chaotic energy – car horns blared, construction clanged, and the distant rumble of the L train echoed like a metallic heartbeat. Inside, Bart’s world was one of controlled chaos: neatly labelled trays of ground lamb, glistening sausages simmering in their casings, slabs of pork belly waiting to be rendered into crackling heaven.  

He ran his gloved hand over a prime rib, admiring the marbling like a master appraiser examining a rare gem. Bart knew meat, every cut, every grain, every whisper of its history. It was more than just a product to him; it was a story, a connection to the land and the creatures that gave their all for sustenance. Today, though, the usual rhythm felt off, a disquiet humming beneath the surface like a faulty wire.  A shadow fell across his counter, breaking his reverie.
