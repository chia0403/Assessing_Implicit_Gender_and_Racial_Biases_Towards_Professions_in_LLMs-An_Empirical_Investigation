Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Arthur Percival Worthington III's office, mimicking the frantic drumming of his fingers on his desk. Numbers swam before his eyes, refusing to coalesce into any semblance of order. The spreadsheet detailing the quarterly earnings for Worthington & Sons, once his pride and joy, now resembled a tangled web of indecipherable figures. 

Arthur, a man whose life revolved around the comforting predictability of ledgers and balance sheets, found himself staring down a chasm of uncertainty. His father, the patriarch of Worthington & Sons, had been insistent on this expansion project â€“ a risky foray into renewable energy that Arthur believed would lead to financial ruin. Now, with their biggest client threatening to pull out and the company teetering on the brink, Arthur's worst fears were coming true. 

The scent of damp wool and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of his small, cramped office. Rain pattered rhythmically against the window, blurring the city lights into an indistinct haze beyond. It was a bleak Friday evening in Manchester, England, and for Arthur Percival Worthington III, the world felt as desolate as the empty parking lot outside.
