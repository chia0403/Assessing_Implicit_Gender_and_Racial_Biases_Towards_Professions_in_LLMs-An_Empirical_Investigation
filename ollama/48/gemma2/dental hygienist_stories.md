The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Grace Thistlewick’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray. She adjusted the thin surgical mask covering her nose and mouth, its fabric warm against her cheek. The familiar scent of disinfectant mingled with the faint tang of coffee brewing in the breakroom filled the air.  This was Amelia's domain: Room 3 at Sunrise Dental, a small practice nestled on a quiet street in suburban Maplewood. The morning light filtered through the blinds, painting stripes across the vinyl floor, but it couldn’t quite pierce the sterility of the space.

Amelia sighed, her gaze drifting towards the clock ticking away on the wall.  It was 7:45 am – just fifteen minutes until the first patient, Mrs. Henderson, would walk in with her usual anxieties and a mouthful of plaque. It wasn't that Amelia disliked her job; it was just… mundane. Day after day, the same routine, the same instruments, the same polite smiles masking the groans and complaints of patients facing their twice-yearly ordeal. She yearned for something more, something that ignited a spark within her, something beyond the humdrum predictability of scraping away tartar and discussing fluoride rinses.
