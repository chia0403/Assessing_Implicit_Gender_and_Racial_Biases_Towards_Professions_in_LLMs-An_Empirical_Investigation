The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a second skin as she stepped out of her car. Spanish moss swayed in the gentle breeze, casting ghostly shadows over the rows of blooming azaleas lining the driveway. The aroma of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass mingled with the salty tang of the ocean just miles away.  

This was Amelia's sanctuary: her grandfather's rambling Victorian house nestled on a sprawling piece of land overlooking Tybee Island. It wasn't just the picturesque setting that she cherished; it was the memories woven into every creaking floorboard and sun-bleached windowpane. Memories of laughter echoing through the halls, the scent of her grandmother's pecan pie baking in the old oven, and the comforting weight of her grandfather's hand on hers during childhood storms. 


Now, Amy had traded city life for this quiet coastal haven. It was a homecoming of sorts, a return to her roots after years spent honing her skills as a physical therapist in Atlanta. But it wasn't just a change of scenery; it was an opportunity to build something new, something meaningful, with the small but vibrant community that called Tybee Island home.
