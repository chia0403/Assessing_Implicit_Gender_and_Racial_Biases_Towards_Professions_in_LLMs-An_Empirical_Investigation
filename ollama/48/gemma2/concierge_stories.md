The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel hung thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. A single, discordant clang echoed from the kitchen below, followed by a muffled curse. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, or "Miss Hawthorn" as she preferred, straightened her lavender uniform blouse and adjusted the silver name pin nestled against her starched collar. 

Her position as Head Concierge wasn't just a job; it was an institution. Generations of Blackwood guests had come to rely on Miss Hawthorn's encyclopedic knowledge of London, her unerring ability to procure anything from a specific vintage port to last-minute tickets to the opera, and her unflappable demeanor even when faced with demanding billionaires or heartbroken lovers.  

This evening, however, the familiar hum of the Grand Blackwood felt different. A subtle tension pulsed beneath the surface, like an approaching storm. Miss Hawthorn glanced at the gilded clock ticking on the wall â€“ 7:02 pm. She hadn't received the usual pre-dinner briefing from her underling, young Edgar, and a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  


Something was amiss.
