The antique grandfather clock in the hall chimed six times, its resonant tones echoing through the cavernous Victorian mansion. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, her sensible shoes whispering on the polished oak floor, paused to straighten a vase overflowing with lilies. The scent was overpowering, cloying even, but Mrs. Van Derlyn insisted on fresh blooms daily. Amelia sighed, subtly shifting a lily that drooped precariously close to the edge of the table. 

The mansion, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the Atlantic, felt more like a museum than a home. Every surface gleamed with polish, every thread carefully in place. It was a testament to Mrs. Van Derlyn's obsessive need for order, and Ameliaâ€™s tireless efforts to maintain it. 


Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Amelia surveyed her domain: the grand staircase draped with an ornate rug, the intricate tapestries adorning the walls, and the antique furniture that looked more suited for display than use. She longed for a life outside these gilded cages, but for now, she was tethered to this world of hushed reverence and pristine perfection.
