The first rays of dawn sliced through the gaps in Elias Blackwood's weathered barn, painting stripes of gold across his calloused hands as he bent over the seed potatoes. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the promise of another long day on Blackwood Farms. 

Elias, a man etched by the sun and solitude of the sprawling Kentucky fields, felt the familiar ache in his back from years spent hauling hay and plowing furrows. His weathered face, creased with laughter lines and worry wrinkles, bore the weight of responsibility for the land that had been in his family for generations.  But today, there was a new kind of tension in his shoulders, a knot of anxiety tightening with every rustle of the wind through the cornstalks. 


The harvest was only weeks away, and the drought had lingered longer than anyone could remember. The creek that once snaked lazily through his fields had dwindled to a muddy trickle, and the crops stood thirsty and brittle in the unrelenting summer sun. Elias knew that if rain didn't come soon, Blackwood Farms might not survive.
