The air in Jasper Thorne's workshop hung thick with the scent of dust and sandstone, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylights, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature constellations. Outside, the bustling market square of Ebonhollow thrummed with life - vendors hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons, the occasional mournful cry of a bard's lute weaving through the din. But within Jasper Thorne's sanctuary, time seemed to move at a different pace, governed by the patient hand of the craftsman and the stubborn nature of the stone. 

Jasper, his calloused hands stained with ochre from the pigments he used to bring life to his sculptures, meticulously chipped away at a slab of alabaster. He was carving an angel, its wings outstretched in a silent prayer, for the grand cathedral looming over Ebonhollow's cobblestone streets. A commission such as this held prestige and brought a good sum, but it also weighed heavy on Jasper's soul. Each chisel stroke felt like a whispered plea against the encroaching darkness he sensed gathering around his city. 


Ebonhollow was once known for its vibrant art scene, its artists celebrated throughout the kingdom. Now, fear had seeped into every corner, stifling creativity and leaving a chill in the air that even the summer sun struggled to dispel. Jasper hoped that his angel, with its serene expression and outstretched wings, could be a beacon of hope in these troubled times, a reminder of the beauty that still existed in a world teetering on the brink of despair.
