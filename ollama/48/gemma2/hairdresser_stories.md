The bell above the door chimed its melancholic melody as Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Davenport slipped out into the cool night air.  A fine mist clung to the cobblestones, blurring the gaslight glow that painted the narrow Edinburgh street in shades of amber and shadow.  

The salon, nestled between a second-hand bookshop overflowing with dusty tomes and a bakery where the aroma of freshly baked bread hung heavy in the air, was quiet now. The last client had left an hour ago, taking with her the usual blend of gossip and hopes for a good week. Amy leaned against the shop window, watching the few late-night stragglers navigate the slick streets.

Her heart felt as heavy as the iron curling tongs she used to tame unruly curls. It had been a long day, filled with the mundane chatter of her clientele and the ever-present hum of dissatisfaction that seemed to follow her like a shadow.  She longed for something more, some spark of excitement in this predictable routine. 


This feeling was amplified tonight. The silence after the last client left felt particularly profound, echoing the emptiness she felt within.
