Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office, each drop a tiny hammer against the glass. The city outside was swallowed by a grey, churning fog, its neon lights barely piercing the gloom. Inside, the waiting room was eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic ticking of an antique clock on the wall. A single lamp cast long shadows across worn armchairs and the faded floral wallpaper. Amelia sat behind her desk, the warm glow of her computer screen illuminating her focused face. 

She tapped at the keyboard, reviewing patient files before her evening shift at Mercy General Hospital. Tonight was a full moon, and with it came an unsettling feeling in her gut, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the storm raging outside. 


Amelia Hawthorne wasn't just any doctor. She was a specialist in rare diseases, one who often found herself treating patients with ailments that defied conventional medicine.  She believed in the power of science, but lately, she couldn't shake off the feeling that there were things beyond her understanding, whispers of ancient mysteries lurking at the edge of her world.  Tonight, those whispers seemed to be growing louder.
