The stale air of the probation office hung heavy with anticipation, thick as the humidity clinging to the August morning in Savannah, Georgia. Amelia "Amy" Rosewater, her nameplate glinting under the fluorescent lights, tapped her pen impatiently against the worn oak desk. The rhythmic click-clack echoed through the otherwise silent room, punctuated only by the faint whir of the air conditioner struggling to combat the oppressive heat.

Amy glanced at the clock – 8:57 am.  Her first meeting of the day was scheduled for 9:00 sharp with a young man named Jasper Hayes, a repeat offender who had just been released from prison after serving time for petty theft. He'd violated his parole multiple times before, and Amy knew this appointment could go one of two ways – a successful restart or another descent into the cycle of crime that seemed to define his life.  

Outside, the humid air thrummed with the lazy buzz of cicadas, a persistent soundtrack to the city's languid summer rhythm. But inside the office walls, Amy felt a knot of tension tightening in her chest. The fate of Jasper Hayes, and possibly many others like him, rested on this meeting.  She took a deep breath, straightened her glasses, and smoothed down her crisp white blouse, preparing herself for the day ahead.
