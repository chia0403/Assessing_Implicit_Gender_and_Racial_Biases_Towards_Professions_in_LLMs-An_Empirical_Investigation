The air in New Orleans hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine as Elara Blackwood surveyed her latest project. The old Creole townhouse, perched precariously on Royal Street, groaned under the weight of centuries. Peeling paint revealed faded ochre beneath, and Spanish moss draped from balconies like ghostly veils.  Sunlight slanted through gaps in the tattered awnings, casting long shadows across crumbling brickwork.

Elara, a petite woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid, adjusted her glasses and frowned. This wasn't just another restoration project. This was a puzzle box, its secrets whispered in the rustling of the wind through the wrought iron railings and the echoing sighs of forgotten memories within its walls.  It belonged to a reclusive art collector named Henri Dubois, a man whose eccentricities were as legendary as his collection. He'd tasked Elara with bringing the house back to its former glory, a request that came with an unnerving caveat: "Let no stone be left unturned."

Elara felt a shiver run down her spine. What secrets did this house hold? And would she be brave enough to unearth them?
