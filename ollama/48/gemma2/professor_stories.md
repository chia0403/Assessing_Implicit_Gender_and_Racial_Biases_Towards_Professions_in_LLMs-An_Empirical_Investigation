Professor Elara Vance adjusted her spectacles, peering over them at the chaotic scene unfolding before her. Papers were strewn across the worn oak table in her office like autumn leaves caught in a whirlwind. Coffee mugs – some empty, others containing suspiciously brown liquids – occupied every available inch of surface space. A half-eaten bagel rested precariously on top of an overflowing stack of books. 

It was 3:17 am, and Elara was knee-deep in research for her upcoming lecture on the elusive nature of time in quantum physics. The silence of the deserted university campus pressed in around her, punctuated only by the rhythmic tapping of her fingers against the keyboard as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn equation.  

Elara, however, felt strangely energized, her mind buzzing with possibilities.  The air crackled with an almost palpable anticipation – something was about to happen, she just couldn’t quite place it. A shiver ran down her spine, and she glanced at the antique clock on her wall. 3:18 am. It chimed once, a deep, resonant note that seemed to vibrate through the very foundation of her being. And then, silence.  


The story took place in the secluded Physics Department of Blackwood University, an institution steeped in tradition and whispered rumours of hidden knowledge. Its Gothic architecture cast long shadows across the campus, creating an atmosphere both alluring and unsettling.
