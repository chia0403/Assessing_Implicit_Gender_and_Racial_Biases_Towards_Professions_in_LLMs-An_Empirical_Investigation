The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth as Alistair "Ali" Hawthorne meticulously lined up the rows of petunias flanking the rose garden. The morning sun, just cresting over the rolling hills that bordered Elmwood Manor, cast long shadows across his weathered hands, turning them into gnarled silhouettes against the vibrant blooms. 

Elmwood Manor wasn't grand, but it held a quiet majesty, its ivy-covered walls whispering stories of generations past. Ali knew every inch of its sprawling grounds: the hidden nooks where squirrels stashed their nuts, the ancient oak that creaked secrets in the wind, the forgotten pathways leading to moss-covered statues. He was the guardian of this green sanctuary, a silent sentinel ensuring its beauty endured.


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along his spine, as though unseen eyes were watching him from the depths of the sprawling rose bushes. The silence, usually comforting, now felt oppressive, broken only by the rhythmic chirp of crickets and the distant call of a crow. Ali paused, his trowel frozen in mid-air, feeling an inexplicable sense that something was about to change.
