The humid Georgia air clung to Silas Montgomery like a second skin as he wrestled the heavy junction box into place.  Sweat dripped down his temple, mixing with the grease that already smeared across his forehead. The aroma of fried chicken and sweet tea drifted from Mrs. Henderson’s porch across the street, doing little to quell his hunger pangs. He'd been at this old Victorian house for hours, battling faulty wiring and a stubborn ghost light flickering in the attic.  The sun was sinking towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the overgrown lawn. This wasn't just any job – it belonged to Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman who’d raised Silas since he was a boy after his parents died. 

"Silas Montgomery," she'd said, her voice trembling with emotion, "this house has seen good times and bad times. But it needs fixing.  It needs you."


**Setting:** A dilapidated Victorian mansion on the outskirts of a small Southern town in Georgia. Late afternoon, with the summer heat still heavy in the air.
