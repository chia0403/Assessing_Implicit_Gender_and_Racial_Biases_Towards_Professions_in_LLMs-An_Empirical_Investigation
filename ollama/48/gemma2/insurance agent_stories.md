The humidity hung heavy in the air, thick as molasses and smelling faintly of burnt sugar. The cicadas thrummed their incessant song, a relentless soundtrack to another sweltering afternoon in Meridian, Mississippi. Inside his cramped office on Main Street, Elias Bartholomew “Eli” Thornton swatted at a fly buzzing near his flickering desk lamp.  

Eli wasn’t cut out for the Southern heat. His pale skin always seemed on the verge of turning lobster red, and his perpetual frown deepened with every bead of sweat that trickled down his temple. He longed for the crisp air and muted grays of Boston, where he’d spent his formative years before his grandmother's failing health forced him back to his hometown. 

He stared at the insurance policy in front of him - a labyrinth of legal jargon and fine print detailing the perils of a leaky roof and faulty wiring. Eli wasn't sure how anyone made sense of it, let alone sold it. He felt like an alchemist trying to turn lead into gold, except instead of treasure, he was left with mountains of paperwork and dissatisfied clients.   


The phone on his desk buzzed, breaking him from his reverie. It was probably another irate homeowner complaining about their deductible, Eli thought with a sigh.  He picked up the receiver, bracing himself for the inevitable onslaught.

"Bartholomew Insurance," he said, his voice flat and weary.
