The rain hammered against the stained glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop a tiny explosion of sound in the hushed room.  Eleanor herself sat behind her mahogany desk, its surface slick with a sheen from the countless cups of herbal tea she’d drained during her long day. The city outside, normally a symphony of honking horns and chattering pedestrians, was subdued tonight, muffled by the relentless downpour. 

Eleanor was alone in her office, waiting for her last patient of the evening, a young woman named Anya whose case had been particularly troubling.  Anya suffered from severe anxiety attacks, triggered by seemingly random noises – a cough in the street, the chirp of a bird, even the rustling of leaves outside her window. Eleanor had tried every technique she knew, but nothing seemed to work.

The silence was broken only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick another beat in the mounting anxiety that gnawed at Eleanor’s own calm facade.  Her eyes drifted to a framed photograph on her desk, a picture of her younger self laughing with her family – a stark contrast to the weary solitude of this moment.


The bell above the door jingled, pulling Eleanor back to the present.
