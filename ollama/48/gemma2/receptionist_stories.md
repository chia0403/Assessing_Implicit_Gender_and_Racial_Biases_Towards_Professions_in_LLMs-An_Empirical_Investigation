The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees, their buzzing a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her manicured nails against the worn surface of the reception desk. 

Amelia's world was confined to the sterile confines of Dr. Emerson's office. Walls painted in shades of antiseptic green and beige held up framed diplomas that Amelia could recite by heart: Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins – all impressive institutions, yet offering no solace from the monotonous routine of her workday.  She took pride in her duties, however. The phone rang precisely at 8:30 every morning, announcing the start of another day, and she answered it with a practiced smile that masked the existential fatigue settling deep within her bones. 

The waiting room was filled with the usual assortment of patients – some nervous, some bored, all holding their breath in anticipation of whatever wisdom Dr. Emerson might impart. Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Amelia's spine, a sensation she couldn't quite place. It wasn’t just the strange man who had just entered, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and trench coat, or the way he seemed to look directly at her with unnervingly intense eyes. No, it was something deeper, a sense that the mundane order of her world was about to be irrevocably shattered.
