The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, battling with the ever-present aroma of animal fur and hay that permeated Dr. Eleanor Amelia Vance's world. Her small clinic, nestled on the outskirts of Willow Creek, was a chaotic symphony of whimpers, barks, meows, and the clattering of tools. Outside, the late summer sun cast long shadows across the dusty road, but inside, the fluorescent lights hummed, illuminating the worn linoleum floor and the familiar clutter of cages and examination tables. Eleanor, her hair pulled back in a tight bun, moved with practiced efficiency, checking the bandage on a ginger cat's leg before turning to face a worried farmer holding a limp rabbit. 

Willow Creek was a sleepy town, content in its rural rhythms, and Eleanor’s clinic was its beating heart. She knew every resident, both human and animal, by name. But today, something felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach as she glanced at the clock – almost noon, and yet no familiar faces had walked through the door. 


Eleanor shook off the feeling. It was probably just a slow Tuesday. She focused on calming the farmer’s anxieties, her own worries momentarily forgotten. After all, there were always animals needing her care, and in Willow Creek, that meant taking care of their humans too.
