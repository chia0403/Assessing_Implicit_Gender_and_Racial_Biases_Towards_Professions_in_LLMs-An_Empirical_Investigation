The humid air hung thick in the operating room like a shroud. The scent of antiseptic mingled with a faint but persistent aroma of coffee brewing somewhere in the distance – Amelia Harding could never quite pinpoint its source, even after eight years working at Mercy General. It was as much a part of the sterile symphony as the hum of the life-support machine and the steady thrum of the surgical instruments. 

Amelia, a physician's assistant with hands that moved almost with grace despite their inherent strength, adjusted her mask again.  The room was abuzz with the hushed energy of a pre-op check: nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, all in silent concert as they prepared for the procedure. Amelia wasn’t quite sure how to feel about this symphony – she felt more like an observer than an active participant. The weight of the scalpel, so familiar yet foreign at the same time, pressed against her palm when she looked at Dr. Davies, his sharp gaze lingering on hers before he finally nodded, a silent agreement with Amelia’s quiet observation.

The patient's name was whispered:  Mr. Patel, a man in his late fifties battling a heart condition that had plagued him for years. Today, they would attempt a complex bypass procedure – a gamble against the clock and time itself.
