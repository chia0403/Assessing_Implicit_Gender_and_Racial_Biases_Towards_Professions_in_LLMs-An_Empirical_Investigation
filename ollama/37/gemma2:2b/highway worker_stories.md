The desert wind whipped across Caleb "Cal" Montgomery's worn face as he straightened his steel-toed boots. The asphalt ribbon stretched before him like a scar on the earth, reflecting the harsh glare of the midday sun.  He adjusted his battered cap and looked up at the imposing black wall of the Nevada mountains that marked the horizon, their rugged peaks shrouded in an unnatural haze. Dust devils danced erratically across the endless expanse of red sand, mocking the monotony of this isolated stretch of Interstate 15. Cal squinted, scanning the desolate landscape for any sign of trouble – a stray tire, a flashing light, even just a fleeting flicker of color in the distance. He was used to solitude. In his line of work, there were days when the world felt as vast and empty as the desert itself. 

Cal had been working on this stretch of highway for three years now, ever since his father’s death left him carrying the weight of responsibility. It wasn't a glamorous career, but it was his life. And today, he was due to meet up with Frank at the next rest stop, a man whose gruff demeanor and stoic silence were only rivaled by the miles that separated them.
