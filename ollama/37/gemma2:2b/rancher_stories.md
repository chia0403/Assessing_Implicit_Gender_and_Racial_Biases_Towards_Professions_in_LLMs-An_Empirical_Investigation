Dust devils danced across the parched fields, their swirling skirts raising plumes of white against the unrelenting blue sky. The air itself felt brittle, crackling with an unseen tension that clung to the back of Elara Blackwood's throat like a hawk's claw.  She stood on the porch of her weathered ranch house, its wooden bones creaking in the dry wind. Below, her herd of cattle grazed listlessly under the relentless sun, their once-proud eyes now dulled with fatigue. A lone windmill groaned its weary tune, offering scant respite from the suffocating heat.

Elara Blackwood wasn't just a rancher; she was the daughter of the land, her legacy woven into the very fabric of this desolate stretch of Wyoming. But something felt off tonight. The usual symphony of creaks and groans from the ranch seemed amplified, each rustle in the leaves, each crackle of the wind, carrying an undercurrent of unease. It wasn't just the heat; it was the way the sky seemed to watch her, its azure depths holding a hidden flicker of something unsettling.
