Rain lashed against the windows of the quaint cottage, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Thorne's chest.  She was staring down at the patient chart in her hands, its pages filled with a symphony of medical jargon and diagnoses that did little to soothe her own anxieties. The name on the chart, "Mr. Henry Evans," felt like another layer to the emotional wall she had built around herself. This was her first real case as an occupational therapist, and she found herself struggling with the weight of responsibility in a way nothing else had prepared her for. 

The cottage itself, nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, was anything but sterile.  It was brimming with character - warm light filtered through dusty windows, wooden beams creaked gently, and floral prints adorned the faded wallpaper. Yet, even in this cozy haven, Amelia felt a sense of displacement. She’d envisioned this transition into independent practice as an opportunity to connect with clients on a deeper level, to help them reclaim their lives after trauma, but instead, she found herself grappling with the mundane, the logistical, and the painfully human aspects of every single interaction. 

The rain had started earlier that day, and Amelia couldn't remember the last time she’d enjoyed its comforting rhythm against the windowpanes. As Mr. Evans sat in the corner chair, his hands wrapped tightly around a worn, leather-bound book, she wondered if her storm was merely a reflection of the one brewing inside him, or perhaps even something deeper.
