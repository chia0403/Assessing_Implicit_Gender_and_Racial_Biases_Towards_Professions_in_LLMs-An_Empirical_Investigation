Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Blackwood Manor, mirroring the chaos within the grand mansion's walls. Amelia Thorne, her callused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of cocoa, surveyed the scene with weary eyes. Dust motes danced in the dying afternoon sunlight that sliced through the heavy curtains, illuminating the wreckage left behind by Lady Evelyn’s latest outburst.  The once pristine silver tea set was scattered across the floor like discarded confetti; a shattered vase lay on its side beside a crumpled dress. 

Amelia, known throughout the manor as “Auntie Millie”, had worked at Blackwood Manor for twenty years. She'd seen it all: Lady Evelyn's temper tantrums, the endless stream of suitors vying for her hand, and the slow descent into madness that haunted the once vibrant mansion. Tonight, however, something felt different. A sense of unease settled over Amelia, like a cold fog swirling in the grand ballroom. It was almost as if Lady Evelyn's fury had become an unwelcome guest, clinging to the air with a growing menace, waiting for its moment.

The house is a reflection of its inhabitant, filled with lavish decor, intricate carvings, and portraits that seem to watch you with their cold eyes.  The manor's isolation is punctuated by only the howling winds and crashing waves, whispering secrets long buried within the walls.
