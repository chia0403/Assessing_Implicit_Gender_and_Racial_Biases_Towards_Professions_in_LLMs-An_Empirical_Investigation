The air hung thick with dust and the scent of sharp granite as Elias Thorne, son of the famed stonemasons of Greyhaven, knelt on the cobblestones, his calloused fingers tracing the intricate grooves of a weathered stone. The sun, sinking behind the snow-capped peaks of the Northern Mountains, cast long, ethereal shadows across the workshop.  He’d been meticulously shaping the block for weeks now, drawing inspiration from the ancient Celtic carvings that echoed in the very heart of Greyhaven's history. He was working on a statue of a forgotten hero - The Wolf King, who had led his tribe through a blizzard and secured their future against an encroaching threat. 

Greyhaven. A city built not for the faint of heart or the overly soft of spirit. Here, stone spoke its own language, stories etched into its very being. Elias's hands knew how to translate that language; he was born into it, raised in its embrace. He saw a piece of Greyhaven's soul in every blade of rock and grit. 

His gaze lingered on the statue’s face, still unpolished and raw. His father would say it needed more life. Elias just wanted to see his creation bloom like the flowers he carved into his evenings. But today, there was a whisper of something different – an ache in his heart that went beyond the callus on his hands. A feeling he couldn't quite define.
