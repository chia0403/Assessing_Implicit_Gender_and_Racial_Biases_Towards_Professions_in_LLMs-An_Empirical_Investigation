The morning mist hung heavy over Willow Creek like a damp shroud, clinging to the gnarled branches of the ancient oak that marked the border between Mrs. Hemlock's property and the neighboring estate. This was precisely where William "Will" Finch, proprietor of "Finch's Finer Greens," found himself at his usual pre-dawn routine: coffee in hand, surveying his worksite like a general inspecting his troops. 

Willow Creek wasn’t much of a place for the average joe; it was a community steeped in an almost tangible tension between its quaint charm and the simmering undercurrent of wealth disparity.  Just beyond the oak, Mrs. Hemlock's sprawling Victorian mansion stood proud, a stark monument to the privilege she wielded over the local populace. Will knew this well; he’d had his fair share of arguments with Mr. Hemlock regarding the proper shade for the rose bushes in Mrs. Hemlock's manicured garden – an argument that always ended up the same: a mutual agreement on the importance of maintaining the visual harmony of the community, even if it meant Will’s own opinion got lost in the maelstrom of her impeccable standards. 


This morning, though, was different. There was a certain tension in the air, one that Will couldn't quite place until he noticed Mrs. Hemlock herself standing on the porch steps, watching him with an unnervingly piercing gaze.  The air hummed with something more than the usual pre-dawn chill. 


He knew he should turn and run, find some solace in a cup of coffee alone, but his heart beat in his chest like a trapped bird as he looked upon her stoic face.
