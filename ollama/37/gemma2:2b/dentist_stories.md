##  The Bite that Changed Everything 

**Setting:** The bustling city of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 1930s. Steam curls from the gas lamps lining Royal Street as tourists and locals alike mill about, weaving through the lively atmosphere. A salty breeze whips off the Mississippi River, carrying the scent of beignets and jazz music.

**Main character:** Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Delacroix, a woman whose sharp wit matched her expertly honed dental tools.  A native of New Orleans, Eve had always felt most comfortable in the hushed calm of her dentist's chair, surrounded by the symphony of grinding gears and whispered anxieties. Her practice was a haven of order and precision - far removed from the chaotic energy of the city outside. 

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick with anticipation. Dr. Delacroix, usually an adept observer of human emotion, found her gaze fixed on the man before her. A palpable tension had descended upon his once jovial face; it etched lines in his jaw and made his eyes dart nervously across the room as if trying to outrun a shadow. "Tell me," Eve said, her voice as gentle as chipped porcelain yet laced with an unspoken challenge, "what brings you here today, Mr. Dupont?"

Mr. Dupont swallowed hard, a nervous habit that mirrored the rapid beating of his heart. He mumbled something about a toothache, but the tremor in his hands betrayed his true intentions.  Eveâ€™s practiced smile faltered for just a moment. The bite mark on Mr. Dupont's arm wasn't caused by a rogue squirrel; it was something else entirely. Eve had seen this kind of scar before, not here in New Orleans, not in the old country where she'd grown up.  This...this was a mark from another world.
