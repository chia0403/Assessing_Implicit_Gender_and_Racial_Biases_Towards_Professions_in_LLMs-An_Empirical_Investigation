The smell of sawdust and fresh pine clung to Thomas Blackwood like an old friend. He stood before his latest project - a meticulously detailed replica of a 17th-century French chateau in miniature form, destined for a museum display in the bustling city of Paris.  His workshop, nestled on a quiet cobblestoned lane just beyond the ancient walls of the city, was a symphony of clanging tools and rhythmic sawing, a testament to his craft that echoed through the twilight hours. 

Thomas's calloused hands, roughened from years of working wood, worked with a precision born of generations of carvers before him.  His eyes, though weathered by time and toil, held an unwavering spark of artistic passion as he examined the delicate carvings on the miniature tower.   Tonight, however, something was different. A strange unease settled over him like a shadow. The moon hung low in the sky, casting long, distorted shadows across his workshop. He glanced at the clock â€“ the hour had grown late. And a faint wind whispered through the eaves of his tiny dwelling, carrying with it an almost unbearable chill.
