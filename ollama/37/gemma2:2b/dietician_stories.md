##  The Weight of Words

**Setting:** The bustling, sun-drenched city market district of Prague.  A cacophony of languages greets you as you walk down cobbled streets, past vendors hawking fresh produce and aromatic spices, the scent of freshly baked bread mingling with the salty tang of fishmongers' stalls. 

**Character:** Evelyn Thorne, a dietician with a reputation for her unorthodox methods and unwavering belief in food's power to heal, is struggling to find her footing in Prague. Having fled her life in England after the breakdown of her marriage, she's found herself on the verge of opening a tiny clinic nestled amidst the vibrant chaos of the city market. 

**Opening:** "It’s like they’re playing hide-and-seek with their cravings," Evelyn muttered to herself, sifting through a pile of meticulously weighed ingredients for her new smoothie blend.  She held up a jar of spirulina powder, its vibrant green hue pulsing under the harsh kitchen light, before tossing it back into the chaotic mix. "They're hiding in plain sight," she mused, adding a dash of pomegranate molasses to the concoction, "waiting for someone with just the right recipe to unlock their potential."  The sun dipped behind the spires of the Old Town Square, casting long shadows across the market. She knew tonight would be her trial by fire. The first patient had agreed to meet her at 7 pm - a man named Josef, who claimed he'd lost his appetite after a lifetime of battling his family history of heart disease. Evelyn could feel the weight of her own anxieties settling on her like the evening chill.  "No pressure," she whispered to herself, holding a small glass jar filled with sunflower seeds. "Just one bite at a time."
