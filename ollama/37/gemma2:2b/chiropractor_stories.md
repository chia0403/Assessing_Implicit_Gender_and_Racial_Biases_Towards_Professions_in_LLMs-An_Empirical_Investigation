The rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Hayes' window like tiny, insistent hammers. She ran a hand through her already windswept auburn hair, the scent of pine needles and damp earth filling her small office in the heart of Portland. Outside, the world was grayed by the storm; within, it felt as if the very air had turned into a tangled web of anxiety. 

Eleanor's clinic, "The Spine & Stone," bustled with its usual afternoon traffic - a steady stream of patients seeking relief from everyday aches and pains. But today, even the rhythmic hum of chiropractic adjustments felt out of sync. The atmosphere crackled with an unspoken tension, echoing in her own tired eyes. It was a Tuesday like any other, but something felt different, heavier than the storm outside. Eleanor had been expecting this day; she'd known it would come, yet the weight of uncertainty kept pulling at her resolve. 

The door swung open, and in walked her newest patient, a young woman named Sarah with worry etched into every line of her face. As Eleanor assessed her stiff shoulders and the subtle tension in her neck, the storm outside seemed to mirror the turmoil swirling within the young woman’s eyes. A knot formed in Eleanor's stomach, mirroring the one she knew would soon appear in Sarah’s spine. This wasn’t just another case; this was a personal connection that had been brewing for weeks.
