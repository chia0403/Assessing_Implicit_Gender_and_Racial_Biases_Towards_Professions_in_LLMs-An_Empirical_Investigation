The setting was small: walls lined with motivational posters featuring inspirational quotes, a worn-out couch facing a desk cluttered with student papers, and the faint hum of fluorescent lights casting a sterile glow. Outside, the sounds of teenage life swirled: laughter echoing across the halls, loud whispers in the lunchroom, and the muffled shouts during a basketball game on the schoolyard.
