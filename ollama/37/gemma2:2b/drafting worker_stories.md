Rain lashed against the windows of the workshop like tiny fists hammering on wood. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne was hunched over her drafting table, the air thick with the scent of fresh ink and old leather.  A half-finished set of blueprints lay scattered before her, each line a testament to her frustration. She'd been working for weeks on this project – a massive, multi-story apartment complex designed to house the city's burgeoning young professionals – and it was nowhere near finished. 

The clock ticked relentlessly, mocking Amy’s progress with every passing second.  Her gaze darted between the blueprint and her overflowing coffee mug, a silent plea for inspiration echoing in the cramped space. Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amy's soul.  The pressure was mounting; deadlines were looming, and she was running out of time. 

**Setting:** A run-down workshop in a bustling city, full of old metal machines and dusty blueprints. The air is thick with the smell of ink and paper, punctuated by the roar of the storm outside.


This setting provides an atmosphere of urgency and stress while also hinting at Amy's quiet determination and her dedication to her work.
