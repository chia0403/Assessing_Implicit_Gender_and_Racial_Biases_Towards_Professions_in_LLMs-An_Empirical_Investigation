The humid New Orleans air clung to Detective  Alistair "Al" Beaumont like a damp shroud, beads of sweat forming on his forehead even beneath the wide-brimmed fedora shielding his eyes. The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Pelican" bar cast a ghostly hue on the cracked asphalt outside, reflecting off the half-dozen or so figures milling about in the alley behind it. 

Al adjusted his collar and ran a calloused hand through his thinning hair, his gaze lingering on the scene before him. It was a Tuesday night - typical in the Crescent City - but tonight felt different, charged with an uneasy energy that rattled the usually carefree hum of the city's lifeblood. The air hung thick with secrets and unspoken tension, each breath carrying a whisper of danger.  He had to find something, anything, to spark his investigation, to break through the stifling silence of this forgotten corner of the French Quarter.
