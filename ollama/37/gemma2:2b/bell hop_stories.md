Barty adjusted his crisp bow tie, its bright red contrasting with the drab grey of his uniform. The Grand Astoria Hotel, a beacon of glamour and opulence only a few blocks away, was shrouded in fog that seemed to hold back the city’s restless heartbeat. 

The air hummed with an undercurrent of anticipation, a promise of something big – something exciting – waiting at its heart.  Barty, despite his youthful exuberance, felt a tremor run through him as he stepped out into the night. Tonight was no ordinary night; tonight, he would be carrying more than just luggage for the wealthy patrons of this opulent establishment. Tonight, he’d carry hope, a chance to rewrite his own story under the golden glow of the Grand Astoria's facade.
