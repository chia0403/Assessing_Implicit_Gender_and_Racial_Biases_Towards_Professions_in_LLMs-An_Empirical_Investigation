## The Walls Whispered

The air in the Keep of Eldoria was thick with the scent of dust, aged parchment, and the lingering memory of burnt ale from last night's feast. A chill wind snaked its way through the stone corridors, whistling around the heavy iron door that separated the inner sanctum from the world outside.  Inside, guards like Aurelius stood, silent sentinels against the shadows. He was a veteran of the Kingâ€™s Guard, his face hardened by years of duty, a single scar tracing a dark path across his left cheek. 

Aurelius ran his calloused thumb over the worn hilt of his sword, its metal cold beneath his touch. Tonight's patrol felt different. The usual creaks and groans of the old walls were amplified tonight, a symphony of whispers echoing from the far corners, each one seeming to speak of secrets best left undisturbed. He glanced towards the moonlit courtyard, watching as the guards practiced their footwork under the watchful gaze of the stone gargoyle perched upon the wall.  The whispers, he knew, were growing louder. 


**Setting:** The Keep of Eldoria is a grand fortress built centuries ago, its stone walls thick and cold. It stands high on a mountain peak overlooking a vast valley, providing unparalleled security to the kingdom of Eldoria, but also serving as a place where history meets the present in unsettling ways.  
 
**Main character:** Aurelius (also known as "The Silent") is a veteran guard who carries a deep sense of duty and unspoken responsibility for the secrets held within the Keep's walls. He is a silent observer of life around him, preferring to let actions speak louder than words. His scarred cheek speaks of past battles, his stoic demeanor hinting at hidden depths.
