The rain hammered against the attic window, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of light on the dusty floorboards.  Inside, Amelia Thorne hunched over her ancient typewriter, her fingertips dancing across the keys as if she was summoning some long-lost magic from the machine itself. The air hung heavy with the scent of mothballs and old paper, the only solace against the relentless November chill seeping through the crumbling brick walls of her grandmother’s house in rural Maine.

Amelia’s latest manuscript lay open on the table, a tangle of half-formed characters and fantastical landscapes that felt more like a dream than reality. Her protagonist, Anya Petrova, a young woman with fiery red hair and eyes that held the secrets of forgotten empires, was meant to be battling a powerful entity known as The Crimson Weaver.  But the words were sluggish, leaving Amelia feeling adrift in the vastness of her own imagination. 

Tonight, she intended to finish the first draft. But a storm like this, howling its fury outside and whispering ancient tales into the attic rafters, made even the most ordinary tasks feel monumental.  Perhaps it was better to let the rain carry away the words, just for now.
