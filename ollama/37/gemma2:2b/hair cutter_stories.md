## The Razor's Edge

**Setting:** A dingy barbershop tucked away on a quiet street in Prague, Czech Republic. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already dim light inside. Steam rose from a chipped enamel basin where a faded "Mr. Szabo's" sign hung crookedly above it.  A musty scent of old hairspray and beeswax hung thick in the air.

**Main Character:** **Klara Petrovská**, known to her clients as simply "Klara," was a master with scissors, but a storm raged within her soul. 

The weight of unspoken words pressed down on Klara like an unseen hand. Her life had been unraveling for months, each strand of it slipping through her fingers. She ran a callused hand across the worn wood panel beneath her elbow and stared out at the swirling chaos beyond the shop's window, the grey clouds mirroring the gloom inside. 

She was supposed to be cutting hair today, but her shears felt heavy in her hands, lacking the usual grace they possessed. The razor held in anticipation on the barber’s chair by Mr. Szabo's grandson – a young man named Pavel, still learning his trade and with eyes full of innocence – was almost an extension of Klara herself.  The silence hung thick and oppressive as she watched him, each flicker of movement drawing her further into that storm within. 


**What will happen to Klara? How will the clients in the shop help her through this moment? What secrets does Mr. Szabo hold?**
