The neon glow of "The Velvet Parrot" pierced through the smoky haze clinging to the air like a dying ember.  The music, a relentless, staccato beat that pulsed with an unhealthy urgency, throbbed in Amelia’s chest.  Her fingers drummed on her piano bench, echoing the frantic rhythm she couldn't escape. Tonight was a disaster.

Amelia Blackwood wasn't sure if it was the city's relentless heart or if it was the storm raging outside that was turning the air thick and bitter, but tonight the music felt wrong.  Every note she hit seemed to lose its intended melody, instead sounding like a strangled cry. The crowd, usually buzzing with excitement for her soulful renditions of classic rock ballads, looked glazed over, their faces illuminated by a collective ennui.  Her eyes darted between the stage and the flickering lights of the disco ball hanging precariously above, feeling as lost as she had ever felt. 

This was supposed to be Amelia’s night – her debut at the legendary "Velvet Parrot," a jazz bar known for launching careers, fueling dreams, and leaving a trail of broken hearts in its wake. Instead, it felt like a dream collapsing around her.  The city lights outside seemed to mock her with their brazen indifference as she stared out from backstage. 


**Setting:** A late-night, smoky jazz club called "The Velvet Parrot" nestled amongst the bustling streets of New Orleans. The air is thick with anticipation and the smell of stale beer and cheap perfume. The music pulsates through the floorboards, driven by a rhythm section that has never stopped pushing the boundaries of what's expected from the genre. 


**Main character:** Amelia Blackwood
