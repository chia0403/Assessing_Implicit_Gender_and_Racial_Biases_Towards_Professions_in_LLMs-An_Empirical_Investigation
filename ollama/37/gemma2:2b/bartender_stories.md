Rain hammered against the grimy windows of The Last Call, its rhythm mimicking the frantic beat of Elara's pulse as she poured another round for Mr. Fitzwilliam.  The man sat hunched in his leather chair, a cloud of expensive cologne clinging to the air like smoke and regret. He hadn't spoken since the last time he’d arrived – three hours ago. It was his third visit this week. The bartender's uniform felt more like armor than clothing as Elara tried to keep her own anxieties at bay.

Elara, named for the ancient moon of the same name in the Lyra System, had always found solace in the rhythmic clatter of glasses and the low hum of conversations that filled The Last Call.  Every night, she'd meticulously polish the worn brass finish of each glass, her touch a prayer whispered to the ghosts of lost dreams that lingered around every corner.  But tonight, Elara felt like she was drowning in a sea of shadows, the city outside blurring into an anonymous mass of grey and black. She hadn't seen Mr. Fitzwilliam's face. Not yet.

**Setting:** 
The Last Call, a dimly lit speakeasy hidden down a back alleyway in Neo-Manhattan. The clientele was an assortment of lost souls - artists with too much paint on their faces, businessmen drowning in debt, and poets grappling with unfulfilled promises.

**Main character:**  Elara Blackwood.
