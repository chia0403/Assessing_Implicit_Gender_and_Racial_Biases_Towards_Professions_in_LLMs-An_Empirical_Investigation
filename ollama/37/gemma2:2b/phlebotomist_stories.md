## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of The Crimson Needle Clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a watercolor smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and nervous anticipation.  A storm raged both outside and inside, mirroring the turmoil brewing in Evelyn Pierce's chest. Just five minutes until she was scheduled to meet her next patient, and she still hadn't managed to get past the knots in her stomach – a visceral reaction to being faced with another human vessel to conquer, another challenge in the lifeblood of others. 

Evelyn wasn't just any phlebotomist; she had spent years honing her skills, transforming from a clumsy teenager who found blood drawing tedious into a seasoned professional who treated every vein like a whispering secret waiting to be unveiled. She was known for her calm hand, her gentle touch, and the way she made even the most anxious patient feel strangely at ease. But tonight, something felt different. A nagging sense of unease tugged at the edges of her focus. 

Her latest patient, a young man named Liam McAlpine, hadn't yet arrived, but every tick on the clock seemed to hammer the silence in her ears. With each passing minute, the fear gnawed at her confidence – a feeling amplified by the storm raging outside and the unsettling premonition of an impending confrontation that she couldn’t quite name.
