The scent of acetone and citrus clung to everything in Aurora's life. She was a creature of precision, her hands wielding tiny knives like scalpel surgeons, transforming chipped edges into flawless canvases. Her salon, "The Polished Petal," was a haven of tranquility amidst the chaos that pulsed beneath the city's gritty surface.  

Tonight, however, a storm raged not just outside in the alley behind Aurora's shop, but within her soul too. The usual calm had been shattered.  She wasn't used to this feeling; it was like a hummingbird trapped inside her chest, beating erratic and loud against her ribcage. Her heart hammered as she meticulously filed down a chipped nail, each movement slow and deliberate, almost hypnotic. 

The client in the chair before her – Mrs. Sinclair, a woman whose life had been woven into the fabric of the city’s history for decades - was no stranger to Aurora's calming touch. But something felt different tonight. The usual sparkle in Mrs. Sinclair's eyes seemed dulled, replaced by a haunted, faraway look. It unsettled Aurora, the silence broken only by the scraping of her tools against the acrylic.  Tonight, it wasn’t just about nail polish; tonight, a storm was brewing within the very shell she held so meticulously.
