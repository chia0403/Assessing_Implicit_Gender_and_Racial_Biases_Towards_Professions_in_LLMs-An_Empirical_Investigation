The late afternoon sun dripped through the dusty glass of Amelia "Amy" Davenport's office window, casting long shadows across her neatly organized desk. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and floral potpourri, a comforting blend she swore kept away the ghosts of past deals gone wrong. Amy wasn’t a woman built for grand visions; she was a creature of pragmatism, living in the messy, thrilling world of real estate.  Her small office on Elm Street in quaint Maplewood, Maine, felt like it held the echoes of countless stories – happy families settling into their first homes, heartbroken couples selling their childhood memories, and aging residents making the difficult decision to downsize after decades spent in a single house. 

Today’s story unfolded with Mrs. Hemlock's sprawling Victorian home on Willow Lane. It wasn't much to look at from the outside – faded paint, peeling shutters, and overgrown ivy creeping up the side - but Amy felt a strange tug of excitement. This was where she hoped to finally close the sale that had been dangling between her fingertips for months.  Mrs. Hemlock was notoriously difficult to work with, and the pressure was mounting as she was getting older, leaving less and less time to find a suitable successor.
