## Story Opening

The harsh fluorescent lights hummed over Amelia Thorne's head as she meticulously cleaned the last patient's molar in her tiny office. The air hung thick with the familiar scent of antiseptic and the ghost of yesterday's coffee. Outside, the city thrummed with life – a symphony of honking cars, distant laughter, and rumbling subways. But inside, Amelia found refuge from this urban cacophony, a safe haven she carved out for herself amongst rows of sterile chairs and gleaming dental tools. 

She was no stranger to the routine. For years, Amelia had walked these hallways, her days marked by the predictable rhythm of patient appointments and cleaning sessions. She enjoyed the methodical precision of her work – the delicate touch on sensitive gums, the gentle probing of a decayed tooth. It was a familiar comfort in an unpredictable world.
