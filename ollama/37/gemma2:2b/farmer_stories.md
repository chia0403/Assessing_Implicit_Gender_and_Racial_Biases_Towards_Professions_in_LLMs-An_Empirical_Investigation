The wind whipped Elara's hair across her weathered face as she surveyed the parched field stretching out before her like a cracked clay doll. A sea of dry earth stretched as far as her weary eyes could see, punctuated only by skeletal trees that clawed at the bruised sky.  Her worn leather boots sunk into the thirsty soil, leaving tracks etched deeper than the furrows carved by Elara's own hands over countless seasons. 

Elara Willowbrook - a name that carried echoes of her ancestral resilience and a legacy of hope, even in these desolate times. Though most villagers had abandoned their land and sought refuge in the fortified city, Elara refused to relinquish even a single acre. Her heart was as stubborn as the ancient oak trees lining the edge of her property, refusing to bend under the weight of hardship or despair. 

Her family's well ran dry months ago, its empty stone basin mirroring the emptiness growing within Elara herself. The drought had stretched on for far too long, threatening not just their crops but the very spirit of their community.  And tonight, as she stared into the abyss of her own desperation, a single tear traced a lonely path down her cheek.
