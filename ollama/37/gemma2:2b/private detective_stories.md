Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Detective Alistair "Ali" Blackwood's office like tiny fists pummeling a tired old man. A single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling cast harsh shadows across the worn leather armchair where Ali sat, its occupant lost in thought. Outside, the city's neon-drenched skyline glittered with an almost mocking optimism that Ali couldn't share. Tonight, his latest case – a missing person of questionable morals and even more dubious connections – had him feeling as lost as a moth in a storm. 

**Setting:** A dingy office tucked away on a grimy side street in Chicago. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint metallic tang of blood, remnants of a case that had yet to leave Ali's mind. His files were overflowing with information, but his client, Mrs. Evelyn Hawthorne, was strangely evasive about details. She only whispered about a "shadow" and an "ancient pact," leaving him with more questions than answers. 


**Main character:** Alistair Blackwood, known as Ali by his few acquaintances in the shadowy world of private investigation. He's a man haunted by past failures, clinging to cynicism as a shield against the harsh realities of a city where innocence is just another casualty. Despite his jaded nature, there's something about him that draws people in, like moths to a flickering flame - a glimmer of hope hidden behind the weary eyes and the cynical wit.
