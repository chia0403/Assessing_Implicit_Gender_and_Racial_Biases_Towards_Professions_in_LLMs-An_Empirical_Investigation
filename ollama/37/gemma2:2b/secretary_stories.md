##  The Clock's Tick Tock

**Setting:** The grand mahogany desk creaked beneath Amelia Thorne's fingertips as she smoothed the crisp white collar of Mr. Thornton's suit. It was always meticulously pressed, always perfectly aligned with the impeccable clock behind it. Every hour on the dot, the ornate clock chimed in the echoing hall of Thornton & Sons – a legacy firm that had weathered decades and seen empires rise and fall. 

**Character:** Amelia Thorne (32) -  A secretary by profession, Amelia navigated the labyrinthine world of law with quiet efficiency. Her days were a symphony of filing, phone calls, and meticulous correspondence, all orchestrated under the watchful eye of Mr. Thornton himself. He was a man whose aura seemed to hold the very essence of Old Money, a man who had built his empire on an iron will and a love for the archaic order he so meticulously maintained. 

**Opening:** Amelia sighed, her gaze lingering on the clock's silent tick-tock. It had been a particularly frustrating week; the legal jargon, the endless demands from demanding clients, and the ever-present feeling of being utterly insignificant in Mr. Thornton’s grand scheme - it all weighed heavily on her. The weight felt like lead in her stomach as she looked at the door; he would be walking in any moment, his presence the only sound that dared to break the silence. 

"Ms. Thorne," a voice boomed from behind, silencing her internal anxieties with its familiar authority. "Mr. Thornton wants to see you."
