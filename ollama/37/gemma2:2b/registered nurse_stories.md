## The Setting: 

The air hung thick and heavy in the cramped hallway outside Dr. Thorne's office, radiating the same sterile scent of disinfectant and fear as the room itself.  A single fluorescent bulb cast harsh shadows on the worn linoleum floor, illuminating dust motes swirling in the stale air. This was the heart of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, where hope often met with despair in equal measure.

## The Character: 

Evelyn Thorne wasn’t born under a particularly auspicious sign.  Her family's history was riddled with misfortune and broken dreams, but she rose above it all, becoming not just a registered nurse, but a beacon of calm amidst the chaos of the ER. Known for her gentle touch and unwavering compassion, Evelyn had a knack for seeing past the pain to the soul beneath. 

**Story Opening:**  Evelyn stood in the hallway, the metallic tang of blood clinging to the back of her throat.  She'd been on call all night, the constant hum of machinery echoing through her ears like a mantra, each beep reminding her that someone, somewhere was suffering. She had treated countless heart attacks, strokes, and accidents, each patient leaving behind a trail of exhaustion and a lingering sense of helplessness. Now, she waited, her worn coat creaking as she shifted from foot to foot. Dr. Thorne’s office door stood open, its emptiness punctuated only by the distant echo of his voice.  Evelyn felt a knot forming in her stomach, a feeling that was both familiar and terrifyingly new all at once. 

What will Evelyn encounter in Dr. Thorne's office? What secret is hidden beneath the sterile surface?
