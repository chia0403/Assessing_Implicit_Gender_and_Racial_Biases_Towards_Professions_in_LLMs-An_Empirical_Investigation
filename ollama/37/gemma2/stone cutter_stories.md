The air hung thick with the scent of granite dust and sweat in Elias Thornewood's workshop. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature constellations.  His calloused hands, stained with ochre pigments from years of chiseling, rested on the smooth surface of a half-finished bust. It depicted a woman with eyes closed, her face serene despite the rough edges that still marred its features. Elias sighed, his breath fogging the cool morning air. The marble, imported from Carrara, was behaving more like stubborn clay today, resisting his every attempt to capture the subtle curve of her cheekbone.

His workshop, tucked away in a narrow alley behind the bustling marketplace of Alora, was his sanctuary.  Here, amidst the comforting clang of his hammer and the whisper of grinding tools, he found solace from the clamorous city life that pulsed just beyond the rough-hewn wooden door. The world outside held politics, intrigue, and whispers of war brewing on the distant horizon. But in this cramped space, Elias Thornewood was a sculptor, an artist, a master of his craft, carving not just stone but moments frozen in time.
