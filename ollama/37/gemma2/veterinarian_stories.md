The salty air whipped Amelia "Amy" Rivers' auburn hair around her face as she stepped onto the porch of Pelican Point Animal Clinic. The sun, already high in the sky, cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt driveway and the weathered wooden sign proclaiming their services: “Dr. Amy Rivers – Veterinary Medicine for All Creatures Great and Small.” 

Pelican Point was a sleepy coastal town where life moved at a slower pace, dictated by the tides and the fishermen's schedules. The clinic itself was a testament to its humble surroundings, a quaint building with faded blue siding and a chipped paint job that spoke of countless seaside storms weathered over the years. Inside, the scent of disinfectant mingled with the comforting aroma of freshly baked dog biscuits from Mrs. Peterson's bakery next door. 

Amy sighed contentedly, taking in the familiar sights and smells. This was her home, both professionally and personally. Pelican Point held a special place in her heart, as it had been where she grew up and where she built her life after graduating from veterinary school. 


Today, however, promised to be anything but ordinary. A worried call had come in earlier that morning – a rare seabird, injured and disoriented, found tangled in fishing nets on the nearby shore.
