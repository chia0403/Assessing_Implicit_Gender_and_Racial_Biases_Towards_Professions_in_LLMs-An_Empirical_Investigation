The gentle whirring of the electric file was the only sound in Celeste Bellarosa's tiny salon. The scent of almond oil and lavender lingered in the air, a comforting familiarity to the woman who had poured her heart into this little haven tucked away on Elm Street. Outside, the bustling city throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, but within these walls, time seemed to slow. 

Celeste carefully shaped the nails of Mrs. Henderson, her long-time client, while listening patiently as she lamented about her garden gnomes being stolen from her yard again. The usual anxieties and triumphs of life unfolded like a familiar ballet, each story etched onto the surface of Celeste's clients' hands.  She was a confidante, a therapist, an artist - all rolled into one under the guise of a manicurist. 

But today, something felt different. A tension crackled beneath the surface, even Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s usual complaints seemed tinged with an unfamiliar edge. It wasn't just the city air buzzing with a strange electricity, it was something deeper, a shift in the rhythm of her little sanctuary that made Celeste feel a prickle of unease.
