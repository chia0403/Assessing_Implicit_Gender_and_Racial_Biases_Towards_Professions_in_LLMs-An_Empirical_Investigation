The air hung thick with humidity and the faint scent of lime-infused water bottles as Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Cartwright surveyed her morning class.  Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of The Sweat Sanctuary, bathing the room in a warm glow that did little to combat the palpable tension vibrating in the space. 

It wasn't the usual pre-workout jitters. This time, it felt different. Amy could sense the anxious energy prickling at the edges of her students' smiles. She chalked it up to the upcoming regional fitness competition – a high-stakes event that had everyone on edge.  But as she adjusted the music, prepping for their signature "Beat the Burn" routine, a flicker of unease sparked within Amy herself. Something wasn’t quite right. 


The Sweat Sanctuary was nestled on the ground floor of an old brick building in the heart of downtown Willow Creek, a vibrant city known more for its thriving arts scene than its fitness culture. It was Amy's sanctuary, her escape from the chaos of the outside world. But today, even the familiar scent of eucalyptus and lavender oil couldn't completely mask a growing sense of foreboding.
