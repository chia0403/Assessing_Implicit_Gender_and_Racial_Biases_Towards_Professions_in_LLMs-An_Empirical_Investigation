Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a miniature drumbeat on the warped glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne hunched over her battered typewriter, its keys clicking out a rhythm as frantic as the storm outside. Her small apartment above Mr. Henderson's bakery was usually a sanctuary of warmth and quiet, but tonight, it felt claustrophobic, the air thick with anticipation and dread. 

Amelia's deadline loomed like a thundercloud – three days to finish her first novel. Three days to prove she wasn’t just another dreamer scribbling away in the forgotten corners of the city. She could almost hear the snickers of those literary gatekeepers, already declaring her manuscript another failed attempt, destined for the overflowing bin of unrealized dreams.  

The scent of freshly baked bread wafted up from the bakery below, a cruel reminder of Amelia's own hunger – both for success and for a warm meal. But she couldn’t afford to be distracted. Her fingers flew across the keys, chasing the ghosts of her imagination, desperately trying to wrangle them into something coherent, something worthy of sharing with the world.
