The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty shelves of Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's office.  She ran a hand over a worn copy of "Invisible Man," its spine cracked from years of use, then glanced at the clock on her desk: 4:57 p.m. Just three minutes until her department’s meeting. 

Eleanor sighed, smoothing down her unruly auburn hair that stubbornly refused to be tamed. Her office at St. Augustine's University was a sanctuary – cluttered with books, manuscripts, and faded photographs of her late grandmother, a renowned botanist. But lately, the sanctuary felt more like a cage.  The pressures of grant writing, committee meetings, and student demands weighed heavily on her. Today’s meeting promised to be particularly fraught, as they were discussing proposed budget cuts that threatened their department's very existence. 

Eleanor glanced down at the crumpled notes scattered across her desk: potential arguments against the cuts, possible solutions, a list of sympathetic faculty members she could rally. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  The fate of her beloved literature department, a place where she’d poured her heart and soul for twenty years, rested precariously on her shoulders. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the battle ahead.
