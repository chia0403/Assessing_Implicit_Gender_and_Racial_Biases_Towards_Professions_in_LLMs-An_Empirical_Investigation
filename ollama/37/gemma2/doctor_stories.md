The rhythmic whir of the ventilation system was the only sound that dared to break the sterile silence of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Thorne’s office. Her pale eyes, magnified by thick-rimmed glasses, scanned the x-ray on her desk, the shadowy image of Mr. Henderson's fractured femur stark against the white background.  

Outside, the city of New Alexandria bustled with life – a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the endless hum of commerce. But within these four walls, time seemed to stand still. Eleanor’s office, located on the top floor of the sprawling General Hospital, offered a panoramic view of the cityscape, but her gaze remained fixed on the x-ray. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her shoulders; another life, another story, another mystery to unravel.  

Mr. Henderson, a burly construction worker known for his booming laugh and sturdy frame, lay pale and still in room 304. He’d fallen from scaffolding that morning, the latest casualty in New Alexandria's relentless construction boom. Eleanor had seen this before – the fragility of life juxtaposed against the city's ambition.  But with Mr. Henderson, something felt different. There was a subtle anomaly in the x-ray, a faint shadow she couldn't quite place. It whispered of a story yet to be told.
