The hum of the centrifuge was a lullaby to Dr. Eleanor Vance as she meticulously pipetted samples into microtubes, her brow furrowed in concentration. The fluorescent lights of the laboratory cast long shadows across her cluttered workbench, illuminating vials filled with shimmering liquids and petri dishes teeming with iridescent bacteria. Outside, the city of New Alexandria thrummed with life, a symphony of distant sirens and honking cars barely penetrating the sterile quiet of Eleanorâ€™s lab within the sprawling complex of the Stellaris Research Institute.
