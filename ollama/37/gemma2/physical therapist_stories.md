The scent of stale disinfectant and lavender oil hung thick in the air, a familiar aroma that usually soothed Amelia Rose Hawthorne. Today, though, it felt oppressive.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her small practice, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. It was eerily quiet â€“ too quiet. Usually, this time of day was buzzing with the clink of weights, the whir of machines, and the muffled groans of exertion. But today, Amelia was alone. 

Her office, nestled on a leafy street in the heart of Portland's historic district, felt strangely empty without the familiar sounds of recovery and rehabilitation. The hand-painted mural depicting a vibrant sunflower field, meant to inspire hope, seemed to droop in the silence. Even her trusty rubber band ball, always rolled to life by impatient patients waiting their turn, lay forgotten on the floor, deflated and lifeless.  


Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid. Something was off, she could feel it. It wasn't just the unsettling quiet. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, leaving an unwelcome weight she couldn't shake.
