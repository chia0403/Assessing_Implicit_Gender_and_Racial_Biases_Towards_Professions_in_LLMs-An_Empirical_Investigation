The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Dr. Evelyn Abernathy's clinic, illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny fireflies. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of cicadas filled the summer air, a counterpoint to the gentle hum of the massage table’s motor as Mrs. Henderson lay prone, receiving her usual post-golf muscle kneading. Evelyn stood by the window, her tall frame casting a long shadow across the worn linoleum floor. She wasn't watching Mrs. Henderson though; her gaze was fixed on a lone crow perched precariously on the rusted antenna of their aging Ford pickup truck parked out front.

Evelyn had a peculiar feeling about crows. They always seemed to appear when things were about to change, like harbingers of some unseen shift in the universe. And lately, there’d been an awful lot of crows around her clinic nestled in sleepy Harmony Creek, Montana. 


  
The small town felt different too. A restlessness had settled over its inhabitants, a tension that crackled beneath the surface of their usual placidity. The air, thick with anticipation, whispered of secrets waiting to be unearthed and old wounds ready to bleed again. Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn’t just another lazy summer afternoon in Harmony Creek; something was brewing, something big.  And she had a nagging suspicion that it wouldn't be good.
