The whine of static was a constant companion to Elsie Mae Hawthorne's life. It filled the cramped confines of her workshop, a converted shed behind her family's modest home in rural West Virginia, mixing with the scent of soldering flux and ozone.  

Outside, the Appalachian foothills stretched in all directions, their slopes draped in a misty haze that blurred the lines between green and grey. A lone crow cawed from atop a rusted weather vane, its voice echoing through the stillness. Inside, Elsie Mae's world revolved around the crackling symphony of radio waves. She could coax meaning from the static, decipher messages hidden within the ether, and bring distant voices into her small workshop. 


She was known throughout the community as "Ellie" the Radio Witch, a moniker earned not for any supernatural abilities, but for her uncanny skill at repairing and modifying radios, bringing them back to life after they'd been deemed beyond saving by everyone else.  Her latest project sat on the workbench before her: an antique Zenith console radio, its once-polished wood scratched and faded, its glass face cracked. It belonged to Mrs. Henderson, who swore she still heard the faint echo of her late husband’s voice crackling through the static, a comforting whisper from beyond the grave. 


Elsie Mae knew it was just wishful thinking, but she also knew that sometimes, even the most impossible stories held a sliver of truth.  She tightened a loose screw, her brow furrowed in concentration. As she worked, a new sound emerged from the speaker – not Mrs. Henderson's husband, but something else entirely. A low hum, a metallic rasp, followed by a voice... but not one spoken in English.
