The air hung thick with humidity, the scent of salt and decay clinging to Eliza Amelia Blackwood like a second skin.  She adjusted the brim of her straw hat, sweat already beading on her brow despite the early hour. A thin layer of grime coated everything in Port Royal – the cobblestone streets slick with recent rain, the brightly painted houses faded and peeling, even the tourists themselves bearing the mark of the relentless Caribbean sun. Eliza surveyed the motley crew before her: a gaggle of wide-eyed teenagers, a couple on their honeymoon who seemed perpetually distracted by each other's phones, and a solitary elderly gentleman clutching a tattered map that looked older than Port Royal itself. 

"Welcome, one and all," she called out, her voice laced with practiced cheer, "to the most notorious city in the Caribbean! I’m Eliza Blackwood, your guide to the wonders – and terrors – that Port Royal has to offer."  She gestured towards the crumbling forts, the faded grandeur of colonial architecture, and the bustling marketplace teeming with pirates, merchants, and everything in between. "Prepare yourselves, folks, because today we're going back in time to a place where fortunes were made and lost, legends were born, and every shadow whispered secrets."  


Eliza adjusted her satchel, feeling the weight of her trusty compass and well-worn notebook. This was her story to tell, her city to guide them through, and she wouldn't let anything stand in her way – not even the ghosts that some said haunted these streets.
