The air in "McGregor's Meats" was thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a perfume that clung to  Elias McGregor like a second skin. The shop itself was a time capsule, its wooden shelves groaning under the weight of hung carcasses, rows upon rows of sausages plumping against their casings, and cured hams draped like velvet curtains across the rafters. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air, and casting long shadows from the cleavers hanging above the stainless steel counter where Elias stood. He was a man built like an ox, his hands scarred and calloused from years of wielding knives with a precision born of necessity. A heavy silver ring engraved with a wolf's head sat on his thumb, glinting under the shop's dim lights.  

Elias McGregor, butcher to generations of locals in the small, forgotten town of Hollow Creek, had always considered himself a purveyor of peace. He believed there was a certain dignity in the act of taking life for sustenance, a respect owed to both the animal and the person who would consume it. But lately, a darkness had settled over Hollow Creek, a creeping unease that whispered through the cobblestone streets like a phantom breeze. And Elias, with his keen senses honed by years spent listening to the quiet stories told in the meat itself, felt it more keenly than anyone.
