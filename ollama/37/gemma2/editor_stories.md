The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's tired face. It read "Night Owl Press," but the only nocturnal creature in sight was Amy herself, hunched over a manuscript titled "The Serpent's Shadow."  

It was 3:17 AM, and her usual cup of lukewarm coffee had long gone cold. The air in her tiny, cramped office hung thick with the scent of stale paper and ambition, as familiar to Amy as her own heartbeat. Outside, Chicago slept beneath a blanket of smog, unaware of the literary battle raging within the confines of this single room.  

Amy rubbed her eyes, fighting off the urge to succumb to the relentless pull of sleep. This manuscript was her chance, the one that could catapult Night Owl Press from obscurity into the literary spotlight. But judging by the convoluted plot and stilted dialogue, it felt more like a tangled web than a story. 


She sighed, took another sip of her now-bitter coffee, and turned back to page five.
