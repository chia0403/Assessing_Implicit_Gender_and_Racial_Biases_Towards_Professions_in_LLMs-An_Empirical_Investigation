The relentless hum of the F-35 Lightning II's engines reverberated through Amelia "Ace" Sterling's bones as she rocketed into the pre-dawn sky. The Arizona desert stretched out below her, a tapestry of dusty browns and muted greens, kissed by the faint blush of sunrise. A single jagged mountain range stood sentinel in the distance, its peaks clawing at the deepening blue canvas above. Ace gripped the controls tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This wasn't just another training mission.  This was a test flight for the new X-Wing program - a prototype fighter designed to push the boundaries of aerial combat, and Ace was the first to pilot it. The air crackled with anticipation, a palpable tension that mirrored the electric charge coursing through her veins.
