The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the asphalt shimmering under the relentless August heat.  He wiped his brow with a grimy rag and adjusted the brim of his straw hat, its faded canvas offering little respite from the glare. The highway stretched before him, an endless ribbon of grey slicing through the heart of rural Wyoming. 

Elias stood on a desolate stretch between towns, miles from anything but scrub brush and wind-whipped sage.  A rusty truck with "Thorne Construction" scrawled across its side sat idle beside him, its engine coughing like a tired beast. It was their workhorse, battered and loyal as Elias himself. Today, they were patching the potholes that seemed to multiply faster than tumbleweeds after a storm. 


This wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest. And for Elias, it was home. He knew every mile of this highway like the back of his hand, every bend and dip, every hidden rattlesnake den.  He felt more connected to this unforgiving landscape than he ever did to the bustling cities he had briefly called home. 


Today, though, something felt different. A restlessness thrummed beneath Elias's skin, a disquiet that couldn't be explained by the sweltering heat. He glanced at the horizon, a vast canvas of blue melting into dusty gold. The wind whispered through the sagebrush, carrying with it the scent of rain and…something else. Something unfamiliar.
