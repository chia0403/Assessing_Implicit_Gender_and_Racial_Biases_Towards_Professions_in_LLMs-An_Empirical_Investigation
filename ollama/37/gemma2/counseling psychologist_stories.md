Rain lashed against Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's office window, mimicking the tempest brewing within her own mind.  The cramped, cluttered space felt suffocating tonight. Books piled haphazardly on shelves threatened to topple, overflowing with dusty volumes on the human psyche â€“ a constant reminder of her own struggles to understand it. Her phone sat silent on the desk, untouched since she'd switched off the "open for appointments" sign three hours ago.  

The city outside was drowning under a torrent of grey, mirroring the desolation Evelyn felt after another day spent listening to people's anxieties, their fears, their deepest wounds. The weight of their stories pressed down on her, a leaden cloak she couldn't seem to shed. This wasn't new; the burden had always been there, a constant companion since she'd entered this profession. But tonight, it felt particularly heavy, almost unbearable. 


She leaned back in her creaky office chair, staring at the swirling patterns of the rain-streaked glass. The city lights blurred into hazy halos, offering no solace.  Evelyn needed an escape, a way to clear her head before she succumbed to the encroaching darkness within. But where could she go? And from whom could she seek refuge, even if only for a brief moment?
