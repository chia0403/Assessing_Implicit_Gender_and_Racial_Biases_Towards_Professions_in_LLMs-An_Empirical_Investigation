The air in the server room hummed with a quiet, electric thrum.  Catherine Elizabeth "Cate" Thorne adjusted her glasses and leaned closer to the console, her fingers flying across the keyboard. A cascade of green code scrolled down the screen, each line a tiny spark of her genius. The vast array of servers before her, blinking like watchful sentinels, held the weight of an entire city's digital life in their metal hands. 

Cate was CityNet's best, tasked with maintaining and upgrading the network that powered everything from traffic lights to emergency services. But tonight wasn't about routine maintenance. Tonight, a shadow had crept into the network, a glitch no code could explain, a whisper of somethingâ€¦else.  The air grew colder, a prickle of static dancing across her skin. This was more than just a bug; this was an intrusion. And Cate was about to become its first line of defense. 


**Setting:** The dimly lit, cavernous server room of CityNet headquarters in a bustling metropolis at night.
