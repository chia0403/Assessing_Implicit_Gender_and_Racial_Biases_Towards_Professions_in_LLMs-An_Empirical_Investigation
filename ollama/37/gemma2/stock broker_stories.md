The midday sun beat down on Manhattan, turning the polished skyscrapers into shimmering mirages.  Rain slicked the sidewalks, reflecting the city's frenetic energy like a fractured kaleidoscope. Inside his office on the 47th floor of the towering Wall Street edifice known as "The Iron Serpent," Alexander Finchley wiped beads of sweat from his brow, though it wasn't solely the August heat that had him flustered. His phone buzzed incessantly, each call a potential minefield of volatile market fluctuations and demanding clients. The air hung thick with anticipation -  the Dow Jones was about to release its monthly report, and Finchley, one of the city's most sought-after stock brokers, held his breath, waiting for the numbers that would make or break him, and countless others like him. 


Alexander adjusted his cufflinks, a pair of intricately carved silver skulls glinting in the fluorescent light. He was a man accustomed to high stakes and even higher pressure. This wasn't just about money; it was about survival. A game where the players were sharks, circling each other with laser focus, always hungry for more. And Finchley, despite the clammy sweat on his skin, relished the thrill of the hunt.
