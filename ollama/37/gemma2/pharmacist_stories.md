The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the neatly stacked shelves that lined the walls. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and lavender hand sanitizer – a comforting familiarity to Amelia Rose Thorne, Head Pharmacist at Oakwood Drugstore.  

Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves against the storefront windows, blurring the familiar scene of Main Street in shades of orange and brown. Inside, however, remained a sanctuary of order and routine. The familiar clatter of prescription bottles being filled, the soft murmur of customers seeking over-the-counter remedies, even the occasional coughing fit from Mr. Henderson who insisted on dropping by every day for his "good health" cough drops – it all formed a comforting symphony Amelia had come to know by heart.  

But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck, a sense of anticipation hanging in the air like the faint scent of cinnamon from the recently restocked holiday aisle. It was subtle, almost unnoticeable, but it tugged at Amelia's senses, whispering that this seemingly ordinary day might hold something extraordinary.
