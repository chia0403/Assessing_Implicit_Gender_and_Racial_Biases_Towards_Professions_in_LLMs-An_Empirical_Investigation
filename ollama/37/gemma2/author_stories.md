The wind whipped around Eleanor Blackwood's cottage, rattling the old windows like chattering teeth. Rain lashed against the glass panes, blurring the view of the craggy cliffs that jutted into the churning sea below.  Eleanor hunched deeper into her armchair, a worn blanket pulled tight around her shoulders. The fire in the hearth crackled merrily, casting flickering shadows on the walls lined with bookshelves groaning under the weight of countless volumes. 

She tapped her pen against her notebook, frustration gnawing at her. This was supposed to be her masterpiece, the novel that would finally catapult her from obscurity to literary acclaim.  But the words refused to come. She’d tried everything – long walks on the windswept beach, steeping herself in folklore, even attempting a midnight ritual involving candles and elderflower wine (which had resulted in a rather unpleasant encounter with a flock of startled seagulls). 

Perhaps, Eleanor mused, she just needed a change of scenery. A new muse, perhaps? She glanced out at the storm-tossed waves, their fury echoing the turmoil within her. Maybe she should venture into town, seek inspiration amongst the bustling crowd… or maybe she'd simply brew another pot of tea and wait for the words to find her.
