The sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's neck as she maneuvered her Caterpillar D7R bulldozer across the barren Oklahoma landscape. Dust kicked up in swirling plumes around the machine, coating everything in a gritty haze. Amy squinted, shielding her eyes with one gloved hand and gripping the controls tighter. The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and diesel fuel â€“ the familiar perfume of her world. 

She'd been on this site for weeks, carving out a new path for a pipeline that snaked its way across the state like a metallic serpent. The work was backbreaking, demanding every ounce of strength and focus she possessed. But Amy thrived on it. There was a primal satisfaction in wielding such immense power, shaping the land with each calculated push and pull of her machine.

Today's task was particularly grueling: clearing a swathe through a stubborn grove of scrub oak before nightfall. The sun dipped lower, casting long shadows that stretched across the dusty plains, painting the world in shades of burnt orange and fading gold.  Amy knew she needed to hurry. She wasn't looking forward to spending another night in her cramped, rusty trailer on the edge of this desolate wasteland.
