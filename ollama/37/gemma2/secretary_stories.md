The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s heels on the linoleum floor echoed through the empty office.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow across stacks of unfiled paperwork and dusty trophies from Mr. Worthington’s “Employee of the Year” streak that spanned a decade (and, rumour had it, involved more than just good work). The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten ambition. 

It was 6:15 AM, well before any of the men in suits would descend upon Worthington & Sons Industries, their faces tight with the day’s anxieties. But for Amelia, this pre-dawn hour held a strange kind of peace. The silence was broken only by the soft murmur of her thoughts and the occasional sigh escaping from the ancient filing cabinet as it creaked open.  Today, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, like the beginning of an incoming storm. 


Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne took a deep breath, straightened her collar, and braced herself for whatever the day might bring. After all, she was used to weathering the storms at Worthington & Sons.
