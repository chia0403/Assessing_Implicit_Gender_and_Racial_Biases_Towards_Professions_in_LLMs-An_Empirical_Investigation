The stale air hung thick in the interrogation room, carrying the faint scent of disinfectant and desperation. Dr. Amelia Katherine Hayes, perched on the edge of her chair, observed the man across from her with practiced detachment. His shoulders were hunched, his gaze darting around the sterile white space like a trapped animal. A thin sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead, betraying his attempts at composure. 

The setting was the dimly lit basement of the sprawling precinct in Savannah, Georgia. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic haze. Outside, the humid air throbbed with the low growl of thunder, mirroring the tension simmering in the room. Dr. Hayes knew this interrogation wouldn't be a simple conversation. This was where truth wrestled with deceit, and she, the forensic psychologist, held the fragile scales.  


She had been called in to assess Mark Anthony Carter, a man accused of abducting a young girl from her bedroom window two nights ago. The evidence against him was circumstantial, but the chilling details of the crime were etched into his face - fear, confusion, and something darker lurking beneath the surface. 

As Dr. Hayes met his eyes, she felt a prickle of unease. There was a storm brewing inside Mark Anthony Carter, one that threatened to spill over with devastating consequences.
