The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and lemon polish as Elara Valentina surveyed the chaos that was Mrs. Periwinkle's living room.  A kaleidoscope of mismatched furniture crammed every inch of space, floral wallpaper screamed in clashing hues, and what appeared to be a taxidermied squirrel sat perched precariously on a stack of worn Harlequin romance novels. 

Elara sighed, her designer heels sinking slightly into the plush, but decidedly dusty, carpet. This wasn't just an interior design project; it was a full-on excavation site. Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman who seemingly collected memories more than possessions, had hoarded every trinket and souvenir from her eighty years on earth.  

Elara adjusted her designer sunglasses, willing herself to focus. This was the kind of challenge that got her blood pumping. She thrived on rescuing homes from oblivion, breathing life back into forgotten spaces with a touch of modern elegance and a sprinkle of unexpected whimsy. 


**Setting:** A sprawling Victorian house in sleepy, seaside town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. Built in the late 1800s, the house is filled with antiques, but also burdened by years of neglect and clutter. The living room is particularly egregious: dusty, cramped, and overflowing with mismatched furniture and vintage knick-knacks.
