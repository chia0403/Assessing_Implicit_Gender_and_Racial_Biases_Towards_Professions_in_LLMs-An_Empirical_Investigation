The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Thorne's collar as she sat in her car, staring across the street at the ramshackle Victorian house. A faded blue awning drooped over the front porch, barely holding back the encroaching vines that seemed to be slowly engulfing the entire structure. The paint peeled like sunburn, revealing patches of rotted wood beneath. 

This was Mrs. Clementine Peabody's residence, and according to Amy's records, she had filed a claim for "unexplained paranormal activity."  Amy scoffed inwardly. Unforeseen events were one thing - falling pianos, rogue squirrels, even the occasional alien abduction - but ghosts? That was pushing it. 

She adjusted her floral print blouse, smoothing down the wrinkles caused by the humid Florida air. Her sensible heels clicked against the pavement as she crossed the street, determined to convince Mrs. Peabody that a leaky roof and a drafty attic were more likely culprits than restless spirits.  This case, like so many others, felt destined to be another tedious journey into the realm of absurd claims and unreasonable expectations. 

Amy wasn't naive; she knew insurance was often about navigating the grey areas between reality and perception. But even for her, this one seemed particularly outlandish. The question was, could she keep a straight face when Mrs. Peabody inevitably began to describe the apparition haunting her attic?
