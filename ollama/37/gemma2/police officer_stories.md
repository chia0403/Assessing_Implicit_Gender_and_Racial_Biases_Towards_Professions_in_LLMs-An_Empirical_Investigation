The rain hammered against Detective Amelia "Amy" Hayes' windshield, blurring the neon signs of downtown Chicago into shimmering streaks of color. The scent of wet asphalt and stale cigarette smoke clung to the air, a familiar cocktail in this city that never slept. Amy tugged her collar tighter against the biting wind, wishing she hadn't left her jacket at the station. 

Her partner, Officer Ramirez, whistled a tuneless melody as he scanned the precinct logs on his tablet.  "Another domestic," he said, glancing up at Amy. "Same old, same old. You up for this?"

Amy sighed, rubbing the fatigue from her eyes. "Might as well be." 


She steered the cruiser down Halsted Street, its headlights cutting through the gloom. The flashing red and blue of a squad car already parked in front of a dingy apartment building confirmed their worst fears â€“ another night on the job, another story waiting to unfold.
