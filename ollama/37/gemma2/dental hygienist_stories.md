The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the row of patient chairs in Dr. Kim's bustling office. It was 8:45 AM, and the scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint tang of stale coffee – a familiar aroma that Amelia had come to associate with her Tuesday mornings.  

Amelia adjusted her blue scrubs, smoothing down the wrinkles that had inevitably formed during her commute on the crowded bus. She wasn't exactly excited about the day ahead; Dr. Kim’s latest patient, Mrs. Henderson, was notorious for her anxiety and aversion to anything involving tools near her mouth. But Amelia, a seasoned hygienist with a calm demeanor and a talent for coaxing even the most apprehensive patients, felt a familiar sense of responsibility settle in. It was more than just cleaning teeth; it was about building trust and easing fears, one patient at a time. 


The office door chimed, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, her face already etched with worry. Amelia took a deep breath, plastered on her warmest smile, and prepared to embark on another Tuesday morning in the sterile world of dental hygiene.
