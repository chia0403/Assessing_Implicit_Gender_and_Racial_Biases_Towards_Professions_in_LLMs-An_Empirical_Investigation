The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and desperation.  

Eleanor "Ellie" Vance adjusted her headset microphone, its weight familiar against her ear. The summer sun beat down on the asphalt parking lot of Meadowbrook Mobile Homes, reflecting off the chrome bumpers of the cars she'd just failed to lure into buying a new trailer. Three rejections in as many hours had drained even Ellie's usual reservoir of optimism. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of blonde hair behind her ear, and glanced at the "Grand Opening Sale" banner fluttering listlessly in the breeze.

Meadowbrook was supposed to be Ellie's ticket to success, the place where sheâ€™d finally prove herself to her skeptical family and climb out of the shadow of her older brother, a real estate titan back home.  Instead, it felt more like a slow, painful descent into sales hell.

It was Ellie's last chance before closing time. She smoothed down her crisp blue uniform and approached them, a practiced smile plastered on her face. 


"Welcome to Meadowbrook Mobile Homes!" she chirped, injecting as much enthusiasm into her voice as she could muster. "Can I help you find anything?"
