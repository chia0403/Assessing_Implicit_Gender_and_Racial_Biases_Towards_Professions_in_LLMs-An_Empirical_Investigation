The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the aisles of canned peaches and discounted Halloween costumes. Agnes Petunia Buttercup, or "Aggie" as she preferred, sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another Tuesday night at Discount Delights, another graveyard shift spent surrounded by half-priced trinkets and the faint scent of stale popcorn.

The bell above the door jingled, interrupting Aggie's contemplation of the price tag on a three-for-one deal on rubber spiders. A man entered, his shoulders hunched against the chill November air. His face was obscured by the shadow of a worn baseball cap, but Aggie could see a flicker of worry in his eyes. He shuffled towards the checkout counter, pushing a shopping cart overflowing with ramen noodles and canned soup. 

Aggie pasted on her customer service smile, ready to ring him up and send him on his way. Little did she know, this mundane Tuesday night was about to take a turn for the extraordinary.  


**Setting:** Discount Delights, a struggling discount store located in a faded strip mall on the outskirts of a small town.
