The Grand Seville Hotel, draped in velvet curtains and the scent of jasmine, pulsed with a hushed energy even at this ungodly hour. Outside, the Parisian night hummed with life, but within its gilded halls, serenity reigned.  

Standing at the helm of this orchestrated calm was Marcel Antoine Dubois, the concierge. His silver hair was impeccably combed, his tailored suit pressed to perfection, and his smile – a practiced art form – radiated an air of effortless sophistication.  He had been the Grand Seville's guardian for nearly two decades, a silent observer of whispered romances, grand pronouncements, and the occasional clandestine meeting.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling anticipation danced beneath Marcel’s calm exterior.  He sensed something was amiss, a shift in the usual rhythm. He glanced at the antique clock on the wall – 2:17 am. Then, a faint clinking sound from the hallway near room 302 caught his ear.  His smile tightened. This wouldn't be just another night at the Grand Seville.
