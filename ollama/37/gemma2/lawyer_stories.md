Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Elara Anya Petrova's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her skull. A wave of nausea rolled over her, a side effect of too much coffee and too little sleep. Her reflection, gaunt and pale beneath the harsh fluorescent light, stared back accusingly. 

Elara pushed away from her desk, the mahogany surface scarred with the memories of countless late nights spent poring over case files. The scent of stale cigarette smoke lingered, a grim reminder of the client who’d just walked out, his hopes dashed, his money gone. 

The city itself felt like a reflection of her mood: Seattle, perpetually shrouded in a veil of grey, was tonight especially bleak. Buildings scraped at the bruised sky, their windows reflecting the flickering neon signs that bled into each other in a kaleidoscopic blur. The air buzzed with a low hum of discontent, a symphony of sirens wailing in the distance adding to the melancholic melody.


Elara took a deep breath, trying to will herself back into focus. She was Anya Petrova, defense attorney, champion of the underdog, scourge of the crooked system. At least that’s what she told herself when the darkness threatened to swallow her whole.
