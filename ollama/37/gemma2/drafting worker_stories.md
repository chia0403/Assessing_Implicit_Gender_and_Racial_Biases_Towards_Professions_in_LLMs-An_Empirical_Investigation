The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck as he hunched over his table, a plume of chalk dust rising with every measured stroke of his compass. The air in the cramped workshop vibrated with the rhythmic clang of hammers and the whine of grinding tools. Outside, the bustling port city of Aethelgard throbbed with activity – sailors hawked their wares, merchants bartered loudly, and children chased pigeons through the narrow cobbled streets. But inside, Elias’ world was confined to his workbench, the scent of sawdust and oil heavy in his nostrils. He was a draftsman, an artisan who translated dreams into blueprints, visions into reality for the city’s architects and builders. 


Today, Elias was working on plans for a grand new cathedral, its soaring spires reaching towards the heavens, each curve and angle demanding meticulous precision. He chewed on the end of his quill, squinting at the intricate drawings before him.  A wave of weariness washed over him, but he pushed it aside. This commission, if successful, could change everything. It held the potential to elevate him from a mere draftsman to a respected architect, a man whose designs shaped Aethelgard's very skyline.  But as Elias stared at his work, a prickle of unease ran down his spine. Something felt off. He couldn't quite place it, but there was a dissonance in the plans, a subtle flaw that nagged at him like a persistent cough.
