The stale scent of spilled beer and regret hung heavy in the air of The Rusty Nail.  Neon signs outside cast an anemic yellow glow on Elara “Ellie” Nightingale’s tired face as she polished glasses, each swish leaving streaks that mirrored the worry lines etching themselves around her eyes. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mimicking the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest. It was closing time again, another night of listening to broken promises and whispered secrets, another night where Ellie felt more invisible than ever. 


The Rusty Nail itself was a relic of a bygone era, tucked away on a backstreet in New Orleans that had once throbbed with life but now seemed to exist solely in the memories of those who had known it better.  Cracked linoleum floors groaned underfoot, faded velvet booths offered dubious comfort, and a jukebox coughed out melancholy blues tunes from an age when hope was cheaper than whiskey. Ellie loved this place, despite its flaws. It was her haven, a sanctuary where she could pour out the sorrows of strangers while trying to drown her own.
