The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of hand sanitizer and something vaguely floral that Amelia Thistlewood suspected was coming from Mrs. Peterson's lavender-scented incontinence pads.  Amelia sighed, pushing aside a curtain to enter Mrs. Peterson's room at the Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the linoleum floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A lone begonia sat on the windowsill, its crimson blooms a splash of color against the faded beige walls. The room itself was sparse, furnished with a hospital bed, a chipped nightstand, and a plastic chair Amelia knew would leave a permanent imprint on her backside if she dared to sit down for long. 

Mrs. Peterson lay propped up in bed, her face creased with worry as she clutched a crumpled photograph of a smiling young woman. A faded wedding band adorned her withered finger. "My granddaughter," Mrs. Peterson had said earlier, her voice thin and reedy, "she's coming tomorrow."  Amelia knew that visit would be a bittersweet one, filled with the joy of family and the sharp pang of loss for the life Mrs. Peterson once lived, a life where she walked without assistance, danced with her husband, and held her granddaughter without trembling hands. 

Today, Amelia's job was to help bridge that gap, to guide Mrs. Peterson back towards some semblance of independence, no matter how small. To give her back the strength to hold her granddaughter's hand again.
