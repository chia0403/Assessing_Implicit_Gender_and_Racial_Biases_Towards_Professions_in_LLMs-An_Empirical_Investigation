The acrid tang of smoke stung Amelia "Amy" Harper's nostrils as she burst through the shattered front door.  Flames danced hungrily across the living room rug, casting grotesque shadows that writhed on the warped walls. The heat hit her like a wall, forcing a gasp from Amy's lungs. 

She had been the first responder, siren screaming its urgent plea down the deserted suburban street at 3:17 am. A frantic 911 call reporting a fire in progress.  The dispatcher hadn't mentioned any injuries, but Amy knew better than to assume. Now, here she was, surrounded by chaos and uncertainty, the air thick with the fear of the unknown. 


Her flashlight sliced through the darkness, illuminating a hallway choked with smoke. She could hear coughing, weak and ragged, coming from deeper inside the house. Adrenaline surged through her veins, pushing back the fear. She knew what had to be done.  

"I'm here! Can anyone hear me?" Amy shouted, her voice swallowed by the roar of the flames. "Stay calm, I'm coming!"
