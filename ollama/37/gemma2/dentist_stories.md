The smell of antiseptic clung to Dr. Amelia Blythe like a second skin. It was a scent she'd grown accustomed to over the past ten years, her dental practice nestled in the quaint heart of Oakhaven becoming an extension of herself.  

Oakhaven was the kind of town where everyone knew their neighbour's name and the local bakery still churned out fresh apple pies every Saturday morning. The cobblestone streets were lined with charming brick buildings, their facades adorned with blooming flower boxes that spilled over in a riot of colour. Amelia's practice, nestled between a quaint bookstore and a bustling coffee shop, was no exception. Its warm, inviting façade, complete with ivy crawling up the brickwork, promised comfort and care.

But behind the comforting facade, Amelia felt anything but calm. Today was her busiest day yet, a whirlwind of anxious patients and last-minute cancellations. A gnawing worry twisted in her stomach – she'd been called for jury duty next week, a responsibility she wasn't sure she could juggle with her already overflowing schedule.  

Amelia took a deep breath, forcing the anxieties back down. It was time to focus on her patients, one pearly white smile at a time.
