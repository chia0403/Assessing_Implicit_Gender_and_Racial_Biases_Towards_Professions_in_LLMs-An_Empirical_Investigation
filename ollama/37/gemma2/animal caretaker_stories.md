The scent of hay hung heavy in the air, mingled with the earthy aroma of damp soil and the sweet, cloying perfume of honeysuckle blooming by the fence line. A rooster crowed somewhere distant, echoing through the sprawling fields that stretched beyond the worn wooden fences of Whisperwind Farm. 

Elara Willowbrook, her auburn braid swaying against her denim overalls, surveyed the morning chaos with a practiced eye.  Chickens scurried beneath her feet, their clucking a constant background hum to the rhythmic clanging of the cowbell as Bessie ambled towards the milking shed. Elara, with calloused hands and a smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes, knew every creature on this farm like she knew her own siblings: their quirks, their routines, their unspoken anxieties. 

This morning, however, something felt different. The air vibrated with an almost palpable tension, a hum beneath the familiar symphony of barnyard sounds. It was subtle, easily dismissed as Elara's imagination playing tricks on her after a restless night. But deep down, she knew something was amiss.
