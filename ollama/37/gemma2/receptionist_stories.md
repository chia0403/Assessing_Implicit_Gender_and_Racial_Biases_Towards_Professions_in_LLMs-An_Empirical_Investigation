The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the chipped linoleum floor of Dr. Bartholomew's office. A faint scent of antiseptic lingered in the air, punctuated by the occasional sharp cough from the waiting room beyond.  Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch, perched on her too-high stool behind the reception desk, tapped away at the archaic computer, its screen flickering with an unsettling green hue. It was 8:30 am, and already the day felt like a marathon she hadn't signed up for. Ellie sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her tight bun. Another Tuesday in paradise.  


The waiting room door creaked open, interrupting Ellie's weary contemplation. A woman, face etched with worry, tentatively entered. She glanced at the receptionist before quickly looking around the sparse office, her eyes settling on a dusty picture frame depicting a smiling Dr. Bartholomew holding a fishing rod. "I’m... I'm here for an appointment with Dr. Bartholomew," she stammered, clutching a crumpled tissue in her hand. 


Ellie forced a smile, hoping it didn't look as strained as it felt. "Of course," she chirped, tapping away at the keyboard. “Name?”

The woman swallowed nervously. "Amelia Carter."


This was going to be another long day. Ellie could feel it in her bones.
