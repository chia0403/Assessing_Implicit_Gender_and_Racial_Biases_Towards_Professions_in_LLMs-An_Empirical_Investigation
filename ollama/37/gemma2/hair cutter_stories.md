The air in "Shear Delight" buzzed with the electric hum of clippers and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. The scent of lavender shampoo mingled with the metallic tang of freshly cut hair, creating a unique aroma that was uniquely "Shear Delight." 

Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch, her nametag pinned proudly to her faded denim apron, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. Her auburn curls were pulled back in a loose bun, revealing her freckled face and the concentration etched between her brows as she adjusted the guard on her clippers. Ellie wasn't just a hairdresser; she was a sculptor of hair, an artist who brought out the hidden beauty in every client that walked through her door. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Ellie's spine. It was the quiet.  Usually, Shear Delight hummed with chatter and laughter, but this morning, it held a disquieting stillness. The only sound besides the whirring clippers came from the ticking clock on the wall, each tick echoing in the unnerving silence.
