The air hung heavy with the scent of fresh concrete and distant rain as Amelia Beatrice Harper surveyed her latest project. It was a behemoth, a twisting spire of glass and steel designed to pierce the bruised sky above Chicago.  Amelia had poured her heart and soul into this building – The Zenith, they called it, ambitious even for a city known for its audacious architecture. But standing on the scaffolding twenty stories up, Amelia felt anything but triumphant. 

She squinted through the haze of construction dust, watching the steelworkers high above hammering away at beams that would soon support the rooftop garden, a lush emerald oasis meant to soften the building’s stark edges. It was beautiful, she had to admit, but it wasn’t her creation. The Zenith belonged to someone else now – her former mentor and rival, Charles Thorne, who had swooped in after her initial design was rejected by the board. 


The wind whipped around Amelia, carrying with it the faint echo of laughter from below. She couldn't quite place it, but the sound stirred something deep within her, a mixture of resentment and a gnawing sense of...loss. This building wasn't just a project; it was a dream she had nurtured for years, one that now felt irrevocably out of reach.
