The rusted hinges screamed their protest as Sergeant Alaric Thorne pushed open the heavy iron gate. Dawn was just beginning to blush across the horizon, casting long shadows from the skeletal trees that lined the perimeter wall of The Citadel. A biting wind whistled through the gaps in the crumbling stones, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke. 

Alaric shivered, pulling his threadbare wool cloak tighter around him. He wasn't a young man anymore, not since the Great War had ravaged their land and left him bearing the scars of countless skirmishes. But duty was a heavy mantle, one he wore with honor despite the chill that seeped into his bones and the weariness in his joints. His breath puffed out in white clouds as he surveyed the desolate landscape before him: a patchwork of burnt fields and jagged rubble, remnants of the war's fury.  

He adjusted the worn leather straps of his shield and tightened the grip on his sword hilt. Today was patrol day. A day to walk the lonely path between hope and despair, a day to remind himself that even in this shattered world, there were still things worth fighting for.
