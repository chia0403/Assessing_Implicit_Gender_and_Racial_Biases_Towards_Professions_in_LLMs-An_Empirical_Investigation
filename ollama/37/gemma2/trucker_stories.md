The engine's rhythmic rumble vibrated through Clyde Montgomery’s worn leather jacket like a second heartbeat. The late August air hung heavy with humidity, clinging to his skin even inside the cab of his eighteen-wheeler. Outside, the Texas landscape blurred into an endless tapestry of shimmering asphalt and dusty fields under the relentless glare of the setting sun. 

Clyde squinted at the rising tide of orange and purple across the horizon, its beauty tinged with a familiar melancholy. He was hauling a load of frozen chicken – destined for a supermarket somewhere in Ohio –  another nameless stop on his endless journey across America. It was the life he knew, the only life he’d ever wanted. 

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up his spine, as if the vast emptiness of the road itself was whispering secrets. He couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn’t just another run – this haul carried a weight beyond the crates of poultry in his trailer.
