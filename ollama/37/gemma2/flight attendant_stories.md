The air inside Flight 427 hummed with a low, familiar thrum. Amelia Beatrice Finch smoothed down her lavender uniform blouse, glancing at the pre-flight checklist one last time.  Outside the galley window, the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo glittered like a fallen constellation, ready to swallow them whole as they descended through the clouds. 

Amelia loved these twilight landings in Japan. The city’s vibrant lights, tinged with the soft glow of dusk, always felt like stepping into a living dream. And tonight, she was especially eager to escape the stuffy confines of the Boeing 787 for a few hours. After all, her friend Hana had promised an authentic ramen dinner at her favorite hidden spot in Shinjuku, a bustling district teeming with neon signs and whispering secrets.  

But as Amelia turned towards the cabin door, a ripple of unease ran through her. The usual murmur of passengers settling in felt strangely muted, replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the occasional cough. A shiver prickled her skin, and for a fleeting moment, she saw a flicker of something dark in the reflection of the galley window.  Something wasn’t right.
