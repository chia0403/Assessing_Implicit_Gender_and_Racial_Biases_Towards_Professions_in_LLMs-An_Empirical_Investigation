The bell above the door tinkled its melancholic tune as Elias Thornton finished sweeping up stray hairs from the floorboards of his shop, "Thornton's Trim."  His reflection in the dusty mirror behind the counter showed a man weary but not broken. He was sixty-two years old, with silver streaking through his once dark hair and lines etched around his eyes that spoke of countless conversations held while wielding scissors and clippers. The scent of bay rum and freshly laundered towels hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort he'd known since he was a boy helping his father at this very shop. 

Elias looked out the window at the faded Victorian houses lining Maple Street, their paint peeling like sunburned skin.  The once vibrant neighborhood had slowly decayed over the years, mirroring the slow decline of small businesses like his. The barbershop chair sat empty, its worn leather creaking a silent plea for a customer. Outside, the autumn wind howled through the skeletal branches of maple trees, rustling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes on the pavement. It was a Tuesday afternoon in October, and Elias felt the familiar ache of loneliness that often settled over him when the day drew to a close and Maple Street fell silent.
