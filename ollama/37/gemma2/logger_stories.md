The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Alistair Finnigan hefted his chainsaw onto his shoulder.  His boots crunched on the gravel path, each step a rhythmic pulse in the deafening silence of the early morning forest. The sun hadn't yet crested the towering pines that cloaked their little town of Timber Creek in perpetual twilight. 

Alistair squinted through the mist, his weathered face illuminated by the faint glow of his cigarette.  He inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar bite of nicotine and the crisp, cool air. Today was like any other day in Timber Creek: a symphony of the saw's whine, the grunts of men hauling logs, and the insistent whisper of wind through the ancient trees. But today felt different, a knot of unease tightening in Alistair’s gut that he couldn’t quite place. The forest seemed to hold its breath, anticipating something unseen, something… unnatural.
