The flickering fluorescent lights cast a sickly yellow glow over Beatrice "Bea" Pennell's cramped office. Paperclips clinked against metal filing cabinets, their mournful sound punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Bea's keyboard as she wrestled with yet another convoluted Form 1040. Outside, the February wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the faded brick storefront nestled on the corner of Maple and Elm. 

Bea sighed, pushing back her thick, auburn hair from her forehead. This was usually the busiest time of year for Bea's little business, "Pennell & Partners" (Partners being the imaginary duo she chatted with during particularly stressful returns). But this year felt different. The air itself seemed heavy with anxiety, a palpable tension that even the scent of stale coffee and printer ink couldn't quite mask. Every client who shuffled through her door seemed burdened by something more than just their tax obligations. 


Bea glanced at the clock â€“ 3:47 PM. Just as she was about to take another swig of lukewarm tea, a figure materialized in the doorway, silhouetted against the fading light. Bea braced herself.  It was going to be a long night.
