The siren's wail ripped through Amelia "Amy" Harper's dreams, jolting her awake like a punch to the gut. She bolted upright in bed, heart hammering against her ribs, the phantom scent of smoke clinging to her nostrils. Even after all these years, the call remained as visceral as the first day sheâ€™d joined Engine 23.

The dispatch crackled through the radio, a frantic voice relaying the details: three-alarm fire, abandoned warehouse district, possible civilian trapped. 

Engine 23 roared to life, its red chassis cutting through the slick city streets, chasing the crimson glow that painted the horizon like a burning omen. Amy gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white, her gaze fixed on the inferno ahead. This wasn't just another call; this was a battle against chaos, a dance with death.
