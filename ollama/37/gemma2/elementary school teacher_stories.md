The rhythmic thump-thump of tiny feet echoed through the hallway as Miss Eloise Beaumont, her heart brimming with an impossible amount of hope for another year of teaching, straightened the colorful bunting strung across the kindergarten classroom doorway. Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting dancing squares on the vibrant rug where stories unfolded daily. A faint scent of crayons and spilled juice hung in the air â€“ a familiar perfume that whispered of imagination and learning. 

Today was the first day back after summer break, and Miss Beaumont's mind buzzed with plans for creative projects, engaging lessons, and perhaps, just maybe, some quiet moments of reading under the shade of the giant oak tree outside. The world felt full of possibility, tinged with that special magic only a fresh start could bring.


As she hung the final piece of bunting, a giggle erupted from behind her, followed by a chorus of excited chatter.  The first wave of kindergarteners had arrived.
