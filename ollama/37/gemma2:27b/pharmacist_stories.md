Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "Oakhaven Apothecary," blurring the already faded lettering painted above the door. Eleanor Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the empty shop. The bell above the door tinkled mournfully as another gust of wind rattled the windowpane. Oakhaven was a quiet town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, and even quieter on days like this when the rain seemed determined to drown out all sound.

Eleanor adjusted her spectacles, the familiar weight comforting against the bridge of her nose. She loved her apothecary, a legacy passed down from her grandmother, filled with the earthy scent of dried herbs and the comforting creak of ancient wooden shelves. But lately, the shop had been struggling. Big chain pharmacies were popping up in neighboring towns, luring customers away with their flashy displays and discounted medications.

Today, though, Eleanor had a glimmer of hope. She'd received a mysterious letter earlier that week, inviting her to a gathering of "those who walk between worlds." The invitation promised knowledge and power, hidden deep within the ancient forests surrounding Oakhaven. Intrigued and desperate for a change in fortune, Eleanor was about to embark on a journey into the unknown, one that threatened to unravel the very fabric of reality she thought she knew.
