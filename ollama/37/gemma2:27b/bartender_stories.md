The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale beer, a familiar perfume that Eliza "Lizzie" Hayes considered her signature fragrance. Neon signs buzzed outside the window, casting fractured rainbows across the mahogany bar she'd polished to a gleam countless times. Lizzie ran a calloused thumb over the chipped rim of a highball glass, her gaze fixed on the dusty bottle of bourbon perched behind it. The Lucky Clover wasn't exactly known for its clientele – mostly gruff dockworkers and weary waitresses looking for a cheap drink and a moment's respite from their realities. Tonight, though, something felt different. A tremor ran through the floorboards, subtle yet undeniable, like the city itself was holding its breath.


Lizzie knew better than most that New Orleans held secrets beneath its cobblestone streets and ornate balconies. This feeling, however, wasn't the usual hum of magic that permeated the French Quarter. This felt ancient, primal, and tinged with a disquieting anticipation.  She glanced at the clock – 11:58 pm. Two minutes until midnight. The night was about to get interesting.
