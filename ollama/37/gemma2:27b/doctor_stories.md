Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Clinic, blurring the neon sign that flickered weakly above the entrance. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne tightened his grip on the worn leather of his stethoscope, his brow furrowed as he listened to the frantic rasp of Mrs. O'Connell's breath. The air in the tiny examination room hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and desperation.

St. Jude's was a far cry from the gleaming hospitals Dr. Thorne had trained in. Tucked away on a forgotten corner of New Orleans, it served the city's most vulnerable: the homeless, the uninsured, those swallowed whole by the relentless undertow of poverty.  

Elias wasn't sure how long he could keep this up. Every day was a battle against overwhelming odds â€“ lack of resources, dwindling staff, and the ever-present specter of burnout. But tonight, looking into Mrs. O'Connell's worried eyes, he knew he couldn't turn away. Not when hope flickered so precariously in the dim light of the examination room.
