Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon cityscape beyond into an Impressionist smear. Elias Finchley hunched over his keyboard, the glow of the monitor reflecting in his tired eyes. Empty takeout containers littered the desk beside him, testament to long hours spent wrestling with lines of code. Elias was on the verge of a breakthrough. For weeks he had been toiling away on Project Chimera, an ambitious artificial intelligence designed to mimic human creativity. Tonight, he felt it - the elusive spark about to ignite.

He ran his hand through his unruly hair, the caffeine buzz from his third energy drink wearing thin. Just one more tweak, he thought, and then Chimera would be ready for its first test run.  But as Elias reached for the enter key, a jarring crash resonated from outside, followed by a chorus of panicked screams. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest.

Something was wrong. Very wrong.
