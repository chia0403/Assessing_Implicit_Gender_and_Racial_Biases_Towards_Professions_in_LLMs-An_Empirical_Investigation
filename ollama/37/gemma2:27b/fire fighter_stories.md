Smoke choked the air, acrid and thick enough to taste. Flames danced greedily against the inky night sky, licking at the crumbling facade of the abandoned warehouse.  Captain Alistair "Ash" Montgomery coughed, his helmet visor fogging with each desperate breath. The heat was relentless, a palpable beast pressing down on him.

He barked orders into his radio, his voice strained but steady. "Truck two, advance line to the north side! Engine three, hit it with the master stream!" 


The warehouse loomed above them, a skeletal monument against the inferno's fury.  Ash could hear the roar of the fire, a hungry beast consuming everything in its path. This wasn't just another routine blaze. Something felt different this time â€“ an unsettling unease prickled at his senses, warning him of something unseen lurking within the flames.
