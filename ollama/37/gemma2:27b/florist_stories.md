The scent of jasmine and honeysuckle hung thick in the air, a cloying sweetness that both calmed and agitated Elara Rosethorn. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her shop, "Petal & Thorn," illuminating motes dancing in its golden rays. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oldhaven bustled with life; merchants hawked their wares, children chased pigeons, and carriages clattered by, leaving trails of dust in their wake. 

Elara, however, remained oblivious to the vibrant tableau unfolding beyond her shop window. Her brow furrowed as she scrutinized a wilting lily, its once-proud bloom now drooping with fatigue. "Stubborn thing," she muttered, gently prodding its stem. A sigh escaped her lips â€“ today was already shaping up to be one of those days. The lilies were due for delivery to Lady Elmsworth's annual garden party, and the last thing Elara needed was a wilted centerpiece stealing the show.
