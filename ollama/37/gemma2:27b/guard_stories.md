The wind howled through the crumbling stone archway, whistling a mournful tune that Elias Thorne couldn't help but find fitting. He tightened his grip on his spear, the rough wood biting into his calloused palms. Above him, the sky pulsed with bruised purple and angry orange as the last vestiges of daylight bled away.

Thorne stood watch atop the crumbling ramparts of Fort Alastor, a once-proud bastion now reduced to a skeletal silhouette against the dying light. Vines snaked up its weathered walls, their emerald tendrils clutching at cracked bricks like grasping claws. Below him, the desolate plains stretched out in an endless, windswept expanse. Not a single tree dared to break the monotony, and only the occasional scuttling creature dared disturb the eerie silence.

It had been ten years since Thorne last saw another soul besides himself. Ten years since the plague swept through the land, leaving Fort Alastor a lonely sentinel in a world ravaged by death. He had sworn an oath to protect the fort, even if it meant protecting nothing but crumbling stone and his own memories. But tonight, something felt different. The wind carried a new scent â€“ a faint metallic tang that pricked at Thorne's nostrils and set his nerves on edge.

He squinted into the gathering darkness, searching for any sign of movement beyond the fort's desolate perimeter. A flicker of light in the distance caught his eye, too brief to be certain. His pulse quickened. Was it a lone traveler? Or something else entirely?
