Rain hammered against the attic windowpane, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. Eleanor Vance sighed, her breath fogging the air above her steaming mug of chamomile tea.  The manuscript lay open on her antique writing desk, its pages blank save for a single line: "The old lighthouse keeper squinted at the horizon..."

Eleanor had been staring at it for hours, the words refusing to flow. Inspiration, usually as constant a companion as the scent of lavender wafting from the corner sachet, had deserted her. The cramped attic room, once her haven, felt stifling tonight.  Even the worn Persian rug beneath her feet seemed to mock her writer's block with its intricate patterns, teeming with stories she couldn't seem to access.

Outside, the wind howled, a mournful symphony that mirrored Eleanor's mood. The ancient Victorian house creaked and groaned under the onslaught, but the sound was almost comforting. At least something else was making noise besides the incessant ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. 


Eleanor pushed back her chair, the legs scraping against the wooden floorboards. She needed a change of scenery. Perhaps a walk along the windswept cliffs overlooking the storm-tossed ocean would stir her imagination.  Or maybe, just maybe, she'd find inspiration in the ghostly tales whispered about the old lighthouse that stood sentinel at the edge of the world.
