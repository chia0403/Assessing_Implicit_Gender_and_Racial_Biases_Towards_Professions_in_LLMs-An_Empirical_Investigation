The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust, sweat, and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Rosalind Davenport surveyed the chaos unfolding on the stage of the Grand Old Theatre - a relic from a bygone era whose faded grandeur barely concealed its crumbling bones. Scratched floorboards groaned under the weight of hastily assembled sets, mismatched props lay strewn about like forgotten dreams, and the chorus line, clad in ill-fitting costumes, stumbled through their steps with the grace of drunken flamingos.

Amy pinched the bridge of her nose, willing away a burgeoning headache. Opening night of "The Tempest" was mere hours away, and it seemed everything that could go wrong had already done so. The lead actor's voice had gone hoarse from screaming at his understudy, the lighting technician was suffering a mysterious bout of stage fright (a cruel irony), and a rogue pigeon had taken up residence in the rafters, contributing a rather unwelcome soundtrack to rehearsals.

This wasn't the grand Shakespearean production Amy had envisioned when she'd first signed on as director. This was a disaster waiting to happen, and she, unfortunately, was the one responsible for keeping it from crashing down around them.
