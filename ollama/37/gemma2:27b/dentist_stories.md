The flickering fluorescent light above Henrietta "Hettie" Bellweather's dental chair cast long, dancing shadows across the room. A faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, battling with the sweet aroma of lavender emanating from the diffuser Hettie had insisted on installing. It was supposed to be calming, but all it did for Hettie at this moment was highlight the tension knotting her shoulders.

Outside, a late summer thunderstorm raged, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. Her normally bustling practice in the quaint seaside town of Oakhaven was eerily quiet. The storm had chased away all her scheduled patients, leaving Hettie alone with her anxieties and the echoing tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. 

Today was supposed to be different. Today, Hettie was expecting a special patient â€“ one that could change everything for her struggling practice. This wasn't just any ordinary toothache; this was the chance to treat the infamous recluse, Silas Blackwood, who hadn't seen a dentist in decades and rumour had it, possessed a mouth full of secrets as intriguing as his enigmatic past.
