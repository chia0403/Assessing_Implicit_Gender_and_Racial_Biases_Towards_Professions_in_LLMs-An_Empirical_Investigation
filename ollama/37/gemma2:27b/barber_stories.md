The smell of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elijah Bartholomew "Eli" Jones. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpane of his barbershop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its path. Outside, the street bustled with life – the rhythmic clang of trolley bells, the shouts of newspaper boys, and the incessant honking of Model Ts vying for space on the cobblestone streets. Eli leaned back against his worn leather chair, wiping down a straight razor with practiced ease. He surveyed his domain: faded posters advertising "The Latest Styles" adorned peeling paint, a lone barber pole spun lazily outside, its red stripes barely visible through the grime.  

Eli sighed. Business had been slow lately, ever since that flashy new salon opened up two blocks down, boasting electric clippers and "scientific hair analysis." Eli scoffed at the notion. He'd been cutting hair in this very spot for twenty years – he didn’t need fancy gadgets to know what looked good on a man.

But today was different. The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow. A chill ran down Eli's spine, a feeling he hadn't experienced since his days as a young soldier during the war.
