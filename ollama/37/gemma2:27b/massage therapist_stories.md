Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Serenity Springs Massage Therapy, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside Elara Solstice. The scent of lavender oil usually so calming seemed to mock her with its tranquility. Her fingers traced the worn grooves of the wooden massage table, feeling the familiar smooth surface that held countless hours of tension, pain, and release. Yet today, it felt alien.

Elara had always found solace in the rhythm of kneading muscles, easing knotted shoulders, and bringing a sense of peace to her clients. But lately, a deep unease gnawed at her. The whispers of an impending change, a shift in the very fabric of her life, echoed through her bones like a haunting melody. It had started subtly - a strange dream about a crumbling stone archway, the scent of rosemary clinging to her clothes even though she hadn't used it in years. Now, with every gust of wind that rattled the windows, those whispers grew louder.
