The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt oil, a familiar perfume to Elias "Eli" Moreau, owner and operator of Eli's Auto Repair. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windows of his cluttered garage, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid Louisiana air. Outside, cicadas droned their relentless summer song, punctuated by the occasional honk of a passing truck on Highway 90.

Eli wiped grease-stained hands on a faded blue rag, squinting at the engine he was rebuilding. It was a classic '67 Mustang, its once vibrant crimson paint now dulled and chipped. The owner, a young woman named Marie, had inherited it from her grandfather and was determined to restore it to its former glory. Eli understood that sentiment; he'd poured his own heart into rebuilding a rusted-out '55 Chevy pickup years ago, the truck now his pride and joy.
