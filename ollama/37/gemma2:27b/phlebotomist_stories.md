The stale air of Mercy General hung heavy, laced with the metallic tang of antiseptic and the faintest whiff of fear. Emilia Blackwood adjusted her turquoise scrubs, the color clashing magnificently with the hospital's sterile white walls. She was known for her unconventional choices â€“  from her vibrant hair streaks to her penchant for whistling show tunes while drawing blood. But today, even the normally upbeat melodies in her head couldn't pierce the oppressive atmosphere. 

A new patient had arrived, a gaunt man with haunted eyes and a tremor running through his skeletal frame. His chart labeled him Johnathan Reed, admitted for "unexplained fatigue and anemia." Emilia felt a prickle of unease; something about his pallid complexion and the way he flinched at her approach whispered of secrets darker than any blood test could reveal.
