The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the rows of identical beige desks. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was another Tuesday morning in the cavernous call center of "Sunrise Solutions," a company whose name felt as ironic as a snowman in July. 

Eleanor tapped her manicured nails against her desk, her reflection staring back from the screen displaying yet another rejected lead. She'd been at Sunrise for two years, diligently dialing numbers and reciting the same tired sales pitch about revolutionizing productivity through their time-management software. Yet, her quota remained stubbornly out of reach. Today, however, a flicker of defiance ignited in Eleanor's usually placid hazel eyes. Today, she was determined to break free from this beige purgatory.
