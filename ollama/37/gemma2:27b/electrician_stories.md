Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the old warehouse, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cavernous space.  Sparks showered from Elias Blackwood's wire strippers as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn connection. The air hung heavy with the smell of ozone and damp concrete.  Elias, his forehead slick with sweat, cursed under his breath. This ancient wiring was proving to be more of a challenge than he'd anticipated. 

The warehouse, once a bustling hub for shipping goods along the river, now stood derelict, its walls scarred with graffiti and the windows boarded shut. Elias had been hired by a developer hoping to breathe new life into the building, transforming it into a trendy loft complex. But first, the labyrinthine network of outdated wiring needed taming.  

Elias wiped his brow with a grease-stained sleeve, squinting at the faded schematic clutched in his hand. It was barely legible, the ink smudged and running like tears. He sighed. This wasn't going to be easy. But Elias Blackwood prided himself on tackling tough jobs. After all, there weren't many electricians who could handle a building this old with its cobwebbed history and hidden dangers lurking in every shadowed corner.
