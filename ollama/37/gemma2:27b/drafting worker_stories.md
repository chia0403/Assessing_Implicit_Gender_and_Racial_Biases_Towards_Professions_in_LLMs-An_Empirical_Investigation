The smell of graphite dust and old coffee hung heavy in the air of the cramped drafting room. Outside, rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the industrial shipyard. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright sighed, running a weary hand through her short, auburn hair. Her drafting table was littered with blueprints for the latest cargo ship, each line and curve demanding meticulous attention. Amy had been hunched over them for hours, her back protesting with every ache and twinge.

She longed to be outside, breathing fresh air instead of this stale, inky atmosphere. But deadlines loomed, and her team relied on her precise drafts to ensure the ship's construction progressed smoothly. The rhythmic clattering of a nearby drafting machine provided a constant backdrop to her work, a metronome marking the relentless passage of time. 

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled Amy from her concentration. Before she could even respond, the door swung open, revealing Mr. Davies, the shipyard foreman, his face etched with concern.
