The scent of dust and damp stone hung heavy in Elias Thornhill's workshop. Sunlight, slanted by the late afternoon sun, painted long stripes across the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the rhythm of the city - the clattering carriages, the hawkers' cries, the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer - faded into a dull murmur behind the thick stone walls. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, chipped away at a block of rough-hewn granite, his chisel ringing out with each precise blow.

He was carving a gargoyle, a snarling beast destined to perch atop the cathedral spire, its stony gaze forever fixed on the bustling city below. Elias, though known for his meticulous work and unwavering patience, felt a restlessness gnawing at him today. It wasn't the stone; he understood its language, its secrets whispered in the grain and striations. It was something else, a yearning that echoed in the hollow spaces of his heart.
