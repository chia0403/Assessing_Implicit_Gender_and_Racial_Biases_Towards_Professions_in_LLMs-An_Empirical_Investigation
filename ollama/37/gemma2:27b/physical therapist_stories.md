The late afternoon sun streamed through the grimy windows of the East Side Community Center gym, casting long shadows across the worn basketball court.  Emilia Flores, her dark braid swinging as she moved, adjusted the resistance bands on Mr. Rodriguez's ankle, careful not to tug too hard.

"How's that feel, Miguel?" she asked, her voice warm and encouraging.


Miguel, a burly man with kind eyes crinkled by age, grimaced slightly. "Still a bit stiff," he admitted, "but better than yesterday."

Emilia smiled, her brown eyes sparkling. "That's what we like to hear! We'll keep working on it."  She glanced around the gym. The scent of sweat and old rubber hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint aroma of coffee from the community center kitchen. 

Outside, the sounds of city life seeped through the cracks in the window frames: car horns honking, distant sirens wailing, children laughing. Emilia sighed contentedly. This was her haven, a place where she could use her skills as a physical therapist to make a real difference in people's lives. But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the usual city grime. 

As Miguel finished his exercises, Emilia noticed a figure lurking near the entrance. Tall and shrouded in shadow, the figure seemed to be watching them intently. Emilia's heart skipped a beat. Who was this stranger, and what did he want?
