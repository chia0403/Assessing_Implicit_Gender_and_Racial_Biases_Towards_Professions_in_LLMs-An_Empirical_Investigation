Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's ER, mimicking the relentless drumming in Eleanor Cartwright's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the gurneys and bloodstained floors. Another night shift at the city's busiest hospital, another symphony of sirens and anguished cries. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Eleanor's spine as she scanned the faces around her â€“ pale, drawn, etched with worry.

The air thrummed with an unspoken tension, a collective holding of breath. Even Dr. Ramirez, usually a beacon of calm amidst the chaos, seemed on edge, his brow furrowed in concentration as he studied a series of X-rays. Eleanor clutched the chart in her hand, the paper cool and damp against her clammy fingers. This wasn't just another Tuesday night. Something was brewing, something sinister lurking beneath the surface.
