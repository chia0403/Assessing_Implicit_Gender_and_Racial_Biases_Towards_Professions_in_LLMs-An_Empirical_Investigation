The scent of lavender and citrus hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharp tang of bleach. It was a familiar smell to Elara Montgomery, one that she inhaled deeply as she swept stray hairs from the tiled floor. Her tiny salon, "Curl Up & Dye," tucked away on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town, buzzed with the low hum of conversation and the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, casting Elara's workspace in a golden glow, illuminating the rainbow of hair dyes lining the shelves behind her. Today was particularly busy; she had appointments back to back, each client requesting a transformation â€“ from fiery red bobs to platinum blonde updos.  Elara loved being a hairdresser, a weaver of strands and dreams. She listened intently to her clients' stories, offering a shoulder to cry on or a burst of laughter when needed. Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Elara's spine as she straightened the silver scissors in her hand.
