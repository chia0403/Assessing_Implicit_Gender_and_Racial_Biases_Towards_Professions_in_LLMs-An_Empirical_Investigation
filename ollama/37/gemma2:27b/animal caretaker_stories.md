The pungent scent of disinfectant mingled with hay and the musky aroma of wet dog fur. Amelia Roseweather grimaced, tucking a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she waded deeper into the kennels. Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of lavender and rose, but inside the Havenwood Animal Shelter, it was always a symphony of barks, meows, and the occasional disgruntled hiss. Amelia loved them all, these creatures abandoned, lost, or simply unwanted. 

Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. A new arrival awaited her - a magnificent black wolfdog with piercing amber eyes and a history shrouded in mystery. Whispers of aggression and a supposed bite incident had preceded him, making even the seasoned staff hesitant. Amelia, however, felt an inexplicable pull towards the creature. Could she earn his trust? Could Havenwood offer him a safe haven, or would he forever remain a shadow in the corners of their hearts, forever wild at heart?
