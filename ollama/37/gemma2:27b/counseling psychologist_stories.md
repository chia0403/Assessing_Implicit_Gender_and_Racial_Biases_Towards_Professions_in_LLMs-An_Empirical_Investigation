Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionist painting of greys and yellows. Inside her office, Dr. Eloise Cavendish sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic patter. It was one of those days when even the city seemed to be weeping. She glanced at the clock - 4:47 pm.  Only thirteen minutes until her last appointment of the day. Eloise wished she could call it quits early and curl up with a good book, but responsibility tugged at her. A new client was scheduled for 5pm sharp, a young man named Simon who had requested her specifically. 

Eloise's office, perched on the sixteenth floor of a modern building overlooking Central Park, was a haven of calm amidst the urban chaos.  Soft, warm lighting bathed the room in a comforting glow. Bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with volumes on psychology and philosophy, interspersed with framed photographs – family, friends, travel memories. A plush armchair sat opposite her desk, inviting conversation and introspection.

Despite the tranquility she'd cultivated, Eloise couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled over her since she received Simon's file earlier that day. There was something about his brief description - "struggling with existential dread and a sense of isolation" – that resonated deeply within her.
