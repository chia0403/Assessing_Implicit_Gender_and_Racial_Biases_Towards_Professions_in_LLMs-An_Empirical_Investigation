Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, mimicking the chaotic symphony raging inside her chest.  She stood at the whiteboard, marker frozen in midair above an unfinished equation, as the bell for third period shrieked its mournful cry.

Ms. Vance taught Algebra II at Harrison High, a sprawling brick behemoth perched on the edge of a sleepy Pennsylvania town. The school was a universe unto itself, teeming with hormonal teenagers navigating the treacherous currents of adolescence.  Eleanor loved them, fiercely and unconditionally. But today, her usual enthusiasm felt as dampened as the chalkboard eraser clutched in her hand. 

A crumpled letter lay on her desk, its stark white envelope mocking her with an air of finality. The words "Resignation" and "effective immediately" swam before her eyes, blurring into a dizzying vortex of anxiety and uncertainty. Her heart pounded against her ribs like a frantic drummer desperate to escape the cage of her chest.
