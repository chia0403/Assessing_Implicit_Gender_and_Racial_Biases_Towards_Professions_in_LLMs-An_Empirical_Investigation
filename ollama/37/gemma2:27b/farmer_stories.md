The rooster's crow was barely audible over the insistent howl of the north wind clawing at Silas Blackwood's farmhouse. Dawn was a bruised purple smudge on the horizon, threatening to break through the grey blanket of pre-dawn gloom. Silas, weathered and strong like an ancient oak, shivered as he pulled his woolen coat tighter around him. The chill bit deeper than usual this morning, seeping into his bones despite the layers he wore. He glanced at the frosted fields stretching beyond his porch, their once vibrant golden wheat now skeletal stalks bowing under the weight of winter's grip.

This year had been a cruel one, even for a man accustomed to the capricious nature of the land. The drought in the summer had stunted his crops, leaving him with a meager harvest. Now, the early freeze threatened what little he had left.  Silas clenched his jaw, determination hardening his gaze. He wouldn't let this defeat him. Not after all he'd been through.  His family depended on him, and Silas Blackwood was a man who always rose to meet his challenges.
