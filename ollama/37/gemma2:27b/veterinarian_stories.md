The pungent aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the musk of wet dog fur and the faint metallic tang of blood. Rain lashed against the windows of Elmwood Veterinary Clinic, blurring the neon 'Open' sign into an indistinct smear. Emilia Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray curl back from her forehead as she surveyed the waiting room. It was a typical Wednesday evening â€“ overflowing with anxious pet owners and their furry companions. 

A ginger tabby yowled pathetically from its carrier, while a portly bulldog snored softly, oblivious to the chaos. Emilia knew each whimper, each whine, held a story, a tiny thread woven into the tapestry of life in this small, seaside town. Tonight, however, she felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. It had been quiet for too long, and something about the stillness before the storm unnerved her.
