Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the relentless pounding in Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's skull. The neon sign outside his office flickered erratically, casting sickly green shadows across the cluttered room. Empty coffee cups and crumpled case files littered the desk, testament to a week spent chasing ghosts – literally and figuratively. Teddy, his trench coat still damp from a fruitless stakeout, slumped back in his creaky chair, the springs groaning in protest.  He was on the verge of calling it a night when a sharp rap on the door startled him upright. 

Through the rain-streaked glass, he saw a silhouette – tall and slender, shrouded in a dark hooded coat. Teddy knew better than to trust appearances, especially in this part of town. He cautiously approached the door, his hand hovering near the revolver tucked beneath his jacket. "Who is it?" he barked, his voice raspy from too much cheap whiskey and too little sleep.
