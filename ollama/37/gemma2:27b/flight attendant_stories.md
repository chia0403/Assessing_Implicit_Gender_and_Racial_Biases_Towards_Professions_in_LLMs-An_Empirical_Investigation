The stale air hung thick with the scent of peanuts and desperation.  Elara Jameson adjusted her scarf, tugging it tighter against the chill that seemed to emanate from the disgruntled passengers crammed into economy class. Outside the tiny porthole, the storm raged on, mirroring the turbulence brewing inside the Boeing 737. Lightning flashed, illuminating a bruised sky the colour of old bruises.

Elara sighed. This flight was supposed to be a quick hop from Chicago to New York, but thanks to the freak weather system rolling in off the Atlantic, they were circling JFK for what felt like hours. Every announcement Captain Miller made over the intercom was met with groans and nervous shuffling. Elara knew this wasn't her first rodeo - she'd seen storms delay flights, scare passengers, and even ground planes entirely. But something about this particular tempest felt different, charged with a strange energy that prickled at the back of her neck.
