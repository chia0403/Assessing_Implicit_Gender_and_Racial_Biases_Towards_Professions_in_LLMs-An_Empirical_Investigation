Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia "Amy" Thornton's cramped apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  A crumpled rejection letter lay on the desk, its words stinging like acid: "While we admire your tenacity, Ms. Thornton, this story simply doesn't fit our current editorial direction." Tenacity was one word for it. Amy preferred "obsessive." For months she'd been chasing the whisper of a conspiracy surrounding the sudden closure of the city's beloved historical society, convinced there was more to the story than met the eye.

Now, with dwindling savings and mounting bills, her editor at the struggling local paper had dealt the final blow. Amy stared out at the rain-soaked cityscape, the flickering neon signs blurring through a veil of water.  Giving up wasn't an option. She owed it to herself, to the community, and to the ghost of Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, the society's enigmatic former curator, whose cryptic last words haunted Amy's dreams: "The truth lies buried beneath the cobblestones."

With a sigh, Amy grabbed her battered raincoat and headed out into the storm, determined to unearth that truth, no matter the cost. The cobblestone streets of Oldtown beckoned, their ancient stones holding secrets as old as the city itself.
