The humid Charleston air clung to Amelia Rose Thornton like a second skin as she hoisted the overflowing laundry basket up the grand staircase of the Vanderlyn mansion. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight slanting through the arched windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of the once-opulent house. Each step Amelia took creaked a mournful protest, echoing her own weariness.

For twenty years, Amelia had been tending to the Vanderlyns' sprawling home on the Battery, polishing silver that shimmered like moonlight and scrubbing marble floors until they gleamed. The Vanderlyn family itself, however, had long since faded away â€“  scattered by scandal and misfortune, leaving Amelia the sole custodian of their memories.

Today, a new chapter was beginning. A young couple, the Whitneys, were moving in, eager to restore the mansion to its former glory. Amelia hoped they understood the weight of history that lay within these walls, the unspoken stories etched into the peeling wallpaper and worn-out carpets. She braced herself for their arrival, unsure if she was ready to share her secrets with strangers.
