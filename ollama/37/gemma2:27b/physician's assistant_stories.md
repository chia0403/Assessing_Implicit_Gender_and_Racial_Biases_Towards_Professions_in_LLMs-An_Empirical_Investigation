The humid New Orleans air hung thick, heavy with the scent of jasmine and frying beignets.  A persistent drizzle painted the cobblestone streets in shades of gray, mirroring Eliza Beaumont's mood. She tugged her rain jacket tighter around herself as she hurried towards Mercy Hospital, its aging brick fa√ßade barely visible through the misty curtain. 

Eliza had been working double shifts at Mercy for weeks, ever since Hurricane Ida swept through the city, leaving a trail of destruction and despair in its wake. As a physician's assistant, she found herself patching up everything from infected wounds to broken bones, her exhaustion overshadowed by the grim determination etched on the faces of those she treated.  The relentless onslaught of patients, each carrying their own story of loss and resilience, was starting to wear on her. Yet, beneath the fatigue, a flicker of hope remained - a testament to the indomitable spirit of New Orleans and its people.
