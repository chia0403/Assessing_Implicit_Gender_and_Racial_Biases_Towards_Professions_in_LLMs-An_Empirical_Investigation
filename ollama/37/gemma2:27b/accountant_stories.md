The flickering fluorescent lights above cast an anemic glow across Eleanor Cartwright's desk, illuminating stacks of invoices like miniature concrete pillars. Rain lashed against the windows of her cramped cubicle, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Another late night, another mountain of receipts to reconcile. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma in the chaotic world of accounting at Cartwright & Sons, a mid-sized firm specializing in small businesses. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. 

She longed for a life beyond spreadsheets and tax forms, a life where numbers weren't her sole companions. Tonight, however, she was trapped – tethered to her desk by the looming deadline for Mr. Henderson's bakery audit. The man had a penchant for misplacing receipts like they were autumn leaves in a gale, leaving Eleanor to piece together his financial puzzle with the precision of a surgeon.
