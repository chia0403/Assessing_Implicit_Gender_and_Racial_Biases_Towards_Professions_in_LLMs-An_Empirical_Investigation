Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Blackwood’s practice, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. A mournful symphony played by wind chimes tinkled from somewhere outside, competing with the insistent drumming of raindrops. Inside, the waiting room smelled faintly of lavender and disinfectant, a blend Amelia had meticulously cultivated to soothe her patients’ anxieties.

She glanced at the clock – 5:57 pm. Only three minutes until closing time. Usually, she’d be bustling about, tidying up charts and prepping for tomorrow's appointments. But tonight, a heavy unease settled in her stomach, a feeling as familiar as the ache in her own lower back from years of adjusting spines. Amelia was expecting a patient unlike any other – one who had booked an appointment under the enigmatic name "Shadowfax" and requested a late-night session.

Amelia straightened the stack of brochures on spinal health, trying to ignore the prickling sensation at the back of her neck. This wasn't the first time she’d received odd requests in her small town practice nestled amongst the rolling hills of Vermont. Yet, something about "Shadowfax" – the cryptic name, the late hour, and a voice mail message that had crackled with static and barely audible whispers – made this encounter feel different.  

The chime above the door jingled, startling Amelia. She turned to see a figure shrouded in shadows stepping into the waiting room.
