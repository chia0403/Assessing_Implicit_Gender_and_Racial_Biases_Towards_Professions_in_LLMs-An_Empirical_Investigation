Rain lashed against the arched windows of Eleanor Ainsworth's studio, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of greys and yellows. The rhythmic drumming was a fitting soundtrack to Eleanor's current mood – one of exasperated frustration. Spread across her drafting table lay blueprints for the Blackwood Manor renovation, a project that had promised grandeur but now threatened to become a grand disaster. 

Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her fiery red curls, which were beginning to mirror the chaotic state of her mind. She wasn't afraid of challenges; in fact, she thrived on them. Transforming neglected spaces into havens of beauty and functionality was her passion. But the Blackwoods – a notoriously eccentric family with more demands than sense – were pushing even Eleanor's boundless patience to its limit.
