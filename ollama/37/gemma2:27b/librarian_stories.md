Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Oakhaven Public Library, each drop an insistent drumbeat against the aged glass. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, peered over her spectacles as she rearranged a teetering stack of returned Agatha Christie novels.  The scent of aging paper and dust mingled with the earthy aroma of wet stone that seeped through the library's ancient foundation. Oakhaven, nestled deep within the emerald embrace of the Blackwood Forest, was a town perpetually shrouded in mist and legend, its inhabitants as steeped in whispers of folklore as they were in strong black tea. Eleanor, with her quiet demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of forgotten lore, fit right into this tapestry of mystery. 


The library, built in the shadow of a gnarled oak older than the town itself, was Eleanor's sanctuary. Its towering shelves, laden with centuries of stories, hummed with unspoken secrets. Today, however, an unsettling stillness hung in the air. No one had entered since the storm began, leaving Eleanor alone with her thoughts and the rhythmic patter of rain.  

Suddenly, a sharp crack of thunder rattled the windows, followed by a chilling gust of wind that extinguished the flickering gaslights, plunging the library into darkness. Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. This wasn't just any storm...this felt different.
