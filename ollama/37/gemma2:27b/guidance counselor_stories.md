Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Amelia Cartwright's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her.  The worn carpet beneath her feet felt damp, mirroring the chill that had settled in her bones. Outside, the late October sun struggled to penetrate the grey sky, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek High School.

Ms. Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Her office, usually a haven of pastel hues and motivational posters, felt suffocating today. The overflowing inbox on her desk, piled high with college applications and desperate pleas for help, seemed to mock her inability to fix everything. 

The bell signaling the end of fifth period clanged through the halls, bringing a wave of teenage voices echoing past her door. But Ms. Cartwright wasn't ready to face them.  Not today. Not when she felt like she was drowning in the weight of their expectations.
