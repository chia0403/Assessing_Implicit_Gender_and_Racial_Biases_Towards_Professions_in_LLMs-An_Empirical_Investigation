The air hung heavy with the smell of petrichor and decaying leaves as Alistair Finchley surveyed his domain. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of rose and gold, casting long shadows across the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor. The ancient oak tree at the edge of the property creaked softly, its branches swaying gently in the early morning breeze.

Alistair, a man whose weathered face bore testament to years spent coaxing life from the earth, ran his gnarled hand over the smooth surface of a rosebush. He could feel the dampness clinging to the petals, the weight of last night's rain still lingering. He knew this garden like the back of his hand; each twist and turn of the cobblestone paths, each hidden nook where wildflowers bloomed defiantly amongst the manicured hedges.

Today, however, something felt different. A sense of unease tugged at him, an almost imperceptible vibration in the air. The usual symphony of birdsong seemed muted, replaced by a disconcerting silence punctuated only by the rustle of leaves and the distant caw of a crow.
