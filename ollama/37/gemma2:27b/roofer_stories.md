The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning his already ruddy skin a shade deeper. He perched precariously on the edge of the slanted roof, one calloused hand gripping the rusty chimney, the other expertly wielding a hammer against a stubborn slate tile. Below him, the sprawling Victorian mansion sprawled like a slumbering giant, its gingerbread trim and ornate windows shimmering in the heat haze. Silas had tackled his fair share of challenging roofs in his thirty years as a roofer, but this one - with its dizzying angles and precarious dormers â€“ was testing even his seasoned patience. 

He squinted at the horizon, where storm clouds were gathering like a brooding army. The air, thick with the scent of pine and freshly cut grass, suddenly grew heavy with the promise of rain. Silas cursed under his breath. A downpour wouldn't just make his job harder; it could be downright dangerous up here. He needed to finish this section before the sky opened up. 

But then a flicker of movement caught his eye. A shadow darted behind one of the mansion's many stained-glass windows, followed by a faint scratching sound. Silas paused, his hammer suspended mid-air. Curiosity gnawed at him. This house had been empty for years - everyone in town said it was haunted.
