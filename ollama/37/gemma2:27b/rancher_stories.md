Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling reddish-brown against the unrelenting azure sky. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of another scorching afternoon on the sprawling Chisholm Ranch.  Cletus Jeremiah "CJ" Chisholm squinted at the horizon, his weathered face etched with concern. He could see the withered silhouette of cottonwood trees swaying listlessly in the distance, their leaves already surrendering to the relentless drought that had plagued their corner of Texas for months. 

CJ tugged on the brim of his Stetson, shielding his eyes from the harsh glare of the sun. The rhythmic clinking of spurs echoed against the silence as he ambled towards the barn, a heavy sigh escaping his lips.  This land, passed down through generations of Chisholm men, was his lifeblood. But the drought threatened to drain it dry, just like the shrinking creek bed that snaked its way across the property.

He needed rain. Desperately.
