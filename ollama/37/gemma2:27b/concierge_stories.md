Rain lashed against the ornate glass doors of The Grand Blackwood, sending icy tendrils creeping across the polished marble floor. Esmeralda Thorne, Chief Concierge of the esteemed hotel, stood ramrod straight behind her mahogany desk, observing the chaos with a practiced eye.

The lobby buzzed with frustrated travellers huddled beneath dripping umbrellas, their faces etched with disappointment and irritation. A rogue gust of wind whipped through the open doors, momentarily extinguishing the flickering flame in the grand fireplace. Esmeralda barely blinked, expertly flicking her wrist to summon a passing bellhop who promptly re-lit the fire, bathing the room once more in its warm glow.

Despite the tempest raging outside, Esmeralda remained an oasis of calm. Her starched white uniform impeccably pressed, her silver hair pulled back into a tight bun, she exuded an air of quiet authority and unwavering composure.
