The crayon drawing on Esmeralda "Esme" Castillo's desk depicted a stick figure with impossibly long arms and legs, reaching toward a sun the color of mango sorbet. It was signed in wobbly letters: "Billy." Esme smiled, remembering Billy's wide-eyed wonder as he'd presented it to her earlier. His glee at capturing the essence of "reaching for your dreams" (as his mother had explained) warmed her heart more than any caffeine ever could.

The classroom buzzed with pre-naptime energy: giggling over misplaced building blocks, whispered secrets shared between tiny friends, and the relentless tinkling of a toy xylophone wielded by a mini maestro named Lucas. Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking the playground, casting long shadows across the brightly colored rug and alphabet chart on the wall.

Esme inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of crayons, glue, and the faint sweetness of juice boxes. This was her sanctuary, her haven from the chaos of the outside world. Here, amidst the boundless imagination and unfiltered joy of five-year-olds, she found a purpose that transcended lesson plans and standardized tests. 

But today, a shadow loomed over Esme's usual serenity. The principal had summoned her for a meeting after school. A shiver ran down her spine. Something wasn't right.
