The Nevada desert shimmered under a relentless sun, blurring the horizon into a hazy mirage. Diesel fumes and dust hung heavy in the air as Reginald "Red" Mahoney wrestled his eighteen-wheeler up the steep incline. He squinted through the grime-coated windshield, his weathered face etched with a familiar blend of exhaustion and grim determination. The CB crackled with static and the bored drawl of another trucker somewhere down the endless ribbon of asphalt. Red ignored it, focusing on the treacherous curves ahead. 

He was hauling a load of delicate electronics from Los Angeles to Reno, a job that paid well but carried its own set of anxieties. One wrong move on these winding mountain roads could mean thousands in damages, not to mention a hefty fine. But Red wasn't one to back down from a challenge. He'd been driving these highways for over twenty years, his calloused hands and steel-grey eyes testament to the countless miles he'd logged and the dangers he'd weathered.
