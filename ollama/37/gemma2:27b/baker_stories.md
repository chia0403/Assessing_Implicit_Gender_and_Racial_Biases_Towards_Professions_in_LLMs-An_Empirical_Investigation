The scent of burnt sugar clung to Eloise Beatrice Clementine like a second skin. It was inevitable, really. Growing up above her grandmother's bakery in the heart of Montmartre, Paris, meant being perpetually dusted with flour and imbued with the aroma of caramelized goodness. This morning, however, the smell was tinged with something acrid – a testament to Eloise's disastrous attempt at crafting croissants.

The early morning light filtering through the shop window illuminated the carnage: misshapen dough lumps resembling monstrous insects rather than delicate pastries. Eloise sighed, her shoulders slumping. Her grandmother, Madame Clementine, whose hands had always produced perfect, flaky croissants with an almost magical touch, was gone now, leaving the bakery and its legacy in Eloise's hesitant hands. 

The weight of expectation pressed down on her like a heavy, yeasty dough.  Today was Bastille Day, the busiest day of the year for "Clementine's Confections," and Eloise had to deliver. But with croissants stubbornly refusing to cooperate, doubt gnawed at her confidence. Could she truly carry on her grandmother’s tradition?
