The air hung thick with the smell of jasmine incense and stale cigarette smoke, a heady cocktail that always seemed to linger in the Grand Sapphire Hotel lobby.  Theodore "Teddy" Bellingham, resplendent in his crisp crimson uniform and jaunty bellhop cap, expertly maneuvered a luggage trolley laden with steamer trunks and wicker suitcases through the throng of guests. The afternoon sun streamed through the stained-glass dome overhead, casting fractured rainbows across the polished marble floor. A gaggle of giggling debutantes, their laughter tinkling like wind chimes, darted past him, leaving behind a trail of lavender perfume. Teddy sighed inwardly. Another day, another mountain of luggage, another parade of wealthy eccentrics with more stories than sense. He couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind the polished facades and expensive jewelry he encountered daily.

Today, however, promised to be different. A telegram had arrived that morning announcing the arrival of a guest unlike any other: Miss Evangeline Blackwood, an enigmatic heiress rumored to possess both unimaginable wealth and a penchant for the peculiar. Teddy straightened his cap, anticipation tingling in his fingertips. He was determined to catch a glimpse of this legendary figure, even if it meant maneuvering past haughty socialites and dodging gossiping concierges.
