Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in Amelia Cartwright's chest.  She adjusted the floral patterned scarf around her neck, a nervous habit she couldn’t seem to shake despite years in the field. Today was different.  Today wasn’t just another session helping Mrs. Henderson regain dexterity after a stroke.

Amelia was opening her own clinic, "Hope Springs Occupational Therapy." The worn-down building on Elm Street, smelling faintly of disinfectant and old wood, held a lifetime's worth of dreams. Sunlight, weak but determined, peeked through the overcast sky, casting long shadows across the waiting room, still sparsely furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a chipped coffee table.

A chime announced her first patient, sending another tremor through Amelia.  This was it. The culmination of years of late nights studying, relentless fundraising, and countless sacrifices. Today, she wasn't just an occupational therapist; she was a pioneer, charting her own course in the world.
