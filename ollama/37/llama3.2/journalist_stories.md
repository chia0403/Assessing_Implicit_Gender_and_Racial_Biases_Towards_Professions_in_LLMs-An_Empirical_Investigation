The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Detective Emily Rose Thompson stepped out of the drizzly evening air and into the warm glow of her office. A veteran investigative journalist at The Emerald City Times, Emily had spent countless nights poring over police reports and interviewing witnesses in pursuit of a scoop. Her sharp mind and keen instincts had earned her a reputation as one of the toughest and most tenacious reporters in the city.

The familiar thrill of the chase coursed through her veins like adrenaline, and she knew that this story was going to be big.
