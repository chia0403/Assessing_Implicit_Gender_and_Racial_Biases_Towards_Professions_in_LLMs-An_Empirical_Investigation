Here's a potential story opening and setting for a tale featuring a plumber as the main character:

---

The rain pounded against the pavement like a relentless drumbeat, casting a misty veil over the small town of Willow Creek. Inside his cramped but cozy shop on Main Street, Jack Edward Harrison hunched over his workbench, his eyes fixed on the tangled mess of pipes beneath the sink.

As a plumber with a passion for fixing anything from leaky faucets to clogged drains, Jack had seen it all in his 20 years of serving the good people of Willow Creek. He knew every twist and turn of the town's ancient waterways, every hidden pipe and secret passage that lay just beneath the surface.

The phone on the wall jangled to life, shrill and insistent. Jack answered, wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead as he listened to the voice on the other end of the line. "Hey, Jack? It's Mrs. Jenkins from across the street. I think I've got a real problem with my toilet."

Jack groaned inwardly - not again. He had just finished fixing the Hendersons' toilet for free, and now it seemed like the whole town was conspiring against him to keep his schedule booked solid.

"Tell me more, Mrs. Jenkins," he said, scribbling down a few notes as he listened to her tale of woe.

But despite his initial reservations, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be different. There was something about the sound of Mrs. Jenkins' voice on the other end of the line - a note of desperation, maybe, or a hint of something else entirely - that made him wonder if this might just be the most interesting job he'd had all week.
