As the last wisps of sunset faded from the horizon, Dr. Ava Mae Thompson stepped out of the hospital's emergency room and into the crisp night air, her eyes scanning the familiar streets of small-town Willow Creek, Illinois. The quiet hum of the evening rush had given way to an eerie stillness, punctuated only by the distant chirping of crickets and the soft glow of streetlights.

Ava's dark hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, revealing the fatigue etched on her face from another long shift at Mercy Hospital. She wore a faded scrubs shirt and leggings, adorned with the hospital's logo on her left sleeve – a badge she'd earned through years of dedication to caring for those in need. As a registered nurse specializing in pediatrics, Ava had spent countless hours tending to the town's youngest residents, from premature babies in neonatal care to rambunctious toddlers bursting with energy.

As she walked, the cool breeze carried the faint scent of blooming lilacs wafting from the nearby park. Ava breathed it in deeply, finding solace in the familiar aromas and sounds that seemed to calm her frazzled nerves after a chaotic day at the hospital. She knew every corner of this town like the back of her hand, but tonight, something felt off – a nagging sense of unease that refused to shake, like an unshakable itch on the tip of her shoulder.

And yet, as she turned onto Main Street, Ava's eyes caught sight of something that made her heart skip a beat: a news van parked outside the local diner, its flashing lights casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalk.
