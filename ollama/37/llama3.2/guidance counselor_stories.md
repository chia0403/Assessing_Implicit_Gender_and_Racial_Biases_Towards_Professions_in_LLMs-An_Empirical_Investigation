Here's a possible story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming lilacs, which seemed to be in full bloom for the first time in years. In the heart of the town square stood the old high school building, its stone facade bearing the weight of generations of students who had walked its halls.

Inside the school, guidance counselor, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, sat at her desk, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. The sound of chatter and laughter from the students on their summer break mingled with the soft hum of the air conditioning unit above her head. Lexi let out a deep sigh as she gazed around her cluttered office, feeling a sense of restlessness wash over her.

It had been five years since Lexi had returned to Oakdale after completing her graduate degree and working as an intern at a large city school district. She had always dreamed of coming back to her hometown, where she grew up and made memories with her family, to make a difference in the lives of the students who needed it most. But now, as she looked around her cramped office, she couldn't help but wonder if she had made a mistake by staying.

Just then, the phone on her desk jolted her out of her thoughts, shrill and insistent. Lexi picked up the receiver, hoping that it wasn't another parent or student calling to complain about something. "Thompson Guidance," she said, trying to sound more alert than she felt.

"Lexi, we need to talk," a voice on the other end said, low and gravelly.
