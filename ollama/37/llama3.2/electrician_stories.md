Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The storm had been brewing for hours, its dark clouds gathering over the small town of Ravenswood like an omen. Inside the dimly lit workshop, Electrician Julian Alexander Pierce huddled over his workbench, trying to finish up the last minute details on a repair job before calling it quits for the day. The smell of ozone and burnt wire filled the air as he carefully soldered a frayed cable together.

Despite the storms brewing outside, Julian felt at home in his workshop, surrounded by the whir of machines and the hum of electricity.
