Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled off the Thames like a damp shroud, casting a misty veil over the streets of Whitechapel. Amidst the narrow alleys and crumbling tenements, one figure stood out - Emrys Fletcher, a burly butcher with arms as thick as his neck and hands stained crimson from a lifetime of handling raw meat.

Emrys had inherited his family's humble butchers shop on Hanbury Street from his father, God rest him. The business had been in the Fletchers' family for generations, and Emrys took pride in continuing the tradition. He spent his days crafting joints and cuts with precision, his nose twitching as he sniffed out the freshest game meats.

But Emrys's life was about to take a drastic turn. As he prepared for the morning's market, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss in the city. Whispers of strange happenings had been circulating among the locals - a missing child here, a mysterious death there - and Emrys's instincts told him that he was about to become entangled in a web of secrets and lies that would change his life forever.

Little did Emrys know, the streets of Whitechapel were about to hold more than just the usual chaos - they would hold a darkness that would test his courage, his wits, and his very humanity.
