Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a chilly autumn evening in New York City, and the streets of Manhattan were ablaze with the vibrant lights of Times Square. The sound of car horns and chatter filled the air as tourists and locals alike hurried to and fro. But amidst the hustle and bustle, one person stood out - 22-year-old songstress, Aria Leigh Everett.

Aria stepped off the subway at the 42nd Street station, her long, curly brown hair swinging behind her like a curtain of night. Her bright green eyes scanned the crowded sidewalk, her gaze lingering on the towering skyscrapers that seemed to touch the clouds. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins. Tonight was going to be a big night.

As she made her way towards the iconic Plaza Hotel, Aria's thoughts turned to the sold-out concert she was about to perform at - one of the most prestigious venues in the city. She had spent months rehearsing for this moment, perfecting her set list and fine-tuning her voice. Her manager, Rachel, had promised her a record deal on the line if they made it happen.

Aria's manager, Rachel, was already waiting for her at the hotel, sipping a cup of coffee and scrolling through her phone with an expression of quiet determination. She spotted Aria approaching and flashed a reassuring smile.

"Hey kiddo, you ready to do this?" she asked, as Aria settled into her seat beside her.

Aria nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "I was born for this."

And with that, the countdown began. The curtains would open in just a few minutes, and Aria Leigh Everett would take the stage by storm, ready to leave her mark on the music world once and for all.
