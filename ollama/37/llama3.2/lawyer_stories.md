Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans glistened like polished onyx as Attorney Emily Elizabeth LaFleur stepped out of her office building, a sleek glass skyscraper that overlooked the Mississippi River. The dim glow of the city's streetlights cast long shadows across the wet pavement, like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch the unwary.

Emily, a sharp-witted and fiercely independent lawyer in her late twenties, pulled up the collar of her tailored navy blue coat, feeling the chill of the night air on her skin. She had just finished a grueling day in court, fighting for justice for her clients in a city where corruption and deceit lurked around every corner.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Emily's mind was still reeling from the case she'd just lost – a high-profile murder trial that had gone sour due to a technicality. The defendant, a young woman accused of murdering her wealthy business partner, had been acquitted on a quibble over venue jurisdiction.

Emily sighed and quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks as she navigated through the throngs of people rushing to and from work. She was headed for a late-night meeting with a new client – a mysterious woman who claimed to have information about a decades-old cold case that had left Emily's curiosity piqued.

The neon lights of Bourbon Street beckoned, promising a night of revelry and excess, but Emily had no interest in getting caught up in the city's notorious party scene. Tonight, she was on a mission to uncover the truth – and she would stop at nothing to get it.
