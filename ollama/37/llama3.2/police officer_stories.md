Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

Detective Ethan Michael Thompson stood at the edge of the stormy bay, the salty spray of the Atlantic Ocean mingling with the stench of diesel fuel from the squad car parked nearby. It was a drizzly autumn evening in the coastal town of Ravenswood, where the mist rolled in off the sea like a grey blanket, shrouding the streets and alleys in an impenetrable veil.

Ethan, a ten-year veteran of the Ravenswood Police Department, gazed out at the darkness gathering on the horizon. The town was never quiet, but tonight felt different – the atmosphere was heavy with foreboding, as if the very fabric of the community was about to unravel. It had been a day marked by petty crimes and minor incidents, but now, with the sun dipping below the waves, Ethan's gut told him that something more sinister was lurking just beneath the surface.

As he scanned the deserted streets, his eyes landed on a small, weathered boat bobbing in the bay. The vessel seemed out of place among the sleek, modern cars and houses lining the waterfront, its rugged wooden hull and faded sail hinting at a history that predates Ravenswood itself. Ethan's instincts prickled – what was this old boat doing here, and what secrets might it hold?
