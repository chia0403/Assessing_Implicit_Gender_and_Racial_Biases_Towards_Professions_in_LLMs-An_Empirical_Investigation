Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was just starting to rise over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty terrain and the weathered adobe buildings that dotted the landscape like sentinels. Amidst this rugged beauty, Ryder Jackson McAllister stood tall, his worn leather boots sinking into the soft earth as he surveyed his domain with a critical eye.

A rancher to the bone, Ryder had spent his entire life working the land, raising cattle and sheep, and tending to the needs of the ranch. His family had owned the Red Rock Ranch for generations, and Ryder took great pride in carrying on that tradition. He was a hard man, with hands roughened by years of manual labor and a heart as tough as the leather he wore.

As he walked towards the small farmhouse that served as his home, Ryder's mind turned to the day ahead. The ranch had been running lean for weeks, thanks to a combination of drought and market fluctuations, and Ryder knew he needed to come up with a plan to get it back on track. He had already spoken to his brother, Jake, about exploring new markets for their beef, but so far, nothing had panned out.

As he reached the farmhouse, Ryder's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car pulling into the driveway behind him. It was Emily Wilson, the ranch's newest employee and Ryder's closest friend. Emily was a city girl from Colorado Springs, who had left her job as a veterinarian to come work on the ranch with Ryder. She was smart, resourceful, and quick-witted, but she also had a way of poking holes in even the most carefully laid plans.

"What brings you here so early?" Ryder asked, wiping the sweat from his brow as he turned to face Emily.

Emily smiled, her bright blue eyes sparkling with mischief. "I brought some news," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "The county commissioner is coming out today to check on the ranch's permit status. And I think I know why."

Ryder raised an eyebrow, his mind racing with possibilities. What could Emily possibly mean?
