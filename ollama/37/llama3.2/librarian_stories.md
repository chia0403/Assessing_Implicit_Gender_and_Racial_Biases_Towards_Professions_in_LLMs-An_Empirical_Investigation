Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the quiet streets of Ashwood, casting a misty veil over the small town's worn facades and quaint shops. Inside the musty walls of the Ashwood Public Library, Emily Anne Windsor hunched over her desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes and whispered conversations from patrons seeking refuge from the storm.

As the librarian, Emily Anne was accustomed to the solitary nature of her work, but tonight felt different. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights seemed amplified, and the shadows cast by the flickering overhead bulbs appeared to twist and writhe on the walls like living things. She sighed, pushing aside a stray lock of curly brown hair that had escaped her neat bun.

It was 8 PM, and the library's evening rush was just beginning. The first patrons would start trickling in soon, seeking shelter from the storm and the quiet comfort of the shelves. Emily Anne had spent countless nights like this, lost in the pages of forgotten novels and ancient texts, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she sensed that something was waiting for her, hidden between the lines of a book or lurking in the shadows.

As she refocused on the task at hand – cataloging new arrivals and making notes on the evening's programming – a faint scratching sound echoed through the library, sending shivers down Emily Anne's spine. She looked up, her eyes scanning the darkening room, but saw nothing out of place. Just the usual creaks and groans of an old building settling into its foundations.

Or so she thought.
