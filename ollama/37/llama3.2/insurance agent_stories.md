Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as insurance agent, Maximilian "Max" Laurent DuPont III, stepped out of his office building and onto the humid sidewalks. The historic French Quarter was alive with the sounds of jazz drifting from Preservation Hall and the scent of beignets wafting from Café du Monde.

As he lit a cigarette, Max gazed out at the twinkling lights of Bourbon Street, his mind still reeling from the phone call he'd just received from his boss. It seemed another one of their clients had fallen victim to yet another bizarre and inexplicable tragedy – this time, the sudden demise of a wealthy businessman who'd been killed by what appeared to be nothing more than a freak lightning strike.

Max's gut told him there was more to it than met the eye, but he knew that in his line of work, you had to separate fact from fiction. As an insurance agent specializing in high-risk cases, Max had seen his fair share of weird and wonderful claims, but this latest one had him stumped.

As he exhaled a plume of smoke, Max's eyes scanned the crowded streets, searching for any clues that might lead him to the truth behind the businessman's untimely demise. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him down a rabbit hole of secrets, lies, and ancient mysteries hidden beneath the city's storied surface.

The air was thick with anticipation as Max DuPont III set off into the night, ready to unravel the tangled threads of his latest case and confront the unknown forces that lurked in the shadows of New Orleans' most mysterious streets.
