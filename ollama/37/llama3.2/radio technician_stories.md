Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a dirty blanket, shrouding its streets and homes in a misty grey gloom. Inside the cramped, cluttered workshop of WJHB Radio Station, 32-year-old radio technician, Everett Wyatt Harrison III, huddled over a malfunctioning transmitter. The faint hum of the repair equipment and the occasional crackle of static filled the air as he wrestled with the tricky electronics.

Everett had spent countless hours in this very workshop, fine-tuning antennas, calibrating receivers, and coaxing even the most recalcitrant signals from the ether. He took pride in his work, knowing that the smooth operation of WJHB's broadcasts was crucial to the town's morale – Ravenswood was a small, tight-knit community where everyone relied on the radio station for news, entertainment, and connection.

As he worked, Everett's mind wandered to the peculiar occurrence that had brought him to this workshop late at night. The station's manager, Mr. Jenkins, had summoned him with an urgent message, hinting at a crisis that threatened the very fabric of their broadcast schedule. Whatever it was, Everett knew that he would have to dig deep and use his technical expertise to unravel its mystery – and restore WJHB's signal to its usual reliable self.

Now it's your turn! What happens next in Ravenswood?
