Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn air clung to the old stone walls of Ravenwood Manor like a damp shroud, casting an eerie gloom over the sprawling estate. Groundskeeper Emilia Rose Fletcher stirred the embers of last night's fire in the manor's great hall fireplace, watching as the flames died down and the room fell silent once more.

It was a chilly autumn morning in late October, with the trees along the winding driveway still heavy with the remains of their summer foliage. The once-lush greenery had given way to shades of gold, crimson, and amber, a final burst of color before the winter snows arrived.

As Emilia added another log to the fire, her eyes wandered out the great hall window to survey the grounds. The gardens were a tangle of fallen leaves and overgrown flowers, but she knew that beneath the neglect lay hidden paths and secret spots waiting to be rediscovered. It was her job as groundskeeper to tend to the manor's sprawling estate, keeping its ancient stones and crumbling walls from succumbing to the ravages of time.

With a satisfied smile, Emilia turned back to the fire, her hands moving with practiced ease as she arranged the logs for a warm, comforting blaze. It was going to be a long day ahead, but she was ready. For in Ravenwood Manor, there were secrets to uncover and mysteries to solve â€“ and Emilia Rose Fletcher was determined to see that every nook and cranny of this old, mysterious place received her attention.
