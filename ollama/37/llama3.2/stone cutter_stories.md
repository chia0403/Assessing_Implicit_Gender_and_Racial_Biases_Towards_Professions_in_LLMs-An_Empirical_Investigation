Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy town of Ashwood, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow streets and half-timbered buildings. In a small workshop nestled between a blacksmith's forge and a bakery, Emrys ap Rhys, son of Gwynn and Gwenyth, stirred to life. A skilled stone cutter by trade, Emrys had spent countless hours honing his craft in the town's quarries, shaping granite into beautiful monuments and ornate tiles that adorned the buildings.

As he stretched his arms and yawned, the smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the open door, enticing him to join the townspeople gathered outside the bakery. The morning air was alive with the hum of conversation and the clinking of cups as they sipped their coffee. Emrys took a deep breath, feeling the familiar ache in his back and shoulders from a long night's work. He dressed quickly in the dim light, his fingers moving with practiced ease as he tied his apron strings.

Outside, the townsfolk were bustling about, preparing for the day's events. The annual Harvest Festival was mere days away, and everyone was abuzz with excitement. Emrys exchanged greetings with the baker, Mrs. Elara, who pressed a warm pastry into his hands as a good luck charm. "Aye, you'll need all the luck you can get, Emrys," she said with a wink. "The festival is going to be the biggest one yet."

Emrys smiled and tucked the pastry into his apron pocket, feeling a thrill of anticipation mixed with trepidation. Something didn't feel right in Ashwood this year...
