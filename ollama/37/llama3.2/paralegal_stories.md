Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Detective James "Jim" Alexander stepped out of his car and onto the wet pavement. A paralegal by day, and a part-time private investigator by night, Jim had seen his fair share of crime scenes, but nothing could have prepared him for the eerie feeling that settled in the pit of his stomach as he gazed up at the imposing skyscraper where his estranged father, a wealthy businessman, worked.

As he adjusted his raincoat and lit a cigarette, Jim's eyes scanned the sidewalk, taking in the scattered umbrellas and the few stragglers who dared to brave the downpour. The neon lights of the bars and restaurants cast a gaudy glow over the scene, making it seem like the entire city was one giant, pulsing party. But Jim knew better. He had a job to do.

A black sedan pulled up beside him, its tinted windows reflecting the dim light of the streetlamps. A low-humming engine and the soft rustle of leather seats were the only signs of life emanating from within. The driver's side door swung open, and Jim's partner, Rachel, leaned out to hand him a folder.

"Anything new?" Jim asked, his eyes narrowing as he took the folder and began to scan its contents.

"Just the usual," Rachel replied, her voice low and gravelly. "Your father's company is being sued by one of his investors. Something about a shady deal gone sour."

Jim's gut twisted into a knot as he tucked the folder back into his coat pocket. This was exactly why he'd tried to stay out of the investigation - his father was a slippery fish, and Jim had no interest in getting tangled up in his web again.

But it seemed fate had other plans.
