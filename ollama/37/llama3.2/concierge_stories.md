Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist. It was a sight that had become all too familiar to Emilia Victoria Winters, the concierge at the grand Ravenswood Hotel.

Emilia, or Mia as she preferred to be called, stood behind the reception desk, her eyes fixed on the old-fashioned key clutched in her hand. She was waiting for the arrival of a new guest, one who had requested a room with a view - and by "view," Mia suspected it meant something more than just a glimpse of the ocean.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Mia's gaze drifted around the lobby, taking in the familiar sights and sounds. The grandfather clock ticked away in the corner, its soft chime punctuating the silence. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting a warm glow over the polished wooden floorboards. It was a space that had seen generations of guests come and go - and Mia knew every trick, every quirk, and every hidden story behind each room.

But as she waited for her mysterious guest to arrive, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach, like a small stone weighing down her heart. She pushed the feeling aside, focusing on the task at hand: making sure their new guest felt welcome - and safe.

Little did Mia know, this would be just the beginning of a very strange and eventful stay at Ravenswood Hotel...
