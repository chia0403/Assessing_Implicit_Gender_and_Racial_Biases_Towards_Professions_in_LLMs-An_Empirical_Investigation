Here's a potential story opening:

As she expertly colored a client's hair at her chair in the salon, Ember Rose Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The morning sun streaming through the large windows above the makeup stations cast an eerie glow over the bustling space, making her feel like she was trapped in a dream from which she couldn't awaken.

The scent of hairspray and perfume wafted through the air as Ember worked to achieve the perfect shade of blonde for her client's latest special occasion. She had been a cosmetologist at "Locks and Lashes" salon for five years, and had grown accustomed to the familiar rhythms of the day - the chatty chatter of the clients, the beep of the timer on the dryer, the satisfying click-clack of scissors snipping through hair.

But today felt different. Today felt like something was waiting just beneath the surface, ready to pounce and disrupt the carefully crafted order of her life.

As she finished up the color job and began to rinse out the dye, Ember's eyes caught sight of a piece of paper on her clipboard that hadn't been there before. She picked it up, her heart racing as she saw a single sentence scrawled across its surface: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Ember felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed out the window, wondering who could have left this mysterious message and what they wanted from her. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a night that would change everything.
