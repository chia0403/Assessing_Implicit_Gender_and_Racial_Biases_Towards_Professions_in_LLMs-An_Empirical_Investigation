Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Sofia Elara Vasquez, a renowned expert in ancient mythology, stood at the edge of the university campus, gazing out at the mist-shrouded lake that lay before her. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell she found invigorating after weeks of stifling academic meetings. As she breathed in deeply, the trees seemed to lean in, their branches tangling above her like skeletal fingers, as if sharing secrets only they knew.

The campus itself was a relic of a bygone era, its Gothic spires and turrets rising like sentinels from the forest floor. It had been here that Sofia spent countless hours pouring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in search of clues to unlock the mysteries of the ancient world. Her specialty was Greek mythology, and she had dedicated her life to unraveling the tangled threads of legend and folklore.

As a professor of classics at Oakwood University, Sofia's department was one of the few remaining bastions of traditional learning, where students could still engage in spirited debates about the finer points of Homer and Sophocles. But even as she delved deeper into her research, Sofia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A subtle unease had been growing inside her, like a faint tremor beneath the surface of her carefully constructed world.

It started with small things – a misplaced scroll, an unexplained email from a colleague – but had escalated to full-blown anxiety in recent days. Tonight, as she stood on the lake's edge, Sofia felt the weight of it all bearing down upon her like a physical force. She was no longer sure if she was ready for what lay ahead.

The mist began to clear, revealing the faint outline of buildings across the lake, their windows glowing with an otherworldly light. It was as if the very fabric of reality had begun to unravel, and Sofia felt herself drawn into its depths, like a moth to a flame. She knew then that she would have to confront whatever darkness lay ahead, no matter how daunting it might seem.

This is just one possible opening, but I hope you find it inspiring!
