## The Guidance Counselor

**Setting:** The air in Sycamore High's counseling room hummed with the usual pre-graduation anxieties.  A stark red paint job on the otherwise neutral walls seemed to amplify the feeling – like a warning sign blinking against the bright fluorescent light fixtures overhead. 

**Character:** Amelia Croft, her name embossed on the door like a silent promise of solace and guidance. At 35, she had seen it all in these hallways: teenage angst, first loves, heartbreaks, and dreams too big to contain within the confines of their own minds.  Amelia was there to help them navigate, even if sometimes she wasn't quite sure where they were headed. 

**Opening:** A young woman with a face that resembled an over-caffeinated storm cloud sat slumped in the corner chair, fiddling with her long silver necklace. "He said he doesn't want me anymore," she murmured, her voice barely a whisper.  "It's just… I thought we were going to be okay." 

Amelia knelt down before the girl, her hazel eyes filled with understanding and a faint flicker of the well-worn compassion that had been etched into her soul since she first started in this career. She patted the edge of the young woman’s hand, offering a gentle smile. "We'll figure this out," she said.  "One step at a time. And if you need someone to talk to, I’m here."
