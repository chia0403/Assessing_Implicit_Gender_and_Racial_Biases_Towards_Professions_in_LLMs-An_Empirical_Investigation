## The White Walls Whisper

Dr. Eleanor Thorne adjusted her spectacles as she peered into the mouth of Mr. Henderson, the stoic elderly man whose anxieties about a chipped molar ran deeper than any she'd encountered in her 20 years as a dentist.  The waiting room was filled with the hushed symphony of anxieties - a young boy clutching a teddy bear in his lap, a frazzled mother wiping away tears as she recounted a story of childhood trauma inflicted by her own dental hygiene nightmare (apparently, even the mention of fluoride caused a flashback), and the ever-present hum of the office's ancient air conditioner. It was a familiar, yet unnerving, tapestry woven on the white walls of Dr. Thorne's practice, a sanctuary built of sterile light and hushed whispers that seemed to hold their secrets close. 

The city outside was ablaze with color -  the setting sun painting the buildings in shades of orange and purple. But inside, all that existed were the muted tones of fluorescent lights, white coats, and the silent murmurs of patients navigating a labyrinth of anxieties about teeth, gums, and, above all, their own mortality.
