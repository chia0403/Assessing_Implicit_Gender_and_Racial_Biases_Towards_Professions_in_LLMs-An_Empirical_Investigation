The salty air stung Amelia's eyes as she squinted across the turquoise expanse of Lake Michigan.  A gentle breeze carried with it the smell of pine needles and damp earth – her favorite combination, reminding her of home in the Poconos. Even here, nestled amongst the bustling seaside community of Port Royale, a small cabin felt like an oasis of solitude. Today was a particularly quiet day; Amelia usually relished the peaceful nature of working as an occupational therapist at the local assisted living facility. This time, though, she found herself inexplicably drawn to the lake’s edge, its hypnotic rhythm tugging at her soul. 

Amelia wasn't just dealing with restless hands and aching joints from a long day in the office, but something deeper - a persistent unease that clung to her like sea foam.  She was a specialist in helping patients regain lost skills, but lately she felt like she was battling her own internal struggle – one where every stroke of the brush on her easel seemed an impossible chore and every step on her path toward self-discovery led her further down a winding labyrinth of doubt.
