The salty wind whipped Elara Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she stood at the precipice of the cliff.  Below, the emerald green valley stretched endlessly before her, the sun dipping towards the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and purple. She was perched precariously on a granite outcrop, her worn leather boots clinging to the rough stone, the only sound besides the ocean's distant roar the soft crunch of gravel under her feet as she stared down. 

Elara Blackwood, DVM, had been a veterinarian in this sleepy coastal town for five years now, and though the salty air and the ceaseless whispers of the sea were calming, the beauty couldn't disguise the deep-seated melancholy that always lingered around her like a shroud. The death of her grandfather, the renowned wildlife expert who had raised her amongst exotic creatures and taught her to read the language of birdsongs, still cast a dark shadow on her soul. 

Elara's work was as much about healing wild creatures as it was about tending to the townsfolk's pets, and tonight, that burden felt heavier than usual. The clinic was buzzing with activity â€“ kittens being bottle-fed, dogs barking their anxieties into the night, a mother cat fretting over her lost kitten. Yet, there was a heaviness in the air, an unspoken tension, as Elara stared out at the vastness of the sea, wondering if she would ever find the solace she so desperately craved.
