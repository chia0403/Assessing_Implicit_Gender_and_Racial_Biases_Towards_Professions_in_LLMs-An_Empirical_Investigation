Their weight was nothing compared to the burden on Silas Blackwood’s heart, the kind that could drown even the bravest soul in its own weight.

A thick fog, clinging to the edges of the forest and shrouded in an eerie chill that seemed to seep into Silas' bones, had settled over the mountain, blotting out even the usual dawn light.  The air hung heavy with anticipation, tinged with a fear he couldn’t quite name. The silence wasn't just absence; it was presence – a palpable weight that pressed down on him, like a shroud.
