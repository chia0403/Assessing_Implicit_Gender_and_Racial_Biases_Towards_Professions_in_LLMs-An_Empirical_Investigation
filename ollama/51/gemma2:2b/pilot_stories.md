The humid air hung heavy over the Pacific Coast, clinging to Amelia Wright like a wet blanket as she gripped the controls of her vintage Cessna 172.  Her destination:  the remote logging town of Willow Creek, nestled deep within the emerald embrace of the Cascade Mountains.  She hated these kinds of trips, always feeling a pang of isolation watching the land roll past as she flew alone through the ever-changing tapestry of cloud and sky. Amelia’s call sign was 'Ember',  a moniker bestowed upon her by a fellow pilot who couldn't resist drawing parallels to her fiery red hair and the way her eyes blazed with determination at every obstacle thrown her way.

Willow Creek, however, wasn't just any town. It was a sanctuary for those seeking solace from the harsh realities of their world; those who yearned for a life less burdened by societal expectations.  Amelia had been hired to deliver a crucial shipment of lumber – supplies desperately needed to rebuild a community ravaged by an earthquake two years ago. The weight of responsibility sat heavily on her shoulders, each beat of her heart echoing the thrumming engine of the plane as she navigated through increasingly turbulent air currents. This wasn't just another delivery; it was a mission.
