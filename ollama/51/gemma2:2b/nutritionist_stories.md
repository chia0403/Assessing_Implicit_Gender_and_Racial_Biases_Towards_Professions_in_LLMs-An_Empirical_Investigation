The aroma of burnt toast clung to the air like a ghost in Dr. Amelia Alcott's tiny kitchen apartment.  It was the kind of smell that could be forgiven on a busy Tuesday morning, but it just served as another reminder of her own chaotic life. "Amelia," she muttered under her breath, "you need a new toaster." Her eyes darted to her overflowing schedule - a nutritionist, therapist, and consultant all rolled into one, juggling a hundred-hour week with a single roommate and the dream of finally opening her own clinic.  

The year was 2047, and this wasn't some far-off sci-fi fantasy – it was reality for many in bustling New Eden City. Amelia, with her vibrant orange hair peeking out from under her trademark chef’s hat, had dedicated herself to revolutionizing the way people approached nutrition. But amidst the burgeoning bioengineered food markets and the constant push of digital health programs, even Amelia felt like she was fighting a losing battle against the sheer messiness of it all.
