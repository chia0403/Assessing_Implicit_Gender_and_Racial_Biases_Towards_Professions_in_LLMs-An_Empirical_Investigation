The Grand Sapphire Hotel hummed with a quiet intensity that only came from a city teeming with dreams. A symphony of clinking silverware echoed off polished marble floors in "La Belle Ã‰poque," the private dining room where Alistair Thorne, concierge extraordinaire, found himself perched on a velvet stool. 

Alistair was a study in contradictions; his sharp wit and silver hair framed by a perpetual frown seemed to belie the genuine warmth that radiated from within him.  The Grand Sapphire held its secrets closely - it whispered of scandalous affairs, stolen fortunes, and forbidden love - all whispered down the corridors and into Alistair's ears like clandestine confessions. 

Tonight, however, there was an undercurrent of anticipation that ran through the very walls. The arrival of Lady Eloise de Saint-Germain, renowned socialite, beauty queen, and rumored secret owner of a sprawling art theft ring, was scheduled for tomorrow. For a man who understood every hidden desire in this city's opulent heart, Alistair felt the tension thicken like the smoky air inside the Grand Sapphire's private bar.
