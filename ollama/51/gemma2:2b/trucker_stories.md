The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, casting the highway in an ominous twilight.  Miles of asphalt stretched before Eldrin "Eagle" Cartwright's tired eyes, each mile a monument to his own relentless pursuit – not of some mythical prize, but of simply getting to the next rest stop before the desert sand-blasted his weary bones. He was driving a behemoth of a rig, a Peterbuilt that creaked and groaned under the weight of its cargo -  an endless supply of lumber destined for some nameless city nestled somewhere in the heartland. 

The wind whistled through the cab's cracked windows, carrying with it the promise of snow. The kind that would freeze his fingers and turn the inside of his rig into a cold sweat-soaked sauna before sunrise. He glanced at the weathered truck map hanging on the wall – a tapestry of roads and routes, crisscrossing the nation like blood vessels carrying lifeblood – all leading to somewhere, eventually. 

Eagle pulled out another pack of cigarettes, his trembling hand momentarily failing to find the lighter tucked behind the ashtray. The scent of old denim, diesel fuel, and burnt tobacco clung to him like a second skin. Tonight, he'd be sleeping in a roadside motel with a flickering neon sign that promised 'comfort' for weary souls.  He wondered, as he lit the cigarette, if any solace existed in such fleeting moments of quiet before the relentless cycle of the open road resumed its cruel dance with time and fatigue.
