The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and decay, punctuated by the sickly sweet aroma of old medicine.  It was August in Evergreen Creek, and a haze of humidity clung to everything like a shroud.  Inside the cramped pharmacy, dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through grimy windows as Dr. Amelia Thorne meticulously poured a vial of emerald-green liquid into a ceramic container. Her hands, calloused from years of handling powders and pills, moved with practiced ease, her brow furrowed in concentration.

For years, Amelia had been the sole proprietor of Thorne's Apothecary, a business she inherited from her grandfather after his sudden passing last spring.  It was an old-fashioned place, nestled on the edge of town where time seemed to move slower, and the echoes of bustling days long gone lingered like ghosts in the empty corners. The pharmacy itself was more than just a store - it held within its walls years of whispered secrets and tales passed down through generations.  But lately, Amelia felt a growing unease creep into her otherwise predictable routine. 

It wasn't just the whispers or the hushed voices of customers; it was something more... something unsettling. Like a spiderweb slowly gathering its threads in the dark corner of her mind.
