The morning mist clung to the cobbled streets of Carrionham like cobwebs spun from death itself. It seeped into every crack in the stone buildings, even the seemingly robust walls of Old Man Finnigan's shop, where the aroma of aged beef and spices hung heavy as a shroud. This was no ordinary butcher shop; it was "Finnigan's Fables," a place where meat whispered tales of its journey from farm to table. 

The air itself seemed to hold an unsettling silence – broken only by the occasional creak of a timbered door, or the rhythmic scraping of metal on metal as Finnigan, his weathered face etched with years spent crafting his craft, expertly sharpened his knives.  His name was not just a reflection of his trade; it was whispered in hushed tones amongst the townsfolk. For Finnigan wasn't merely a butcher – he was the whisperer of meat, the one who knew each cut and every story held within its fibers.  

This morning, however, there was something amiss. A strange urgency crackled beneath the stillness, like the sudden snap of an unseen thread in the fabric of reality. And Finnigan, with a deep, unsettling knowing in his eyes, felt it too.
