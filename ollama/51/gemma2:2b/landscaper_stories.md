The morning air was thick with the scent of wet earth and freshly cut grass, but even that couldn't mask the lingering weight in Felix Hawthorne's chest. He shifted the worn canvas bag slung over his shoulder, idly running a calloused thumb along the zipper. It held the meager compensation for the week – enough to keep his roof over his head, just barely.

He surveyed his small patch of paradise on Maplewood Lane - a tiny sliver of green squeezed between towering apartment buildings and bustling traffic. A symphony of honking horns and hurried footsteps filled the air as he started work, his eyes tracing the lines of his carefully crafted garden. This wasn't just work for Felix; it was therapy. Each meticulously pruned rosebush, each neatly trimmed hedge offered a soothing balm to his anxieties. Maplewood Lane was a microcosm of his own life – small yet vibrant, full of quiet beauty within its chaotic surroundings.

The sun finally broke through the early morning haze, casting long shadows across the garden. This week's project was particularly daunting – revitalizing Mrs. Henderson's neglected flowerbed next door. A constant source of frustration and unspoken tension between Felix and his neighbor's stoic, elderly mother, who believed every blade of grass should be aligned to her exacting standards.
