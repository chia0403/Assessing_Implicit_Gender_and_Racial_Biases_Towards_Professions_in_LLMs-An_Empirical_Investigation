The neon lights above "Sparkle & Shine" seemed to pulse in time with Elara's tired heart.  Even though she was used to working the late shift at this crowded convenience store, the monotony felt like an anchor today.  Every time the automatic doors chimed open, another wave of people flooded through, demanding their caffeine fixes, chips, and that strange, purple-tinged candy that made her stomach ache just looking at it. 

Elara was officially named Elara Dawn, a name as whimsical and impractical as the floral print apron she wore.  She'd always considered it a bit of an insult â€“ 'Dawn', for all its connotations of hope and new beginnings, seemed to clash with the grim reality of her job. Tonight, however, the words felt more poignant than usual. It was her first week at Sparkle & Shine, and every shift felt like she was being tested by a particularly demanding deity of customer service.
