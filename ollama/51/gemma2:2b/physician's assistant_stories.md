## Setting: 

The storm had begun hours ago, lashing against the high-rise windows of the San Francisco General Hospital like the fury of a thousand angry seabirds. Rain hammered against glass, turning the normally bustling streets below into a churning symphony of grey and silver. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic scent and the whispers of weary patients struggling through the night. 

## Character:

**Elias Thorne,** his usually sharp eyes clouded with fatigue, sat in the small break room on the hospital's tenth floor. His worn leather boots echoed against the tile floor as he paced restlessly, a half-finished cup of lukewarm coffee abandoned by his side. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered space. 

## Story Opening:

"What are you doing here at this hour, Elias?" 
The voice was sharp and familiar, tinged with an unspoken disapproval that resonated through the small room like a cold breeze.  He turned to find Dr. Lawson, his gruff but respected mentor in the emergency department, leaning against the doorframe, his shadowed silhouette framed by the flickering light of the streetlamp outside. 

Elias’s gaze drifted to the overflowing bins in the corner, the chipped porcelain mugs of forgotten coffee, and the stacks of outdated medical journals. He knew the question was not a personal attack; it was simply Dr. Lawson's way of gauging his current emotional state.

"I'm... trying to stay awake," he admitted, the words echoing hollowly in the silence that followed. 
He couldn't look at Dr. Lawson’s face, unable to decipher the storm of emotions swirling beneath his stoic exterior. The past twenty-four hours had been a blur – an endless loop of frantic calls, anxious patients, and the crushing weight of responsibility settling heavy on his shoulders.  Tonight, however, was different. A sense of dread hung thick in the air, a feeling that something was terribly wrong. Something far beyond the usual anxieties of a young PA at the helm.  
 

The storm outside intensified; the thunder's roar felt like an ominous premonition. The weight of his responsibility seemed to press down on Elias's chest, threatening to suffocate him under its relentless force. What was he doing? He knew. Deep inside, he knew that this was bigger than just a sleepless night or even the anxieties that plagued his profession. It was a storm brewing in the heart of San Francisco General and it was going to impact them all.
