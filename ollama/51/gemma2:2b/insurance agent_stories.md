##  Setting: The Storm

**Opening:**

Rain lashed against the windows of Mr. Silas Thorne's office, mirroring the tempestuous emotions churning within him. A decade he'd spent in this cramped room, surrounded by stacks of policies and crumpled files, his life a tapestry woven with claims denied and promises kept.  He was known as 'The Keeper', a moniker earned from the seemingly infinite capacity to navigate the tangled legal nets of insurance while staying afloat amidst rising tides of misfortune. 

Tonight though, something felt different. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within. A young woman's voice on his phone, choked with sobs, echoed through his tired bones.  "My home," she said, her voice cracking like ice, "it's gone." 

Silas Thorne rubbed his hand over his salt-and-pepper beard, a familiar weight settling in his gut. He knew the feeling. The sinking dread of loss, the stark reality of what it meant to lose everything you built. Tonight, he was about to face another wave, another storm he had no control over but was destined to navigate. 

**Main Character:**  Silas Thorne
