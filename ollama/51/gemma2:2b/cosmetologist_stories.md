## The Crimson Cascade 

**Setting:** A worn, brick-walled salon in the heart of an industrial district. Sunlight filters through grime-covered windows, painting streaks of gold onto the chipped linoleum floor and scattering dust motes in the air. The aroma of hairspray and burnt sugar lingers, a testament to decades spent beneath the whirring of dryers and the chatter of clients.  

**Main Character:** Evelyn "Evie" Thorne, known for her fiery red hair that cascades like molten lava down her back and a talent for transforming ordinary people into something extraordinary. 


The bell above the salon door chimed, its hollow sound swallowed by the cacophony of Evie's thoughts. A young woman with eyes as wide as startled rabbits stepped inside, clutching a worn leather bag. Evelyn studied her, taking in the nervous tremor in her hand and the way she fidgeted with a loose thread on her dress.  

"Evelyn?" The woman whispered, a hesitant smile playing on her lips. "It's about time."
