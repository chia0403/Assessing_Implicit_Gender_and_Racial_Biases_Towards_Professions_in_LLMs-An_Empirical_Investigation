The smell of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of Harmony's Reception - not exactly the kind of atmosphere that promised romance or serenity, but it was the perfect fit for Iris Blackwood. As a receptionist with more years on her hands than anyone else (not to mention a few hundred extra wrinkles), Iris had become intimately acquainted with the rhythm of the office: the quiet lull before 9 a.m., the frantic scramble of phone calls as clients arrived, and the predictable ebb and flow of paperwork. 

Harmony's was a place of whispers and secrets, where anxieties were traded like stock shares in the open market, and dreams were sold as second-hand furniture on credit. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but Iris, with her tired eyes and ever-present smile, held the space together like a worn armchair holding up the weight of many lives. 

The clock ticked past 8:30, marking another day in the endless parade of routines.  Iris looked up from her filing cabinet as the bell above the door chimed â€“ a new client was arriving. The thought sent a shiver down her spine, not out of fear, but out of anticipation. This wasn't just another appointment; this was a meeting with destiny.
