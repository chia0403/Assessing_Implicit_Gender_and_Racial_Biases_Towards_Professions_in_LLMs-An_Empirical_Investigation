## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A crumbling Victorian mansion nestled on a windswept cliff overlooking the crashing Atlantic waves. Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, sending a symphony of droplets cascading down the ancient stone facade. 

**Main Character:** **Eira Blackwood**, her silver hair whipping around her face as she stood at the precipice of the house's grand entrance. A weathered leather jacket was layered over a scarlet dress, her stoic expression betraying a lifetime spent battling both wind and weather.  The weight of years clung to her like the fog that often shrouded the mansion in its eternal embrace. 

"Now," Eira announced, her voice echoing through the empty hallway, "those who aren't afraid of shadows shall begin their journey." She adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat and surveyed the group of tourists huddled beneath the dripping eaves.  Their faces were a mixture of awe and trepidation as they stared at the house, its spectral presence looming over them like a forgotten memory.  

"The whispers," Eira continued, her eyes flickering towards the shadowed corners of the hall, "they start here." 
 
**Story opening:**  Eira's tour group was small - barely a dozen souls braving the biting winds and the unnerving silence of Blackwood Manor. They were drawn by the allure of ghost stories and local lore, eager to experience the macabre charm of this decaying mansion on the windswept cliff.  But even for seasoned thrill-seekers, the atmosphere felt different tonight; the air hummed with an unspoken tension, and Eira's usual theatrical flair seemed dimmed by a deeper unease that resonated from the house itself.
