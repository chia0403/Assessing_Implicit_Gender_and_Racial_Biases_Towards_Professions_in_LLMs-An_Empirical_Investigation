The fluorescent hum of the office lights seemed to mock Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's weary smile.  It was 8:00 AM on a Tuesday in late February – another typical blizzard-ridden day in Chicago. Snow piled high against the windows, blurring the skyline into a watercolor sketch of gray and white. Esme had already dealt with three particularly agitated clients this morning, their frustrations fueled by the ever-present "taxman" and his elusive methods.  

Esme, however, was no stranger to chaos. With thirty years at her side – in fact, her very first job - as an income tax preparer, she'd witnessed the ebb and flow of the season like the tides of Lake Michigan. Her small office on the third floor of a run-down building housed a trove of forms, pens that felt heavy like lead weights in her hands, and enough coffee to fuel a small army. The aroma of stale printer paper mingled with peppermint schnapps – a daily reminder from her late grandmother of "the comfort of a good hustle." Esme was determined to provide just that, for each tax payer who walked through the door.
