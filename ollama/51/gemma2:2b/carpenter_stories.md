The air hung thick with the scent of pine and varnish, a familiar embrace for Elias Thorne. He inhaled deeply, savoring it as his calloused hands moved deftly across the worn oak frame. Outside the workshop door, the storm raged – a furious chorus of wind and rain drumming on the tin roof like restless spirits. Inside, however, calm reigned. The rhythmic creaks of his saws were the only sounds besides the gentle crackling of the wood-burning stove. 

Elias was a craftsman born from the heartwood of a sturdy oak tree, much like his grandfather before him. He’d grown up in the shadow of the old town's grand church, where every year, his father would build a replica of the tower with painstaking care. Each step of the tower, each plank of wood, was imbued with Elias' memories – from the way the sun dappled through the stained-glass windows to the echo of his father’s laughter as he hammered the final nail. Now, Elias was taking on the legacy himself. 

He had a contract - a commission for a grand old oak chest to be delivered to Lord Blackwood's manor before the end of the week. This was a test. A challenge. The weight of expectations, both familial and financial, lay heavy on his shoulders. As he worked, Elias felt his gaze linger on the unfinished masterpiece: a chest so intricately carved that even his grandfather would have been humbled by its craftsmanship. 
 
He was about to take a break when a frantic knock echoed through the workshop, jolting him back to reality.  A young boy stood on the threshold, rain dripping from his sodden clothes and fear etched across his face. "Master Elias," he stammered, eyes wide with panic, "it's... it's my brother."
