The early morning air was thick with the promise of rain, clinging to Elara's worn canvas bag as she hurried through the deserted hospital hallway.  Her footsteps echoed off the polished floors, each sound a jarring beat in the symphony of quiet that reigned. The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sickly yellow pallor on the stark white walls. Even at this ungodly hour, the hospital was strangely desolate, its usual bustle replaced by a hush so profound it felt almost suffocating. 

Elara, a woman with hands as strong and capable as they were scarred from years of helping others regain their mobility, tugged her bright red scarf tighter around her neck. Her name was Elara Thorne, and this city's physical therapy department held the weight of countless lives in its weathered walls – a responsibility that she embraced with every ounce of her being. 
 
 Today, however, the usual humdrum routine was disrupted by an unexpected visitor: a man named James Blackwood, whose body language spoke of despair so deep it seemed to seep from his very bones.  A fractured ankle and a shattered spirit had brought him here, but Elara sensed something deeper – a fear that went beyond the physical.
