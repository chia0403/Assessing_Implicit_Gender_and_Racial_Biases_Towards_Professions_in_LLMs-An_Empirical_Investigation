Rain hammered against the roof of the ambulance like frantic fingers tapping on a broken record. The wind howled, whipping the wipers across Amelia "Amy" Thompson's windshield in an almost mocking display of defiance.  The late November chill seemed to seep into her bones through the flimsy plastic sheeting that served as a partition between the front and back of the vehicle. Amy shifted in her worn-out driver's seat, watching the neon sign of the nearby motel flicker on and off like a dying firefly.

Amy adjusted the brim of her cap, its faded red hue hardly visible through the sheets of rain obscuring the road ahead. Tonight was another one of those nights - the kind that felt heavy with unspoken worries and an unsettling sense of inevitability. The city's underbelly always had a way of pulling you in, even for someone like Amy, whose life was dedicated to helping others. 

Tonight, she was tasked with transporting Mrs. Evelyn Harris, a frail old woman with a history as long and winding as the roads they traveled on. A stroke had left her trapped inside a nightmare, her world slowly fading away, while waiting for another miracle in the form of medical professionals who just couldn't reach her in time.
