Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, mimicking the rhythm of Amelia's heart as she waited for her contact.  The greasy spoon, "Momma Dottie’s Diner," was an unlikely beacon in the storm-ravaged town of Oakhaven. It was hardly a place to conduct high-stakes interviews, but its owner, Mrs. Dottie herself, possessed a warmth that even the most cynical journalist could find hard to resist. Amelia adjusted her rain slicker and tapped the worn tabletop with her fingertips, a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. 

The name “Oakhaven" itself was an ironic choice for a town so bleakly deserted in the aftermath of the firestorm that swept through last week.  Her contact was supposed to know something about it, something big. Amelia's gut whispered that this wasn’t just another missing persons case - something felt…different. Something dark and ominous hung over Oakhaven like the grey clouds outside. 

"Amelia?" Mrs. Dottie's voice, warm as a mug of coffee, broke through her train of thought. "You look soaked." She winked, her smile crinkling the edges of her weathered face. "Don't tell me you forgot your umbrella again, kiddo.”  


Amelia smiled weakly, unable to speak. It was true - she hadn't brought an umbrella, choosing instead to brave the storm with a sense of reckless idealism, fueled by a promise of truth and justice. 

**Character:** Amelia "Amy" Carter, a determined young reporter haunted by a past trauma that fuelled her insatiable thirst for uncovering the truth behind the most perplexing stories in Oakhaven.
