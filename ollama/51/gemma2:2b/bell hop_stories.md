The air hung heavy with the scent of rain and old leather in the grand lobby. It was August in Chicago, and the humidity clung to everything like a damp sheet.  A lone light flickered above a row of velvet-backed chairs that seemed to stare down on everyone with silent judgment.  This was the Grand Metropolitan Hotel, an oasis of elegance nestled within the bustling chaos of the city's skyline.  Inside it, however, time moved slower, measured in echoes and lingering smoke from forgotten cigarettes.

His name was Arthur Everett, a bell hop who looked more like he belonged on the streets than behind the polished glass doors of this historic institution.  He straightened his starched uniform, sighing as he ran a hand through his unruly hair. At least the rain had a calming effect on the city, he thought, before he remembered it was also driving tourists straight to the airport.  The air-conditioning hummed in his ears, battling the thick weight of expectation and boredom that hung like a shroud over him. 

He watched as a group of young women, giggling over their handbags, entered the lobby. Arthur hoped they'd find their room quickly; he had enough on his plate already.  His mind was already occupied by Mrs. Peabody's incessant demands for more tea, and the fact that no one seemed to have brought him a fresh pair of shoes since his last shift three weeks ago. 

Arthur sighed again, adjusting his name tag. "It's good to be back in a place where I actually have a chance to think," he muttered under his breath, as if talking to himself. This wasn't just another day on the job; this was a reminder of who Arthur Everett was and what he was trying to achieve within the confines of this grand hotel.
