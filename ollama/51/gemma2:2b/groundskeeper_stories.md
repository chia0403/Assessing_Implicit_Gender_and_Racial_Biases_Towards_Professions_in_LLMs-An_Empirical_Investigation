The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle as Elara Blackwood tended to the rose bushes lining the stone walls of Blackwood Manor.  Her calloused hands expertly brushed away a dew-laden petal, sighing in contentment as she watched the morning sun paint the roses in hues of crimson and gold. Elara Blackwood had been the groundskeeper for her entire life, a quiet presence in the sprawling estate that held generations of Blackwoods within its weathered walls. She knew every nook and cranny, from the secret passageway hidden behind the old oak tree to the whispering brook tucked away behind the rose garden. But today, something was different. Today, an unwelcome shadow clung to the manor's usual serenity.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled in the heart of a forgotten valley, shrouded by ancient oaks and a mist that seemed to hold secrets of its own.

She wears faded overalls that seem to have absorbed every drop of rain and sunshine for the past fifty years.
