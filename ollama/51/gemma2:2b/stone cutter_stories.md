The morning mist clung to Arlo Stonehill’s weathered face like a shroud as he stood before his quarry.  Even after three decades working the rough stone of this mountainside in the shadow of Mount Cinder, he found himself staring up at the imposing grey peak with a sense of wonder. The air was crisp and thin, carrying a hint of frost and the sweet tang of pine. Arlo wiped the sweat from his brow, his hands calloused and strong as gnarled branches.  He ran a callused thumb over the worn leather strap of his tool belt; each stone cutter's heart held a deep-seated desire to shape the raw beauty of stone into something magnificent, something that would leave its mark on the world.

Arlo Stonehill wasn’t just a stone cutter; he was a storyteller.  Each piece of granite he worked on, every curve and contour he carved, whispered tales of the mountains themselves – tales of ancient heroes and forgotten gods. Each block became a living canvas for his artistry, imbued with both the grit of its origins and the finesse of his own hand. 

Today’s commission was particularly significant; it would be the centerpiece of the annual Spring Festival in town.  A family heirloom, the massive granite arch they called "The Watcher" had been destined for this moment since Arlo first learned to wield a chisel as a boy, watching his father craft its rough outline into life.
