The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, its familiar aroma doing little to ease the knot of unease tightening around Clara's chest.  She adjusted her worn massage table linens, their muted floral pattern barely hiding the underlying threadbare fabric. It wasn’t often she worked at night, yet tonight was a special occasion – her first client in this secluded mountain cabin outside Aspen.

Clara Miller had always sought peace. After years of living in the frenetic heart of Los Angeles - a city where every surface seemed to reflect the frantic pulse of a million lives - she finally found solace tucked away among snow-capped peaks and crisp mountain air. The cabin, built by her late grandmother, was her refuge – a place where time slowed its relentless march, and silence reigned in the absence of sirens and car horns. 

Tonight, however, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was amiss. The woman across from her, Ms. Davenport, with her sharp, almost accusing eyes, seemed to radiate an unsettling energy. As Clara began her customary shoulder massage, a shiver ran down Ms. Davenport's spine as if touched by a cold wind that didn't seem to exist.
