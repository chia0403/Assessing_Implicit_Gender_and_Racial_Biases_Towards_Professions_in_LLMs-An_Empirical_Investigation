Rain lashed against the barn windows, drumming out a furious rhythm against the corrugated metal. Inside, Amelia Briarwood crouched on the floor, her knees grazing the worn, wooden planks. Her gaze was fixed on the shivering form of Barnaby, the rescued sheepdog she’d been caring for since he'd arrived as a scrawny pup, barely larger than a kitten. The storm had knocked down the power lines last night, leaving Amelia in the dark and with Barnaby feeling more cold than comfortable.  She’d already used up all the extra blankets they had in the barn; every one of them was damp and smelled of mildew from the previous week's floods. Her heart ached for him, but she knew that her small farm didn't have the capacity to keep an animal like Barnaby through any storm, let alone this one. 

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear as her gaze drifted to the worn photograph tucked beneath her thumb. It showed a younger version of herself, standing beside a handsome Border Collie with gleaming black fur. A picture of a happy farm life that was now just a faded memory. 


**Setting:** A small, rural farm near a bustling city in Maine, USA. The storm has been raging for hours and the power is out. 
**Main Character:** Amelia Briarwood - an animal caretaker who has recently inherited her late grandmother's farm after years of living on the edge of the city.
