Rain lashed against the grimy windows of  "The Drunken Pigeon," echoing the storm brewing in Evelyn "Evy" Thorne's soul. A lone street lamp outside cast a sickly yellow glow onto the rain-slicked asphalt and a discolored puddle that had formed beneath the rickety door. The aroma of stale beer, cigarettes, and something vaguely floral wafted through the air, mixing with Evy's headache to form an olfactory cocktail she could only describe as "Chicago in July."

Evy sat hunched over her worn leather-bound case file.  The name on the bottom of the page was a familiar one: "James Hawthorne." A fading starlet from the silent era, now gone missing, and her client's desperation for answers hung thick in the air. The case had been dropped months ago - the local police were convinced it was a simple runaway - but Evy refused to throw in the towel. This city was crawling with secrets, each one begging to be unearthed. 

Evy felt the familiar tug of duty in her gut as she took another drag on her cigarette. The air tasted like ash and regret. "He's got history," she muttered to herself, tracing a finger over a faded photograph of Hawthorne in a flapper dress. "And he hasn't forgotten it."


**Setting:**  A late 1920s Chicago - The city is a whirlwind of jazz music, bootleg whiskey, and the whispers of hidden truths behind every shadow. Crime is rampant, but so is hope for anyone who wants to take a chance in this fast-paced, ever-changing landscape.

**Character:** Evelyn "Evy" Thorne, known to some as “The Sparrow” -  a private detective with a sharp tongue and sharper mind, Evy navigates the dark underbelly of Chicago, solving cases with grit and grace.
