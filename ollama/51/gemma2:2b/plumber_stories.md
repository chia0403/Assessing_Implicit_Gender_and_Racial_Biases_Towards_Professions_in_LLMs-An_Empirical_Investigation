## The Clogged King

**Setting:**  Oldhaven City, nestled amongst rolling hills in a forgotten corner of Oregon, USA. A city built on ingenuity, its charm lies in a patchwork of Victorian-era buildings and modern apartments. The old town center, however, still holds its secrets - cobbled streets where time seems to have stopped flowing, hidden alleyways smelling of brine and decay, and the occasional flickering gaslight illuminating forgotten stories.

**Main Character:**  Bartholomew "Bart" Quillman, a plumber with hands that knew both wrench and wisecrack, and eyes that saw something magical in every leaky pipe or rusted joint. 


The rumble of an aging plumbing system was not just a nuisance to Bart; it was a symphony to his soul. Tonight's melody had been unusually dramatic. An old Victorian mansion, its grandeur dulled by years of neglect, seemed to hold its breath. A choked cough echoed from its depths as the heavy front door creaked open, followed by a flurry of nervous steps and the faint scent of lavender and dust. 


Bart smiled. He could already guess who'd called in the "Clogged King" himself. This wasn't just any clog; this was Mrs. Evelyn Blackwood, whose family lineage ran deeper than most, with whispers of ancient curses woven into the fabric of the house.  He had a feeling this time, the music would be far more dramatic.
