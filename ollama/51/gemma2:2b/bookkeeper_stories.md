The air was thick with the scent of old paper and mildew, a familiar comfort that did little to soothe the rising anxiety in her stomach. Across the worn oak desk lay a stack of ledger entries, each page laden with numbers that whispered secrets she didn't fully understand, let alone decipher.

But lately, the ledger felt heavier than usual, the silence in her once-harmonious office a stark reminder that something was amiss. 

Amelia glanced at the clock: just past midnight. The storm outside had been raging all day, an ominous counterpoint to the chaos brewing within her own mind.  This wasn't just about balancing the books anymore - it felt like unraveling a tapestry of years, a hidden story of wealth and betrayal woven in the very fabric of their business.
