## Story Opening:

The air in Arthur “Ace” Sterling’s office crackled with the familiar tension of impending storm. Outside, New York City was ablaze with the vibrant red and orange hues of sunset, casting long shadows across the towering glass and steel that made up his world. But Ace felt none of the city’s excitement; he sat hunched over his desk, a grim scowl etched on his usually chipper face.  His calloused hands tightened around a pile of financial reports. He stared at the screen where ticker numbers danced like frantic butterflies, mirroring the chaotic beat in his chest. 

Ace knew what these numbers meant.  They weren't just figures; they were whispers from the city's underbelly, promises and lies, fortunes to be won and lost in a blink of an eye. His job wasn't about making dreams come true - it was about manipulating them into something tangible, something real.  And today, that manipulation had gone horribly wrong.

**Setting:** 
Ace Sterling’s office sits atop one of the tallest skyscrapers in Manhattan. The expansive view from his window reveals a panorama of the city lights: iconic landmarks like the Chrysler Building and Empire State, and street life buzzing with energy beneath a veil of shimmering neon signs.  His office is meticulously organized, but the air within it hummed with an undercurrent of anxiety; a testament to Ace’s precarious position in the intricate web of Wall Street's power play.
