The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elara Valdez's back as she smoothed the last patch of asphalt. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking her efforts with their fleeting, ephemeral nature. The air tasted like burnt rubber and sagebrush, a familiar combination that was both comforting and unnervingly desolate. 

Elara’s orange safety vest shimmered under the oppressive heat, reflecting a distorted image of herself - weary eyes beneath a dusty fringe of brown hair. Around her, the highway stretched onward, a ribbon of grey stretching towards the horizon like an impossible promise. She'd been assigned this stretch for weeks – a lonely, unforgiving stretch nicknamed "The Devil's Highway" by locals who whispered about the ghosts that haunted it at night. 

Tonight, Elara would be alone. Her shift was long, but her supervisor had promised a break in two hours. That break would hopefully bring with it some semblance of normalcy - a cup of coffee from a gas station run-down diner, maybe even a chat with another worker who didn't seem to mind the company of an old, rusty boombox blasting Frank Sinatra. But tonight, Elara knew, this was just a patch in a much larger picture.  The Devil’s Highway wouldn't yield to her work alone; its secrets were deeper than asphalt and concrete. The silence only fueled Elara’s unease.
