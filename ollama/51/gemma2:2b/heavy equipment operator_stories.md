## The Concrete Jungle

**Setting:**  The heart of Detroit's roaring 20th century industrial district, where rust-red brick factories stand sentinel against the ever-growing sprawl of the city. A symphony of clanging steel and grinding machinery hums in the air.

**Character:**  Atlas "Ace" Callahan.  A man carved from granite and hardened steel, Ace is a master operator who's seen more asphalt crumble beneath his wheel than most people see sunrises.  His hands are calloused, his biceps thicker than the steel beams he manipulates, and his eyes reflect the grit of a life spent amidst the grime and clang of construction. Heâ€™s a solitary man, content with the rhythmic pulse of machinery and the echoing roar of engines.

**Opening:**

The air was thick with the scent of diesel and dust as Ace clambered into the behemoth of a bulldozer he called "Big Bertha." The machine thrummed to life, its engine a deep-throated groan that echoed through his bones. Ace tightened his grip on the controls, steel fingers deftly guiding Bertha's massive claws across the overgrown lot.  He was clearing land for a new skyscraper, a testament to Detroit's relentless march toward progress.

The city had been a crucible, its streets forged in sweat and grit. But underneath the concrete jungle lurked a quiet beauty, in Ace's eyes. He saw it in the way sunlight caught the steel beams of abandoned factories, in the fleeting whispers of wind through crumbling chimney stacks. This was where he belonged, amidst the broken promise of progress and the enduring strength of humanity.  He took a long drag from his cigarette, watching as Bertha tore into the earth with an unearthly roar, each scrape a testament to the relentless churn of Detroit's lifeblood.
