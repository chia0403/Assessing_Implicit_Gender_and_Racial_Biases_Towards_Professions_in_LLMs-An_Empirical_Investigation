The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Thorne's head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor of Bloodworks. It was 8:30 pm, close enough to midnight to trigger her own internal alarm clock - and just the kind of quiet that made the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of blood draws sound more like an ominous heartbeat. Outside, the Chicago wind howled through the cracks in the building's aging facade, its fury a stark contrast to the sterile calm inside. 

Amy was used to both – the chaotic rush of blood flowing into vials and the loneliness that came with working under the constant watch of time. For years, she had navigated this world, expertly wielding needles like miniature swords, drawing out life's crimson treasures for research and treatment. Tonight, though, her usual stoicism felt brittle. A new batch of patients were coming in – a young woman, pale and trembling, with her face pressed against the door; and an older man, his eyes burning red-rimmed, whose shoulders slumped under the weight of unspoken sorrow. Amy's heart went out to them both, echoing the hum of the fluorescent lights above.
