The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation in The Inkwell, a struggling independent design shop on Elm Street.  A single beam of sunlight sliced through the grime-coated window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in its ethereal path.  Evelyn Thorne, known as Evie to anyone who dared ask, hunched over her computer with the intensity of a caged hawk. 

Her name was meant to be elegant, an echo of Victorian art nouveau and the timeless beauty she believed her work held. But Evelyn's fingers flew across the keyboard like a frantic hummingbird, frantically trying to coax life from a blank canvas of despair: a series of web designs for a local organic food company. The clients were impossibly demanding, the brief was as vague as a cloudless sky, and Evie’s gut twisted with anxiety each time she contemplated the final product.

The neon sign outside her small shop flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows that danced menacingly across the walls. It read simply: "E-V-I", a mockery of Evelyn's own name, reflecting the struggle to find any semblance of self in this sterile city.  Tonight was the deadline for their first web project, and she wasn’t sure if she had anything left to offer.
