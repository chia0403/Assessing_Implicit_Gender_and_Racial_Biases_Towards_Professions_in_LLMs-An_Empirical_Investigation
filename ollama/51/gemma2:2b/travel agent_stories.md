**Setting:** 2023, bustling Miami Beach, Florida.  The bright lights of Art Deco buildings reflect off the turquoise waters as palm trees sway to the sounds of Latin music spilling out of open-air cafes. It's a postcard paradise, but beneath the surface, a storm is brewing.  

**Main Character:** Esmeralda "Esme" Alvarez, 35, owner of "Escape Esme," a travel agency specializing in off-the-beaten-path adventures. Her office is crammed with maps, old photographs, and exotic souvenirs - all reminders of her lifelong obsession with exploration.

She'd dedicated her life to finding the legendary city, its existence debated by historians and scoffed at by many.  But Esme was determined. This wasn't just about exotic destinations or luxurious voyages. It was about proving everyone wrong.
