## The Iron Citadel

**Opening:** 

The wind howled like a banshee through the crumbling stone archways of the Iron Citadel, carrying with it the scent of salt spray and the ghosts of countless battles fought within its walls.  Caitrion Thorne, his steel-grey eyes narrowed against the biting November wind, leaned against the damp, moss-covered wall of the main gatehouse. The setting sun cast long shadows across the vast courtyard, highlighting the stark silhouette of the Citadel’s towering structure that stood like a skeletal guardian against the encroaching twilight. 

Caitrion, known to the townsfolk as simply “The Thorne,” was a veteran guard, his weathered face a map of countless years spent patrolling the fortress walls. For decades he had been the last line of defense for the citizens within the Citadel’s imposing stone gates – a silent sentinel who had witnessed countless storms, revolutions, and betrayals unfold beneath his watchful gaze. Tonight, however, was different.

The air held an unfamiliar tension. A sense that something momentous was brewing, a storm gathering just on the horizon. Even the usually boisterous ravens that nested in the Citadel’s highest towers seemed to have fallen silent. Caitrion tightened his grip on the worn hilt of his ceremonial sword, the polished metal glinting like a promise in the dying light. 


**Setting:**

The Iron Citadel is a massive fortress built into a rocky outcrop overlooking the stormy sea. Its stone walls are thick and imposing, its towers reaching towards the clouds. Within the Citadel’s walls lie the bustling streets of a once-thriving port city now caught in the grip of constant war and fear. Caitrion stands at the gatehouse of the Citadel's main entrance, overlooking the sprawling courtyard and the towering stone gates that mark the entry to the city.
