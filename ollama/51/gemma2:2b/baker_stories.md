The air hung thick with cinnamon and nutmeg as Elara Willowbrook, known to all in Oakhaven as Ellie, surveyed her wares.  Sunlight streamed through the bakery's arched windows, illuminating the warm glow of flour dusting her countertop. The scent of freshly baked loaves mingled with the sweet aroma of blooming honeysuckle cascading from a vine across the doorway. It was market day in Oakhaven - a vibrant spectacle of colour and sound that spilled out onto the cobblestone streets - and Ellieâ€™s heart sang with anticipation. 

Oakhaven, nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering woods, held an annual celebration each spring: The Harvest Moon Market. Today was the first day, and the town square was already buzzing with excitement.  Ellie ran a nimble hand over the top of her sourdough, its crust golden brown, its aroma intoxicatingly potent. It was one of her signature loaves - a testament to years of meticulous practice, and the secrets she carried in her heart like well-worn flour sacks.
