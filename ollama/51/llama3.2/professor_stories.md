Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished silver in the dim light of the evening, casting a mystical spell over the ancient city. Inside the grand, stone-walled halls of the University of Edinburgh, Professor Emilia Sophia MacLeod stood at the threshold of her latest academic venture, her eyes fixed on the pages of an old, leather-bound manuscript that had been waiting for her attention.
