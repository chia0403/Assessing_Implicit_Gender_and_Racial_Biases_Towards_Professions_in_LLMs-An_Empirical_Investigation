Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was filled with the sweet scent of jasmine and the sound of vendors calling out to tourists as they made their way through the crowded streets.

Ava Amira El-Khouri, a seasoned tour guide with a deep knowledge of the city's history and secrets, stood at the edge of the Monastery, her eyes scanning the crowd of visitors as they gathered around her. She was known for her engaging personality and ability to bring the ancient stones to life, but tonight she felt a sense of unease that she couldn't shake.

As the tourists began to file into the amphitheater-style theater where Ava would be giving her evening talk on the history of Petra, she noticed a group of strangers lingering at the edge of the crowd. They seemed out of place among the throngs of well-worn travelers, and their eyes gleamed with an intensity that made Ava's skin prickle.

"Welcome, everyone," Ava began, her voice carrying across the theater as she launched into her talk on the majesty of Petra. But as she spoke, she couldn't help but wonder what had brought these strangers to this place tonight, and whether they were there for the same reason that she was: to uncover secrets hidden in the ancient stones.

This setting establishes Ava Amira El-Khouri as a knowledgeable and charismatic tour guide, while also introducing an air of mystery and unease. The story can now unfold from here, exploring Ava's investigation into the strangers' presence and their potential motives.
