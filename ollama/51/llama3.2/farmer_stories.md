Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was just starting to peek over the rolling hills of the Iowa countryside, casting a warm orange glow over the fields and farmland that had been in Elijah Wystan Thayer's family for generations. Elijah, or Eli as he was known to his friends and neighbors, stood at the edge of his property, sipping coffee from a worn leather cup and surveying the land he loved. His farm, Greenhaven, stretched out before him like a patchwork quilt, with rows of corn and soybeans stretching towards the horizon.

Eli had spent most of his life here, working alongside his father and grandfather to bring in the crops and tend to the livestock that kept their farm running. But as he stood there on this crisp spring morning, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The weather forecast had predicted a dry spell for the next few weeks, which meant that Eli would have to work twice as hard to keep his fields watered and his crops healthy. And then there were the strange occurrences that had been happening around the farm - equipment malfunctioning, tools gone missing, and an eerie feeling of being watched that seemed to settle over him like a shroud at night.

Despite the challenges ahead, Eli felt a sense of pride and purpose as he gazed out at his land. He was a farmer, through and through, and he would do whatever it took to keep Greenhaven thriving. But little did he know, this was just the beginning of a summer that would test his resolve, his patience, and his very way of life.
