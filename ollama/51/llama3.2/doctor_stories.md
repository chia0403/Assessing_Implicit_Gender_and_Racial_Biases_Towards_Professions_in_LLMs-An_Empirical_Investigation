Here's a story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Elliot Thompson stood at the edge of the small, rusty dock that jutted out into the murky waters of Bayou Teche, the air thick with the sweet scent of blooming magnolias and the distant tang of decay. As he gazed out across the bayou, the golden light of dawn was slowly creeping over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the twisted cypress trees that seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets.

Elliot, a seasoned doctor with years of experience in emergency medicine, had traded his high-stakes hospital life for a quieter existence in this small Louisiana town. He'd inherited the old family homestead on the bayou from a great aunt he'd never known, and after a painful divorce, he'd seen it as the perfect opportunity to start anew.

As he sipped his coffee, the sound of birds chirping and the soft lapping of the water against the shore created a soothing melody that seemed to wash away the stress of the past few weeks. Elliot felt a sense of peace settle over him, one he hadn't known in years.

But as he turned back towards the small Cajun-style cabin that served as his home, his gaze caught on something peculiar - a faded black sedan parked at the edge of the dock, its tires scuffed and worn. The door was open, just a crack, and Elliot could have sworn he'd closed it when he came out to enjoy the morning.

Something about the sight sent a shiver down his spine. Who would be visiting him so early on a Sunday? And what were they doing here?
