Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain pounded against the windows of Jack Edward McCormick's small office, casting a dim gloom over the cramped space. As a draftsman for a mid-sized architecture firm in downtown Seattle, Jack had grown accustomed to the drizzly days that seemed to dominate the Pacific Northwest climate. He rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that had been building all morning.

Outside, the gray sky stretched out as far as the eye could see, punctuated only by the occasional skyscraper or church spire. The streets were deserted, save for the occasional jogger or cyclist making their way through the rain-soaked sidewalks. Jack's office was a small, windowless cube on the 23rd floor of a nondescript high-rise building, surrounded by the hum of fluorescent lights and the occasional murmur from his coworkers.

As he stared blankly at the computer screen in front of him, Jack couldn't help but feel a sense of discontent wash over him. He had always loved drawing and designing, but working as a draftsman felt like a dead-end job â€“ a necessary evil to pay the bills, but not exactly fulfilling. And yet, he had no idea what else he wanted to do with his life.

Just then, Jack's phone rang, breaking the silence. It was the lead architect on the upcoming project, a sleek new high-rise in South Lake Union. "Hey, Jack, it's Tom. I need you to get some revisions done on that design package by the end of the day. Can you make that happen?"
