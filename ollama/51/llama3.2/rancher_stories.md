Here's a story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby sagebrush that stretched as far as the eye could see. In the small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of Arizona's desert landscape, 35-year-old Ryder Jackson "RJ" Thompson was finishing up the day's chores at his family's ranch.

As he gazed out over the property, his mind wandered to the gathering storm brewing on the horizon - a severe drought that had been draining the life from the land for months, and threatening the livelihood of ranchers like RJ. The once-lush pastures were now nothing more than dry, cracked earth, and the creek bed was dry and dusty.

Despite the challenges, RJ took pride in his work as a fifth-generation rancher, and he was determined to find a way to overcome the obstacles ahead. His family's ranch had been a staple of Willow Creek for over a century, providing fresh meat and dairy products to the local community. But with the drought tightening its grip, RJ was starting to wonder if it would be enough.

As he turned his back on the stunning view, RJ heard the rumble of an engine outside the barn door. It was his best friend, Jesse, who had stopped by for a visit. The two men had grown up together, exploring the desert and sharing stories of their adventures around campfires under the stars. Now, as they stood side by side in the fading light, RJ knew that he could count on Jesse to have his back - no matter what the future held.

"Hey, man," Jesse said, grinning, "what's the plan for dinner? I'm starvin'!"

RJ chuckled and clapped him on the back. "How about we fire up the grill and throw some steaks on? My mom's been cookin' up a storm all day."

As they headed towards the farmhouse, RJ couldn't shake off the feeling that something was brewing - both literally and figuratively. The drought may have brought challenges, but it also seemed to be stirring up secrets and lies in the small town of Willow Creek...
