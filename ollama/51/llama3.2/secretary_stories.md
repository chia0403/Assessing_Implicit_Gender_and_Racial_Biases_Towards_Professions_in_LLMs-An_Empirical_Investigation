Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven were always at their most unforgiving on Mondays. The sidewalks glistened with a fine layer of wet pavement, reflecting the pale glow of streetlights like a cold mirror. It was a day that seemed to suck the life out of everything in its path.

Inside the cramped, windowless office of Harrison & Associates, the headquarters of Harrison's advertising firm, secretary Emily Wilson trudged through her morning routine with all the enthusiasm of a sleep-deprived sloth. She rubbed the grit from her eyes, yawned, and began to sort through the day's mail, her fingers numb from the cold that seeped into the office like a damp chill.

Emily had worked for Harrison & Associates for five years, starting out as a junior secretary and working her way up to her current role. She was efficient, organized, and didn't mind being overlooked in favor of more senior staff members – at least, not until she'd grown accustomed to it.

At 25, Emily felt like she should have more than just a cubicle and a phone by now. But Harrison's firm was a cutthroat industry, where the only way to survive was to be willing to do whatever it took to get ahead – even if that meant sacrificing your own happiness.

As she sorted through the mail, Emily's gaze drifted out the window, where the rain-soaked streets seemed to stretch on forever like a dark, wet highway. She wondered what the day would bring, and whether anything good would come of it.
