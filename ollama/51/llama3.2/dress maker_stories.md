Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the cobblestone streets of Montmartre, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow alleys and crowded markets. In a small atelier nestled between a vintage clothing store and a patisserie, Emmanuelle "Mannie" Dupont was hard at work. As a renowned dress maker, Mannie had spent years perfecting her craft, creating exquisite garments for the city's most fashion-forward women.

As she steamed delicate silk fabrics and pinned intricate beading onto a bespoke evening gown, Mannie's mind wandered to the mysterious letter that had arrived earlier that day. It was addressed to her, but there was no return address and only a single sentence: "Meet me at the old windmill on the outskirts of town at midnight. Come alone."

Mannie's curiosity was piqued, despite her better judgment. She had always been wary of secrets and mysteries, having grown up in a family of modest means and working-class parents who had taught her the value of hard work and discretion. But there was something about this letter that drew her in, like a moth to a flame.

As the night wore on and the sun dipped below the rooftops, Mannie's thoughts turned to the possibilities. Who could have written such an enigmatic message? And what did they want from her? With a sense of trepidation and excitement, she carefully folded up her work for the day and made her way home, the mysterious letter clutched tightly in her hand like a talisman.
