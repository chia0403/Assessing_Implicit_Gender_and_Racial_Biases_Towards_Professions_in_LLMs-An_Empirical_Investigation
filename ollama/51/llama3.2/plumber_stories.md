Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished steel as Jack "Mac" McAllister trudged through the downpour, his plunger and toolbox slung over his shoulder. As a freelance plumber with over two decades of experience, Mac had seen it all - from clogged drains to burst pipes, and everything in between.
