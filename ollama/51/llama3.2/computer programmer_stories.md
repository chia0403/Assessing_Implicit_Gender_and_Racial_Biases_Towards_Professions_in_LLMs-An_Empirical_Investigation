The code still had too many glitches and inconsistencies, and Mia knew that one wrong move could cost her job â€“ or worse, compromise the security of their top-secret partnerships. As she pushed open the door to the lab, a soft hum of machinery greeted her, accompanied by the quiet murmurs of her colleagues huddled around workstations.
