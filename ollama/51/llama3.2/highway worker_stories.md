Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the desolate stretch of Highway 12, casting a golden glow over the crumbling asphalt and rusting guardrails that lined its edges. The air was thick with the scent of diesel fuel and decaying vegetation, a smell that Highway Worker Elliot Jenson knew all too well.

Elliot, or EJ as he liked to be called, stood at the edge of the highway, his eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of trouble. He had been working on this stretch of road for years, and he knew every bump, every pothole, and every loose patch like the back of his hand.

As a member of the state's highway maintenance crew, Elliot spent his days fixing broken bridges, clearing fallen trees, and performing routine repairs to keep the roads safe for drivers. He took pride in his work, knowing that the jobs he did helped keep people safe and connected to their communities.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Elliot had received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number, warning him of a impending disaster on Highway 12. The caller had been cryptic, but one thing was clear: something big was coming, and EJ was the only one who could see it.

As Elliot looked out over the deserted highway, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew that he couldn't ignore the warning, not now that he had heard it. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him to the edge of danger and beyond.
