Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in late October when Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her small apartment building in downtown Portland, Oregon. She took a deep breath of the damp air, feeling the misty rain on her face as she gazed out at the familiar streets of the city's financial district. As an accountant for a mid-sized firm, Emilia had spent countless hours staring at spreadsheets and crunching numbers, but tonight she was on her way to a dinner date with a potential new client.

She had worked hard to build a reputation as one of the most reliable and detail-oriented accountants in town, and she was eager to show off her skills and make a good impression on her new client, Olivia Wellesley.

She spotted Olivia waiting for her at a corner table by the window, sipping on a glass of wine and looking every bit as poised and confident as she had promised to be over the phone.

But despite her professional demeanor, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this meeting...
