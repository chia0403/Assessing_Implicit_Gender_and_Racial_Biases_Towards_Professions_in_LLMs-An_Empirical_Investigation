Here's a potential story opening and setting for an occupational therapy-based story:

Opening:

"As she sipped her morning coffee, occupational therapist Dr. Emilia Rose Jenkins gazed out at the grey skies above the hospital's rehabilitation ward. It was going to be another long day of helping patients regain their independence and overcome the challenges that had been holding them back. But Emilia wasn't one to shy away from a challenge. She took pride in her work, knowing that every small victory could make all the difference in someone's life."

Setting:

The story takes place at Mercy General Hospital, a large urban teaching hospital with a robust rehabilitation program. The ward where Emilia works is specifically designed for patients who have suffered traumatic injuries, such as strokes, spinal cord injuries, or amputations. The room is filled with the soft beeping of machines and the murmur of conversations from patients, family members, and caregivers.

Emilia's specific role involves working with a group of patients who are recovering from various forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI). She uses her expertise in occupational therapy to help them regain their daily functioning skills, such as dressing, feeding, and managing their medications. Her team is small, but she has a loyal support system, including her colleagues Dr. Rachel Patel, a neurologist, and Lisa Nguyen, a physical therapist.

As Emilia begins her day, she receives a call from the nurse's station, informing her that one of her patients, 35-year-old Sarah Taylor, has just woken up from a coma-induced seizure. The news is not entirely unexpected – Sarah had suffered a severe TBI in a car accident several weeks ago – but Emilia knows that every patient's recovery is unpredictable and always a surprise.

With a sense of trepidation, Emilia makes her way to Sarah's room, ready to face whatever challenges the day may bring.
