Here's a story opening and setting:

Detective Emily Jane "Evie" Thompson stepped out of the crisp autumn rain and into the warm glow of the precinct's lobby. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the steady beat of her heart, a familiar rhythm that had accompanied her through countless late nights and early mornings on the job.

As she hung up her soaked coat, Evie couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be a long night. The streets were always quietest just before dawn, but tonight felt different - like the city was holding its breath in anticipation of something.

Outside, the rain had slowed to a gentle patter, casting a misty veil over the towering skyscrapers and narrow alleys of downtown Seattle. The Space Needle stood sentinel in the distance, its lights twinkling like stars in the pre-dawn darkness.

Evie glanced down at her watch - 2:47 AM. Just enough time for a cup of coffee and some quiet reflection before the shift got underway. But as she turned to head into the precinct, her phone buzzed on her belt, shattering the peaceful silence.

"Detective Thompson," she answered, her voice low and even.

And that's when everything changed.
