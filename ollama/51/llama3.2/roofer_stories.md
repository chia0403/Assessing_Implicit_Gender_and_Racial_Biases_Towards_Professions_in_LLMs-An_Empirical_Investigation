Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn sidewalks. On Elm Street, where the old oak trees cast long shadows in the late afternoon light, 32-year-old Jack "Mac" McCarthy sat perched on the edge of his roof, gazing out at the view.

As a roofer, Mac had spent countless hours on rooftops like this one, but he never got tired of the feeling of being up high, with nothing but the wind and the sky for company. He had worked in construction since he was a teenager, learning the trade from his father, who had learned it from his own father before him. Mac's family had lived in Willow Creek all their lives, and he loved the town almost as much as he loved fixing leaky roofs and patching up damaged shingles.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Mac had a problem on his hands. He had just finished installing a new roof for the old Jenkins' house, but when he went to collect his pay from the bank, he discovered that the check had been lost in the mail. Again.
