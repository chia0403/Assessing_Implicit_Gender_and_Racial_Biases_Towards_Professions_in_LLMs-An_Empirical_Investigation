Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Kaia Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her office and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the sprawling campus of Oakwood University. As a counseling psychologist with a specialization in trauma recovery, Dr. Thompson had seen her fair share of dark days and desperate souls. But on this particular morning, something felt different. Maybe it was the way the sunlight danced through the leaves on the trees, or perhaps it was the sense of excitement that always came before a new semester began.

Whatever it was, Dr. Thompson felt a spark of energy ignite within her as she made her way across campus to the student union building. She had just finished a meeting with the university's counseling center administrators and was eager to dive into her first day of fall classes. Her students were waiting for her in the lecture hall, and she couldn't wait to share her expertise with them.

As she pushed open the door to the student union, Dr. Thompson was greeted by the warm aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of conversation. The sound of chatter and laughter filled the air, and she smiled to herself as she made her way towards her office in the psychology department. It was going to be a great semester.

How's that? I've given you a potential opening scene with the main character, Dr. Kaia Alexandra Thompson, setting up the story and establishing the setting of Oakwood University. Let me know if you have any specific requests or changes!
