Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and weathered houses. Real estate agent Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside her office building, a small beachfront bungalow with a worn wooden sign that creaked in the gentle sea breeze. Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the salty air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the ocean. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved her job – not just showing houses to clients, but sharing the essence of Tidal Cove with people who thought they knew it all.

Lexi's eyes scanned the parking lot, where a sleek black SUV sat waiting for her. She had a client meeting scheduled in an hour, and she still needed to review the listing files for the Smith property – a sprawling beachfront estate that was rumored to be on the market after years of being off-limits. As she turned back towards her office, a piece of paper slipped from her pocket and floated to the ground.

It was a note, scribbled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone."
