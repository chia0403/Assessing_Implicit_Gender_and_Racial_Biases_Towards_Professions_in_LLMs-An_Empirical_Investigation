Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a sweltering summer evening in late August, and the sun had just dipped below the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan's financial district. The air was thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and freshly brewed coffee from the cafes that lined the streets of Wall Street.

Austen Wynter, a 32-year-old stock broker with a sharp mind and a quick wit, stood at the edge of his office window, gazing out at the glittering lights of the city below. He was a rising star in the world of high finance, known for his ability to navigate even the most complex markets with ease.

As he sipped on a glass of fine scotch, Austen's mind wandered back to the meeting he had just left with his boss, where he had received an offer that would change everything. The company was considering merging with a rival firm, and they wanted Austen to be part of the team negotiating the deal.

But as Austen gazed out at the city, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him all week, and he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. He made a mental note to dig deeper into the merger proposal before making any big decisions.

Little did Austen know, this was just the beginning of a wild ride that would take him from the high-stakes world of finance to the dark alleys of organized crime.
