Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the Parisian sky, casting a warm orange glow over the City of Light, Aubrey Adèle LaFleur stepped out of her small atelier on Rue de Rivoli, taking a deep breath of the crisp evening air. The scent of freshly baked croissants and roasting coffee wafted through the streets, enticing passersby to indulge in the city's famous culinary delights.

Aubrey, with her wild curls of curly brown hair and bright green eyes, gazed out at the elegant façades of Haussmannian buildings, their intricate stonework and ornate balconies a testament to the city's rich history. As an interior decorator, she had spent countless hours within these walls, bringing the beauty of Parisian architecture to life through her design choices.

Tonight, however, Aubrey was on her way to meet a potential new client at a luxurious townhouse in the 8th arrondissement. She had received a cryptic email from an anonymous source, promising a high-end project that would push her skills to new heights. The prospect of working with a discerning client and showcasing her talents on a grand scale sent a thrill through Aubrey's veins, and she quickened her pace as she made her way towards the townhouse, eager to see what the night had in store.

Little did Aubrey know, this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take her deep into the heart of Parisian society, where secrets lurked behind ornate doors and hidden agendas threatened to upend her carefully crafted world.
