Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the small town of Oakdale, nestled in the heart of rural Illinois. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming lilacs.

In a small trailer parked behind his truck, Bertrand "Bert" Thompson stretched his arms and yawned, shaking off the remnants of a restless night's sleep. As a landscaper for the past decade, Bert knew every inch of Oakdale, from the sprawling lawns of the wealthy elite to the overgrown gardens of the struggling single mothers who worked at the local diner.

Bert's own garden, tucked away in a corner of his trailer lot, was a reflection of his love for nature and his quiet rebellion against the industrialized world. He spent most of his free time tending to it, coaxing life from the neglected soil and experimenting with novel combinations of native flowers and herbs.

As he swung open the creaky door of his trailer, Bert's gaze fell upon a piece of paper slipped under the doorstop, with a single sentence scrawled on it in hastily scribbled handwriting: "Meet me at the old oak at midnight. Come alone."
