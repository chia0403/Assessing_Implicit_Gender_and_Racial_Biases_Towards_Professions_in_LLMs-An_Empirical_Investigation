Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small coastal town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint shops and homes that lined its Main Street. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of saltwater and the sound of seagulls wheeling overhead.

In a small spa nestled between a vintage clothing store and a bookstore, Aurora "Rory" Wynter was preparing for her first appointment of the evening. A licensed massage therapist with a calm and compassionate demeanor, Rory had built a loyal client base among the town's residents, each one drawn to her ability to ease their physical and emotional tension.

As she lit the candles in her treatment room and ran a calming essential oil through her diffuser, Rory felt a sense of peace wash over her. She loved this time of day, when the world seemed to slow down and all that mattered was the present moment. Little did she know, tonight would bring an unexpected challenge to her tranquil routine.

Rory's gaze drifted out the window, where the stars were beginning to twinkle in the night sky like diamonds scattered across the fabric of the universe. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she sensed that something was off, though she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was. Still, she steeled herself for the night ahead, ready to face whatever came her way with her usual calm and professionalism.
