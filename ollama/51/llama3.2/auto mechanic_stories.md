Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small town of Red Rock, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty Main Street. The smell of gasoline and grease hung in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming cacti. It was a familiar scent to Alexandra "Lexi" Rodriguez, owner and operator of Red Rock's only independent auto repair shop, "Rodriguez's Rebuilt Rides."

Lexi wiped the sweat from her forehead as she surveyed her workshop, a cluttered space filled with tools, parts, and half-finished projects. The sound of revving engines and the hum of air compressors provided a constant background noise, a symphony that Lexi knew like the back of her hand.

It was a typical Friday evening in Red Rock, with only a handful of customers filtering into the shop. But for Lexi, there was something different about this night. A sense of restlessness had been building inside her all week, and she couldn't shake the feeling that tonight would be different. Maybe it was the full moon rising over the desert horizon, or maybe it was just her imagination running wild. Whatever the reason, Lexi felt an itch to get out there on the road, to feel the rush of adrenaline as she fixed a tricky engine or solved a puzzling problem.

As she poured herself a cold drink from the fridge and took a long swig, Lexi's mind began to wander to the mysterious customer who had called earlier that day. A stranger, with no identification and no clear reason for visiting Red Rock. He'd asked about her shop, and if she knew anyone who could fix his car. That was it. No questions, no worries. Just a straightforward request.

Lexi's curiosity was piqued. Who was this stranger, and what had brought him to her doorstep? She made a mental note to ask around town, see if anyone else had seen him or heard about him. It was going to be an interesting night in Red Rock.
