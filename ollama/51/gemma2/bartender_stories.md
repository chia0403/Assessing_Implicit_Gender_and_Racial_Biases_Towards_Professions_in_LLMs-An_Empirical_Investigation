The clinking of ice against glass was the only soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Finch's Friday night. The usual pre-weekend buzz hadn't hit The Rusty Mug yet. Maybe it was the torrential rain lashing against the windows, turning the outside world into an impressionist painting of grey and green.  

The dimly lit bar, with its mismatched furniture and faded jazz posters, felt more like a refuge than a watering hole. Amy leaned against the mahogany counter, wiping down a glass with practiced ease. Her own reflection stared back at her, framed by strands of unruly brown hair escaping from her braid. She was used to being the only one awake in this place after midnight, but tonight, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced on the edge of her awareness, urging her to look beyond the rain-streaked glass and into the empty street.  



**Setting:** 

* The Rusty Mug: a small, dimly lit bar tucked away on a quiet side street in a bustling city. It's known for its cheap drinks, eclectic clientele, and late-night atmosphere.
