Outside, the Chicago autumn wind howled, rustling the leaves into vibrant piles on the sidewalk just outside her classroom window. But inside Mrs. Rose's kindergarten class at St. Augustineâ€™s School, it was a haven of color and controlled chaos. Twenty-five five-year-olds buzzed around like bumblebees, fueled by sugary snacks and boundless energy.  

Amy sighed, trying to herd the children away from the construction paper mountain they'd inadvertently built in the corner. "Okay everyone," she called, her voice a bright counterpoint to the cacophony, "circle time! Time for our story!"

She smiled, feeling a familiar warmth bloom in her chest. These tiny humans, with their boundless imaginations and sticky fingers, were her world.
