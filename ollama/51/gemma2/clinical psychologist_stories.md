The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the cobblestone street below. The incessant drumming echoed the rhythm in her chest, a nervous thrum that had become a constant companion since the case landed on her desk.  

Eleanor sat perched on the edge of her leather armchair, its worn surface smooth beneath her fingertips. The office itself was a haven of muted browns and greens, designed to be calming, but the storm outside cast long shadows that danced across the walls like restless spirits. She sighed, pushing aside the file titled "Patient: Anonymous," its contents heavy with cryptic messages and disturbing sketches. 

The anonymous patient had contacted her through an encrypted email, pleading for help. Their words were fragmented, laced with fear and paranoia, hinting at a horrifying reality only they seemed to perceive. The case felt like a tangled thread, leading into the dark heart of the city's underbelly, a place Eleanor usually avoided.  But something in those desperate pleas drew her in, an irresistible call to unravel the mystery before it consumed its victim entirely.


Her gaze drifted to a single, vibrant poppy blooming defiantly from a pot on the windowsill, its crimson petals stark against the gray backdrop of the storm-ravaged city. It was a fragile thing, yet it persisted.  A glimmer of hope in the encroaching darkness. Perhaps, Eleanor thought, there was still a chance to save her patient before their world crumbled entirely.
