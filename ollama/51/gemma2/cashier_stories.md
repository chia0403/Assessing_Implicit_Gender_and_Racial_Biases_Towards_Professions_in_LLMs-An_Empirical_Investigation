The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and microwave popcorn, a familiar aroma that clung to every surface in the 24-hour convenience store where she worked. It was 3:17 am, Wednesday morning, which meant mostly bored college students looking for instant ramen and weary truckers searching for lukewarm coffee and questionable snacks. Evelyn, with her faded pink hair pulled back in a messy bun, scanned the items on the conveyor belt with practiced boredom. A crumpled pack of gummy worms, a half-empty bag of potato chips, a can of Mountain Dew â€“ another typical transaction. Just then, the bell above the door jangled, announcing a new customer. 


Evelyn looked up, expecting to see another bleary-eyed student or truck driver, but instead, she found herself staring into the eyes of someone entirely different. He was tall and slender, his features sharp and angular, dressed in clothes that seemed too elegant for this dingy corner store.  He wore a silver pendant around his neck, glinting faintly in the harsh fluorescent light. And he looked at her with an intensity that sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine.
