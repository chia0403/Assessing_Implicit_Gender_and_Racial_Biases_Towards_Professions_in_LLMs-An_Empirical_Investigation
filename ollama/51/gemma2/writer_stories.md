Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop like a tiny hammer against the warped glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne hunched over her battered typewriter, the rhythmic clatter of keys competing with the storm's fury. Dust motes danced in the weak beam of light filtering through the grimy pane, illuminating the chaotic scene: stacks of paper overflowing from every corner, empty coffee mugs drying on a rickety table, and a faint smell of mildew clinging to the air. 

Amelia ignored it all, her focus laser-sharp on the blinking cursor that seemed to mock her with its blankness.  She had been stuck on this sentence for hours: "The wind whispered secrets through the gnarled branches..." It wasn't the words themselves, but the lack of inspiration, the absence of the spark that usually ignited her imagination. 

The storm, however, seemed determined to provide it. A sudden, deafening crack of thunder reverberated through the old house, followed by a flash that illuminated the attic in an eerie white light. The power flickered, then died, plunging Amelia into darkness.  She cursed under her breath, but then, something strange happened. In the stillness, she heard a faint whisper, barely audible above the wind's howl. It seemed to come from the corner of the room, where a dusty trunk lay forgotten beneath a pile of faded tapestries. 


Amelia felt a shiver crawl up her spine. This was more than just a storm; this was something else entirely.
