The scent of sawdust hung thick in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of pine and the tang of freshly cut metal. Sunlight streamed through the open windows of Elijah Blackwoodâ€™s workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air.  Elijah, his hands calloused and strong, carefully fitted a dovetail joint on a weathered oak table leg. His brow furrowed in concentration as he adjusted the piece, muttering to himself about the stubborn grain. 

The workshop itself was nestled on the edge of a sleepy coastal town called Havenwood, tucked away from the bustle of the main street. It was a ramshackle building with mismatched shingles and walls painted a faded shade of seafoam green.  Inside, it was a haven for Elijah - a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of his work, the clanging of hammers, the rasp of planes, and the comforting scent of wood.  The workshop housed years of accumulated treasures: ancient tools passed down from generations of Blackwoods, half-finished projects taking up every corner, and shelves overflowing with exotic woods brought in from faraway lands.
