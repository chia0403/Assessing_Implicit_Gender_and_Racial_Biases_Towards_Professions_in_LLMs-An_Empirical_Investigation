Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Beaumont's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own mind.  The city lights blurred into an impressionistic watercolour through the downpour, casting the sterile room in a melancholic glow. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her leather armchair, stared at the untouched mug of lukewarm coffee beside her. The scent of Earl Grey usually calmed her, but tonight, it did little to quell the gnawing anxiety twisting in her gut.

The recent string of unexplained disappearances hadn't helped. Whispers of something sinister lurking beneath the surface of their otherwise vibrant lives had seeped into every conversation, casting a pall over the air. Eleanor tried to dismiss these anxieties as unfounded speculation, but a seed of doubt had been planted, taking root in her rational mind.  Tonight, however, it threatened to bloom into full-blown fear.
