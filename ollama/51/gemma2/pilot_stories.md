The rusty red sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the desolate expanse of Kepler-186f.  Captain Elara Vance gripped the controls of her battered scout ship, the 'Red Sparrow,' its aging engines groaning with every shuddering pulse. A layer of dust, red as rust and as fine as powdered glass, coated everything; even her visor bore a faint crimson film she couldn't quite scrub away.

Elara squinted at the datapad projecting a holographic map of the treacherous canyons that riddled this planetâ€™s surface. "Damn thing," she muttered, her voice crackling through the comms system.  "Never should have taken this shortcut." 

She was running out of time. Her mission: to locate the lost expedition led by Dr. Anya Sharma and bring them back before the unforgiving Keplerian night swallowed them whole. The comms had gone dead weeks ago, leaving Elara with only a trail of cryptic distress signals and her own gnawing sense of dread. Now, deep in the canyons, she was facing an inferno of wind-swept sand, towering cliffs that pierced the bruised sky, and the ever-present fear that silence meant something worse than just lost signal.
