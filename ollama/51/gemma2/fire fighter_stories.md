Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruise of purple and orange, bleeding into an ominous red horizon where the flames devoured another section of the old warehouse district. Elias felt the heat on his face even through the thick glass window, the oppressive warmth a constant reminder of the danger that lurked just beyond their station walls.

Each blaze was a stark reminder of neglect, of dreams turned to ash, of lives lost or changed forever by the unforgiving tongue of fire. But Elias didn't flinch. He tightened his grip on the pole leading down into the truck bay, adrenaline surging through him like a shot of pure energy. It was time to do what he trained for, what he knew in his heart: fight the fire, save lives, and hold back the darkness.
