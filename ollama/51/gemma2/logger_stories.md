The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth as Elias Thorne swung his axe, the steel biting into the heartwood of a towering Douglas fir. Sunlight, fractured by the canopy overhead, dappled the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow.  Elias's muscles throbbed with familiar ache, a testament to years spent wrestling with nature's giants. He wiped the sweat from his brow, his calloused hand leaving a smear across his weathered face.

He dismissed it as nerves, chalked it up to the solitude. He had worked these woods for twenty years, knew them like the back of his hand. There was nothing here to fear.
