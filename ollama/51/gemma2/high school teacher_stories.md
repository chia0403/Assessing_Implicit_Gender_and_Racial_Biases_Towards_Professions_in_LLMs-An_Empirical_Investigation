The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a chorus of disgruntled bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Mrs. Eleanor Ashworth's history classroom.  A lone ray of sunlight sliced through the grime-coated window, illuminating a dust mote dance in its path. It was the kind of Wednesday afternoon that stretched on forever, heavy with the lingering scent of stale pizza and adolescent apathy. 

Eleanor, her silver hair pulled back into a tight bun, tapped her foot impatiently against the linoleum floor.  Sheâ€™d just finished explaining the intricacies of the Treaty of Versailles to a room full of blank stares, punctuated by the occasional snore. At least three students were openly texting under their desks, and the boy in the back row seemed determined to make origami airplanes out of his homework assignment. 

This wasn't how she imagined her last year at Oakwood High going.  


**Setting:** A run-down history classroom at a small, public high school in a Midwestern town.  The year is 2023.
