The biting wind whipped across the Citadel's ramparts, carrying with it the tang of salt and the mournful cries of gulls. The sky, bruised purple with the approaching storm, mirrored the growing unease in Elara Anya Thorne's chest. As one of the Royal Guard, she was duty-bound to stand watch, her hand perpetually hovering over the hilt of her sword, even when a chill gnawed at her bones and fatigue threatened to pull her under. Tonight, though, the premonition of something amiss felt heavier than usual. The air crackled with an unseen tension, a silence so profound it whispered danger in Elara's ear.


**Setting:**  The Citadel, a towering fortress perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the tempestuous Sea of Storms. Its grey stone walls are weathered by centuries of salt spray and siege, its ramparts bristling with archers and soldiers like vigilant sentinels guarding against the ever-present threat from the lawless sea beyond. The city itself lies nestled within the Citadel's shadow, a bustling hub of merchants, artisans, and sailors, but tonight, even the usual vibrant hum felt muted by the approaching storm.
