The scent of jasmine hung heavy in the humid Florida air, clinging to Amelia Brighton's crisp white blouse as she walked briskly down Magnolia Avenue. The midday sun beat down on her back, turning the cobblestones beneath her heels into shimmering mirages. Palm trees swayed languidly in the breeze, their fronds casting dancing shadows across the pastel-colored storefronts lining the street. 

Amelia, a real estate agent with a name as bright and sunny as her disposition, adjusted the strap of her designer handbag and scanned the bustling scene. Today was a big day – she was meeting with a potential buyer for the Victorian mansion at 125 Hawthorne Lane, a property that had been on the market for months and represented Amelia’s chance to finally close a major deal after a string of smaller successes. But as her eyes swept across the vibrant crowd, filled with tourists, locals sipping iced coffee, and even a stray iguana sunning itself on a sidewalk bench, a sense of unease prickled at the back of Amelia's neck. 


The quaint charm of Magnolia Avenue felt… different today.
