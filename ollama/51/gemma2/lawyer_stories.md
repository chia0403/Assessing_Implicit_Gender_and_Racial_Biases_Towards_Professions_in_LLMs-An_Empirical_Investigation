The humidity clung to Amelia Beatrice Davenport like a second skin as she stepped off the ferry onto the cobblestone streets of Harbourtown. The air was thick with the scent of salt and seaweed, punctuated by the cries of gulls and the rhythmic clatter of fishing boats unloading their catch at the nearby pier. 

Amelia smoothed down her crisp white shirt collar, feeling the sweat prickle beneath her linen sleeves. She hated this island. It was a charming anachronism, a quaint postcard come to life, but she found its predictable rhythms and gossipy populace stifling.  She’d only been called back for a single case – defending a local fisherman accused of smuggling endangered sea turtles – yet already she felt the weight of Harbourtown pressing down on her like the heavy fog that often shrouded the island.

She had built a career on navigating the complexities of law, unraveling tangled threads of evidence and exposing truth hidden beneath layers of deceit.  She could handle this. Or at least she’d try. The only question was: would Harbourtown let her?
