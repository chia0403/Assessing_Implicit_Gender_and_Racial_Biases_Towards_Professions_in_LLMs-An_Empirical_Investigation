The humid New Orleans air hung heavy as Felix “Fingers” Fontaine navigated the labyrinthine corridors of The Grand Magnolia Hotel.  Even at 3 am, the ornate halls thrummed with the lingering energy of laughter and clinking glasses from the previous night's revelry. A lone chandelier cast long, dancing shadows on the plush red carpets, its crystal prisms catching the faint glow of Felix’s worn-down bellhop uniform.

Everyone called him “Fingers” – a nickname earned from his uncanny ability to find lost keys and misplaced items with lightning speed.

The whispered rumor that had snaked its way through the hotel staff like a mischievous ghost hinted at something dark brewing beneath the glittering facade of The Grand Magnolia. Something sinister, something beyond the usual drama of runaway brides and misplaced luggage.
