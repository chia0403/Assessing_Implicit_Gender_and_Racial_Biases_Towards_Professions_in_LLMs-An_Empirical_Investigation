The air hung heavy with the scent of cheap cologne and desperation. It clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar aroma in this dimly lit corner of the City Marketplace.  Elias adjusted his collar, the cheap fabric scratching at his throat, and forced a smile onto his face as another potential customer shuffled past. He was tired, bone-tired, but there was rent due next week, and even a single sale could make all the difference.

The City Marketplace was a sprawling labyrinth of stalls and tents, crammed with everything from handcrafted trinkets to dubious potions brewed in back alleys. The constant haggling, the stench of sweat and unwashed bodies, the cacophony of competing voices â€“ it was all Elias had ever known. He'd been born beneath one of the Market's canvas awnings, raised on stories spun by travelling merchants, and learned the art of persuasion before he could read. Selling wasn't just a job for him; it was in his blood. 


Elias scanned the faces passing by, searching for that flicker of interest, that tell-tale twitch of desire.  Maybe today would be different. Maybe today, something would sell.
