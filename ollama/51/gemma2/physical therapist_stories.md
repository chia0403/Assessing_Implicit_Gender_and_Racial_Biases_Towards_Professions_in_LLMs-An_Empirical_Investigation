The scent of antiseptic and lavender clung to Amelia Harper's scrubs like a second skin. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of her clinic, casting long shadows across the polished hardwood floor. Outside, the bustling city hummed with its usual cacophony, but inside Amelia’s small practice, nestled on a quiet side street in Seattle, there was an air of calm. 

Amelia, with her unruly auburn curls pulled back in a loose braid and a faint dusting of freckles across her nose, was adjusting the ankle brace on a young woman named Chloe, who sat patiently on the examination table. Chloe had recently fractured her ankle while training for a marathon, and Amelia's gentle touch and encouraging words were helping her through the frustrating recovery process. 


The soft whir of an electric massage gun filled the room as Amelia worked, a soothing counterpoint to the steady tap-tap-tap of Chloe’s foot against the table. It was in this quiet space, amidst the familiar clinking of metal tools and whispered reassurances, that Amelia Harper found her purpose: helping people reclaim their bodies and find strength where they thought there was none.  But today, a sense of unease lingered in the air. A phone call from Chloe's worried mother, mentioning a strange rash on Chloe's leg, had sent a ripple of worry through Amelia’s usual calm facade.
