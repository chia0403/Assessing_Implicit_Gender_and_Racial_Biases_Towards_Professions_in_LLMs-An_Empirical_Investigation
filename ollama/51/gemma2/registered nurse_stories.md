The sterile scent of bleach and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia "Amy" Harper, RN.  She moved with practiced grace through the fluorescent-lit hallways of Mercy General Hospital's oncology ward, her worn stethoscope bouncing gently against her chest. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the large windows, painting stripes of gold across the pale green walls. Amy paused at a doorway, taking a deep breath before pushing it open. 

Inside, a young woman sat hunched over on the bed, her face obscured by tangled dark curls and a thin blanket pulled tight around her shoulders. The room was silent, save for the rhythmic beeping of a heart monitor that seemed to echo Amy's own anxious pulse. This wasn't just another patient; this was Emily Carter, a bright-eyed girl who had captured everyoneâ€™s hearts with her resilience and humor when she first arrived weeks ago, diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia.  Now, the laughter had faded, replaced by a weary silence that sent a chill down Amy's spine. 


Amy knew time was running out. Emily needed a miracle.
