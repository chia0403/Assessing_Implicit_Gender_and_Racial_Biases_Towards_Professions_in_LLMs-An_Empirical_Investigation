The relentless Nevada sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Jenson's neck as he wrestled with the stubborn steel grate, its rusted edges digging into his palms. Sweat beaded on his forehead, quickly evaporating in the dry heat. Around him, the highway stretched like a grey ribbon under the vast, cloudless sky. The rhythmic hum of passing semis punctuated the silence, their distant horns echoing like lonely wolf cries across the desolate landscape. 

Bart wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of dirt and sweat across his face. He was alone, as usual. Highway maintenance in this part of Nevada was a solitary job, a world of asphalt, gravel, and the occasional desert lizard darting across the road. Today's task: replacing a broken grate on one of the many drainage ditches that snaked along the highway's edge. A small job, but crucial nonetheless. He knew from experience that even a seemingly insignificant detail could cause major headaches if ignored.  


He took a deep breath, savoring the air that tasted faintly of gasoline and dust. This was his life â€“ simple, honest work under an unforgiving sky. He wouldn't trade it for anything.
