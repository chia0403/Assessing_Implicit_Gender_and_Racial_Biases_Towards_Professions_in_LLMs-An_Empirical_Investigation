The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and granite dust, a familiar perfume to Elara Thornewood. Outside her workshop window, the sun beat down on the cobblestones of Oakhaven, turning the midday heat into a shimmering haze. Inside, the workshop was cool and cavernous, lit by shafts of sunlight filtering through cracks in the high ceiling. Tools lay scattered across rough-hewn wooden benches - chisels, hammers, rasps, all whispering tales of countless stones brought to life under Elara's skilled hands. 

She knelt beside a block of emerald green stone, its veins pulsing with the cool fire of a distant quarry. A delicate vein of gold threaded through it like a spiderweb, shimmering in the light. This was no ordinary commission - this was for Lord Hawthorne himself, and Elara knew its completion rested on her shoulders like the weight of a thousand stones. 


This wasn't just about crafting another sculpture; this was about proving herself worthy, not just as a stone cutter, but as an artist capable of capturing the essence of the noble lord in cold, unyielding jade. A bead of sweat trickled down Elara's temple, blending with the dust on her cheek.  She inhaled deeply, the scent of granite grounding her, and brought the chisel down with a decisive swing. The stone yielded with a dull thud, sending a shower of dust into the air. This was her world, this world of stone and shadow, where she could sculpt dreams from reality, one meticulous stroke at a time.
