The greasy rag hung limply in Elias "Eli" Finch's hand, its cotton fibers now stained with a kaleidoscope of motor oil and grime. The scent of burnt metal and gasoline hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to his work clothes like a second skin. His worn leather apron, once black, was now a tapestry woven from patches and stains, each telling a silent story of repairs past.  

Eli's workshop, nestled on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, was less a shop and more a haven for forgotten vehicles. Rusty hulks of cars and trucks lined the dirt floor, their stories whispered in creaking metal and faded paint. Sunlight streamed through a grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A radio crackled with static, spewing out a country tune that had long since lost its rhythm. Eli wiped his brow, leaving a streak of oil across his forehead, and surveyed his domain. It wasn't much, but it was his. He owned every dent, every scar, every whisper of the past etched into these metal skeletons.
