The flickering neon sign outside cast an erratic purple glow across Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she hunched over her cluttered desk. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her small office, each drop a tiny hammer pounding on the glass, mirroring the relentless ache in her head.  

Eleanorâ€™s practice was tucked away on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, a town where secrets clung to the air like morning mist and gossip travelled faster than the dusty wind that swept across the plains.  She had come here five years ago, seeking solace from the bustling city, only to find herself ensnared in a web of tangled lives and whispered anxieties. 

The rhythmic click-clack of her typewriter filled the silence, punctuated by the occasional sigh as she struggled to piece together a coherent thought. A fresh case file lay open before her, its pages smeared with ink and trembling slightly from the draught whistling through the cracks in the window. This one was different. It felt heavier, more urgent than the usual aches and pains that filled her days. The name on the top of the file, scrawled in an unsteady hand, sent a shiver down her spine:  "Samuel Blackwood - Missing."
