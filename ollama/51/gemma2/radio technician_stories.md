The static hissed like a scorned viper, spitting at Alistair Finch in the cramped confines of his workshop. He leaned closer to the antique Zenith console, its Bakelite casing warm beneath his calloused fingers. The scent of solder and ozone hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Alistair's senses. 

His workshop was a haven tucked away on the second floor of a derelict Victorian building in Port Royal, Maine â€“ a town where time seemed to move at a slower pace than anywhere else in the world. Seagulls screeched outside his dusty windows, their cries echoing the incessant hum of the generator keeping the lights flickering above him. Tools lay scattered across workbench surfaces, a testament to Alistair's constant tinkering and repair work. Old radios, gramophones, and even a battered Model T Ford engine occupied corners, each whispering stories of bygone eras. 

Alistair squinted at the schematic in his hand, the lines blurring under the dim light emanating from a frayed lampshade. The Zenith was a mystery, its circuitry behaving erratically, spitting out bursts of garbled sound and strange, almost musical static. It wasn't just any radio; it had belonged to his grandfather, a renowned adventurer who disappeared at sea decades ago, leaving behind only whispers of unsolved mysteries and a box full of peculiar artifacts.  


Alistair adjusted the tuning knob, a flicker of hope igniting in his chest. Perhaps, he thought, this radio held the key to understanding his grandfather's final journey.
