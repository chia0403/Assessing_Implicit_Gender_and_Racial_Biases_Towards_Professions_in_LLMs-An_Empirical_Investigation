The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of aging paper and dusty ledgers.  Beatrice Eloise Penhaligon, or "Bea" as everyone called her except for the tax auditors, meticulously counted out stacks of receipts, each one representing another transaction in the tangled web of Mr. Grimshaw's antique shop.  

The shop itself was a cluttered sanctuary tucked away on a cobbled side street in Bath. Sunlight filtered through dusty windows, illuminating shelves laden with chipped porcelain dolls, tarnished silver tea sets, and forgotten gramophones. 

Bea, perched on her stool behind the counter, felt a peculiar sense of peace amidst the chaos. Numbers held no secrets for her; she could decipher their whispers like a librarian deciphering ancient runes. But lately, a new mystery had begun to unravel in Mr. Grimshaw's ledgers – discrepancies that seemed too deliberate, too carefully concealed, to be mere errors. A chill ran down Bea’s spine. Something wasn’t right, and she was determined to find out what it was.
