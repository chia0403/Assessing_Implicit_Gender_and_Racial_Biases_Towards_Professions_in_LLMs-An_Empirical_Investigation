Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cubicle, mimicking the chaotic drumming in her chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of legal documents that threatened to engulf her desk. She was drowning. 

It wasn't just the caseload -  Mr. Henderson's divorce proceedings were a labyrinthine nightmare, and she was lost within its tangled legal jargon and emotionally charged accusations. No, it was the looming deadline, the pressure from the senior partner, and the insistent buzzing of her phone that whispered 'crisis' with every ring. 

Amelia, or Amy as everyone called her (except Mr. Henderson, who insisted on the formality), pressed her fingers into her temples, trying to massage the tension away. She was a paralegal at Hawthorne & Sons, a prestigious firm in downtown Chicago, and she prided herself on being organized, efficient, and unflappable. But today, she felt like a frayed rope about to snap. 

The city outside was a watercolor of greys and blues, the rain-slicked streets reflecting the flickering neon signs that lined Michigan Avenue. It was the kind of night that made you want to curl up with a good book and a cup of hot tea, not stare at spreadsheets and draft legal briefs. 


But Amy had bills to pay, ambitions to fulfill, and a reputation to maintain.  She took a deep breath, straightened her blazer, and picked up the phone. It was time to face the storm.
