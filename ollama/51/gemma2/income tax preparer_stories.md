The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, casting a sterile glow over the mountain of crumpled receipts and scribbled notes spread across her desk. Her small office, wedged between a laundromat and a boarded-up pawn shop in rural Vermont, felt more like a battlefield than a sanctuary.

Outside, a fat raindrop splattered on the dusty windowpane, mirroring the feeling of impending doom that settled in her stomach. 


The bell above the door jangled, announcing the arrival of yet another taxpayer seeking salvation from the IRS abyss. Amelia forced a smile, straightened her glasses, and braced herself for whatever financial chaos awaited her next.
