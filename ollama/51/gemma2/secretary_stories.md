The air in Ms. Henrietta Featherbottom's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the chaos on her desk: overflowing in-trays, a crumpled ball of paper labeled "Emergency Meeting - DO NOT OPEN," and a half-eaten tuna sandwich resting precariously close to a stack of confidential files. 

Henrietta Featherbottom, ever the picture of composed efficiency despite the surrounding pandemonium, meticulously sharpened her pencils.  Her spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose, magnifying the worry lines etched between her brows. It was Tuesday, which meant Mr. Worthington, her notoriously demanding boss, would be back from his "business trip" (which always seemed to involve a different brand of scotch and a string of increasingly elaborate excuses). 

And this time, something felt different.  A gnawing sense of foreboding settled in Henrietta's stomach, tightening like an ill-fitting corset. It wasn't just the mess on her desk â€“ it was the silence. The usual cacophony of ringing phones, frantic footfalls, and Mr. Worthington's booming voice were absent, replaced by a hushed stillness that felt almost sinister.  


Henrietta sighed, pushing back the curtain of hair from her face. It was time to get to work. But as she reached for the topmost file, a stray thought flitted through her mind: what if Mr. Worthington wasn't coming back at all?
