The humid Virginia air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he wrestled with the unruly tangle of ivy choking Mrs. Hathaway’s prize-winning hydrangeas. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes, but Elias didn't flinch. He was used to the heat, to the constant battle against Mother Nature’s relentless reclaiming. His hands, calloused and strong from years of wielding shears and spades, moved with practiced precision, carefully severing the invasive vines without harming the delicate blooms beneath. 

Elias Thorne Landscaping wasn't exactly a booming enterprise – most clients in this sleepy town preferred to let their gardens run wild – but Elias took pride in his work. Each meticulously trimmed hedge, each perfectly manicured lawn, was a testament to his dedication and quiet artistry.  This sprawling, Victorian-era home with its rambling gardens, however, presented a unique challenge. It wasn't just the overgrown flora; there was an air of melancholy hanging heavy over the place, as if the very walls whispered forgotten secrets.
