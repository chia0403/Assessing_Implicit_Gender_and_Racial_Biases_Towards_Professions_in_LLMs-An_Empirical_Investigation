The air in Eloise Evangeline Beaumontâ€™s workshop was thick with the scent of lavender sachets and freshly cut wool. Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylight, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays. Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh buzzed with the clatter of carriages and hawkers' calls, but inside the shop, a tranquil stillness reigned. 

Eloise sat hunched over her workbench, her nimble fingers expertly guiding a needle through fine silk. She was embroidering a wedding gown, its creamy fabric draped around a wooden form like a ghost bride. Each stitch was precise, delicate, imbued with the same care and attention Eloise poured into every garment she crafted. The shop, inherited from her grandmother, was more than just a business; it was a sanctuary, a legacy woven into the fabric of her being.
