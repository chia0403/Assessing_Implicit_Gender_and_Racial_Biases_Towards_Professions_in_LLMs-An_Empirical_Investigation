The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew Thistlewick's tweed jacket, already damp with sweat despite the brisk autumn air. A bead of moisture trickled down his temple and disappeared into his neatly trimmed beard. He adjusted the brim of his Panama hat, wishing for the shade of a passing cloud. 

Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick was, by all accounts, a proper tour guide. His knowledge of Edinburgh's history was encyclopedic, his pronunciation impeccable, and his enthusiasm, if occasionally strained in this heat, infectious. He stood before a gaggle of tourists, their faces a mixture of excitement and sunburn, at the foot of Arthur's Seat. 

"Now," he announced, voice booming with practiced cheer, "this majestic hilltop... is where..." But his words were swallowed by a sudden gust of wind that ripped through the assembled group, sending tour brochures scattering like autumn leaves. 


The setting: Edinburgh, Scotland. A crisp autumn day, the air alive with the scent of fallen leaves and the distant murmur of bagpipes. Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano rising majestically above the city, looms in the background, its peak bathed in warm sunlight. Below, tourists jostle on cobbled streets, their colourful attire a vibrant counterpoint to the ancient stone buildings that line them.
