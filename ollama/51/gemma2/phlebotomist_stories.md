The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile waiting room. A faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, mingled with the nervous sweat of patients bracing themselves for needles. Outside, the Miami sun blazed, an unwelcome reminder of the heat trapped within these four walls. Amelia sighed, smoothing down her starched white uniform and adjusting the stethoscope dangling around her neck.  It wasn't the ideal workday â€“ another sweltering afternoon extracting precious drops of blood from reluctant patients. 


But beneath the mundane routine, a current of anticipation thrummed within her. Today was different. Today, she was drawing blood for Dr. Eleanor Finch, a renowned hematologist who'd recently moved to Miami from Chicago. Dr. Finch's reputation preceded her: brilliant, meticulous, with a knack for solving even the most perplexing blood disorders. For Amelia, who dreamed of pursuing a career in research, this was a chance to learn from the best, to witness firsthand the magic that unfolded within those vials of life-giving fluid.
