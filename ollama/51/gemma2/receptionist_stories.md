The insistent clack-clack of Brenda Penelope Thistlewick's heels echoed through the sterile hallways of Thornhill & Sons Incorporated.  The fluorescent lights hummed above her head, casting an anemic glow on the beige carpet that seemed perpetually stained with coffee rings and existential dread. It was another Tuesday in Accounting purgatory - a place where spreadsheets were gospel, deadlines were gods, and Brenda, as the sole receptionist, was the unfortunate gatekeeper to both.

Brenda sighed, adjusting the tight bun her mother insisted upon for "professionalism." Her fingers tapped impatiently on the worn countertop, waiting for the next client to blunder into the cavernous reception area. It wasn't that she disliked her job – it paid the bills, allowed her access to endless episodes of “Murder, She Wrote,” and provided a front-row seat to the daily drama of middle management. But today, a persistent itch beneath her skin whispered of something more, something beyond the beige walls and the recycled air. 


It was a Tuesday, after all, and Tuesdays always felt... different.
