The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, clinging to Eleanor Josephine "Ellie" Bellweather like a second skin as she navigated the bustling marketplace in Marrakech. The sun beat down on the terracotta rooftops, turning the narrow streets into shimmering mirages. Ellie clutched her worn guitar case closer to her chest, its familiar weight a comfort amidst the chaos. 

She hadn't come to Morocco for fame or fortune.  This wasn't about chasing the next big gig or signing a record deal. This was about searching for something lost â€“ a melody, a feeling, an inspiration that had faded like a watercolour left in the rain. She hoped that somewhere in the labyrinthine alleys of Marrakech, amidst the vibrant colours and intoxicating sounds, she would find it again. 


Ellie's fingers unconsciously traced the carved initials on her guitar case: EJB. A reminder of who she was, even when the music seemed to have forgotten her.
