The humid air hung thick in "Mama Gina's," clinging to Elara Rose Thorne like a second skin as she navigated the labyrinthine tables, balancing a precariously stacked tray of steaming plates. The scent of garlic, oregano, and simmering tomato sauce was a familiar perfume, one that had become as ingrained in her as her own heartbeat.  Mama Gina's, a bustling Italian trattoria nestled on the corner of Elm and Maple in a faded, working-class neighborhood, was more than just a restaurant; it was a tapestry woven from generations of family recipes, boisterous laughter, and shared stories. It was Elara's world, a world she knew like the back of her hand. 


Tonight, though, something felt different. The usual warmth seemed dulled, replaced by a nervous energy that buzzed through the air like an untethered hummingbird. Even Mama Gina, usually the embodiment of fiery cheer, wore a crease between her brows as she barked orders to the kitchen staff. A sense of foreboding settled in Elara's chest, tightening with each clatter of dishes and murmured conversation.
