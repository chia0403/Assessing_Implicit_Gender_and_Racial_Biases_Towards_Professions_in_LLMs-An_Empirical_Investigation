Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Leo Augustine's workshop, each drop a drumbeat in the symphony of the storm.  A sickly yellow light from the single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling cast long shadows across the cluttered space. Tools lay scattered on every surface - wrenches, pipes, plungers, and countless other contraptions that whispered tales of countless battles with leaky faucets, stubborn clogs, and vengeful toilets. Leo himself hunched over a workbench, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously disassembled a particularly stubborn faucet valve.  His calloused hands moved with the practiced grace of a surgeon, each twist and turn precise and controlled. 

Leo wasn't just any plumber; he was the go-to guy for all things water-related in the sprawling coastal town of Saltwind. He could coax life back into even the most ancient pipes, diagnose a leak before it caused a deluge, and talk to toilets like they were old friends. 


The insistent ringing of his phone shattered the rhythmic patter of the rain. Leo snatched it up, the answering machine's cheerful jingle jarring in the tense atmosphere. "Leo Augustine Plumbing," he grumbled into the receiver, wiping grease from his forehead with a stained rag. "Leave your message."

But instead of a recorded plea for help, a frantic voice crackled through the speaker. "Leo, it's Mrs. Peabody! The whole house is flooding! Please hurry!"
