The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood. It clung to his apron, his boots, even the hairs at the back of his neck.  He ran a calloused thumb over the slick blade of his cleaver, admiring its sharp edge honed to a deadly gleam. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes of "Blackwood's Butchery," casting long shadows across the sawdust-covered floor and illuminating the rows of neatly displayed carcasses: glistening lamb, ruby-red hams, plump chickens hung like jeweled pendulums.

Elias Blackwood, his name whispered with both reverence and fear by the townsfolk, was more than just a butcher. He was a craftsman, an artist who sculpted life from death, transforming raw flesh into edible masterpieces. His shop, nestled on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, a town shrouded in perpetual twilight by the looming presence of the Whisperwood forest, was as much a sanctuary as it was a place of commerce.  Within its wooden walls, Elias found solace, a rhythm to his days dictated by the hum of cleavers and the quiet gurgling of the blood drain.


But today, something felt different. The usual comforting thrum of the shop vibrated with an unsettling tension. A chill snaked through the air, heavier than the smell of blood and brine. Elias frowned, a premonition settling in his gut like a leaden stone. Today, Hollow Creek wouldn't be its usual quiet self. Something was coming.
