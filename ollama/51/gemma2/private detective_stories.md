The rain hammered against Amelia 'Amy' Brighton’s office window like a chorus of angry fists. The grimy pane offered a blurry view of the neon-streaked streets of Seattle, each sign flickering like a dying firefly in the perpetual twilight. Amy, her nametag crookedly pinned to the threadbare cardigan she wore over her too-thin blouse, chewed on the end of a pen and scowled at the case file sprawled across her desk. 

It was the kind of case that made her question why she ever chose this line of work – missing persons, petty theft, insurance fraud. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but it paid the bills. This one, however, felt different. A young woman, Eliza Thorne, vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a trail of whispers about a hidden society operating in the city's underbelly.

The air in Amy's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and regret. She took another bite of her pen, then tossed it into a overflowing ashtray beside her battered phone.  It was time to get started, even if all she had to go on was a name, a note, and a gnawing feeling that something far more sinister was at play than anyone knew.
