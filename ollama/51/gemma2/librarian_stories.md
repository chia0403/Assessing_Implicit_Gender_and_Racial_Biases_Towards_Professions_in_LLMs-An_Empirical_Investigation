The scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne had come to associate with peace. She ran a finger along the spine of a first edition Dickens, its worn cover whispering tales of forgotten London streets and eccentric characters.  Sunlight slanted through the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. The late afternoon hummed with the quiet rustle of pages turning and the soft clinking of teacups from the nearby cafe. 

Amelia, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, surveyed the scene with contentment. For twenty years, she had been the guardian of this haven of knowledge, a sanctuary where stories lived and breathed on worn shelves and whispered from forgotten corners. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along her spine, a sense that the familiar rhythm of Oakhaven was about to be disrupted. 


The bell above the door chimed softly, announcing a new arrival.  Amelia turned, her gaze settling on a figure shrouded in a long, dark coat, their face obscured by the shadows cast by the brim of a wide hat. The newcomer hesitated at the threshold, their eyes scanning the library before finally locking onto Amelia's. A chill snaked down her spine â€“ this wasn't just another patron seeking solace in the pages of a book. This was something... else.
