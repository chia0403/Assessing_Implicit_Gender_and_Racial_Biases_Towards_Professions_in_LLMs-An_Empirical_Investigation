The scent of crayons and stale goldfish crackers hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Ms. Eloise Pettigrew like a second skin. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Room 207, illuminating dancing motes and the rows of brightly colored desks.

Eloise imagined her stern voice echoing through the classroom as she read out the names of the "delinquent borrowers."
