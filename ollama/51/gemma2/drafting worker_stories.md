The air hung thick with the smell of dust and graphite. Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright squinted at the blueprints spread across her workbench, their lines blurring under the flickering fluorescent lights. Her brow furrowed as she traced the intricate network of pipes with her calloused finger. This wasn't just any ordinary HVAC system; this was for the Zephyr Tower, a gleaming glass monstrosity that promised to pierce the smog-choked sky and become the symbol of progress in their industrial city, New Zenith. 

Ellie, despite being one of the youngest draftspeople at the firm, had been entrusted with the project's complex ventilation plan. It was her chance to prove herself, to rise above the monotony of copying blueprints for mundane buildings and contribute to something truly ambitious.  But as she delved deeper into the schematics, a nagging unease began to crawl up her spine. The designs felt off, somehow, like a puzzle missing a crucial piece. 


The workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the sprawling factory complex, was dimly lit and cluttered with tools and half-finished projects. Outside, the constant roar of machinery punctuated by the shrill whistles of steam engines painted a chaotic symphony of industrial life. Through the grime-coated windows, Ellie could glimpse the relentless churn of New Zenith â€“ a city consumed by its own ambition, where progress marched on at breakneck speed, often leaving human stories in its dust.
