The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and lavender as Seraphina Celeste adjusted the steaming hot towel on Mrs. Delacroix's face. Her nimble fingers worked deftly, applying a gentle pressure to Mrs. Delacroix's temples, easing away the tension etched into her forehead lines from years spent navigating the high-stakes world of Parisian haute couture. 

Seraphina’s salon, “Lueur,” nestled in a quiet cobblestone street tucked away from the bustling Champs-Élysées, was a haven for those seeking solace and rejuvenation.  The worn velvet chairs, antique mirrors reflecting the soft glow of flickering candles, and the soothing melodies of Debussy playing softly on the gramophone created an atmosphere of tranquil escape from the city’s relentless pace. 


Outside, the Parisian sun cast long shadows across the quaint street, painting the terracotta-hued buildings in hues of gold and crimson. A symphony of car horns and distant laughter drifted through the open windows, a reminder of the vibrant life pulsing just beyond Lueur's peaceful walls.
