The rhythmic clang of pots against stainless steel was a lullaby to Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont. The steam rising from the simmering stock swirled around her like a comforting fog, carrying with it the scent of thyme and rosemary. Her small restaurant, nestled on a cobblestone street in Prague's Old Town, buzzed with life despite the early hour. Servers were flitting about, polishing silverware and arranging fresh flowers, while Ellie herself moved with a practiced grace, stirring sauces and inspecting ingredients.  

She was a whirlwind of energy, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, flour dusting her cheeks like a blush. Her worn apron, emblazoned with the restaurant's name, "U Zlatého Vařeče" (The Golden Kettle), held countless memories – splashes of tomato sauce, splatters of oil, and the occasional smudge of spilled chocolate ganache. Ellie cherished every stain; they were badges of honor, testaments to her passion for food and her dedication to bringing joy to her customers.  

But today felt different. A knot of tension tightened in Ellie's chest, a feeling she couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the anonymous note slipped under her door yesterday, threatening to expose a secret from her past, or maybe it was the unsettlingly empty tables, usually brimming with eager diners by this time. Whatever it was, it cast a shadow over the warm familiarity of her kitchen.
