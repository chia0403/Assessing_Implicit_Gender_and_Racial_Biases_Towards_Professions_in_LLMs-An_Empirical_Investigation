The early morning mist clung to Elara Willowbrook’s boots as she trudged through the overgrown pathways of Whispering Pines Sanctuary. A symphony of birdsong – cardinals, robins, even a distant owl – filled the air, punctuated by the occasional mournful bleat of a goat and the excited chatter of rescued parrots.  Elara inhaled deeply, savoring the earthy scent of damp soil and pine needles, a welcome change from the city smog that clung to her memories. 

She was just finishing up a bucketful of fresh oats for the miniature horses when a frantic squawk pierced through the peaceful morning. It came from the aviary, where the rescued parrots were housed in their brightly painted cages. Elara’s heart leapt into her throat. This wasn't the usual playful screeching – this was a sound of pure terror.  


Whispering Pines Sanctuary, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, had been Elara's haven for five years. It wasn't just a job; it was her life's purpose – to give abandoned and injured animals a second chance at happiness. Today, however, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling tension, as if danger lurked just beyond the sun-dappled foliage.  Elara knew she had to act fast.
