The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Rosalind Finch's office, mingling with the faint, lingering aroma of peppermint toothpaste. Sunlight streamed through the large window overlooking Maple Street, casting warm squares across the polished wooden floor. Outside, the bustling rhythm of midday traffic hummed faintly, a distant counterpoint to the quiet whirring of the drill nestled in its metal cradle beside Amelia. 

She glanced at the clock: 12:37 p.m. Lunch break was five minutes away, and she desperately needed a caffeine fix. Her day had been an unending symphony of aching molars, chipped veneers, and one particularly anxious patient who swore he could feel his tooth 'dancing' under her drill.  

Amelia sighed, pushing back the stray curl that always seemed to escape her meticulously braided bun. This wasn’t what she had envisioned when she’d embarked on her dental journey, but then again, life rarely went according to plan.
