The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sterile tang of disinfectant that always seemed to permeate the walls of Sunhaven Rehabilitation Center.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont, her brown hair pulled back into a tight bun, adjusted the strap of her bright yellow tote bag and surveyed the room. It was Monday morning, which meant the usual flurry of patients, shuffling through the doors with varying degrees of hope and apprehension. 

Ellie took a deep breath, the lavender doing little to quell the familiar knot of anxiety in her stomach. This wasn't just another day on the job. Today was Amelia's assessment. Amelia, the six-year-old girl who had suffered severe burns in a house fire, whose future hung precariously in the balance.  Ellie glanced at the worn, yellowed photo taped to her whiteboard – a smiling Amelia, carefree and bright, wielding a paintbrush like a conductor leading an orchestra of colors. It was a stark contrast to the pale, fragile girl she was about to meet. 


Sunhaven, nestled on the outskirts of Boston, was a sprawling building with faded brickwork and echoing corridors. Inside, it pulsed with life – the clatter of wheelchairs, the soft murmurs of therapy sessions, the occasional burst of laughter that cut through the quiet hum of anticipation. It was a place where hope battled despair, where broken bodies and spirits were meticulously pieced back together.  Ellie's role, as always, was to be a beacon in that struggle, guiding patients towards healing, one small step at a time.
