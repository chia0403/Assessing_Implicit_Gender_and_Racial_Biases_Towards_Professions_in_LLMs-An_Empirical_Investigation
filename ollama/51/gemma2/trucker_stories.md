The diesel engine hummed like a contented beast under the hood of Clara Belle "CB" Hawthorne's eighteen-wheeler, her trusted rig nicknamed "Betsy." The asphalt ribbon stretched before her, glinting like molten silver under the desert sun. CB squinted at the endless horizon, her weathered face a roadmap of countless miles and sleepless nights.  Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like phantoms against the backdrop of arid plains that blurred into hazy blue mountains. She was three days out of El Paso, heading for Portland, hauling a load of Oregon cherries destined to be transformed into delectable pies across America. The air crackled with the static hum of CB's radio, but all she heard was dead air. She sighed, the desert wind whistling through her open window like a mournful lullaby. It was moments like these, miles from civilization and swallowed by silence, that CB felt most alive.
