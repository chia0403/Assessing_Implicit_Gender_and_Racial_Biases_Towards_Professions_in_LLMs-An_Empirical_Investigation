The aroma of freshly brewed chai hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of dusty guidebooks and exotic spices. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains of Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's office, casting warm squares on the worn Persian rug beneath her feet. Outside, London bustled with its usual chaotic energy, but inside the tiny travel agency tucked away on a cobbled side street, time seemed to slow.

Amelia, perched on her antique velvet chaise longue, idly flipped through a glossy brochure featuring the turquoise waters of Bora Bora. Her fingers traced the outline of a luxurious overwater bungalow, her mind already drifting to the gentle lapping of waves against its wooden platform. The phone jangled, breaking the tranquil reverie. Amelia reached for it with a sigh, her smile already fading as she recognized the caller ID. It was Mrs. Grimshaw, notorious for demanding last-minute changes and impossible itineraries.

"Travel Dreams," Amelia announced into the receiver, bracing herself for another round of high-maintenance travel woes. 


The setting is a small, charming, slightly dusty travel agency in London, England. The time is the late afternoon, just as the city begins to stir after its workday lull.
