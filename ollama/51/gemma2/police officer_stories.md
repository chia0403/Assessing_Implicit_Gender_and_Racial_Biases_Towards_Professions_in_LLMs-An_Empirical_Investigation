The neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign cast an unsettling green tinge across Detective Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau’s face as she surveyed the crime scene. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of “Lucky’s Diner,” blurring the already indistinct shapes of parked cars and shadowy figures huddled under awnings. The aroma of burnt coffee and fried food hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet counterpoint to the metallic tang of blood that permeated the diner’s interior. 

Izzy, a woman hardened by years on the force in this sprawling, rain-soaked city, pulled her trench coat tighter around her. She could see the body through the grime-streaked window: a man sprawled on his back beside a shattered milkshake glass, crimson staining his white shirt like a gruesome abstract painting. This wasn’t her usual beat – she dealt with the high-end theft and political scandals that kept the city's elite comfortable. But something about this diner, tucked away in the forgotten corner of town, felt different, pulled at a thread deep within her.  

“Another body for the books,” sighed Sergeant Miller, his voice gruff beneath the din of the storm. He stood beside Izzy, his face etched with exhaustion. “Let’s hope this one isn't another dead-end like the last five.”
