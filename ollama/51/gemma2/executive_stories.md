The scent of expensive cologne mingled with the metallic tang of anxiety in Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's nostrils. Her tailored suit felt tight, constricting like the glass walls of the conference room that offered a panoramic view of the city, but only served to highlight her claustrophobia.  She surveyed the faces around the table: hardened board members, their expressions as impassive as marble statues; potential investors with predatory eyes, circling like vultures waiting for the carcass of a failing venture. 

Amy, CEO of Blackwood Biotech, had poured every ounce of herself into this company, her father's legacy, and now its future hung precariously in the balance. A new competitor, a ruthless biotech giant named Seraph Industries, was making waves with groundbreaking research, threatening to snatch away their funding and steal their crown. 

The city lights twinkled below, an endless ocean of possibility, but for Amy right now, they felt more like warning beacons, flickering reminders that the stakes were higher than ever before. This meeting wasn't just about numbers and projections; it was about survival.
