Rain lashed against the greasy windows of The Rusty Spork, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale beer, and desperation. Eliza Marie Davenport, her blonde ponytail escaping its elastic, balanced a tray laden with lukewarm coffee and wilted fries, navigating the sticky linoleum floor with practiced ease. She was used to this kind of night, the kind where the only customers were weary truckers and insomniacs seeking refuge from the storm. 

Eliza sighed, glancing at the clock above the grimy counter.  2:17 am. Just a few more hours until she could escape this greasy spoon purgatory and crawl into her own bed.
