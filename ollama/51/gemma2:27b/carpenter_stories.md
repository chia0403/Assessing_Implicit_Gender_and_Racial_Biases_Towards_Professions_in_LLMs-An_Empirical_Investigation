The pungent smell of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Blackwood's threadbare apron like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty panes in the shop window, painted stripes across his workbench, illuminating the half-finished rocking horse taking shape beneath his calloused hands. 

Elias' workshop was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the heart of Port Haven, a bustling port town where salt spray mingled with the scent of baking bread and the cries of gulls echoed through narrow alleys. It wasn't much to look at - weathered wood beams held up a sagging roof, tools hung haphazardly from hooks, and piles of lumber crowded the corners. But for Elias, it was a sanctuary, a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of hammer against wood, transforming rough planks into objects of beauty and utility.
