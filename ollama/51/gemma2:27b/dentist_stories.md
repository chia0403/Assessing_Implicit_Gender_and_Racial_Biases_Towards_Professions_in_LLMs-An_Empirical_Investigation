The midday sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves.  Heat haze danced above the cracked sidewalk, distorting the image of Dr. Theodore Alistair Finch's quaint dental practice – "Finch Family Dentistry" emblazoned in cheerful blue lettering above the door. Inside, however, the air was refreshingly cool. The whirring of the overhead fan mixed with the gentle tinkling of a wind chime, creating a soothing ambiance that did little to calm Theo’s nerves. He nervously tapped his foot against the worn linoleum floor, his reflection staring back at him from the stainless steel instruments neatly laid out on the tray beside him. Today was different. Today wasn't just any routine checkup. Today, he was facing his greatest fear - treating Mrs. Gwendolyn Hawthorne, the notorious "Iron Jaw" of Elm Street, known for her bone-crushing grip and withering critiques of anyone who dared to touch her pearly whites.
