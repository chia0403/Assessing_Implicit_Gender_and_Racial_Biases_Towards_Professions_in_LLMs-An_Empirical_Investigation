Rain lashed against the windows of the Airbus A320, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Rose Hawthorne. She stared out at the grey canvas, her reflection superimposed on the swirling clouds. Normally, Amelia loved the view from 35,000 feet – the sense of perspective, the shrinking world below. Today, however, she felt claustrophobic, trapped not just by the plane but by the weight of her recent breakup.

The announcement chime sounded, jolting her back to reality. "Ladies and gentlemen," Captain Nguyen's voice boomed through the cabin, "we are currently experiencing some turbulence due to a passing weather system. Please remain seated with your seatbelts fastened." Amelia took a deep breath, plastering on her professional smile as she moved down the aisle, checking on passengers and smoothing ruffled feathers. Today, more than ever, she needed this job – the routine, the interactions, the illusion of control it provided.

But beneath the surface, Amelia felt adrift.  The familiar hum of the engines now sounded like a lonely lament, echoing her own unspoken fears. As she reached the back galley, a flicker of movement in the reflection caught her eye. A lone figure sat slumped in the last row, shrouded in shadow. Curiosity piqued, Amelia steered towards him, ready to offer comfort or perhaps just a distraction from her own swirling anxieties.
