The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the alphabet chart tacked to the wall. Emilia Cartwright sighed, running a hand through her perpetually frizzy auburn hair. Crayon scribbles adorned every surface â€“ desks, chairs, even the pristine white easel in the corner. Kindergarten was a delightful whirlwind of energy and chaos, but today, Emilia felt the weight of it all pressing down on her.

The classroom buzzed with pre-lunch excitement, children chattering amongst themselves while building precarious towers from brightly colored blocks. Outside, the crisp autumn air whispered through the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground. It was a beautiful day, but Emilia couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in her stomach like a lead weight.

Something wasn't right.
