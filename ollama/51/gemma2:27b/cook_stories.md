The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and roasting garlic, a comforting embrace in the chill of pre-dawn. Elara Brightsmith, her cheeks flushed from the oven's heat, deftly flipped a pan of saffron potatoes, their edges crisping to perfection. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven were still shrouded in mist, the only sound the distant clang of a blacksmith hammering away at his forge.

Elara hummed softly as she worked, her mind already crafting the day's menu: hearty venison stew for the lumberjacks returning from the forest, delicate blackberry tarts for the gossiping ladies of the village square, and perhaps a surprise dish to delight Old Man Thistlewick, whose gruff exterior hid a surprisingly sweet tooth. 

Today was market day in Oakhaven, a bustling affair that brought traders and travelers from miles around. Elara's stall, nestled beneath the shade of a gnarled oak tree, would be a magnet for hungry souls, drawn by the aroma of her simmering pots and the promise of a hearty meal made with love.  

But as she stirred a pot of creamy mushroom soup, a tremor ran through the cobblestones, rattling her copper pans. The air grew heavy with an unfamiliar tension, punctuated by the panicked cries of startled birds. Elara's humming ceased, replaced by a knot of unease in her stomach. Something was wrong. Very wrong.
