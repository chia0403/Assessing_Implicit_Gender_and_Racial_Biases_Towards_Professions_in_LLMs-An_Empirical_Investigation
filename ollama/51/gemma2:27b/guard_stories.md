The wind whipped across the obsidian plains, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks with icy sand. He tightened his grip on the spear, its rough haft biting into his calloused palm. The setting sun cast long shadows from the jagged obsidian formations that jutted out of the unforgiving landscape like broken teeth. In the distance, the shimmering dome of Obsidian City pulsed with a faint purple light, a beacon of civilization in this desolate expanse.

Elias wasn't fond of the wind. It carried memories - whispers of laughter and warm embraces, scents of roasted meat and spiced wine. Memories of a life he'd left behind, traded for the monotonous solitude of guarding the city gates.  His gaze swept across the barren landscape once more, searching for any sign of movement.  He knew his duty: protect Obsidian City from whatever horrors lurked beyond its walls. But tonight, the silence felt heavier than usual, punctuated only by the mournful howl of the wind. Something felt...wrong.
