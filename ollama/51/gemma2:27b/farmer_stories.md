The sun, still pale and hesitant in the early morning sky, cast long shadows across Silas Blackwood's fields. Dew clung to the stalks of barley, glistening like scattered diamonds under the weak light. A rooster crowed somewhere off in the distance, its call echoing through the crisp air and jolting Silas awake. He stretched his weary limbs, the ache in his joints a familiar companion after a long day of tending the land. His weathered hands, rough as bark from years of toil, instinctively reached for his worn straw hat perched on the kitchen table.

Silas stepped out onto the porch, the cool air stinging his face and bringing with it the scent of damp earth and hay. He surveyed his domain: a patchwork quilt of fields stretching towards the horizon, bordered by thickets of ancient oaks and a meandering stream that whispered secrets to the willow trees clinging to its banks. This land was in Silas's blood, passed down through generations of Blackwoods who had carved a living from its stubborn soil. Today, however, a sense of unease settled upon him like a shroud. The harvest had been meager, the rains late and unpredictable, and whispers of hardship were spreading through the nearby village.
