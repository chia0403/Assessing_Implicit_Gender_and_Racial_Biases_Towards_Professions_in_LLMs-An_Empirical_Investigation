Rain lashed against the windowpane, mimicking the relentless pounding in Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's head. The fluorescent lights of her tiny office hummed incessantly, adding to the growing cacophony. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatened to topple over on her desk, each form a reminder of the looming tax deadline. April 15th was just two weeks away, and Bea's anxiety levels were reaching DEFCON 1.

Her office, nestled in a nondescript strip mall between a laundromat and a discount liquor store, wasn't exactly conducive to serenity. The peeling linoleum floor and faded floral wallpaper screamed "temporary," a sentiment Bea desperately clung to as she contemplated the mountain of paperwork before her.  

But Bea wasn't one to back down from a challenge. For fifteen years, she had navigated the labyrinthine world of tax codes, helping ordinary people decipher their financial destinies. She prided herself on her meticulousness, her ability to find deductions hidden in plain sight, and her unwavering empathy for clients overwhelmed by the complexities of the system.  

This year, however, felt different. A strange sense of foreboding lingered in the air, fueled by the recent news of a massive data breach at the IRS. Rumors swirled about identity theft running rampant, leaving Bea feeling like she was walking on thin ice. Little did she know that this tax season would be unlike any other, catapulting her into a world of intrigue and danger far beyond the realm of balance sheets and deductions.
