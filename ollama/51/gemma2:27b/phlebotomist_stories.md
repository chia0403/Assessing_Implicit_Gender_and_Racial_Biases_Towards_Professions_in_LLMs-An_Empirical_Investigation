The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic glow across the worn linoleum floor of Mercy General's lab. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her auburn braids escaping their usual neat bun, tapped a gloved finger against the vein map on the screen. A complex web of blue lines snaked across the image – Mrs. Henderson’s arm – each representing a potential access point. Amelia sighed. This was her third attempt today, and every vein seemed to have vanished into thin air.

Amelia wasn't one to give up easily. She prided herself on her gentle touch, her ability to soothe even the most anxious patients. But Mrs. Henderson, with her furrowed brow and clenched fists, presented a challenge Amelia hadn’t encountered before. The woman's whispered prayers only intensified the pressure in the room, making Amelia feel like she was performing surgery under a microscope, every breath amplified by the sterile silence.
