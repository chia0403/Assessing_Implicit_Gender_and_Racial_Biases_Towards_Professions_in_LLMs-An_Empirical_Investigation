Smoke choked the air, acrid and thick, stinging Elias Vance's eyes even through the grime-streaked visor of his helmet. The roar of the blaze was deafening, a hungry beast devouring the three-story Victorian mansion with terrifying gusto. Flames danced from broken windows, licking at the night sky like tongues of orange fury. Elias, his muscles burning with exertion, wrestled the heavy hose further into the inferno, the searing heat a palpable force against his fireproof gear. He could hear the panicked cries of trapped civilians echoing through the inferno, fueling his determination. This was what he lived for â€“ to be the shield between chaos and salvation, a beacon of hope in the darkest hour.  Tonight, however, something felt different. The heat was more intense, the flames wilder. Elias felt a prickle of unease crawling up his spine.

This wasn't just another house fire. This was something... else.
