Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless barrage that mirrored the turmoil in Amelia Blackwood's heart. Her fingers hovered over the keys of her antique typewriter, refusing to press down. The blank page before her mocked her inability to conjure words, the rhythmic tapping she usually relished replaced by an unnerving silence. 

The attic, her sanctuary and writing space for decades, felt suffocating tonight. Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight piercing through a crack in the boarded-up window, illuminating stacks of dog-eared manuscripts and overflowing bookshelves.  Each one held a story, a world Amelia had meticulously crafted. But tonight, her imagination lay dormant, choked by a grief so profound it threatened to swallow her whole. 

Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the windswept moors of Yorkshire, was due to her publisher next week. But how could she possibly write about ghosts and shadows when she felt haunted by her own? The recent loss of her beloved husband, Thomas, had left a gaping hole in her life, silencing the muse that had whispered stories into her ear for so long.
