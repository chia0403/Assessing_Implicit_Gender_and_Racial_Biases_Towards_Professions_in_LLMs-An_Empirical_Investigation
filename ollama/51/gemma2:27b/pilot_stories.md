The whine of the turbine engine echoed through Amelia "Ace" Cartwright's bones as she ran her gloved hands over the faded paintwork of her Cessna 172. The setting sun cast long shadows across the dusty runway of Dusty Gulch airstrip, painting the cracked asphalt in shades of orange and purple. Ace inhaled deeply, a mix of hot engine oil and dry desert air filling her lungs. This wasn't the glamorous life she'd dreamed of as a kid, poring over aviation magazines, but it was hers. 

Dusty Gulch, a forgotten speck on the map of Nevada, wasn't exactly bustling with activity. Most days, Ace was content to ferry supplies to isolated ranches or offer scenic tours over the majestic canyons and mesas that sculpted the landscape. But today was different. Today, she had an unusual passenger: a weathered, leather-faced man who introduced himself only as "Mac" and whose eyes held a glint of something hidden, something Ace couldn't quite decipher.

As Mac climbed into the cramped cockpit, his gaze swept over the control panel with an unsettling familiarity. He settled into the co-pilot seat, a worn duffel bag at his feet, and fixed Ace with a stare that sent shivers down her spine. "Take us east," he rasped, his voice as dry as the desert wind. "And make it quick."

Ace felt a knot tighten in her stomach. This wasn't your average cargo run. Something about Mac, something about the urgency in his voice, whispered of danger and secrets hidden beneath the vast Nevada sky.
