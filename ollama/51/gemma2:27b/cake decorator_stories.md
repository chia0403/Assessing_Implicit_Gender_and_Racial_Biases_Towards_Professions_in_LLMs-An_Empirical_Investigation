The scent of vanilla and almond hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elara Cartwright's apron and threading its way through her unruly curls. Her workshop, tucked away in a cobblestone alley behind bustling Market Street, was awash in the warm glow of afternoon sunlight filtering through the dusty windowpanes.

Her fingers, dusted with powdered sugar, itched to add the finishing touch â€“ a cascade of cascading sugar blossoms down one side, mimicking the bride's bouquet.
