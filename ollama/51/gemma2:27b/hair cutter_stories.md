The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something chemical, sharp and sweet, that Elara Beaumont couldn't quite place. It clung to her fingers, a phantom perfume reminding her of all the heads she'd sculpted that day. Outside, the neon glow of the "Open" sign flickered against the rain-slicked pavement, painting streaks of pink and green on the cobblestone street. 

Elara leaned against the worn oak counter, its surface scarred with years of scissor mishaps and accidental dye spills. Her reflection in the mirror behind her was blurred by the steam curling from the sink where a pair of clippers still rested. She wasn't sure what time it was anymore - time had become an elastic thing in this small, cluttered salon nestled in the heart of Oldtown, where the cobblestones whispered stories and the gas lamps cast flickering shadows on the crooked facades.

Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual hum of Elara's scissors seemed muted, her movements sluggish. A restlessness pulsed beneath her skin, a feeling that the familiar rhythm of snipping and styling wasn't enough anymore.  

A sudden clatter from the back room snapped her attention. It was Finnigan, her apprentice, forever tripping over his own feet and dropping things in a flurry of nervous apologies. Elara sighed, pushing herself away from the counter, ready to face whatever chaos he'd stumbled into this time. Little did she know, tonight's chaos wouldn't involve misplaced combs or broken bottles of hairspray; it would be something far more unexpected, something that would unravel the very fabric of her world and lead her on a journey beyond anything she could have imagined.
