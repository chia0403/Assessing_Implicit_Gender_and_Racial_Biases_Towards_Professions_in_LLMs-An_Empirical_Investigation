The air in "Le Petit Pain" hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and yeast. Outside, Paris shivered beneath a late-autumn drizzle, but inside the bakery, warmth emanated from the ovens like a comforting embrace. Elodie Dubois, her flour-dusted apron tied snugly around her waist, hummed a cheerful tune as she shaped delicate croissants. Her hands moved with practiced grace, years of experience transforming simple dough into golden crescents. Elodie loved this time of day – the quiet before the rush, when the only sounds were the gentle whirring of the mixer and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her rolling pin against the counter.

Elodie glanced at the clock, its hands inching closer to eight – the time when Monsieur Moreau, the notoriously picky owner of the café across the street, would arrive for his daily delivery.  Elodie took a deep breath and straightened her cap. Whatever Monsieur Moreau threw at her today, she was ready.
