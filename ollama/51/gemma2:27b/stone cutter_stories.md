The sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s back as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Sweat stung his eyes, but he dared not stop, not with Master Hemlock watching from beneath the awning of the workshop. The air hung heavy and thick with dust, swirling in miniature tornadoes kicked up by each swing of Elias' hammer. It was a symphony of clangs and scrapes, punctuated by the occasional hiss as Elias quenched his chisel in the nearby bucket of water.

Elias dreamt of carving something magnificent, something that would stand the test of time – not these dull, repetitive tombstones Hemlock insisted on churning out. He longed to carve intricate gargoyles, delicate angels, maybe even a soaring dragon poised atop the town’s crumbling cathedral. 

But for now, he was stuck with the monotonous task of etching another name onto cold, unyielding stone: "Beloved Wife and Mother, Seraphina Thorne." His mother. The irony wasn't lost on him. He was carving her final resting place, a monument to a life tragically cut short by the very same illness that now gnawed at his own lungs.
