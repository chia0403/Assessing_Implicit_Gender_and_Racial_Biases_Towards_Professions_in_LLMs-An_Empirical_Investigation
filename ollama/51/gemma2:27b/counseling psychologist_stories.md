The scent of pine needles and damp earth clung to Elara Sinclair as she trudged up the porch steps. Rain hammered on the tin roof above, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence of the cabin.  Nestled deep in the heart of the Redwood National Park, the weathered wooden structure felt more sanctuary than office. 

Elara, with her auburn braid snaking down her back and hazel eyes reflecting the stormy sky, paused at the threshold. This wasn't her usual sterile consulting room, filled with motivational posters and plush armchairs.  Here, surrounded by towering redwoods, their branches heavy with rain-soaked leaves, she hoped to create a different kind of space - one that fostered vulnerability and connection.

Her first client, Liam Hawthorne, was due any minute.  He'd been referred by a colleague, a young man struggling with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Elara took a deep breath, letting the calming scent of pine ground her. She hoped the serenity of this place would be a balm for his wounded soul.
