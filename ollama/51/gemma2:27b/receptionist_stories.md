The insistent chirping of a vintage rotary phone jolted Elara Beaumont from her daydream.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting elongated shadows across the worn Persian rug.  Elara sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear before picking up the receiver. 

"Grand Blackwood Hotel, Elara speaking," she said, forcing her voice into its usual cheerful lilt despite the weariness that clung to her like a second skin.

The Grand Blackwood was a relic of a bygone era, its faded grandeur whispering tales of lavish balls and whispered scandals. It stood on the edge of a bustling city, a lonely sentinel gazing out over cobblestone streets teeming with life.  But within its walls, time seemed to move at a slower pace, echoing with the ghosts of forgotten memories.

Elara loved the history that permeated the building's bones, but lately, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A chill hung in the air, heavier than the damp autumn fog rolling in from the sea. And the guestsâ€¦they seemed different these days.  Eyes shadowed with secrets, whispers exchanged behind cupped hands. 


What secret lurked beneath the Grand Blackwood's elegant facade? Elara wasn't sure, but she had a feeling she was about to find out.
