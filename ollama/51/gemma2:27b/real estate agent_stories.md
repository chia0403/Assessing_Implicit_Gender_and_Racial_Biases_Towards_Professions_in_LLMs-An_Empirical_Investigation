The air in Savannah hung heavy with humidity, thick enough to choke on. It clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's skin like a second shirt as she trudged up the overgrown path towards the dilapidated Victorian mansion. Spanish moss dripped from ancient oaks, casting eerie shadows across the cracked cobblestone driveway. The house loomed before her, a skeletal giant draped in peeling paint and shrouded in secrets.  Amelia tugged at the collar of her crisp white blouse, already regretting her decision to wear it on this sweltering July afternoon.

This wasn't the kind of listing Amelia usually handled. High-end condos downtown, charming cottages by the squares â€“ those were her bread and butter. But Mrs. Evangeline Beaumont had been insistent: "Amelia Rose," she'd croaked over the phone, her voice brittle with age, "Only you can do this. This house... it needs someone who understands." 

And so here Amelia was, facing down a crumbling monument to a bygone era, wondering what exactly Mrs. Beaumont meant and bracing herself for whatever secrets this house held.
