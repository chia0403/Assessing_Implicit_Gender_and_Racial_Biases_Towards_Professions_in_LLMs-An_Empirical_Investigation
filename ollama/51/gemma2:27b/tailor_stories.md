The scent of beeswax and lavender clung to Thaddeus Bartholomew Finch like a second skin, as familiar and comforting as his own worn tweed waistcoat. His shop, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of London's tailoring district, was a sanctuary from the clamorous city beyond. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating spools of silk thread in jewel tones and bolts of wool patterned with intricate paisleys. Thaddeus hummed a jaunty tune as he measured a length of crimson velvet, his nimble fingers working with practiced ease. The rhythmic click-clack of his shears against the cutting table was a lullaby that had lulled generations of Finch's to sleep.

But today, a disquiet lingered in the air, thick as the smoke curling from Thaddeus's pipe. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its crisp white envelope bearing the embossed seal of a noble house he hadn't heard from in years. It promised a commission unlike any other, one that whispered of secrets and danger, drawing Thaddeus into a world far removed from the tidy order of his shop.
