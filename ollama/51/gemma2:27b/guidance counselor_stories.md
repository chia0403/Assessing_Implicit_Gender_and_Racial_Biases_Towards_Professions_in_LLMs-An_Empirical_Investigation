Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Ms. Rosalind "Rose" Hawthorne's cramped office, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on stacks of college brochures and student files overflowing from every surface. Rose sighed, rubbing a weary hand over her forehead. This year felt heavier than most.

She was the sole guidance counselor at Blackwood High, a sprawling brick behemoth perched precariously on the edge of a dying industrial town. The air here always smelled faintly of rust and despair, a scent that had seeped into Rose's very bones after twenty years in this position. Today, however, the weight wasn't just the usual burden of guiding students through the labyrinthine college application process or untangling their personal dramas. 


No, today was different. Today, a new student was transferring in - one whose file had arrived with a chilling red stamp: "High Risk." Rose stared at the photograph clipped to the top sheet: a pale boy with haunted eyes and a shock of black hair that fell over his forehead like a curtain. His name was Elias Blackwood, and something about him sent a shiver down her spine.

Was it just the unsettling name mirroring their town, or was there something else lurking beneath the surface? Rose knew she had to be prepared. This Elias Blackwood might be more than just another troubled teenager. He might be the storm brewing outside her window, ready to break through and change everything.
