Rain lashed against the narrow windows of Edgar Bartholomew Finch's office, blurring the already dreary view of Market Street.  Edgar, a man whose physique resembled a slightly disheveled accountant doll come to life, hunched over his ledger, the faint scent of mildew and mothballs clinging to his tweed waistcoat. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fountain pen against the aged paper was the only sound that dared challenge the relentless drumming of the storm outside. 

He wasn't a man prone to excitement. Years spent meticulously balancing books for the various eccentrics and entrepreneurs of Grimsborough had cultivated in him a quiet, methodical nature. But tonight, something felt different. A tremor of anticipation, as subtle as the shift in wind direction, ruffled Edgar's usually placid demeanor. He paused, his sharp blue eyes scanning the ledger once more before reaching for a sealed envelope tucked away in a dusty corner of his desk. 

It was addressed simply: "To E.B. Finch, Bookkeeper Extraordinary."  The crisp, elegant script sent a shiver down Edgar's spine. This wasn't just another set of accounts to reconcile; this felt like the opening chapter of a story he never knew he was part of.
