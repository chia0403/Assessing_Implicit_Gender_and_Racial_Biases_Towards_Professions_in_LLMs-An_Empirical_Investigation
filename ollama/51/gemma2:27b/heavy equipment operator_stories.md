The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck as he wrestled the excavator arm into position. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes. He squinted through the glare reflecting off the dusty earth, focusing on the trench he was digging for the new water line. The air hung heavy and still, thick with the smell of diesel and hot metal. Silas wiped his brow with a grimy rag, sighing as he surveyed the uneven progress. This job was turning out to be more trouble than it was worth. 

The ground beneath him was riddled with buried rocks and stubborn tree roots, making every inch a laborious battle. He longed for the open expanse of the highway projects he'd been on before, where the earth yielded willingly under his machine's powerful teeth. Here, in this cramped suburban development, every movement felt constricted. 

Silas grumbled under his breath, tightening his grip on the controls. Just then, a shrill voice pierced through the monotonous drone of the engine. "Hey! You're digging too close to my azaleas!" A thin woman with tightly curled hair and a face pinched in perpetual disapproval glared at him from over her rosebush fence. Silas sighed again. This was going to be a long day.
