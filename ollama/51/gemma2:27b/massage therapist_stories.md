Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Serenity Springs," blurring the city lights into impressionistic streaks. Inside, the air hummed with the gentle scent of lavender and chamomile. Eloise Beaumont, her fingers expertly kneading away tension in a client's shoulders, paused momentarily to listen to the storm rage. 

It was nights like these that she felt most at peace, cocooned in the warm embrace of her massage therapy room. The rhythmic tapping of rain against glass, the soft murmur of Tibetan singing bowls playing from a hidden speaker, and the sigh of relief escaping her client's lips all harmonized into a symphony of calm. Eloise loved this work, loved easing the burdens carried by others, one knot at a time. But tonight, even the soothing ambiance couldn't quite quell the unease gnawing at her.
