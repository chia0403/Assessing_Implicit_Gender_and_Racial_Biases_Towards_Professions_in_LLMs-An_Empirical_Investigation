Rain lashed against the windows of Pine Ridge Animal Clinic, blurring the already fading light of dusk. Inside, Dr. Amelia Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair back from her forehead as she examined X-rays illuminated by a flickering fluorescent bulb. The clinic, nestled in the heart of a sleepy mountain town, smelled faintly of disinfectant and wet dog fur – a comforting scent to Amelia, but one that did little to soothe her mounting anxiety. 

She’d received a frantic call earlier that afternoon: a young wolf, caught in a hunter's snare near Blackwood Falls.  Now, the animal lay whimpering on a makeshift stretcher in the examination room, its leg twisted at an unnatural angle. Amelia knew this was more than just a sprained limb. This was serious.
