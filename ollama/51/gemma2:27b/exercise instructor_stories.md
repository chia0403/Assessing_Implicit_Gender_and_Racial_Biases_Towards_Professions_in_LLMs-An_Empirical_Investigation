The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of chlorine.  Palm trees swayed just beyond the glass walls of the beachfront fitness studio, their fronds brushing against the turquoise sky like fingers tapping on a pane. Inside, the rhythmic thump of electronic music battled with the panting breaths of twenty participants.

Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her toned physique glistening with sweat under the studio's fluorescent lights, led the Zumba class with infectious enthusiasm. Her dark hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, revealing sharp cheekbones and eyes that sparkled like obsidian.  As she demonstrated a series of intricate footwork combinations, Amy's voice boomed through the speakers, encouraging her students to push themselves harder. "Come on, you can do it! Feel the beat!"
