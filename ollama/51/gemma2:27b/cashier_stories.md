The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the endless aisle of candy bars and tabloids that lined the checkout counter. It was Tuesday, 3:17 pm, and the usual post-lunch lull had settled over the Stop 'N Shop. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and discounted doughnuts, punctuated by the occasional beep of the scanner as Elara rang up a customer's groceries.

Elara sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another day, another endless parade of wrinkled dollar bills and mumbled requests for extra bags.  She dreamt of something more, something beyond the monotonous rhythm of scanning and bagging. Today, however, that dream felt further away than ever.
