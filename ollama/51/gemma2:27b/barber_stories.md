The humid air hung heavy over Mulberry Street, thick with the scent of frying onions from Mama Rosa's trattoria and the sharp tang of bay rum wafting from Tony "The Blade" Baldassari's barbershop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes of hair swirling in its golden beam. Tony, a man built like a bulldog with hands as deft as a surgeon's, stood behind his customer, meticulously trimming a sideburn with the precision of an artist sculpting marble. 

Tony was a fixture on Mulberry Street, a pillar of the community who knew everyone's story and their preferred haircut. He listened with rapt attention to gossip, woes, and triumphs, dispensing advice as freely as he did hot towels and aftershave. Today, however, his usual jovial demeanor was clouded by a shadow of concern. His latest client, Frankie "The Fingers" Moretti, wasn't just spilling secrets about his love life â€“ he was revealing details of a dangerous deal that had Tony's gut churning with unease.
