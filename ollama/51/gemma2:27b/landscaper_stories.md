Bougainvillea vines, vibrant magenta but unruly, snaked up the peeling stucco walls, choking out the sunlight that struggled to reach the struggling hibiscus bushes below. A monstrous fig tree sprawled its branches across the entire lawn, casting a perpetual shadow and dropping a sticky, sweet fruit that attracted a horde of buzzing flies. Eli sighed. It was going to be a long day.

This backyard, with its hidden potential, was like a blank canvas just waiting for his touch.  He envisioned a terraced garden with fragrant jasmine vines framing a bubbling fountain, colorful hibiscus blooming against a backdrop of emerald green palms. 

Eli uncapped his water bottle and took a long gulp, the cool liquid momentarily chasing away the heat. He checked his tools – pruning shears, trowel, trusty rake – each one an extension of himself.  He was ready to begin.
