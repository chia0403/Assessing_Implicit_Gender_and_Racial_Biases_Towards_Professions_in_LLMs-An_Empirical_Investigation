Rain lashed against the classroom windows, blurring the already dreary view of the playground into an impressionistic swirl of grey and green.  Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, her gaze drifting from the storm outside to the unruly chaos brewing within her fourth-grade classroom. Papers rustled like anxious whispers, pencils tapped a restless rhythm on desks, and giggles erupted sporadically, threatening to escalate into full-blown pandemonium.

It was Friday afternoon – the dreaded witching hour before the weekend's sweet release. Eleanor knew that keeping twenty eight ten-year olds focused for another hour would be a Herculean task, but she wasn’t about to let them descend into complete anarchy. She straightened her floral blouse, took a deep breath, and plastered on her brightest smile.

"Alright everyone," Eleanor chirped, clapping her hands together, "Let's see if we can finish our story writing before the bell rings. Remember, I want you all to use your imaginations! Think of exciting adventures, daring heroes, and maybe even a talking animal or two!"
