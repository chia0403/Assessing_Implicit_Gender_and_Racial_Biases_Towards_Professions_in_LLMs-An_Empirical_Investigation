The sun beat down on Silas Montgomery's weathered neck as he leaned against his pickaxe, watching plumes of dust rise from the asphalt grinder ahead. The incessant whirring and grinding was the soundtrack to Silas' life these days, punctuated by the occasional honk of frustrated drivers navigating the detour around their construction zone. He squinted at the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him, shimmering with heat haze in the July afternoon.

Silas wasn't a man prone to complaining, but today, even the rhythmic clanging of his coworker hammering road spikes into freshly laid asphalt couldn't soothe his restless spirit.  There was something unsettling about this stretch of highway â€“ a subtle shift in the air, an unnatural stillness beneath the scorching sun. Silas felt it in the way the crows perched silently on distant telephone wires, their usual raucous calls absent. He felt it in the way even the wind seemed to hold its breath, leaving him bathed in an oppressive silence.

He wiped the sweat from his brow with a grimy rag and looked towards the horizon. There, rising from the flat expanse of dusty scrubland, was a towering mesa, its sheer rock face casting an elongated shadow across the highway like a skeletal finger pointing towards something unknown.
