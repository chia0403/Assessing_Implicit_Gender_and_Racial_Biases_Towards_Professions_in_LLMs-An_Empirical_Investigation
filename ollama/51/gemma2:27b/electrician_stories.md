The neon sign of "Big Al's Diner" flickered erratically, casting an unsettling strobe effect across Jasper Thornton's weary face. He squinted up at the faded red letters, a sigh escaping his lips. Another blown fuse. It was becoming a nightly ritual in this sleepy town of Harmony Creek. 

Jasper, a man built more like a lineman than the lithe electrician he was, adjusted his tool belt and trudged towards the diner's entrance. The scent of greasy burgers and burnt coffee wafted out, mingling with the sweet aroma of honeysuckle blooming along the cracked sidewalk. It was a comforting smell, reminding him of simpler times, before Harmony Creek became plagued by inexplicable electrical surges.

Tonight, though, the familiar comfort felt strained. Jasper wasn't just fixing fuses anymore. He was troubleshooting a mystery that hummed beneath the town's surface, sparking fear in the residents and unsettling even his own pragmatic soul.
