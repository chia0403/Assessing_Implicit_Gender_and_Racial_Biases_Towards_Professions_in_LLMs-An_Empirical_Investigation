The rain hammered against the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, mimicking the frantic rhythm drumming in Eleanor Cavendish's chest.

Eleanor straightened the stack of overdue notices on her desk, each one a tiny paper reminder of deadlines unmet. Tonight, however, it wasn't forgotten books weighing on her mind. It was the cryptic message she'd received earlier that day, scrawled in spidery handwriting on a faded postcard: "The Raven knows."
