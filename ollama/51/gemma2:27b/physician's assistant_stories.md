Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Urgent Care clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Rose Callahan. Her normally tidy blonde bun had begun to unravel, stray strands clinging damply to her temples. She scrubbed at a stubborn coffee stain on her scrubs, frustration mounting with each swipe.

Three hours into her shift and they were already drowning in patients â€“ a cascade of flu-ridden children, sprained ankles from icy sidewalks, and a persistent cough that refused to be diagnosed.  Amelia, usually unflappable in the face of medical chaos, felt a tightness in her chest, a nagging sense of dread she couldn't shake off. 

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettling glow on the waiting room, packed with coughing, sniffling bodies. A child wailed from behind a curtain, his cries piercing through the cacophony. Amelia took a deep breath, willing herself to calm down. She loved her job, helping people, easing their pain.  But tonight, something felt different, unsettlingly off-kilter.

And then, the ambulance sirens pierced the night, signaling an arrival that promised to further escalate the chaos already swirling around Amelia.
