Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the kennels, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around her shivering frame. The wind howled like a wounded beast, rattling the windows and sending shivers down her spine. It was nights like these that Amelia questioned her sanity. Why had she chosen to dedicate her life to creatures who couldn't even say thank you?

The answer, of course, lay in the soft whimpers coming from the row of cages lining the walls. Each one housed a lost soul: a trembling terrier with mismatched ears, a regal Persian with a matted coat, a boisterous bulldog who snored like a chainsaw. They were all under Amelia's care, and she was their only sanctuary in this unforgiving storm.

The old Victorian house, once grand, now sagged under the weight of years and neglect. The paint peeled in long strips, revealing bare wood beneath. Ivy, tenacious and relentless, climbed its walls like skeletal fingers. But within those crumbling walls, Amelia had built a haven for abandoned animals. A place where love and compassion outweighed the grim reality of their circumstances. 


Tonight, however, felt different. There was an unease in the air, a prickling sensation on the back of Amelia's neck. The wind seemed to carry whispers, and shadows danced ominously in the flickering lamplight.  As she reached for the latch of a cage, her heart skipped a beat. A low growl, guttural and menacing, echoed from the depths of the kennel.
