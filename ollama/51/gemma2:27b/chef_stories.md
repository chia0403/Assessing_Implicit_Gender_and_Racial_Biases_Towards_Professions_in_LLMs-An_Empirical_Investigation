The air hung thick with the scent of roasting garlic and sizzling butter, a familiar comfort to Evangeline Dubois. Her worn wooden spoon tapped a rhythmic beat against the stainless steel pot as she stirred the bubbling mirepoix. Outside, the Parisian dawn was just breaking, casting long shadows across the cobbled streets of Montmartre. 

Evangeline's tiny bistro, "Le Coq Doré," nestled between a whimsical antique shop and a boisterous florist, was still shrouded in darkness. But inside, Evangeline was already alive with the energy of creation, her hands moving with practiced grace as she transformed humble ingredients into culinary masterpieces. Today was market day, and Evangeline knew exactly what treasures awaited her: plump heirloom tomatoes bursting with summer sunshine, fragrant herbs freshly plucked from sun-drenched fields, and perhaps even a glistening wild boar for her signature ragout.  

But beyond the anticipation of fresh produce lay a deeper anxiety gnawing at Evangeline's heart. Business had been slow lately, and whispers of a new, trendy bistro opening just down the street were reaching her ears. Today, she knew, was crucial. She needed to create something extraordinary, something that would remind her loyal customers why "Le Coq Doré" remained the heart and soul of Montmartre.
