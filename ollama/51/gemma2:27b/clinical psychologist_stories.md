Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the relentless storm brewing inside her own mind. The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and lavender incense, a futile attempt to mask the lingering odour of despair that seemed permanently etched into the threadbare carpet. Eleanor gazed out at the grey cityscape, the distant neon signs blurred by the deluge.  Her fingers traced the worn spine of Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams," a book she'd consulted more times than she could count, yet its wisdom felt as distant as the sun hidden behind the storm clouds. Today, even the comforting words of the Viennese master offered little solace.

Her next appointment was due in ten minutes â€“ a young man plagued by insomnia and crippling anxiety, convinced he was slowly losing his mind. Eleanor sighed, the weight of his unseen suffering pressing down on her own weary shoulders. She longed for a day when she wouldn't feel the echoes of her patients' pain so acutely, when she could separate herself from their fractured realities. But for now, she remained tethered to them, a lifeline in the stormy seas of their tormented minds.
