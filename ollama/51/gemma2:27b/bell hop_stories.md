The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed above Edgar Bartholomew Fitzwilliam like a Victorian giant, its facade stained with grime and years of London fog. He shifted the heavy luggage bag on his shoulder, the weight settling uncomfortably into the crook of his arm. Tourists were fickle creatures, often forgetting that bellhops weren't automatons capable of infinite strength.

Edgar sighed. Another day, another endless parade of overstuffed suitcases and demanding patrons. He longed for something more, a life beyond the echoing lobby and the perpetual scent of stale polish. 


He eyed the brass revolving door with weary resignation. It was about to spit out another wave of arrivals â€“ a gaggle of giggling American tourists judging by their loud voices and brightly patterned clothing. Edgar braced himself, steeling his polite smile.

Little did he know that today's arrivals would hold more than just suitcases filled with souvenirs. Hidden amongst them lay a secret, a mystery that would drag Edgar into a world far removed from the mundane routine of The Grand Blackwood Hotel.
