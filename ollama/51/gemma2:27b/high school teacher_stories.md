The pungent scent of old textbooks and floor polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the nervous sweat of thirty teenagers crammed into Ms. Elara Beaumont's AP Literature classroom.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its rays and casting elongated shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Ms. Beaumont, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, tapped a stack of well-worn paperbacks on her desk, a calming smile playing on her lips. Outside, autumn leaves rustled against the brick walls of Hawthorne High, a symphony of crimson, gold, and russet announcing the impending chill of winter.
