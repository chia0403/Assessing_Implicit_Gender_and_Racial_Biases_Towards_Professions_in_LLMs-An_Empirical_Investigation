The July sun hammered down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's back as he wrestled a roll of shingles onto the steep slope of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian. Sweat stung his eyes, but Eli didn't dare wipe it away. One wrong move and he'd be tumbling down with these ancient tiles, landing amongst the overgrown roses in her neglected garden.

He squinted at the horizon, where shimmering heat waves danced above the dusty rooftops of Harmony Creek.  The quaint town, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, usually hummed with summer activity. But today, an unsettling stillness hung in the air. Even the cicadas seemed to have fallen silent. 

Eli grunted as he secured the shingles, a familiar knot of unease tightening in his chest. Lately, Harmony Creek had been plagued by strange occurrences - unexplained power outages, flickering lights, and whispers of ghostly apparitions seen flitting through the old cemetery at night. Most folks dismissed it as summer fever, but Eli couldn't shake the feeling that something was deeply amiss. 

He glanced down at the weathered hammer in his hand, its worn wooden handle smooth from years of use. It had belonged to his grandfather, a man who believed in facing fears head-on. Eli took a deep breath, channeling his ancestor's spirit. Whatever was happening in Harmony Creek, he wouldn't back down. He would face it, one shingle at a time.
