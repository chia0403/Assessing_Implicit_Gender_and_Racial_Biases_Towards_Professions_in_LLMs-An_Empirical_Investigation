The sun beat down on Jericho "Jake" Callahan's weathered neck as he surveyed his sprawling ranch. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mocking the withered corn stalks struggling to survive the relentless drought. Jake squinted at the horizon, hoping for a sign of rain, but all he saw was the shimmering heat haze blurring the distant mesas. 

It had been three years since decent rain fell on his land in West Texas, and the once-thriving cattle ranch was now a shadow of its former self. The herd had dwindled to a fraction of its size, their ribs visible beneath their dusty hides. Jake, his face etched with worry lines deeper than the canyons that scarred the landscape, knew he couldn't hold on much longer.
