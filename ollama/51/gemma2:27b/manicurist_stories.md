The bell above the door chimed its cheerful greeting, but Esmeralda "Esme" DeLuca barely registered it. She was locked in a war with a particularly stubborn cuticule, wielding her nipper like a tiny, gleaming sword.  Sunlight streamed through the front window of "Nails by Esme," illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the overflowing plant stand beside the door. The scent of lavender polish and acetone mingled with the faint sweetness of jasmine tea brewing on the counter, creating Esme's signature salon aroma.

Outside, the bustling streets of Little Italy hummed with the familiar cacophony of car horns, vendors hawking their wares, and snippets of Italian conversation. But inside "Nails by Esme," time seemed to slow down, each stroke of the file a meditation, each dab of polish a tiny work of art. Yet, despite her focus, Esme couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change. 

The bell chimed again, sharper this time, and a shiver ran down Esme's spine. She looked up, expecting to see Mrs. Moretti with her usual request for pale pink and rhinestones, but instead, she met the gaze of a stranger â€“ a woman with piercing blue eyes and a leather jacket that screamed "trouble."
