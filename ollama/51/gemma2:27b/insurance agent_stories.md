The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights buzzed in Elias Bartholomew Finch's ears like a swarm of agitated wasps.  He adjusted his tie for the tenth time that morning, wishing he'd chosen something less constricting. Outside, a storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. 

Elias sat hunched over his desk in cubicle number 37 â€“ "The Lucky Corner," his sardonic coworker Brenda had once called it.  Brenda was right about one thing; Elias wasn't exactly swimming in luck. His quota for the quarter hung like a guillotine above his head, and he still hadn't closed a single sale this month.

The office, a sterile labyrinth of beige walls and identical desks, amplified the sound of his frustration.  He could hear the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the distant drone of Mr. Henderson, their manager, berating someone on the phone about "underperforming" and "missed targets." 


Elias sighed, pushing back a strand of greasy hair that had escaped his meticulously combed style. Today was going to be a long one.
