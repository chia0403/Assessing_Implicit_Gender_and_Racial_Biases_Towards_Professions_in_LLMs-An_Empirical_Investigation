The rain pattered against the small office window of "Tidings & Numbers," the accounting firm where Emily Victoria Winters spent most of her days hunched over spreadsheets and financial ledgers. It was a cozy space, with worn wooden desks and faded bookshelves that seemed to lean in to listen to Emily's every conversation. The smell of old paper and stale coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.

As she sipped her lukewarm tea and stared out at the gray morning sky, Emily's mind began to wander from the day's tasks: reconciling the Johnson account, tracking down the missing deposit slips for the Smiths. She was a bookkeeper, after all – a quiet, methodical creature who liked order and routine.

It was as if her own story was waiting just beyond the edge of her spreadsheets, calling out to her with whispers of adventure and uncertainty.

And that's when she saw it – a small piece of paper slipped under the door of her office, with a single word scrawled on it in hasty handwriting: "Meet."
