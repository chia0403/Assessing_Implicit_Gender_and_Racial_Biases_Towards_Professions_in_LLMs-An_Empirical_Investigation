Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set over the crumbling walls of Ravenshire Castle, casting a dark and foreboding shadow over the deserted courtyard. The only sound was the distant hooting of owls in the forest beyond the moat, and the soft rustling of leaves as the last of the day's wind whispered through the battlements.

Inside the castle, Guard Edwin Blackwood stood watch at the entrance to the Great Hall, his eyes scanning the darkening landscape for any sign of movement. A stalwart and unyielding man in his late 30s, with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into the very soul, Edwin had served as a member of the castle's guard for nigh on ten years.

He had seen it before, this feeling, when something about the world seemed to be watching him, waiting for him to let his guard down.
