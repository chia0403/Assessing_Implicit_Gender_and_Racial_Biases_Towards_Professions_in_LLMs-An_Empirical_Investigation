Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she gazed out the steam-stained window of her office, occupational therapist Dr. Emily Rose Thompson watched as the misty raindrops clung to the panes like tiny, translucent tears. The streets of Portland were always a blur on days like this, but Emily's focus was fixed on the patient files scattered across her desk.

It was 10:45 AM on a drizzly Wednesday, and the sound of rain pattering against the glass was the only soundtrack she needed to clear her mind. Her practice, "Therapeutic Horizons," had been a labor of love for years, ever since she'd earned her Master's degree in occupational therapy from Oregon State University. Now, with over a decade of experience under her belt, Emily was known for her innovative approaches and compassionate demeanor.

As the phone on her desk jolted her out of her reverie, Emily picked up, her eyes scanning the room for the file she'd been waiting for all morning. "Therapeutic Horizons," she said warmly, ready to tackle whatever challenge the day might bring.

But as she listened to the caller's hesitant voice on the other end, Emily's instincts told her that this call would be different.
