Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as the neon lights of Bourbon Street reflected off the wet pavement. It was a night that promised nothing but trouble and excess, just like any other evening in this city's infamous entertainment district. Amidst the revelry, one man stood out - not for his wild abandon or reckless spirit, but for his steady gaze and calculating demeanor.

Aubrey Laurent "Lucky" LaFleur, a seasoned insurance agent with a knack for reading people, navigated the crowded sidewalks with ease, his eyes scanning the sea of strangers as if searching for someone in particular. His own troubles were far from the rowdy revelers that surrounded him - a recent divorce and a dwindling client base had left him feeling like he was drowning in a sea of red ink.

As Lucky stopped at a street corner to check his watch, the faint scent of magnolias wafted through the air, carrying with it whispers of a past he'd rather forget. It was then that his phone buzzed, shrill and insistent, breaking the spell of the evening's melancholy. A text from an unknown number flashed on the screen: "Meet me at Jacques-Imo's at midnight. I have information about your policy."

Lucky's eyes narrowed as he pondered the message. Who was behind this mysterious summons? And what did they know about his troubled past? The insurance agent's instincts screamed warning, but a spark of curiosity had already been lit - and Lucky LaFleur couldn't resist the allure of a good mystery.
