Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Sophia Elara Patel stood at the edge of the crowded hospital corridor, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she gazed out at the chaotic landscape of beeping machines and anxious faces. As a Physician's Assistant (PA) in the Emergency Department, Sophia was no stranger to chaos, but that didn't make it any easier.

It was a typical Friday evening at Mercy Hospital, with patients streaming in after a long week of work and socializing. The ER was buzzing with activity, from the paramedics wheeling in patients on stretchers to the doctors and nurses scrambling to triage and treat the next batch of arrivals. Sophia's eyes scanned the room, taking in the sea of unfamiliar faces and the blur of paperwork and medical charts flying through the air.

As she watched, a harried-looking nurse rushed past her, calling out for someone named Dr. Lee to come and assist with a particularly tricky case. Sophia winced inwardly - that was her mentor's patient. She had been working under Dr. Lee's guidance for several months now, learning the ins and outs of emergency medicine and honing her skills as a PA.

But tonight felt different. Tonight, Sophia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was the storm raging outside, or maybe it was just her intuition kicking in - whatever it was, she knew that this night was going to be one for the books.

Little did Sophia know, that sense of unease would soon prove to be more than just a hunch...
