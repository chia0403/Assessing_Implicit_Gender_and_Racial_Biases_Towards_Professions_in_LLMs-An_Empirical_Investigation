Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished stone as Emma Elizabeth Rose Wilson stepped out of her small apartment and into the drizzly evening air. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar scent of damp earth and ozone fill her lungs, a welcome respite from the sterile office environment she'd spent most of her day trapped in.

The Bellvue Manor building loomed ahead, its Gothic spires and turrets reaching toward the grey sky like skeletal fingers. The building's imposing facade seemed to swallow up the light around it, creating an aura of mystery and intrigue that Emma found fascinating.
