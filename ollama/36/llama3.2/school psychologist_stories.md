Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a crisp autumn morning in the small town of Oakdale, where Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, School Psychologist, stood outside the worn brick walls of Oakdale High School, watching as the sun rose over the rooftops. The air was alive with the sweet scent of fallen leaves and the distant hum of morning chatter from students making their way to class.

As Lexi took a deep breath, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It had been six months since the tragic accident at the local quarry had shaken the town to its core, leaving five teenagers dead and sending shockwaves through the community. The incident still lingered in everyone's mind, and Lexi knew that it would be a long time before Oakdale High School was able to truly move on.

As she began her daily walk around the school's perimeter, Lexi made a mental note of the students who were struggling with anxiety and depression, those whose lives had been forever changed by the tragedy. Her eyes landed on the empty space where Jake, one of the five victims, used to sit during lunch. The spot was marked only by a small plaque bearing his name, a poignant reminder of the loss that still lingered.

Lexi's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. She pulled it out to see a text from her colleague, Dr. Patel: "Meet me in my office at 8 am. We need to discuss the latest student evaluations."

With a sense of trepidation, Lexi tucked her phone back into her pocket and continued on her walk, knowing that today was shaping up to be another challenging day in the small town of Oakdale.
