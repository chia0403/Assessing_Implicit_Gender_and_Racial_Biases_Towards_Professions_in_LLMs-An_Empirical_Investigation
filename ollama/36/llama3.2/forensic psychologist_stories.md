Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the old, wooden dock that jutted out into the mist-shrouded lake, her eyes scanning the murky waters for any sign of movement. The early morning sun cast a pale glow over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, where Lexi had grown up and returned to after years away. As a forensic psychologist with the local sheriff's department, she'd seen her fair share of crime scenes, but there was something about this one that felt off.

The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Lexi could feel the weight of the town's collective unease bearing down on her. It had been three days since the body was found, a young woman with no identification and no leads on who might have killed her. The investigation was ongoing, but so far, every piece of evidence seemed to lead to a dead end.

Lexi took a deep breath, letting the cool mist fill her lungs, and began to survey the dock's weathered pilings, her trained eye searching for any sign of something that might shed light on the mystery. The trees surrounding the lake seemed to lean in, as if listening to her thoughts, their branches tangling together like skeletal fingers.

As she worked, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that she was missing something – a tiny detail, a misplaced clue – that could crack the case wide open and bring justice to the victim. But for now, all she had were questions and a growing sense of unease that this was far from over.
