Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Manhattan's Upper East Side, Emily Rose Thompson adjusted her pair of cat-eye glasses and surveyed her salon with a practiced eye. The scent of coconut oil and honey wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of chatter from her clients as they sipped their Starbucks coffee and scrolled through their phones.

Emily, or "Evie" as she was known to her friends and loyal clientele, was a 28-year-old cosmetologist with a passion for making people feel like millionaires. With over five years of experience under her belt, she had built a reputation as one of the top stylists in the city, with a client list that included A-list celebrities and socialites.

As she worked on perfecting the perfect updo for her latest bride-to-be, Evie's mind wandered to the strange phone call she'd received the night before. The mysterious stranger who claimed to have information about her missing mother had left a cryptic message on her voicemail: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." Evie shook off the feeling of unease, telling herself it was just a prank from an ex-boyfriend or a wrong number. But as she gazed out into the fading light of day, she couldn't shake the sense that something was about to change in her life forever.
