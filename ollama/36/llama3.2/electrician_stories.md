Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the coast of Crescent Bay, shrouding the small town in a damp, gray mist that seemed to cling to everything it touched. It was the kind of day where the air felt heavy with moisture and the smell of saltwater hung over everything like a miasma.

Inside the cramped, dimly lit office of his electrical contracting business, Jack Harrison hunched over a cluttered workbench, his eyes fixed on the tangled mess of wires in front of him. He was a master electrician, with a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but even he had to admit that this particular job was going to be a challenge.

It started when a frantic phone call from the wealthy businessman who owned Crescent Bay's only lighthouse came through - the old tower was on fire and he needed someone to investigate ASAP. Harrison had arrived at the scene just as the sun was setting, casting an eerie orange glow over the waves below. He'd been surveying the damage ever since, trying to piece together what could have caused the blaze.

As he pored over his notes, a small spark of curiosity ignited within him - something about this fire didn't feel right. And with the fog swirling outside like a living thing, Harrison couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something crucial. Little did he know, this case would lead him down a dark and twisted path from which there might be no return.
