As the first wisps of dawn crept over the sleepy streets of New York City's Upper East Side, Vivian Adeline Thompson slipped out of her modest apartment in the historic Dakota building, a gleaming monolith of Beaux-Arts elegance that had stood watch over the neighborhood for over a century. She stretched her slender frame, yawned, and began to make her way down the stairs, her high heels clicking softly on the worn marble.

As a concierge at the Plaza Hotel, Vivian was accustomed to witnessing the most exclusive lives of Manhattan's elite play out behind the hotel's ornate facade. She knew the intricacies of every guest's schedule, their preferences, and their deepest secrets. Her reputation as the go-to confidante and problem-solver for the city's most powerful families had earned her a quiet yet enviable position at the heart of New York's high society.

Tonight was no exception. A grand ball was being held in one of the hotel's opulent suites, and Vivian had spent the previous evening preparing the guest list, arranging flower arrangements, and discreetly negotiating with the catering staff to ensure that every whim would be catered to. As she emerged into the crisp morning air, a small package wrapped in crisp white paper waited for her on the landing, its contents whispered to her only by the hotel's enigmatic butler, Mr. Jenkins: "From someone who needs discretion and your particular set of skills, Vivian."
