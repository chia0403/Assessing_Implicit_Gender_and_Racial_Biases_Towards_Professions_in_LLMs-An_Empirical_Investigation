Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of the Red River Ranch, casting a golden glow over the rolling hills and grasslands that stretched as far as the eye could see. It was early April, and the air was crisp with the scent of wet earth and new life.

At the heart of this sprawling property stood the ranch's main homestead, a weathered but sturdy adobe structure that had been in Amos Ryder "Ace" Jackson's family for generations. Ace, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-40s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, stepped out into the bright morning light, taking a deep breath of the cool air as he surveyed his domain.

As a rancher, Ace knew every inch of this land, from the hidden waterholes to the best spots for raising cattle. He had grown up learning the ins and outs of farming and ranching from his father, who had taught him everything he knew before passing away a few years ago. Now, with his own children growing older and showing an interest in taking over the family business, Ace was determined to ensure that the Red River Ranch remained a thriving and sustainable operation for generations to come.

But as he stood there, sipping his coffee and scanning the horizon, Ace couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been growing inside him for weeks, fueled by strange occurrences on the ranch - equipment malfunctioning, livestock behaving erratically, and an overall feeling of being watched.

Little did Ace know, this was just the beginning of a summer that would test his resolve, challenge his wits, and push him to confront the darker side of the land he loved.
