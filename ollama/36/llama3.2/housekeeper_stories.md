Here's a potential story opening:

As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy streets of Ashwood, Emilia Rose Wellesley stirred in her small bed, situated in the cramped attic room above the family's grand estate. With a sigh, she swung her legs over the side of the narrow bed and planted her feet firmly on the cold, wooden floorboards. The chill of the morning air didn't bother her; she was accustomed to it. As the housekeeper for the esteemed Wellesley family, Emilia had grown accustomed to the early hours, when the household was still and the only sounds were the creaks and groans of the old mansion.

She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and began her morning routine, carefully making her way downstairs to start the day's tasks in the kitchen. But as she descended into the warm, golden light of the sunroom, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss.
