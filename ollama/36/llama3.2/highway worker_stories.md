As the sun rose over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, Highway Patrolman Ryder Blake McCormick trudged along the side of State Route 60, his boots kicking up small clouds of dust with each step. The air was thick with the scent of creosote and mesquite, a familiar smell that signaled the start of another long day on the job.

Ryder, a man in his mid-30s with a rugged jawline and piercing blue eyes, squinted against the bright morning light as he surveyed the stretch of asphalt before him. As a seasoned highway worker, Ryder had spent countless hours maintaining the roads that crisscrossed this unforgiving landscape, but on days like today, when the temperature soared into triple digits, even the most hardened veteran couldn't help but feel the weight of the task ahead.

The pavement stretched out before him like an endless ribbon, a serpentine path that wound its way through the desert's vast expanse. Ryder's gaze flicked to the horizon, where the rocky outcroppings gave way to the endless blue of the sky. It was days like this that made him wonder how he'd ended up in a job that took him further away from civilization with every step.

Despite the isolation, Ryder had grown accustomed to the rhythms of the desert. He knew when the monsoons would come, bringing life-giving rains to the parched earth, and when the winter snows would finally arrive, blanketing the landscape in a layer of white that made it almost indistinguishable from the rolling hills of Colorado. But on days like today, with the sun beating down relentlessly, Ryder couldn't help but feel a pang of restlessness.
