Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of Ravenshire in a damp, grey mist. It was a chill autumn evening, and the kind of night that made you want to curl up by the fire with a good book and a warm cup of tea.

But for Jack Ethan Fletcher, plumber extraordinaire, there would be no such luxury. His truck was still parked outside the old warehouse on the waterfront, where he'd spent the last few hours trying to unclog a particularly stubborn drain. As he trudged through the fog, his boots making squelching sounds in the wet pavement, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The warehouse had been abandoned for years, a relic of Ravenshire's industrial past. But tonight, as Jack approached the entrance, he could have sworn he saw a faint light flickering in the window. He hesitated, his hand on the wrench at his belt, wondering if he should investigate further.

That was when his phone buzzed in his pocket, shrill and insistent. Jack pulled it out to see a text from his boss, Mike, requesting his presence at the local plumbing supplier's office - something had gone wrong with one of their main customers' pipes, and Mike needed Jack's expertise ASAP.

As he read the message, the fog seemed to grow thicker, swirling around his ankles like a living thing. Jack felt a shiver run down his spine. This was going to be a long night.
