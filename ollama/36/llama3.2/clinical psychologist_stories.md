Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Evelyn Rosemary Thompson stepped out of her small apartment, gazing out at the grey, rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to match the somber mood she'd been carrying since the latest trauma case had left her shaken. As a clinical psychologist with a specialization in trauma and PTSD, Evelyn was no stranger to the darker corners of the human mind.

The building where she worked was just a few blocks away – the Oregon Psychology Center, a state-of-the-art facility that housed a team of therapists and counselors dedicated to helping the city's most vulnerable populations. Evelyn had spent countless hours within those walls, listening to the stories of survivors who'd been forever changed by their experiences.

But today, as she began her commute to work, Evelyn felt like she was walking into a familiar nightmare – one that seemed to be waiting for her around every corner. The city's sounds and smells, once vibrant and alive, now felt oppressive and menacing, like the weight of the world was crushing down on her shoulders.

As she walked through the deserted streets, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that there was a whispered message in the wind that only she could hear. It was a sense of foreboding that had become all too familiar for someone who'd spent years navigating the complexities of the human mind – and yet, it left her feeling more lost than ever before.

With a deep breath, Evelyn pushed open the door to the Oregon Psychology Center, stepping into the warm, golden light of the waiting room. The soothing hum of gentle chatter and the soft chirping of birds from the nearby park offered a fleeting respite from the shadows that lingered outside. But as she made her way through the crowds of patients and clients, Evelyn couldn't help but wonder what darkness lay ahead – and whether even she was ready to face it head-on.
