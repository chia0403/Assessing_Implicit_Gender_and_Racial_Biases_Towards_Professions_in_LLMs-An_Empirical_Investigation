Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly spring morning in Portland, Oregon, the kind of day that made you want to stay indoors with a good book and a warm cup of coffee. But for Emilia "Mia" Thompson, owner of the small but beloved salon, Locks & Co., there was no time for indulgence. The rain outside matched the gloomy mood that had been settling over her all week - not just because of the gray skies, but also because of a nagging feeling that something was off.

As she unlocked the door to the salon and stepped inside, the scent of shampoo and conditioner enveloped her, a familiar comfort that usually lifted her spirits. But today, it only seemed to cling to her like a bad habit. The sound of raindrops on the roof and the soft hum of the blow dryers created a soothing background noise, but Mia's mind was elsewhere.

She had been cutting hair for over a decade, ever since she left home in small-town America to pursue her dream of becoming a hairstylist in this vibrant city. Locks & Co. had become more than just a salon - it was a haven for the eclectic and the outcast, where everyone who walked through that door felt seen and heard.

As Mia began prepping for the day's appointments, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. She had received a mysterious message on her phone earlier that morning, an anonymous text with only two words: "They're watching."
