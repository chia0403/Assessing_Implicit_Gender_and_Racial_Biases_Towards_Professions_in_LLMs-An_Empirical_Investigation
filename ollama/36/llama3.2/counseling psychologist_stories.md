Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emilia Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping her long, curly brown hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the grey, stormy sea. The rain lashed down on her face, stinging her skin like a thousand tiny needles, but she barely noticed. Her mind was elsewhere, lost in thoughts of the session that had just ended.

Just an hour ago, Emilia had listened to 17-year-old Alex Chen, who had confided in her about the crippling anxiety that had been plaguing him since his parents' tragic accident last year. As a counseling psychologist, Emilia had spent years honing her skills to help teenagers like Alex navigate the darkest corners of their minds, but even she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered long after the session ended.

The clinic where Emilia worked was located in a small coastal town, its white buildings and weathered wooden dockside a stark contrast to the sleek, modern skyscrapers that dominated the city's skyline. The town had a way of getting under your skin, though - it was as if the air itself was infused with the whispers of its past, the secrets hidden beneath the waves.

As Emilia gazed out at the turbulent sea, she couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. She knew that this was just the beginning of another long day ahead of her, one filled with the trials and tribulations of her clients, and the quiet moments like these when the world seemed to be holding its breath.

And yet, as she turned to make her way back inside, Emilia couldn't shake off the feeling that something was waiting for her just beneath the surface - a stormy sea of secrets and lies, or perhaps even a deeper truth lurking in the depths of the town's troubled past.
