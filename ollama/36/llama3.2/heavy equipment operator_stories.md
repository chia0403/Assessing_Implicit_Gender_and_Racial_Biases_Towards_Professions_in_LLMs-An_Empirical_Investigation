Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Montana ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby grasslands. Heavy equipment operator, Ryder Cole Thompson, sat atop his modified Caterpillar 349F excavator, scanning the horizon for any sign of trouble as he finished up the day's work.

Ryder had been operating heavy equipment since he was old enough to wear a hard hat, and he took pride in his ability to get the job done efficiently and effectively. As a member of the Thompson ranching family, Ryder had grown up surrounded by the land and the rhythms of rural life. But despite his rugged exterior, he had a secret: he'd been experiencing strange dreams lately - vivid, unsettling visions that seemed all too real.

As Ryder shut down the excavator's engines and climbed down from the cab, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He glanced over at the old ranch house in the distance, its porch creaking gently in the breeze like a lonely sigh. It was going to be a long night.
