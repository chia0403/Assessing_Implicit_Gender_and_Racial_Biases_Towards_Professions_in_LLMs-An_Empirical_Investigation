Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson gazed out the rain-soaked window of her small office in downtown Portland, Oregon. The gray skies seemed to match her mood perfectly - dull, uninspiring, and perpetually stuck in neutral. It was days like this that made Lexi wonder why she'd ever left the corporate world behind, trading in her high-rise skyscraper view for a cramped, windowless cubicle in a drab office building.

**Setting:**

Lexi Thompson, a 30-year-old paralegal, had just finished a long day of reviewing contracts and preparing documents for her boss's law firm. The Portland office was a hub for environmental litigation, and Lexi found herself drawn to the work - not because she was passionate about the law, but because it allowed her to use her analytical skills and attention to detail to make a difference.

The office itself was a nondescript, two-story building on SW 3rd Avenue. The floors creaked beneath her feet as she made her way to the elevator, a constant reminder of the age and neglect that seemed to permeate every aspect of the city. Outside, the streets were empty and deserted, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to escape the rain.

Lexi's gaze lingered on the drab exterior of the office building, feeling like she was stuck in a rut. But as she stepped into the elevator, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker with promise - a small spark that hinted at the excitement and uncertainty that lay ahead.

How's this? I'd be happy to continue or modify it if you have any specific requests!
