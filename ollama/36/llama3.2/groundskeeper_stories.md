Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, casting a mystical veil over its quaint streets and worn buildings. In the heart of this rural community, on the sprawling estate of Willowdale Manor, groundskeeper Emilia Adelaide Fanshawe stirred to life amidst the dew-kissed grasses and leafy foliage.

As she emerged from the small cottage nestled among the gardens, Emilia breathed in the damp air, her senses invigorated by the scent of damp earth and new growth. The early morning light danced through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the cobblestone paths and ornate ironwork that crisscrossed the estate's manicured lawns.

Emilia stretched her arms above her head, feeling the familiar ache in her back from a lifetime spent bending, pruning, and tending to the land. She yawned, revealing crooked teeth, and began her daily routine, methodically making her way to the manor house to prepare for the day's chores.

With the dawn breaking over Ravenswood, Emilia Fanshawe was ready to tackle whatever secrets or surprises the day might bring â€“ from pruning the roses to unraveling the tangled threads of the estate's mysterious past. Little did she know that today would be no ordinary day in this sleepy town, and her quiet life as a groundskeeper would soon be upended by forces beyond her control.
