Here's a possible story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Amelia Elara Dupre stepped out of the worn brick building where she spent most of her days hunched over a workbench, hammer in hand. As a skilled drafting worker for the venerable Dupre Construction Company, Amelia took pride in her work, meticulously crafting intricate wooden joints and precision-cutting curved frames to bring the visions of her boss, Monsieur LeBlanc, to life.

The air was heavy with the scent of freshly cut wood and the distant thrum of jazz from the French Quarter's famous Bourbon Street drifted through the misty air, mingling with Amelia's own thoughts as she made her way down the narrow alleyway between the towering oak trees. She had just finished a long shift at the office, where she spent most of her day poring over plans and blueprints, pouring over the fine details that would ensure every beam and board fit together like a well-oiled machine.

As she walked, Amelia's thoughts turned to the strange letter she'd received earlier that week. The envelope was old-fashioned and yellowed, with no return address, but the words themselves had been plain as day: "Meet me at the old sawmill on the outskirts of town if you want to know the truth about your family's past." Amelia's gut told her to ignore it, but a nagging sense that there was more to the mysterious message lingered, refusing to be dismissed.

With a sigh, she tucked the letter into her pocket and continued down the alleyway, lost in thought as the rain intensified around her.
