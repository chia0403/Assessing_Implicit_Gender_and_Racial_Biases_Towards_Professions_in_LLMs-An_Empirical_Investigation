Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the River Liffey, shrouding the narrow streets of Dublin's Liberties in a damp, grey mist. In a small shop on Fleet Street, a sign creaked in the wind, bearing the name "McTavish & Sons" in faded letters above the door. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of fresh meat and the sound of sizzling sausages filled the air.

Amidst the chaos of chopping and wrapping, Angus McTavish, a burly man with a bushy beard and a twinkle in his eye, expertly trimmed a joint of lamb. His worn leather apron was stained with the remnants of yesterday's butcherings, and his hands moved with a practiced ease that had been honed over decades of working behind the counter. As he worked, Angus's mind wandered to the argument he'd had with his nephew, Eamon, earlier that morning - the one that had left a sour taste in his mouth like yesterday's meat. Little did he know, today would bring more than just another day at the shop.
