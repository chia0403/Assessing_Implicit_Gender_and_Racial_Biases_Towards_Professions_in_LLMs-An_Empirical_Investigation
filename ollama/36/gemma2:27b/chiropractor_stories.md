Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's chiropractic clinic, blurring the lights of the quaint seaside town into shimmering halos. The scent of salt air mingled with lavender from the diffuser she'd placed by the reception desk, creating an odd but calming aroma.  Evelyn sighed as she surveyed her empty waiting room.

But she'd craved a slower pace, a connection to nature, and so she'd uprooted herself and moved to this charming coastal town, hoping to build a new life.

The bell above the door chimed, startling her from her thoughts. A figure shrouded in rain shuffled in, leaving a trail of wet footprints across the polished wooden floor. Evelyn straightened her crisp white coat and offered a warm smile. "Welcome in! Please have a seat," she said, gesturing to the plush armchair by the window.  

The stranger hesitated, pulling off a sodden wool cap and revealing a face etched with worry lines. "Dr. Thorne?" he asked, his voice raspy.
