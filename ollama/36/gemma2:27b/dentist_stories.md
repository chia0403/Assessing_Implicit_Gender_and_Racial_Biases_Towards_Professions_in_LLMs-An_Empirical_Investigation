The rain hammered against the stained glass windowpane above Dr. Evelyn Albright's chair, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of color. The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of fluoride and antiseptic. Evelyn sighed, her gaze drifting from the patient in front of her – a jittery teenager with braces and a death grip on the armrests – to the grey sky beyond.

It wasn't the weather that was getting to her. It was the silence. This quaint little seaside town of Saltwind had been unusually quiet since the storm rolled in, keeping even the most stalwart locals indoors.  Usually, Evelyn's waiting room buzzed with chatter and the clatter of coffee cups. Today, it echoed only with the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Evelyn tightened her grip on her drill, a familiar anxiety creeping up her throat. This wasn't just any filling. This was young Michael Hawthorne's first cavity, and Evelyn, ever the perfectionist, wanted to make sure he left her chair with a smile, not a scar.
