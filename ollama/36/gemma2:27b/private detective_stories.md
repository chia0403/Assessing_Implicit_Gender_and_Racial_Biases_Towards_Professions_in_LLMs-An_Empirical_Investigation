Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. The air in Silas Blackwood's office was thick with cigarette smoke and the faint scent of stale coffee. Papers overflowed from his overflowing desk, illuminated by a single flickering bulb that cast long, grotesque shadows on the peeling wallpaper. 

Blackwood himself, a man whose face looked like it had been sculpted from granite and disappointment, leaned back in his creaky chair, a half-empty bottle of bourbon sweating condensation onto the scarred surface. His eyes, the color of weathered steel, were fixed on the doorway, waiting.  He'd received a call earlier â€“ a woman, voice trembling with desperation, asking for his help. A missing husband, she said. Vanished without a trace. Blackwood, despite years of cynicism hardening him like concrete, couldn't ignore the plea in her voice. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of his client.  Blackwood straightened, stubbing out his cigarette with a sigh. This was going to be another long night.
