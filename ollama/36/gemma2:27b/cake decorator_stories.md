The whir of the stand mixer was Amelia "Amy" Rosebrook's symphony. Flour dusted the air like shimmering snow, catching the afternoon sunbeams that streamed through the bakery window. Amy hummed along to the radio, her nimble fingers expertly piping buttercream roses onto a three-tiered vanilla cake. It was destined for a wedding reception, a cascade of ivory frosting mimicking the bride's bouquet.

The bell above the shop door jingled, breaking Amy's concentration. She glanced up, expecting Mrs. Henderson collecting her usual lemon poppyseed loaf. Instead, a tall man with tousled dark hair and eyes the colour of melted chocolate stood hesitantly in the doorway.  His gaze darted around the bakery, landing briefly on the wedding cake before settling on Amy. 


"Hi," he said, his voice a low rumble. "I was hoping you might be able to help me."
