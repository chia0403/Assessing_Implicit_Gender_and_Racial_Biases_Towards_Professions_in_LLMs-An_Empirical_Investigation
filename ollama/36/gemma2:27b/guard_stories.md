The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethelgard, carrying with it the scent of snow and something else, something faintly metallic that made Sergeant Kaelan Thorne's stomach churn. He pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around himself, squinting against the swirling grey snow. Above, the jagged peaks of the Greyfang Mountains loomed, their summits lost in a perpetual veil of mist.

Kaelan stood on the crumbling parapet of Fort Avaron, the last bastion of civilization for hundreds of miles. He was alone on duty, the rest of his comrades huddled inside against the relentless cold. 

His gaze swept across the frozen wasteland, searching for any sign of movement. For weeks, rumors had plagued the fort: whispers of a barbarian horde amassing in the north, their hunger for conquest growing with every passing day. The elders dismissed it as superstition, but Kaelan couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that something wicked was approaching on the horizon.

He gripped his frost-covered spear tighter, its haft cold against his gloved hand. His heart pounded a steady rhythm against his ribs, mirroring the distant rumble he swore he could hear echoing from beyond the mountains.
