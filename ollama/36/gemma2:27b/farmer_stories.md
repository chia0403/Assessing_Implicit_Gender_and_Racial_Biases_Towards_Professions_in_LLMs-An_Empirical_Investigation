The rooster's crow pierced through Elara Blackwood’s sleep like a rusty nail. She groaned, tugging the threadbare quilt tighter around her shoulders. Dawn was barely breaking over the rolling hills of Thistlebrook, painting the sky in hues of lavender and rose.  Elara knew that meant another long day ahead – mending fences, tending to the stubborn flock of sheep, and praying for rain. This year had been dry, drier than anyone in Thistlebrook could remember. The crops were stunted, the earth cracked, and a sense of unease hung heavy over the small farming community.  

Elara climbed out of bed, her joints protesting with a symphony of pops and creaks. Her calloused hands reached for the worn apron hanging on the back of the door – a familiar ritual that marked the beginning of another day battling the unforgiving land. Today, she felt it more acutely than ever. The weight of responsibility for her family's survival pressed down on her like the relentless summer sun.
