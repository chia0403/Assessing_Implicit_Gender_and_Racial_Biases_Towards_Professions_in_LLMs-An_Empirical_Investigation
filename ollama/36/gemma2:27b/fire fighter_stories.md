The insistent blare of the siren tore Amelia "Ember" Reyes from a dream about swimming in an ocean of molten gold.  She jolted upright, heart hammering against her ribs, the familiar scent of smoke and burnt rubber already creeping into her nostrils even before she swung her legs over the side of the bunk. Ember was used to the disorientation; it came with the territory of being one of the few female firefighters at Station 17.  

Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, tinged with the orange glow of distant flames reflecting off the wet asphalt. The heavy air hung thick and humid, promising another scorching summer day in Phoenix, Arizona. Ember raced down the pole, her boots thudding against the metal rungs, adrenaline already surging through her veins. 

This wasn't just any call. This was the old Hawthorne textile mill, a hulking behemoth of brick and iron that had been abandoned for decades. Rumors swirled about it being haunted, but Ember knew better than to believe in ghosts.  Whatever was burning inside those crumbling walls, it was real, and it needed her help.
