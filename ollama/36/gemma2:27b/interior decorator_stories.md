The relentless July sun beat down on the asphalt, turning the air thick and syrupy. Emilia "Em" Cartwright squinted through the glare as she wrestled a vintage peacock chair out of her cluttered van. Sweat beaded on her brow, mingling with stray blonde curls that had escaped her hastily tied bun. The chair, a glorious monstrosity of lacquered wood and iridescent feathers, was destined for the sunroom of Mrs. Hawthorne's Tudor mansion - a project Em both relished and dreaded in equal measure.

Mrs. Hawthorne, a formidable woman with a penchant for dramatic pronouncements and antique porcelain dolls, had given Em carte blanche to redesign her sunroom into an "oasis of tranquility." Em was all for creating serene spaces, but balancing Mrs. Hawthorne's eclectic taste with her own minimalist aesthetic was proving to be a delicate dance. The peacock chair, though stunning, was just the first hurdle in what promised to be a challenging but ultimately rewarding project.
