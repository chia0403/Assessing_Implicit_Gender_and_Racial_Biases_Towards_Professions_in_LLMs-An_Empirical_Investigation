The scent of caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the yeasty tang of rising dough and the sharp bite of cinnamon. Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne hummed along to the radio, her hands dusted white with flour as she expertly braided three strands of challah dough. Outside, a relentless drizzle hammered against the shop windows, blurring the Parisian street scene into an impressionist painting.

Eloise's bakery, "Le Pain Dor√©" (The Golden Bread), was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone lane, its warm glow beckoning passersby seeking refuge from the dreary weather. The bell above the door tinkled merrily as a customer stepped inside, momentarily banishing the scent of rain with the aroma of wet wool and bergamot perfume. Eloise smiled, her heart warming at the sight of another soul seeking solace in her creations.  

Today was no ordinary day. It was Bastille Day, a celebration of France's freedom, and Eloise had poured her heart into crafting a special baguette, infused with rosemary and studded with tiny flags. But as she reached for the loaf pan, a sharp rapping on the back door startled her.

Who could be visiting on a day like this?
