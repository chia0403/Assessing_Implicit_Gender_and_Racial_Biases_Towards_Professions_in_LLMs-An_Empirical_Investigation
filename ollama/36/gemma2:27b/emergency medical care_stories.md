The insistent whine of sirens tore through Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's dream – a blurry montage of fluffy kittens and overflowing ice cream cones. Groaning, she slapped at the snooze button on her alarm clock, momentarily silencing the relentless cry. The red glow from the streetlights filtering through her thin curtains was enough to tell her it wasn't just a dream.

It was 3:17 AM. A Wednesday. And somewhere in the sprawling concrete jungle of Chicago, someone needed Amy.

She scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold hardwood floor. The adrenaline started pumping – a familiar rush that washed away any lingering drowsiness. Years on the ambulance had honed Amy into a finely tuned machine, ready to spring into action at a moment's notice. 

Tonight, she was riding with Marco, a gruff but dependable veteran EMT who’d seen it all. They were stationed at Engine Company 18 in the heart of Rogers Park, a vibrant neighborhood that buzzed with life during the day and held its breath under a veil of shadows at night.  The call would come through any minute, flashing on their worn-out computer screen, detailing the emergency that awaited them. Amy tightened her braid, adjusted her EMT badge, and braced herself for another unpredictable Chicago night.
