The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and impending rain. Theodore "Theo" Bellingham surveyed his domain – the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor – with a practiced eye.  His weathered hands rested on the handle of his trusty rake, its teeth worn smooth from years of battling stubborn leaves and unruly weeds. 

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept moor, was Theo's sanctuary. He knew every twist of its overgrown paths, the secrets whispered by the ancient oaks lining the driveway, and the precise moment the roses would unfurl their velvety petals in the morning sun. Yet today, something felt off. A strange tension crackled in the air, barely perceptible beneath the symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves. Even the usually placid koi pond seemed to shimmer with an unnatural energy.

Theo squinted towards the manor's imposing silhouette, its windows dark and lifeless. The Blackwood family, eccentric recluses rumored to dabble in the occult, had been absent for weeks, leaving Theo to tend their neglected paradise alone. He shrugged off a shiver of unease. It was just the weather, he reasoned, his heart beating a little faster against his ribs. Still, as he turned back to his work, the faintest hint of sulfur hung in the air, an unwelcome guest in his floral haven.
