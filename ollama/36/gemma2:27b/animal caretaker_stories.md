Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, a steady rhythm that underscored Esmeralda "Esme" Finch's anxieties. She crouched beside Daisy, a pregnant ewe whose labored breathing filled the air with a sharp, almost metallic scent. Esme gently stroked Daisy's matted wool, whispering reassurances she didn't entirely feel herself. The storm had rolled in unexpectedly, cutting off power to the small, secluded farm nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands.  

With no electricity for the heat lamps, the temperature in the barn was plummeting. Esme knew that Daisy needed warmth and calm to deliver her lambs safely. But with each clap of thunder, the ewe became more agitated, her bleating rising in pitch. The fate of both mother and lambs rested on Esme's shoulders, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on her like the relentless rain outside.
