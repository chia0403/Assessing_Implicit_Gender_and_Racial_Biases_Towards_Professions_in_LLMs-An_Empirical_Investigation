The sun beat down on Silas Elijah "Si" Carter's neck, turning it the color of a ripe tomato.  He squinted at the shimmering asphalt, the heat rising in waves off the endless black ribbon stretching before him. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking his attempts to stay cool under the wide brim of his faded Stetson hat. Si ran a calloused hand over the back of his neck, grimacing as sweat stung his eyes.

He was stationed at mile marker 237 on Highway 66, a lonely stretch of road cutting through the heart of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. His job: repair potholes and patch cracks that threatened to swallow unsuspecting tires whole. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest, and Si took pride in keeping this artery of America flowing smoothly.
