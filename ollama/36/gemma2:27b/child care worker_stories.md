Rain lashed against the windows of Sunshine Daycare, blurring the vibrant crayon drawings taped to the glass into watery smears. Inside, twenty-five-year-old Amelia Cartwright bounced a fussy toddler named Leo on her hip, his chubby face contorted in a wail that could rival a foghorn. The usual cheerful chaos of the daycare felt muted today; even the normally boisterous preschoolers huddled closer to their teachers, watching the storm with wide, apprehensive eyes.

Amelia sighed, rocking Leo gently. "It's just a little rain, sweetheart," she cooed, though her voice was strained. It wasn't just the weather that had her feeling on edge. This morning, Mrs. Peterson, the daycare owner, had announced an unexpected inspection from the city council, scheduled for later that afternoon. Amelia knew they were always prepared, but a nagging anxiety wormed its way into her stomach.

The bell above the door jingled, startling Leo and sending him wailing anew. A figure emerged from the storm, shaking droplets from a bright yellow raincoat â€“ Amelia's best friend, Maya, arriving to start her afternoon shift. 

"Looks like you need another pair of hands," Maya said with a sympathetic smile. She swept into the room, immediately taking over Leo's bouncing, allowing Amelia to finally catch her breath.
