Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's cramped studio apartment, blurring the already hazy cityscape beyond. The air hung thick with the smell of developing chemicals and damp cardboard boxes overflowing with prints. Amy sat hunched over her makeshift darkroom table, bathed in the dim red glow of a safelight. Her hands, stained purple from countless hours spent immersing negatives in trays of developer and fixer, moved with practiced precision as she carefully hung a fresh photograph on the drying rack.

This one was different. It wasn't a shot of the gritty urban decay she usually captured â€“ the peeling paint on abandoned buildings, the melancholic gaze of a homeless man huddled against the cold, the fleeting beauty of graffiti blooming across brick walls. This photograph held a strange ethereal quality. A swirling mist clung to an ancient oak tree in the middle of a forgotten park, its branches twisting upwards like gnarled fingers reaching for a sky hidden by a veil of rain.

Amy traced her fingertip along the image, mesmerized by the way the light seemed to shimmer and dance within the mist. She couldn't explain it, but this photograph felt... haunted. As if it held a secret, waiting to be unlocked.
