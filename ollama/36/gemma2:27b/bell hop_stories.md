The mahogany door swung open with a groan that echoed through the hushed lobby, releasing a blast of humid Miami air into the cool sanctuary of The Flamingo Royale. Theodore "Teddy" Quincy III straightened his crisp bellhop uniform and plastered on his most charming smile. Another tourist, another opportunity to earn a decent tip. He was already mentally calculating how many mojitos he could buy with five bucks.

The Flamingo Royale stood proud against the turquoise canvas of Biscayne Bay, its pink facade shimmering under the relentless Florida sun. Palm trees swayed in the breeze, casting long shadows across the marble floor. Inside, the air buzzed with a low hum of activity â€“ guests checking in and out, porters rushing luggage through the opulent hallways, the tinkling of piano music drifting from the grand salon. It was Teddy's world, a gilded cage where he navigated the desires and whims of the wealthy and restless.

But today felt different. The woman who stepped into the lobby was unlike any guest Teddy had seen before. Dressed in a flowing crimson gown that clung to her curves like a second skin, she carried herself with an air of quiet power. Her eyes, dark as midnight and fringed with thick lashes, met his gaze for a fleeting moment, sending a shiver down his spine.  She held out a worn leather suitcase, her lips curving into a enigmatic smile. 

"Theodore Quincy III," she said, her voice a velvety purr. "I believe you have something of mine."
