The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz like a swarm of agitated bees, casting a sickly yellow glow over the sterile white walls of the clinic waiting room. The air, thick with disinfectant and fear, clung to Esme's already clammy hands as she surveyed the lineup of anxious faces before her.

She was used to this â€“ the nervous coughs, the darting eyes, the hushed whispers about "bloodwork" and "results." As a phlebotomist at Hopewell Community Clinic, Esme saw it all: the frail elderly woman clutching her granddaughter's hand for support, the burly construction worker trying to mask his terror with bravado, the young mother whose face mirrored the fear in her child's wide eyes. Today was no different.

But something felt off. A prickle of unease crawled up Esme's spine as she noticed a figure slumped against the far wall, shrouded in shadow and silence. Unlike the others, he hadn't even glanced up at her arrival. He seemed utterly detached, lost in his own world of despair.

Esme approached him cautiously, her practiced smile faltering for the first time that day. This wasn't the typical pre-bloodwork jitters. There was something deeper, something colder emanating from this man. And as she drew closer, a faint metallic scent reached her nostrils, sharp and unsettling.
