Rain lashed against the warped plywood door of Elias "Eli" Bartholomew's workshop, each drop drumming a frantic tattoo. The air inside smelled faintly of solder and desperation. Eli, his grease-stained overalls clinging to his wiry frame, squinted at the mangled mess of pipes before him. A symphony of clanks and groans emanated from the contraption, a testament to Mrs. Higgins' claim that her "gentleman caller" had attempted some DIY plumbing. 

Eli sighed. This was going to be a long night.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes against the rusted corrugated iron roof. The power flickered ominously, threatening to plunge the workshop into an even deeper gloom.
