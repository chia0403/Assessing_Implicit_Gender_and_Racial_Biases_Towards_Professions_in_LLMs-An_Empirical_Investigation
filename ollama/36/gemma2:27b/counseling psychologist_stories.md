Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own heart. The antique grandfather clock in the corner ticked with monotonous precision, each chime a reminder of the dwindling time she had left before her next appointment. She gazed out at the gray cityscape, blurred and indistinct through the rain-streaked glass. Her normally vibrant lavender office, filled with the comforting scent of sandalwood incense and overflowing bookshelves, felt suffocatingly small tonight.

Eleanor was renowned in the city for her empathetic approach to counseling, guiding countless individuals through their darkest hours. But tonight, she felt a chilling emptiness gnaw at her own soul.  The recent loss of her mentor and close friend, Dr. Samuel Pierce, had left a gaping hole in her life, one that even her years of experience couldn't seem to fill.
