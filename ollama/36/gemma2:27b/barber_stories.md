The pungent aroma of bay rum mingled with the sharp scent of shaving cream hung thick in the air of Benny "The Blade" Barone's barbershop. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of hair clippings that danced in the golden rays. Benny, a stocky man with a handlebar moustache that quivered with each chuckle, hummed along to an old Sinatra tune crackling from the radio perched precariously on a stack of vintage magazines. 

His shop, "Benny's Blades & Brushes," occupied a prime corner spot on Mulberry Street in Little Italy. The faded red and white striped awning was a familiar sight, drawing in regulars and curious newcomers alike with its promise of sharp cuts and even sharper conversation. Today, however, the usual buzz of chatter was replaced by an unnerving silence. Benny glanced at the empty barber chairs, his bushy eyebrows furrowing with concern. Something wasn't right.
