Rain hammered against the bakery window, blurring the warm glow emanating from within. Emilia Sinclair, her auburn hair escaping its neat bun in rebellious curls, shivered despite the heat radiating from the steaming cappuccino clutched in her hands. She glanced at the clock - 8:15 am. Her first client of the day was already fifteen minutes late.

Emilia sighed, pushing the frustration down. It wasn't uncommon for people to be intimidated by a dietician, seeing them as judgmental food police instead of allies on their journey to better health. This client, a young woman named Amelia struggling with emotional eating, had seemed particularly apprehensive during their initial phone consultation. Emilia hoped she hadnâ€™t scared her off.

The bell above the bakery door chimed, startling Emilia. She looked up, expecting to see Amelia's hesitant figure, but instead found herself staring at a man dripping wet and looking utterly bewildered. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with dark hair plastered to his forehead and eyes the color of stormy skies.


He gave her a sheepish smile. "Sorry," he said, his voice rough with apology. "Am I in the wrong place? This is The Flour Garden, right?"
