The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, laced with the earthy aroma of sawdust and curing spices. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpanes of "Finnegan's Finest," illuminating motes of dust dancing in its wake. Bartholomew Finnegan, his broad shoulders hunched beneath a stained butcher's apron, surveyed the display case with a critical eye. 

He ran a calloused thumb over the rosy flesh of a prime rib roast, its marbling glistening under the harsh fluorescent lights. "Needs a bit more aging," he muttered to himself, before turning his attention to the plump sausages hanging from hooks above. Bartholomew prided himself on crafting the best sausages in all of Oakhaven, each link bursting with flavor thanks to his secret blend of herbs and spices passed down through generations.

But today, something felt off. A knot of unease tightened in Bartholomew's gut as he glanced at the clock ticking steadily on the wall â€“ almost closing time.  He hadn't seen a single customer all day. Usually, by this hour, the shop would be buzzing with housewives haggling over prices and children pleading for scraps of bacon. 

The unsettling silence was broken only by the rhythmic thumping of Bartholomew's cleaver against his chopping block, each blow echoing in the cavernous room like a hammer blow to his heart. Something wasn't right in Oakhaven, he could feel it.
