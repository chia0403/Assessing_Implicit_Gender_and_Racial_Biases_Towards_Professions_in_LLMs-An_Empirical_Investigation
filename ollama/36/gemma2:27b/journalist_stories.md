Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Cartwright's cramped apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The air hung thick with stale coffee and unfulfilled promises. She stared at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen, mocking her writer's block.  

Three weeks she'd been chasing this story – a whispered rumour of corruption in the city council, tangled up with whispers of missing funds and hushed-up scandals. Three weeks spent dodging evasive officials, sifting through mountains of bureaucratic paperwork, and encountering dead ends at every turn. The clock was ticking; her editor, a man known for his volcanic temper and razor-thin patience, had given her an ultimatum: deliver the goods by Friday or face the consequences. 

Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, the neon glow of the city reflecting in their depths. This wasn't the glamorous life she'd envisioned as a young journalism student, fueled by idealism and dreams of exposing truth to the world. Now, facing down a faceless bureaucracy and a deadline that felt like a noose tightening around her neck, she questioned if it was all worth it.  

Just then, a sharp rap on her door jolted her from her reverie. Heart hammering in her chest, Amelia cautiously approached the threshold, wondering who could be braving the torrential downpour at this hour.  As she peered through the peephole, a flash of lightning illuminated the figure standing outside – a young man, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat, clutching a manila envelope. His presence sent a shiver down Amelia's spine, a mixture of apprehension and intrigue.
