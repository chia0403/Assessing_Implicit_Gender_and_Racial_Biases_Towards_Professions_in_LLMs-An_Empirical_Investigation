Rain hammered against the skyscraper windows, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of light as it hit the neon-drenched cityscape below.  Theodore "Teddy" Alistair Davenport III stared out at the tempest, his reflection a pale ghost superimposed on the chaotic tableau. The mahogany desk in his corner office at Davenport & Sons felt cold beneath his manicured fingers. Spreadsheets glowed on his dual monitors, each column and row a silent testament to the volatile dance of the market he'd dedicated his life to. 

Today, however, Teddy wasn't focused on the numbers. He was wrestling with an altogether different beast - a summons from the enigmatic and notoriously ruthless investor known only as "The Serpent."  Teddy knew little about The Serpent, just whispers of unimaginable wealth and deals sealed in shadows. What he did know was that ignoring this summons would be akin to signing his own death warrant.
