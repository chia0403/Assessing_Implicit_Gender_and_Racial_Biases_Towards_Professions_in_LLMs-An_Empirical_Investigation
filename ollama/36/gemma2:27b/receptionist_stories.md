The incessant chirping of the antique grandfather clock in the corner was driving Eliza Mayfair-Hawthorne up the wall. It wasn't the sound itself, exactly, more the relentless ticking that mirrored the monotony of her day. She smoothed down the wrinkles on her powder blue blouse – a stark contrast to the dusty mahogany desk she perched behind – and sighed.

The grand foyer of Hawthorne & Sons, an antiquated law firm smelling faintly of leather and forgotten ambition, was eerily quiet for a Monday morning. Eliza usually reveled in the peace before the storm, but today even the soft rustle of legal documents felt oppressive. 


She longed to be anywhere else – perhaps sketching by the river, her charcoal pencil dancing across the canvas, capturing the fleeting beauty of a sunrise.  But here she was, trapped in this gilded cage, answering phones and dispensing smiles to men in expensive suits who seemed perpetually on edge. Eliza knew it wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills and allowed her to pursue her true passion – art. Or at least, it would when her meager savings weren't constantly depleted by rent.

Just then, the heavy oak door creaked open, interrupting her reverie. A gust of wind whipped through the foyer, carrying with it the scent of rain and a figure cloaked in shadow. Eliza straightened her spine and plastered on her best professional smile. Another day, another client.  Little did she know this arrival would shatter the monotony of her existence and plunge her into a world she never dreamed possible.
