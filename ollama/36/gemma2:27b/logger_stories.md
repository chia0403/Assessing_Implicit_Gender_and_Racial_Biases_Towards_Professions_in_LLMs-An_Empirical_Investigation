The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A pale sliver of moon peeked through the towering Douglas firs, casting long, skeletal shadows across the clearing. Silas Blackwood adjusted his headlamp, the beam cutting through the gloom to illuminate the gnarled trunk before him. The ancient cedar, its bark etched with decades of weathering, stood defiant against the encroaching darkness.

Silas ran a calloused hand over its rough surface, feeling the silent strength pulsing beneath.  He'd been logging these woods for twenty years, and each tree he felled felt like a goodbye to an old friend. He knew their language - the whispers of wind through their needles, the creaks and groans under the weight of snow, the slow, steady pulse of life coursing through their veins. 

But today, there was something different about this cedar. It hummed with an energy he couldn't quite place, a subtle thrumming that vibrated deep within his bones. Hesitation gnawed at him, but the quota needed filling. He took a deep breath, the scent of cedar sharp in his nostrils, and swung his axe.
