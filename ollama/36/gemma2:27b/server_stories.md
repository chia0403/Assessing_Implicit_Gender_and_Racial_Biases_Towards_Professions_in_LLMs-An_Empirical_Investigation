The flickering neon sign outside "Luigi's Pizza Palace" cast an anemic green glow across Amelia Beatrice Dubois' tired face.  It was 10:30 pm on a Friday night, and Luigi's was in its usual state of controlled chaos. The aroma of oregano and garlic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the greasy scent of pepperoni and the sharp tang of vinegar from the salad bar. 

Amelia weaved between tables laden with half-eaten pizzas and empty soda cups, her smile plastered on as she balanced a tray piled high with steaming calzones. A chorus of drunken laughter erupted from a booth in the corner, followed by the clatter of forks and the slurping of spaghetti. Amelia sighed internally. This was always the hardest shift - the late Friday night crowd.

But tonight felt different.  A prickle of unease ran down her spine, something she couldn't quite place. Maybe it was the way a man in a trench coat kept staring at her from across the room, his eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses even though the sun had set hours ago. Or perhaps it was the unsettling stillness in the usually bustling kitchen, punctuated only by the occasional clang of pots and pans. 

Whatever it was, Amelia felt a growing sense of dread as she approached table seven, bracing herself for another round of demanding customers and overflowing plates.
