Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Sparky's Electrical Emporium," blurring the neon sign into an indistinct swirl of pink and blue. Inside, Elias Finnigan tightened a screw on a flickering fluorescent fixture with a grunt, sending a shower of sparks dancing across the cluttered workbench. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt solder, punctuated by the rhythmic drip-drip from a leaky pipe somewhere in the bowels of the building.

Elias was no stranger to this symphony of industrial decay. He'd inherited "Sparky's" from his grandfather, a gruff but brilliant electrician who’d built a reputation for fixing anything with wires. Now, Elias carried on the torch, though the business had seen better days. The once-thriving neighborhood had grown quiet, replaced by boarded-up storefronts and an unsettling stillness that seemed to creep into his bones.

But tonight was different. A call had come in just before closing time, a frantic plea from Mrs. Hemlock on Maple Street. Her lights were flickering, her refrigerator was humming ominously, and worst of all – the old grandfather clock that had been ticking for generations was inexplicably silent. Elias couldn't explain why, but this job felt different. It wasn't just a faulty wire or a blown fuse; there was something else in the air, an unsettling hum beneath the static crackle of the storm. 

He grabbed his toolkit, the familiar weight comforting in his hands, and stepped out into the tempestuous night. The rain stung his face as he made his way down the darkened street, towards the house shrouded in shadows – a house that seemed to hold its breath, waiting for him to arrive.
