The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile white glow over Eleanor Beatrice Fitzwilliam's workspace. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was hers. Every gleaming instrument, every neatly labeled container, spoke to years of meticulous care and dedication.  Eleanor, with her gentle hands and soothing voice, prided herself on making even the most anxious patients feel at ease. But today, something felt off.

The air hung thick and humid in the small town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, where Eleanor had spent her entire life. Usually, the sweet scent of honeysuckle from Mrs. Henderson's garden next door wafted through the open window, but today there was only a strange metallic tang. Even the birds seemed unusually quiet.

As Eleanor prepped for her first patient, a shiver ran down her spine. The unease lingered, an ominous premonition that something wasn't right in Oakhaven, something beyond a sticky summer day.
