Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Urgent Care clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Marie "Ellie" Dubois. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the cramped waiting room, where a symphony of coughs and sniffles played out. Ellie, her scrubs damp with sweat and exhaustion, stared at the overflowing triage list, each name a ticking time bomb of potential disaster.

It was 2:00 AM on a Tuesday, and Ellie, already into her third twelve-hour shift this week, felt like she was running on fumes. The small town clinic in rural Montana was perpetually understaffed, leaving her to shoulder the burden of treating everything from broken bones to infected wounds.  Tonight, however, felt different. There was an urgency in the air, a weight that pressed down on Ellie's chest with every cough and groan emanating from the waiting room. Something wasn't right.
