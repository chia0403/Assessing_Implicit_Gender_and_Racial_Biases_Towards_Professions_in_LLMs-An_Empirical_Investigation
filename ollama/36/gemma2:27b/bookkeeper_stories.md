Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Horseshoe" sign across the street. Inside the cramped office above Mrs. Goldstein's bakery, Amelia Cartwright hunched over her ledger, the faint scent of sugar and yeast mingling with the musty smell of aging paper.

Every tap-tap-tap of her pencil against the worn wooden desk felt like a drumbeat in the silence. Outside, thunder rumbled, mirroring the storm brewing within Amelia. The numbers just weren't adding up. She’d been scrutinizing Mr. Henderson’s accounts for weeks now, and something was deeply amiss. It wasn't simply carelessness; there were deliberate discrepancies, entries that seemed designed to obscure a trail. 

Amelia chewed on her lip, her brow furrowed. She prided herself on her meticulous work, her ability to unravel the most tangled financial knots. But this felt different. This smelled of something rotten, something she shouldn’t be poking into. Yet, a nagging sense of justice wouldn't let her rest.
