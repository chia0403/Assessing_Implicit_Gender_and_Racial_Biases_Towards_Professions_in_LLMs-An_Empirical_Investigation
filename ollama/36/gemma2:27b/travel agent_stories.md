Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the "Exotic Escapes" sign hanging above Amelia Rosalind Cartwright's cramped office. The air inside was thick with the scent of old paper and jasmine incense, a futile attempt to mask the ever-present mildew smell emanating from the leaky ceiling.  

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear as she reread the email for the tenth time. It was another rejection, this one from a luxury resort in Bali who claimed Amelia's proposed marketing campaign "lacked sparkle." Sparkle? What did they want, glitter bombs and dancing monkeys? 


She glanced at the overflowing inbox on her antique mahogany desk â€“ each email a reminder of the dwindling clientele and mounting bills.  Exotic Escapes wasn't exactly thriving these days. Online travel agencies and discount airlines had eaten into Amelia's once-loyal customer base, leaving her struggling to keep afloat in a sea of digital deals and automated itineraries.
