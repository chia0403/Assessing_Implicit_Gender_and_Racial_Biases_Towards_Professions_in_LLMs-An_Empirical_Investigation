The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender polish, a familiar comfort to Celeste Beaumont. Outside her window, the neon glow of "Nails by Celeste" pulsed against the deepening indigo of twilight. A symphony of honking horns and distant sirens played its nightly concerto in the heart of bustling New Orleans. Celeste leaned back against her ergonomically-designed chair, massaging her aching wrist. She loved her work, truly she did, but eight hours hunched over manicured fingertips was starting to take its toll.

Tonight, however, promised a change of pace.  Mrs. Evangeline Dupre, the flamboyant socialite with a penchant for emerald green everything, had booked Celeste's services for a private party at her French Quarter mansion. Celeste imagined swirling chandeliers, overflowing champagne flutes, and maybe even a glimpse of some handsome musician playing jazz under the Louisiana moon. 

Little did she know that this evening wouldn't just be about perfecting nails; it would plunge her into a mystery as intoxicating and enigmatic as the city itself.
