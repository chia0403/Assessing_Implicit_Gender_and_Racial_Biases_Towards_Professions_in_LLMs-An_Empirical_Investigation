The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber. Sunlight, filtered through grime-coated windows, cast long shadows across the cluttered workbench in Alistair Finch's garage. Tools lay scattered like fallen soldiers – wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers – each a testament to years spent coaxing life back into sputtering engines. Alistair himself, grease smudged on his forehead and calloused hands stained a permanent shade of engine black, grunted as he wrestled with a stubborn carburetor.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind that shimmered with unbearable heat, even in the cramped confines of the garage. The only sound besides Alistair's grunts was the distant whine of cicadas and the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock perched precariously on a stack of tires.  Alistair wasn't sure why his grandmother had insisted on bringing it into the garage when she bequeathed him the place, but its steady pulse somehow kept him company amidst the mechanical chaos.
