Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic drumming in Alistair Blackwood's chest. He hunched over his worn mahogany desk, the only light emanating from a flickering oil lamp casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room.

Alistair Blackwood wasn't your average novelist. His tales weren't spun from whimsical fancies or romantic escapades; they were woven from the darkest recesses of the human psyche, steeped in gothic horror and chilling suspense. He prided himself on his ability to tap into primal fears, to conjure nightmares onto the page that lingered long after the final sentence was read.

But tonight, Alistair wasn't writing. The quill lay abandoned beside a half-empty inkwell, its nib dry and forgotten. Instead, his eyes were fixed on a crumpled letter clutched in his hand, the wax seal broken, revealing words that threatened to unravel everything he held dear.
