The recycled air hummed with a low, constant drone, barely audible over the gentle murmur of conversation and the clinking of ice cubes against plastic. Eleanor Rose Cartwright smoothed down her navy blue skirt, the crisp fabric settling perfectly around her knees. Outside the oval window, the inky darkness punctuated by pinpricks of starlight offered no clue to their altitude or destination. Eleanor was used to this disorientation; it came with the territory of being a flight attendant for Celestial Airlines, an airline renowned for its long-haul flights across the globe.

Tonight's flight from Tokyo to Buenos Aires promised to be a long one, stretching over fifteen hours. As she checked her trolley for any stray cutlery or napkins, Eleanor couldn't help but feel a familiar pang of excitement mixed with exhaustion.  She loved her job â€“ the constant travel, meeting new people, the thrill of soaring above the clouds. But the endless time zones and disrupted sleep patterns took their toll. 

Suddenly, a sharp beep echoed through the cabin, followed by the Captain's calm voice announcing an unexpected turbulence patch. Eleanor braced herself against the galley counter as the plane lurched violently. A wave of nervous murmurs swept through the passengers, punctuated by the occasional shriek. This was going to be a long night.
