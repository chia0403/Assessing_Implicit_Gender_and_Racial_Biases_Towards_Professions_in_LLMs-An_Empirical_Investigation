The scent of crayons and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, a peculiarly comforting blend that always signaled the start of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's day. Outside, the late September sun was struggling to pierce the veil of early morning fog, casting long shadows across the playground of Sunnyside Elementary. Inside Ms. Hawthorneâ€™s third-grade classroom, however, the world was bright and buzzing with energy.

Twenty-seven pairs of eyes, wide with anticipation, were fixed on her as she stood at the head of the class, a mischievous twinkle in her own hazel eyes. Today was "Storytelling Day," an annual tradition Ms. Hawthorne cherished. It wasn't just about reading a book; it was about crafting a world together, letting imaginations soar and fostering a love for language that would hopefully last a lifetime.
