Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Eloise Beaumont's attic studio, blurring the view of the Paris rooftops beyond. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, a counterpoint to the frustrated thump of her brush against the canvas.  Eloise sighed, stepping back from the easel, where an unfinished portrait glared back at her.

It wasnâ€™t the subject matter that troubled her; Madame Dubois, with her sharp cheekbones and steely gaze, had been a fascinating sitter. It was Eloise herself, doubting her own ability to capture the woman's spirit on canvas.  Every brushstroke felt clumsy, a pale imitation of the vibrant personality radiating from Madame Dubois.

Eloise stared at the cityscape beyond the rain-streaked glass, searching for inspiration in the swirling grey clouds and the flickering gas lamps below. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil paint and turpentine, mingling with the faint aroma of woodsmoke drifting up from the street.  Perhaps a change of scenery was what she needed.
