The flickering fluorescent lights of the Save-Rite grocery store buzzed incessantly above Eloise Clementine Bellweather's head, casting an anemic glow over the aisles stacked high with discounted cereal and dented cans of soup.  Eloise, perched on her stool like a bored sparrow, idly tapped her acrylic nails against the worn laminate countertop.

She sighed, the sound swallowed by the ceaseless hum of refrigerators and the muffled chatter of shoppers browsing for bargains. Monday night at Save-Rite was usually a slow affair, punctuated only by the occasional harried parent grabbing milk and bread or an elderly gentleman meticulously examining every coupon in his tattered wallet. Tonight, however, felt even slower than usual, the silence thick enough to choke on.

Eloise idly picked at a loose thread on her uniform apron, dreaming of escaping this fluorescent purgatory. Maybe she'd finally enroll in that pottery class she'd been eyeing, or dust off her old guitar and try writing some songs again. Anything but scan another can of Spam and plaster on her perfunctory "Have a nice day!"
