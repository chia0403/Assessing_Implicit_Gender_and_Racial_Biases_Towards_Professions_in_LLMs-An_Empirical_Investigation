The insistent clanging of the vintage brass bell echoed through the opulent lobby, shattering the serene hum of hushed conversation and tinkling piano keys. Elodie Beaumont, resplendent in her crimson uniform with its intricate gold embroidery, looked up from her meticulously organized desk. A slight crease formed between her perfectly arched eyebrows as she noted the impatience etched on the face of the newcomer.

Elodie worked at The Grand Sinclair, a historic hotel nestled amongst the cobblestone streets and whispering gaslamps of Edinburgh's Old Town. For decades, it had been a haven for the wealthy and influential, its grand rooms echoing with the whispers of forgotten scandals and triumphs. Elodie, despite her youth, was already considered an institution herself â€“ her encyclopedic knowledge of the city and unwavering dedication to her guests legendary within its hallowed halls. 

But today felt different. The newcomer wasn't just impatient; there was a palpable desperation in his eyes, a sense of urgency that prickled Elodie's intuition. As he strode towards her, his footsteps heavy on the plush carpet, she couldn't shake the feeling that this encounter wouldn't be like any other.
