Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eloise Hawthorne's office, mimicking the relentless anxiety churning in her gut. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over stacks of case files piled precariously on her desk. Outside, the city throbbed with a damp, frenetic energy, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation that permeated Eloise's world.  

She was responsible for twenty-five souls, all teetering on the precipice between redemption and relapse. Their names were etched onto those files: Jimmy "Fingers" Esposito, struggling with heroin addiction; Maria Sanchez, desperate to escape her abusive ex; Anthony "Tony Two Times" Russo, a career thief trying to go straight. Each one carried their own burden of guilt, fear, and hope.

Eloise was supposed to be their guide, their lifeline back to society. But tonight, as the rain hammered down and the city lights blurred beyond the windowpane, she felt like she was drowning alongside them.
