Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne’s office, mimicking the tempest brewing within his own mind. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and regret, both emanating from him. He stared out at the swirling grey sky, the neon sign of the all-night diner across the street flickering like a dying firefly. Usually, he found solace in the city’s nocturnal symphony - the honking horns, rumbling buses, distant sirens - but tonight, even the familiar cacophony grated on his nerves.

He had just finished a particularly harrowing session with a new patient, a young woman named Lily whose fragmented memories hinted at a childhood marred by unspeakable horrors. Her eyes, wide and haunted, reflected the abyss she carried within. Elias felt a pang of empathy so profound it bordered on physical pain. He was drawn to these broken souls, desperate to piece them back together, yet he knew the limitations of his own healing touch.
