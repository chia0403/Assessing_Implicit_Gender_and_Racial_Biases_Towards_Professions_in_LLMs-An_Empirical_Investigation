The insistent beep of the heart monitor sliced through Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's sleep like a rusty knife. Groaning, she fumbled for her phone, squinting at the harsh light of 3:17 AM. Another night shift at Mercy General, another symphony of beeping machines and rustling gowns.  She pushed herself out of bed, already feeling the familiar ache in her lower back.

Outside her tiny apartment window, the city lights blurred through a thin veil of pre-dawn rain. Eleanor could almost taste the metallic tang of it on her tongue. 

Tonight's assignment was the cardiac unit - a whirlwind of anxious families, critical patients, and the ever-present pressure to keep everyone alive. She took a deep breath, steeled herself against the fatigue that threatened to consume her, and pulled on her scrubs.  Another day, another life saved, she hoped.
