Inside, steam rose from mugs of lukewarm coffee and the air hung thick with the scent of frying bacon and desperation. Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, her voice rough as gravel from too many late nights and cheap whiskey, took a shaky breath and tightened her grip on the microphone.

Ellie could practically taste success - a record deal, sold-out stadiums, her name in lights. But first, she had to win over this notoriously hard-to-please man with her voice and soul laid bare on this tiny, sticky stage.
