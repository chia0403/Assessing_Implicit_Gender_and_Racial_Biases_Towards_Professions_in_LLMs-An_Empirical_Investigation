Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the autumnal hues outside into an impressionistic smear of grey and orange. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright, OT, adjusted her spectacles and peered at the assessment sheet in front of her. The file belonged to Mr. Elias Thornton, a retired carpenter who had suffered a stroke three weeks prior. His left side was paralyzed, his spirit as bruised as his body. 

Amelia sighed, a familiar ache settling in her chest. Helping people regain their independence after life-altering events was her calling, but it was a calling filled with both immense joy and heartbreaking challenges. Elias's case felt particularly daunting; the man had retreated into himself, refusing to engage with therapy or even acknowledge his new reality. 


Today, Amelia hoped to break through that wall of resistance. She straightened her floral-patterned cardigan, took a deep breath, and stepped into Eliasâ€™s room.
