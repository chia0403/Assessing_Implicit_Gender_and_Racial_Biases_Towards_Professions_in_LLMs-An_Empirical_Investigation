The salty tang of the Pacific Ocean hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of eucalyptus from the grove bordering Elara Reyes's small clinic. Sunlight slanted through the open window, illuminating dust motes dancing above the worn wooden floor. Elara herself, her dark hair pulled back in a loose braid, stretched languidly, her fingers reaching for the ceiling as she popped the kink out of her shoulder. Years of working with injured athletes had given her shoulders a tendency to seize up.

The bell above the door tinkled, pulling her from her reverie. A young woman, her face drawn and pale, hesitantly entered the clinic. Elara rose, a warm smile spreading across her face. "Welcome," she greeted, her voice gentle yet firm. "You must be Maya? I'm Elara."


This is just the beginning.  What happens next is up to you!  Will Maya be recovering from a sports injury? Something more serious? What challenges will Elara face in helping her patient heal?
