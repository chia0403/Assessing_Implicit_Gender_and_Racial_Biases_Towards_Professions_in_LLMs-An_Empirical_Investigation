Rain lashed against the window of Archibald Finnian's cramped office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the neon glow of "Finnian's Finest Insurance" flickered precariously, mirroring the flickering hope Archibald clung to.  He was staring at a stack of overdue notices, each one a paper tombstone marking another failed attempt at selling policies. His once-proud mahogany desk now resembled a battlefield strewn with crumpled rejection letters. 

The bell above the door chimed, shattering the silence. A figure emerged from the swirling grey mist outside, silhouetted against the neon sign. Archibald straightened his tie, hoping this wasn't another soul come to collect on his mounting debts. He forced a smile onto his face, bracing himself for whatever fate had blown through his door.
