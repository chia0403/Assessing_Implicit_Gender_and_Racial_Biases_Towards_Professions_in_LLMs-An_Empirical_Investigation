The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of salt and decaying seaweed. A chorus of cicadas thrummed in the mangroves behind Elias "Eli" Santiago's ramshackle workshop, their incessant buzzing providing an unwelcome counterpoint to the static hissing from his ancient radio receiver. Eli, sweat plastering his greying hair to his forehead, twisted a knob on the receiver with calloused fingers. 

His workshop was perched precariously on stilts above the murky water of Tortuga Bay, a forgotten sliver of coastline in the Dominican Republic. Rusted tools and spare parts cluttered every surface, a testament to Eli's lifelong love affair with the magic of radio waves. He’d spent decades coaxing signals from the ether, connecting this isolated community to the outside world, one crackling transmission at a time. 

But today, something was wrong. The usual symphony of voices - fishermen calling in their catches, merchants hawking their wares, gossiping aunts sharing local news - were replaced by an unsettling silence.  Eli’s gut twisted with apprehension.  This wasn't just a faulty antenna; something felt fundamentally off.
