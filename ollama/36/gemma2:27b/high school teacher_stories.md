The bell shrieked, a metallic banshee signaling the end of another soul-crushing class. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, pushing away from her desk and wincing as her chair legs scraped against the linoleum floor. The stale air of Room 207 hung heavy, thick with the scent of chalk dust, adolescent angst, and faintly, burnt popcorn – a remnant of yesterday’s disastrous chemistry experiment.

Amelia surveyed the wreckage: crumpled worksheets scattered like fallen leaves, half-eaten lunches abandoned on desks, and teenagers already shuffling towards the exit like lemmings drawn to the sea. She was tempted to join them, to escape the fluorescent prison and lose herself in the anonymity of the bustling school hallway. But a stack of ungraded essays glared accusingly from her desk, their unfinished sentences whispering demands for her attention.

She was Amelia Rose Hawthorne, English teacher extraordinaire, or so she'd hoped when she first accepted this job at Northwood High.  But lately, the "extraordinaire" part felt like a cruel joke. The spark had dimmed, replaced by a weary resignation that settled in her bones like a cold draft. 

Today, however, something was different. A single envelope sat on her desk, tucked amidst the chaos of papers and textbooks. It bore no return address, only her name scrawled across the front in elegant, spidery handwriting. Curiosity piqued, Amelia reached for it, feeling a flicker of anticipation she hadn't felt in months.
