Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Eleanor Beatrice Winthrop's small office, mimicking the frantic drumming in her chest. The deadline for filing taxes was looming, a monstrous beast with gnashing teeth and fiery breath.  Eleanor, perched on a wobbly stool behind her cluttered desk, frantically shuffled through stacks of receipts, W-2s, and crumpled napkins scrawled with cryptic expense deductions.

Her office, nestled above a bustling bakery in the heart of Portland, Oregon, was a sanctuary of organized chaos. Stacks of files towered precariously beside overflowing filing cabinets, each one a testament to her clients' varied financial lives. The aroma of cinnamon and yeast wafted up from the bakery below, a tantalizing contrast to the metallic tang of anxiety that hung heavy in the air. 

Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising tide of panic. She had always loved numbers, their precise logic and elegant order. But this time of year, with deadlines breathing down her neck and clients bombarding her with last-minute requests, even the most comforting equations seemed to mock her with their unwavering certainty.
