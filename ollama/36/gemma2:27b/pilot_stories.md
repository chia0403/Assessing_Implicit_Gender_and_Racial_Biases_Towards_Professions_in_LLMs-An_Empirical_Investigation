The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, the scent of salt and diesel mingling in Amelia "Ace" Callahan's nostrils. She squinted at the horizon, where the fiery orb of the sun was sinking into the endless expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The sky above was awash in shades of orange and purple, a breathtaking backdrop to the battered Cessna 172 she was piloting.

Ace ran a calloused hand over the worn leather of the control yoke, her knuckles white with tension. Below her, the turquoise waters churned and frothed against jagged black volcanic rocks, marking the treacherous coastline of Isla Perdida â€“ Lost Island, they called it.  Legend said it was a haven for pirates centuries ago, their buried treasure still waiting to be unearthed.

But Ace wasn't interested in gold or jewels. She was on a mission far more personal: to find her missing father, a renowned archaeologist who vanished without a trace six months ago while investigating ancient ruins on the island.
