The air hung thick with the scent of salt and decay in the bustling fish market of Galena Bay. Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries competing with the boisterous haggling of vendors and the rhythmic clanging of metal against wood as crates were emptied and sorted. Sunlight glinted off the oily scales of fresh catches – plump cod, glistening salmon, even the occasional elusive lobster, its claws snapping in defiance. 

Amidst this chaotic symphony, Amelia Rose Sterling, a reporter for the Galena Gazette with eyes the color of storm-tossed seas and a spirit as fiery as a harbor bonfire, maneuvered through the throngs, her notepad clutched tightly in one hand. The rhythmic slap of waves against the pier was a constant backdrop to the day’s unfolding drama – a drama that Amelia hoped would be more than just another mundane market day story.  She had heard whispers, rumors swirling like the sea spray itself, about something strange happening beneath the surface of Galena Bay.
