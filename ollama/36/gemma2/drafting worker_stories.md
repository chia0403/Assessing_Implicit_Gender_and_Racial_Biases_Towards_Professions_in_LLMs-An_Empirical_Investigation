The air in the drafting room hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and graphite.  A faint hum resonated from the large drafting table that dominated the center of the space, its surface scarred with the countless lines drawn by generations of engineers. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Beatrice Thorne’s focused brow. She hunched over her drawing board, a tangle of metallic blue and crimson lines emerging beneath her precise strokes.  

Amelia wasn't just sketching; she was crafting dreams. Dreams of soaring bridges, intricate machinery, and structures that pierced the clouds. But for now, her focus lay on the mundane task before her: revising blueprints for a new ventilation system for the city’s aging power plant. A necessary project, no doubt, but hardly the kind of work that ignited Amelia's imagination. She yearned to design something truly revolutionary, something that would leave its mark on the world.  

Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with life – a symphony of car horns, construction sounds, and distant laughter. Yet, within the drafting room, time seemed to stand still, measured only by the scratch of Amelia's pencil against paper.
