The rhythmic hiss of the oxygen tank was the only sound breaking the silence of the ambulance.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon signs of Chicago into streaks of color. Inside, Emilia "Em" Harper, an EMT with years etched onto her face and empathy in her eyes, held a blood pressure cuff tight around the wrist of a young woman slumped unconscious in the back. 

The siren wailed, cutting through the downpour like a wounded beast. Em glanced at her partner, Jake, his brow furrowed as he scanned their patient's vitals. "Pulse is weak," he muttered, "and she's losing heat fast."

Em felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach. This wasn't unusual for them - the city was a melting pot of chaos and fragility, both beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. But every call had the potential to be their last, a reminder that time was a precious commodity they couldn't afford to waste.
