The air in Mr. Hemmingsworth's office hung heavy with the scent of old paper and disappointment.  Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick, his long-suffering secretary for the past ten years, sighed and tapped her neatly manicured nails against the mahogany desk.  A stray curl had escaped her perfectly coiffed bun and lay limply across her forehead. She glanced at the clock: 3:57 PM. Mr. Hemmingsworth was late again.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the tall windows of the office, bathing the plush carpet in a dusty orange glow.  Framed prints of forgotten battles lined the walls, interspersed with certificates commemorating Mr. Hemmingsworth's various (and often questionable) business ventures.  A half-empty bottle of sherry sat forlornly on the desk, testament to another afternoon spent grappling with financial woes. Eleanor smoothed her crisp white blouse and adjusted the pearl necklace that was her only indulgence. It was time for another round of damage control.
