The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Montgomery's head like a chorus of anxious bees. Dust motes danced in their sickly yellow glow, mirroring the nervous energy buzzing in her own chest. The bell had just shrieked its dismissal for the afternoon, and her small office at Northwood High was already filling with the cacophony of teenage angst: slammed lockers, whispered gossip, and the occasional strangled sigh.  

Eleanor, however, was immune to the symphony of adolescence. Years spent mediating teenage drama and navigating the choppy waters of parental expectations had dulled her senses to most of it. She sat behind her desk, a mountain of meticulously color-coded files before her, sipping lukewarm coffee and awaiting her next appointment â€“ a sixteen-year-old named Liam Parker who had mysteriously stopped attending his classes. He was the last name on her list for the day, and Eleanor knew, with a sinking feeling, that he would be the most challenging.  


The setting: Northwood High, a sprawling brick building in a quiet suburb just outside the bustling metropolis of Baltimore. It's a school where everyone knows everyone, or at least pretends to.
