The air hung heavy with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar perfume to Elara Beatrice Finch. Her tiny studio, tucked away in a cobbled alley behind the bustling market square of Prague, was her sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylight, illuminating swirling motes of dust and catching the vibrant colours on her canvas. A half-finished portrait stared back at her: a young woman with fiery red hair and eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of a thousand stories. 

Elara paused, her brush poised above the canvas. The woman in the portrait was beautiful, but there was a sadness in those eyes that Elara couldn't quite capture. It wasn't just the melancholy cast by the setting sun filtering through the window; it was something deeper, a hidden longing that tugged at Elara's own soul.  

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled her. She turned, startled, leaving the portrait unfinished for another day. Prague pulsed with life outside her studio walls, but in this moment, the only sound she heard was the insistent rapping and her own quickening heartbeat.
