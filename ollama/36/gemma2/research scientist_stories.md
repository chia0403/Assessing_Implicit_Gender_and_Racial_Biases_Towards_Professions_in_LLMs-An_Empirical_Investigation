The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab hummed with a low, almost imperceptible buzz – the sound of a thousand tiny calculations being performed simultaneously.  Around her, holographic projections danced, displaying complex equations and swirling galaxies of data. Her office, tucked away on the third floor of the Stellar Cartography Institute, was less sterile than other labs she’d worked in. Bookshelves overflowed with novels about space exploration and theoretical physics, their spines worn from countless rereadings. A framed picture of Earth, captured by a probe orbiting in the Kuiper belt, sat on her desk – a constant reminder of the universe she dedicated her life to understanding.

But tonight, Eleanor wasn't focused on distant stars or pulsating quasars. Tonight, her attention was consumed by a single, tantalizing anomaly: a ripple in spacetime detected near Proxima Centauri b, a planet orbiting our closest stellar neighbour. 


It wasn't just any ripple; it pulsed with an unnatural regularity, like a heartbeat echoing through the fabric of reality itself. The implications were staggering. Could this be evidence of advanced alien technology? A natural phenomenon beyond our current understanding? Or something else entirely?  As Eleanor stared at the pulsating waveform on her screen, a shiver ran down her spine. Whatever it was, she knew in her gut that this discovery would change everything.
