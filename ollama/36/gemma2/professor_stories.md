The stale scent of chalk dust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of old parchment and forgotten dreams. Professor Amelia Rose Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping over the rows of empty desks in her Victorian-era lecture hall. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the bustling metropolis of Newhaven hummed with life, but within these hallowed halls, time seemed to move at a different pace, a slower, more contemplative rhythm. Amelia sighed, her breath misting in the chilly air. Another Tuesday morning, another lecture hall filled with vacant stares, and yet another soul yearning for something more than the dusty confines of academia.  She tapped her pen against the podium, its metallic click echoing through the silence, a stark contrast to the gentle whisper of turning pages she longed to hear. 


Today was different though. Today, Amelia had a hunch. A feeling, as sharp and sudden as a lightning strike, that this lecture on ancient Celtic mythology would be unlike any other.  Perhaps it was the way the ravens croaked outside her window, their raucous calls mimicking the restless energy she felt within herself. Or maybe it was the dream she'd had the night before, vivid and unsettling, filled with swirling mists and whispered prophecies. Whatever the reason, Amelia knew in her bones that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
