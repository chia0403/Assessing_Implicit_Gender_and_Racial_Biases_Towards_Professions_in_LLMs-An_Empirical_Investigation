The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and cheap bourbon in The Rusty Anchor, a dive bar nestled on the edge of the forgotten docks. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign that flickered "Drinks - Always Cheap". 

Behind the worn mahogany counter stood Silas Blackwood, his hands deftly shaking a margarita for a woman with tired eyes and red lipstick smeared across her teeth. He knew her story â€“ another love gone sour, another Friday night trying to drown the ache in amber liquid. Silas, with his silver salt-and-pepper beard and permanent frown etched into his face, was an expert at reading stories written on weary faces, their pain mingling with the clinking of glasses and the hum of hushed conversations. He was The Rusty Anchor's guardian, its silent confidant, the man who knew more secrets than he ever shared. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Silas glanced up, expecting another lost soul seeking solace in his bar.  Instead, he saw a stranger, tall and broad shouldered, his face obscured by the shadows of a worn fedora. He carried himself with an air of quiet danger, like a wolf stepping into a flock of sheep.
