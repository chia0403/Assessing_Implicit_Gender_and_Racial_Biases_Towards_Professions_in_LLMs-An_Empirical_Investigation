The sun was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dew-kissed grass of Sanctuary Ridge. The air was crisp with the scent of pine and damp earth, a symphony of bird song already filling the pre-dawn stillness. Amelia "Amy" Juniper, her red hair peeking out from beneath a worn baseball cap, surveyed the sprawling animal sanctuary from her perch atop the hay bales in the barn. She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar comfort of her work. 

Sanctuary Ridge wasn't just a place for rescued animals; it was Amy's lifeblood, a haven she'd built brick by loving brick since inheriting her grandfather's rambling farm five years ago.  Her days were a whirlwind of feeding schedules, mending fences, and administering medication, punctuated by playful nudges from furry residents and the occasional heartfelt bleat of gratitude. 


Today, though, Amy felt a tremor of unease beneath the familiar rhythm. A strange quiet hung in the air, a silence broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant drone of a hummingbird. Something was amiss.
