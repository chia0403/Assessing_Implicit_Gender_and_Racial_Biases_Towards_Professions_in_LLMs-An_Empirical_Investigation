The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax polish as Emilia Beatrice Thistlewick surveyed the dining room. The mahogany table gleamed under the afternoon sun, set for six with gleaming silverware and china that had likely seen the Edwardian era come and go. A single vase of lilies stood sentinel in the center, their fragrance a sweet counterpoint to the faintly dusty air.

Emilia adjusted her starched apron and hummed softly as she carefully placed napkins on each plate. The Blackwood Manor was always pristine – a monument to order and formality, much like its current owner, Lord Frederick Blackwood. He rarely ventured into the common areas himself, preferring his library and the company of dusty tomes over that of living souls.  It left Emilia with an almost monastic existence: cleaning, polishing, preparing meals for the occasional guest (mostly distant relatives she never saw), and tending to the manor's many quirks. Today was no different - a quiet Sunday afternoon punctuated by the ticking of grandfather clocks and the hushed whispers of ancient secrets held within the walls. 


But Emilia sensed something different today. A tension in the air, a faint tremor beneath the usual predictable rhythm. She couldn't quite place it, but she knew, with a certainty that settled like a stone in her stomach, that Lord Blackwood’s solitary existence was about to be irrevocably altered.
