The air in “Mick’s Meats” hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a familiar aroma that clung to Edgar Michaelson’s clothes like a second skin. Outside, rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the neon sign advertising "Premium Cuts" into a hazy pink rectangle. Inside, the butcher's shop was a sanctuary of warmth and muscle-memory routines.  Edgar, his hands calloused and stained crimson from years of wielding cleavers, moved with practiced grace between the rows of chilled carcasses, selecting the prime cuts for Mrs. Petrov’s Sunday roast and snipping succulent sausages for young Timmy down the street. The clatter of knives against bone, the rhythmic thump of a meat mallet, and Edgar's gruff baritone humming along to the radio were the soundtrack to his life – a life he wouldn't trade for anything else.  


But today, a strange chill seeped into the familiar warmth, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the approaching winter storm. A delivery truck hadn't arrived, its driver was unreachable, and the usual butcher's paper wrapping smelled faintly of something…off. Edgar dismissed it as nerves, a glitch in his well-oiled routine. Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss, something sinister lurking beneath the surface of his cozy world.
