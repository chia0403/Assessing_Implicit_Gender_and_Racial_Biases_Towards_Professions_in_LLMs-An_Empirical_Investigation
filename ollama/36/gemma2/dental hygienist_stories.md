The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of gleaming stainless steel instruments. Outside her window, the humid July air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending thunderstorms. But inside the bright, antiseptic world of Dr. Peterson's dental practice, it was always cool and controlled. 

Amelia expertly maneuvered the ultrasonic scaler, its high-pitched whine a familiar soundtrack to her day.  Dr. Peterson, a jovial man with perpetually rosy cheeks, peered over her shoulder, nodding approvingly at the meticulous cleaning of Mrs. Henderson’s molars. It was just another Tuesday morning in Amelia's world – a predictable rhythm of scraping plaque, flossing, and polishing smiles. 

Or so it seemed until a new patient walked in, his eyes shadowed and wary, a duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  His name, the receptionist mumbled, was Elias Thorne. And something about him, something in the way he clutched the worn leather of his bag, made Amelia’s carefully constructed world feel just a little bit less predictable.
