The humid Georgia air clung to Elara "Ellie" Blackwood like a second skin as she wrestled with a tangle of exposed wiring in Mrs. Henderson's attic. Dust motes danced in the single bare bulb dangling precariously overhead, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered space. Ellie swore under her breath, tugging at the frayed wires that had become hopelessly knotted in their descent from the old fuse box.

"Dang it," she muttered, wiping sweat from her brow with a grime-streaked forearm. "Why did they think burying these cables in insulation was a good idea?" 

Ellie wasn't new to the quirks of older homes – this charming Victorian house was just another day at the office for her. But even after five years as an electrician, there were moments that made her wonder if she had inherited the wiring gremlins from generations past.  Mrs. Henderson needed her power back on before nightfall. The storm rolling in promised a deluge of rain and wouldn't be kind to the old house without its protection. Ellie, however, wasn't about to let a little weather – or a stubborn circuit – stop her. 


The attic was filled with the scent of aged cedar and mothballs, a familiar aroma that always seemed to accompany ancient mysteries waiting to be unearthed.  Ellie paused, peering into a darkened corner where shadows danced on forgotten trunks and dusty family heirlooms. A shiver ran down her spine - not from the chill in the air, but from an inexplicable feeling that something was watching her.
