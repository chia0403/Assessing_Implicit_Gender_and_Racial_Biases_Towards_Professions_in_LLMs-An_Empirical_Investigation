The air in the cramped exam room hung thick with antiseptic and worry.  Amelia "Amy" Harper, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun that betrayed a tension she desperately tried to hide, tapped her pen against the worn vinyl of the patient table. The woman before her, Mrs. Eleanor Peterson, clutched a faded handkerchief to her chest, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

Amy felt the familiar prickle of helplessness –  a sensation she battled constantly in this understaffed clinic nestled on the fringes of the sprawling, decaying industrial town of Rustford, Ohio. The clinic itself was a testament to years of neglect: peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights casting long shadows across chipped linoleum floors, and an air conditioning unit that wheezed more than it cooled. It wasn't much, but it was all that stood between this community and complete healthcare destitution. 

"Mrs. Peterson," Amy began, her voice as soothing as she could manage, "Tell me about the pain."  But even as the words left her lips, she knew it wouldn't be easy. Rustford wasn’t known for sharing its woes.  Its residents, hardened by generations of hardship, wore their pain like a shield – impenetrable and deeply guarded. 


Amy had to get through that shield. Mrs. Peterson needed help, and Amy was all that stood between her and whatever darkness lurked beneath the surface of this town's quiet despair.
