The humid air hung thick in the lobby of The Grand Magnolia, clinging to Bartholomew “Barty” Featherstone’s damp linen uniform like a second skin. Sweat prickled at his temples as he wrestled with the heavy luggage trolley, its rusty wheels groaning against the polished marble floor. It was the kind of July afternoon that melted even the sturdiest willpower, and Barty felt his own simmering beneath the collar of his crisp white shirt. 

The Grand Magnolia, a relic of Belle Époque opulence, sprawled before him in all its dusty grandeur. Sunlight slanted through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the faded velvet armchairs and antique chandeliers that hung like glittering promises from the high ceiling. Once, this lobby had pulsed with the laughter of wealthy patrons, the clinking of champagne glasses, and the hushed murmur of secret conversations. Now, it was a quiet place, steeped in the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams, its grandeur fading like an old photograph left out in the sun.


Barty sighed, his gaze lingering on the faded tapestry depicting a scene from a bygone era - a grand ball, swirling with dancers under the watchful eye of angels. He longed for those days, when The Grand Magnolia had been more than just a shell of its former self.  But Barty, like the hotel itself, was stuck in a perpetual state of quiet decline, forever caught between past glory and uncertain future.
