The air hung thick with the scent of garlic and desperation. Eliza Beatrice Cartwright wiped down a sticky table, her face taut, a familiar knot forming in her stomach. The Friday night rush at "Luigi's Little Italy" was always like this - chaotic, loud, and exhausting. 

Eliza preferred the quiet hum of lunchtime, the regulars' predictable orders and friendly banter. But now, it was all about speed, efficiency, and keeping the bottomless bread basket full enough to appease the ravenous horde that flooded in every Friday night. The neon lights reflecting off her tired eyes painted a distorted reality â€“ she wasn't just serving food; she was navigating a battlefield of clinking glasses, spilled red wine, and competing conversations vying for attention. 


Eliza took a deep breath, trying to ignore the throbbing headache building behind her eyes.  She grabbed a fresh order pad, ready to brace herself for another night of serving smiles with the side of burnt garlic knots and lukewarm coffee. This job wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills, and tonight, that was all that mattered.
