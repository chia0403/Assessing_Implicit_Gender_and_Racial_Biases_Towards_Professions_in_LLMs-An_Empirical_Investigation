The morning mist clung to Elias Thorne's beard like a wisp of lost dreams.  He stood on his porch, watching the sun bleed orange onto the horizon, painting the vast cornfields surrounding his farmhouse in shades of amber and crimson. The air was thick with the earthy scent of damp soil and the promise of another long day. Elias, calloused hands clenched around a steaming mug of coffee, took a deep breath. The rhythm of farm life was ingrained in him, a steady beat that echoed through every fiber of his being. Each sunrise brought a fresh set of challenges, each sunset a bittersweet reward for the labor he poured into the land. But today, Elias felt a gnawing unease, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that whispered of something out of place in their idyllic world. 


The Thorne farm, nestled deep within the rolling hills of southern Vermont, had been in his family for generations. Rows upon rows of corn stretched as far as the eye could see, interrupted only by the occasional barn or silo standing sentinel against the ever-changing sky. A weathered sign, barely legible after years exposed to the elements, proclaimed "Thorne Family Farm - Established 1847" above the rusted mailbox.
