The amber glow of the "Open" sign cast long shadows across the cracked linoleum floor of Peterson's Pharmacy. A faint scent of dusty cough syrup hung in the air, mingling with the sterile tang of rubbing alcohol. Behind the counter, Elara Mae Peterson meticulously counted out antihistamines into a plastic vial. Her silver hair was pulled back in a tight bun, emphasizing the fine lines etched around her hazel eyes that held a lifetime of dispensing both medicine and advice.

Elara had seen this small town, Willow Creek, through thick and thin â€“ from booming harvests to devastating droughts, births and deaths, joys and sorrows. She knew everyone who walked through those faded red doors, their ailments as familiar as the worn spines of the medical textbooks lining her shelves.  But tonight, something felt different. A restlessness hung in the air, a whisper of change that ruffled the edges of Elara's usually calm world.  


As the bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of another customer, Elara braced herself for whatever Willow Creek had in store next.
