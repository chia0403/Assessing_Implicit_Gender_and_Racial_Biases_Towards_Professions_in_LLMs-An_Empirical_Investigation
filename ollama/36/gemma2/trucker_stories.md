He’d made this route a hundred times before, but something felt different this time. A restlessness stirred within him, a yearning for something beyond the familiar rhythm of the road.

The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and fried food, punctuated by the mournful wail of a distant train whistle. He stepped out of his cab, stretching stiff muscles that had been cramped for hours behind the wheel.
