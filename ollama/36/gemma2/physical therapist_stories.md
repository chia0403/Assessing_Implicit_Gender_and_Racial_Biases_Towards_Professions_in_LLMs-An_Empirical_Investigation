Rain hammered against the windows of Amelia Harper's office, blurring the vibrant cityscape beyond. The rhythmic drumming echoed the anxious tapping of her foot as she waited for Mrs. Evelyn Reed to arrive.  Amelia had been treating Mrs. Reed for a month, helping her regain strength and mobility after a debilitating stroke. She knew Evelyn was nervous about today’s appointment – her first visit outside the sterile walls of the clinic since the accident. 

The door opened, admitting a gust of wind and a frail figure wrapped in a bright red coat. Mrs. Reed, her face etched with worry, shuffled in, relying heavily on Amelia's provided walker for support. Her eyes scanned the room, landing briefly on the familiar faces – the young couple holding hands in the corner, the elderly man diligently reading a newspaper – before returning to Amelia’s warm, reassuring smile.


“Ready for your first outing outside the clinic, Evelyn?” Amelia asked gently, her voice calm and encouraging amidst the storm raging outside.
