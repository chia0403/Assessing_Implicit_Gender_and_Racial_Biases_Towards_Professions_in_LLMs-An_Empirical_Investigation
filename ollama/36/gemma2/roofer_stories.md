The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bark" Malone's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his brow, dripping into his eyes as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn slate shingle.  His calloused fingers traced the moss-covered valley of the old Victorian, its intricate gingerbread trim barely visible beneath decades of grime and neglect. Bark had worked on this building before, patching up leaks during the worst storms the city had seen in years. This time, it was different. A new family had bought the house, their bright laughter echoing through the once-silent halls. They wanted to restore it to its former glory, a dream that came with a hefty price tag - and plenty of hard work for men like Bark. 

The setting was Baltimore in the summer of 1978. The air hung heavy with humidity, the scent of freshly cut grass mingling with the exhaust fumes from the passing cars below. A symphony of clanging hammers, chirping cicadas, and distant sirens filled the urban soundscape.  Bark leaned back against the chimney, his weathered face shaded by a worn straw hat. He scanned the sprawling city from this vantage point, its brick facades bathed in the golden afternoon light. Somewhere down there, beneath the tapestry of streets and rooftops, lay his small, cluttered apartment. A simple haven he retreated to after long days like this, where the only sounds were the hum of the refrigerator and the distant rumble of a television set. 


This was Bark's world â€“ a patchwork of sky, brick, and steel, where stories unfolded on every rooftop and in every eavesdropping chimney. And today, as the sun began its slow descent towards the horizon, a new story was about to begin.
