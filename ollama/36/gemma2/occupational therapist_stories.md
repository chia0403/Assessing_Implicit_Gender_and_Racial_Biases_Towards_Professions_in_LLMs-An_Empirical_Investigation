The stale scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer, a familiar fragrance to Amelia Rose Hawthorne as she stepped into Mrs. Peterson’s sunroom. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the mismatched furniture. Outside, the wind rattled the leaves of the ancient oak that shaded the house, its branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards the late summer sky.

Amelia surveyed the room – a cluttered tapestry of forgotten hobbies and half-finished projects. A loom stood silent in one corner, its threads draped limply across the frame.  A collection of colorful yarn lay scattered on the floor beside an unfinished knitting project. On the table sat a worn chessboard, pieces frozen mid-game. 

Mrs. Peterson, frail yet determined, gripped her walker tightly as she watched Amelia enter, her gaze fixed on the therapist’s every movement with a quiet intensity.  This was Amelia's third visit since Mrs. Peterson had suffered a stroke, and the occupational therapist felt a familiar pang of sympathy for the woman who once thrived in this sun-drenched haven, now relegated to its periphery.


Amelia smiled warmly. "Good morning, Mrs. Peterson," she greeted, her voice carrying a reassuring lilt.  "Ready for our session?"
