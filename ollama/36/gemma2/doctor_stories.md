The flickering neon sign outside "Dr. Elara Vance: General Practitioner" cast an eerie green glow across the deserted street. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the city lights into streaks of colour. Inside, Dr. Elara Vance, her blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously cleaned surgical instruments. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and exhaustion.  Elara glanced at the clock – 2:37 AM. This wasn't how she'd envisioned her Tuesday night. She’d promised herself no more late shifts after the last month’s string of emergencies, but then Mr. Henderson had called, pleading for help. He was a regular, sweet old man with a heart condition, and Elara couldn't bear to see him suffer alone in the middle of the storm. 

Elara sighed, wiping down the handle of a scalpel. The rain drummed against the roof like an insistent beat, mirroring the anxious thrumming in her chest. This city never slept, especially not on nights like this.
