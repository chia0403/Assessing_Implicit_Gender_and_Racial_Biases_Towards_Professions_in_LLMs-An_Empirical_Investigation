Rain lashed against Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's trench coat, turning the already slick streets of New Orleans into a mirror reflecting the city's neon glow.  A symphony of jazz drifted from open doorways, battling for dominance with the guttural roar of passing buses and the ceaseless hum of generators struggling to keep the French Quarter alive after the latest storm knocked out the power grid. 

Izzy hated working in the rain. It soaked into everything, turning her uniform heavy and clammy, and obscuring the already hazy line between the grime of the city and the bloodstains she wished were absent from her world. But this wasn't just another routine night shift.  A whisper had reached her ears, a rumour swirling through the underbelly of the Quarter: a disappearance, a body, something dark hidden beneath the glitz and glamour of Mardi Gras season. And Izzy, with a hunger for justice as deep-seated as her love for beignets, was determined to uncover it.
