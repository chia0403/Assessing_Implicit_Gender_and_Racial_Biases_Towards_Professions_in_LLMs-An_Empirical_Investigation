The stale air of the editorial office hung thick with the smell of lukewarm coffee and desperation.  Papers spilled from overflowing in-trays, littering Eleanor Amelia Vance's desk like fallen leaves. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over everything, even the normally vibrant scarlet of her favourite vintage typewriter. 

Eleanor, a woman who usually approached deadlines with the calm precision of a surgeon, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. It was two weeks before their biggest release - a collection of short stories by an acclaimed, but notoriously difficult, author named Jasper Thorne. And Eleanor, their youngest editor and the only one willing to take on Thorne's notorious temperamental outbursts, had just received his latest critique: "The prose is as lifeless as a week-old croissant." 

Eleanor sighed, pushing back her thick auburn hair from her eyes. She knew this would be tough.  Thorne demanded perfection, but his definition often bordered on the absurd. This was going to be a long two weeks.  


**Setting:** The cramped and chaotic editorial office of a small publishing house in Manhattan, New York.
