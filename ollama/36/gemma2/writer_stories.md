The aroma of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, mingling with the scent of dust and aging paper that permeated Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s cramped apartment.

The deadline for her latest novel loomed, a menacing shadow casting its chill over every waking moment. 


The rain intensified, mirroring the storm brewing within Amelia.  Could she overcome this creative block, or would she be swallowed whole by the darkness?
