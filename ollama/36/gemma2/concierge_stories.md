The air in The Grand Bellagio was thick with the scent of jasmine and old money. It clung to everything, from the polished marble floors to the velvet ropes cordoning off the opulent lobby. Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Beaumont,  concierge extraordinaire, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. A lone piano player tinkled out a forgotten waltz in the corner, its melody barely audible over the hushed murmurs of guests and the clinking of champagne glasses. 

Ellie adjusted the pearl necklace that was always more costume jewelry than heirloom, a memento from a time when she'd dreamt of grander things. Now, she was tethered to this gilded cage, trading dreams for perfectly pressed napkins and flawlessly executed requests. At least tonight promised something different. A guest had arrived â€“ a woman shrouded in mystery, her face obscured by the wide brim of a hat and her voice as smooth as honeyed cognac. She'd requested a room with "a view that whispers secrets" and a bottle of something "to drown out the echoes of yesterday."  Ellie knew this was no ordinary guest. 


 This was her chance to rewrite her own story, one whispered request at a time.
