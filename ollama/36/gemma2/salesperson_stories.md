Her monthly quota loomed like a ravenous beast, and Amelia needed a miracle - something unique, something desirable, something that would make customers forget their dwindling bank accounts and unleash their inner bargain hunter.  She adjusted her signature red lipstick, a splash of color against the bleak backdrop, and plunged deeper into the labyrinthine aisles.
