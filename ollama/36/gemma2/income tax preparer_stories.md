The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Pennell's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stacks of crumpled receipts and W-2 forms that threatened to engulf her desk. A faint aroma of stale coffee hung in the air, mingling with the scent of desperation – a potent perfume she knew all too well this time of year. Her cramped office, wedged between a laundromat and a vape shop on Elm Street, was a chaotic symphony of whirring printers, ringing phones, and Bea's own rapid-fire keyboard clacking as she wrestled with last-minute tax returns. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows and mirroring the storm brewing inside Bea’s head. It was Tax Day Eve, and her phone wouldn't stop ringing. 


Bea sighed, running a hand through her already disheveled bun. She knew every one of those frantic voices calling for help with their taxes – single mothers scrambling to avoid penalties, self-employed freelancers drowning in paperwork, and the occasional clueless college student who thought an avocado toast receipt constituted a legitimate business expense. It was exhausting, but Bea wouldn't have it any other way. The satisfaction of untangling financial knots and bringing order to chaos was her own personal Everest, one she conquered every April with grit, caffeine, and a surprising amount of empathy.
