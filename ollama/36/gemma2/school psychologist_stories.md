The schoolyard, usually buzzing with activity after lunch, was eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic drumming of raindrops against the windowpane. This unusual stillness made Eleanor's stomach clench. Something felt off.

Beneath its veneer of normalcy lurked a complex web of social hierarchies, academic pressures, and simmering anxieties that often spilled over into the realm of the bizarre. Eleanor had witnessed it all – from petty rivalries to full-blown breakdowns – during her five years at the school.
