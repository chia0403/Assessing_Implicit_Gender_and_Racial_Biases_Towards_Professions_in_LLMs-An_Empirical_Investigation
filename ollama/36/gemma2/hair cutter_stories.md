The humid Florida air hung thick with the scent of chlorine and coconut sunscreen as Eloise "Ellie" Beatrice Carmichael snipped away at the unruly mane before her. She hummed along to the tinny pop song playing on the radio, the rhythm echoing in the steady click-clack of her shears. Ellie's barbershop, "The Beachcomber," was a haven for surfers and sun-kissed locals alike. Its faded turquoise walls were adorned with surfboards and vintage beach posters, the worn wooden floor sticky with years of spilled sunscreen and laughter. Outside, the ocean roared, its whitecaps crashing against the shore, a constant backdrop to Ellie's daily symphony of buzzing clippers and whispered secrets.

This wasnâ€™t just another Tuesday morning at The Beachcomber. It was the day a storm, both literal and figurative, was about to break.
