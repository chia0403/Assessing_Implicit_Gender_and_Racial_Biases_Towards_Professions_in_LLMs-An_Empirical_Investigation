The air thrummed with an anxious energy as Amelia Rose Hawthorne prepped for takeoff.  It wasn't unusual for flights to be a little tense; after all, she was responsible for hundreds of strangers' safety and comfort thousands of feet above the earth. But this one felt different. The passengers seemed more on edge than usual, their faces pinched with worry, eyes darting nervously around the cabin. 

Amelia attributed it to the storm raging outside.  They were leaving Chicago – a city that often wore its weather like an ill-fitting coat, unpredictable and capable of sudden shifts from sunshine to tempest in the blink of an eye. This time, the tempest had arrived with a vengeance, lashing the plane with wind and rain as they taxied towards the runway. The announcement crackled over the intercom, a calm voice assuring them that they would take off soon, despite the inclement weather. 

Amelia adjusted her navy blue uniform, smoothing down the crisp white collar. She cast a glance at the reflection in the metal cart she was pushing – a beacon of order amidst the chaos brewing outside.  Her smile, practiced and reassuring, felt strained against the backdrop of the approaching storm. This wasn't just any flight; this was Flight 314 to Los Angeles, and Amelia knew, deep down, that something wasn't right.
