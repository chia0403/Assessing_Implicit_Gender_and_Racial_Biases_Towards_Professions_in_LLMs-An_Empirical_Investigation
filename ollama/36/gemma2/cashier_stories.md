The fluorescent lights hummed above Eliza Amelia Butterfield's head, casting a sterile glow on the aisles of Discount Delights. Her fingers tapped impatiently against the register screen, counting down the seconds until her shift ended. It was 9:47 p.m., and she could practically taste the freedom of a lukewarm pizza and a trashy reality TV show waiting for her at home. She scanned another bag of stale chips – the customers were dwindling, their carts filled with discounted snacks and questionable-looking toiletries – when the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. 


Eliza looked up, expecting to see another weary soul seeking solace in a bargain bin. Instead, she was met with the unexpected: a young man, dressed in a crisp suit that seemed out of place in this dingy haven of discounts. He wasn't carrying any bags or looking at anything in particular, just standing there, observing the scene with an air of detached curiosity.  Eliza felt a shiver run down her spine – something about him felt off, like a misplaced puzzle piece in this familiar, mundane landscape. 


Discount Delights, known for its perpetually sticky floors and questionable selection of canned peaches, was usually the last place anyone would expect to encounter anything out of the ordinary. But tonight, Eliza had a feeling things were about to change.
