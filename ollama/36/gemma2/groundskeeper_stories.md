The mist clung to Bartholomew Quince's boots as he walked, dampening the crisp autumn air that stung his nostrils with the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke. The sun, a pale disc peeking through the swirling grey, barely managed to pierce the gloom that blanketed Oakhaven Manor.  Bartholomew, or Bart as most called him, whistled a tuneless melody as he surveyed his domain. He was Oakhaven's sole groundskeeper, responsible for the sprawling lawns, the meticulously manicured hedges, and the ancient oak trees that whispered secrets in the wind. 

Oakhaven was a stately manor, its gothic facade weathered by time, yet still holding a certain grandeur. The house itself seemed to sigh under the weight of its history, each brick and windowpane hinting at a past filled with forgotten stories and hushed tragedies. Today, however, Bart felt an unsettling presence amidst the familiar stillness. Something was different. A prickling sensation crawled up his spine, a disquiet that he couldn't quite place.  As he rounded the bend towards the rose garden, he saw it â€“ a single crimson rose, blooming in defiance of the season, its petals unfurling in the pale light like a splash of blood on snow. 


This was no ordinary rose. This was a harbinger. Bart knew it with an instinct that had served him well throughout his years tending to Oakhaven's grounds. Something was about to change. And he wasn't sure if it would be for better or worse.
