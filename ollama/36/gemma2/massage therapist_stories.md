The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the incessant hum of traffic outside. Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s cozy studio, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic canvas. Inside, warm amber light cast long shadows across polished wooden floors and the rows of plush massage tables draped in white linen. 

Amelia herself moved with practiced grace, her slender hands kneading a ball of tension out of Mr. Henderson’s tight shoulders. He was a regular, a retired accountant who carried the weight of countless spreadsheets even in his leisure time.  His breath sighed in relief with each gentle push and pull of Amelia's thumbs, a symphony of quiet groans filling the small space.  Outside, the storm raged on, but within these walls, there was only peace. At least for now.
