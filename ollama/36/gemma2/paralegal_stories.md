The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Brighton, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the mountain range of case files on her desk. The air in the office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma that clung to this small firm like a shroud. Outside, the Chicago skyline shimmered under the afternoon sun, a stark contrast to the grey monotony of Amy's reality. She hunched over her computer, the glow of the screen reflecting in her tired hazel eyes. Another day, another stack of paperwork threatening to consume her.  

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, sifting through legal documents, pulling out relevant information, and crafting concise summaries for her supervising attorney, Mr. Davis. He was a man perpetually shrouded in the fog of his own cynicism, with a voice that grated like sandpaper and a gaze that could curdle milk. Amy had learned to anticipate his moods â€“ the sharp, barked instructions when he was impatient, the gruff yet oddly comforting silence when he was deep in thought. She knew she was just another cog in his legal machine, but there was a part of her that yearned for more than this endless cycle of files and deadlines.


Amy longed to be in court, to witness the drama unfold firsthand, to fight for justice with passion and conviction. But for now, she was tethered to her desk, relegated to the shadowy world of legal assistants, forever on the periphery of the courtroom's stage.
