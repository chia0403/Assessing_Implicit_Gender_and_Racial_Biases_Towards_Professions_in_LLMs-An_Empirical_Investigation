The sawdust clung to Elias Blackwood's calloused hands like tiny, pale snowflakes. His workshop, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, hummed with the familiar symphony of hammering and sawing. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the chaotic beauty of his domain: half-finished furniture piled against rough-hewn walls, tools meticulously arranged on shelves crafted by Elias' own hands, and the ever-present scent of cedarwood and varnish hanging heavy in the air. 

Elias ran a hand over the smooth surface of a cherrywood table he was building for Mrs. Hawthorne's new bakery. He loved this stage of his work, the moment before the piece truly came alive.  He could envision the warm glow of lamps illuminating the table as locals gathered around it, sharing stories and laughter over freshly baked bread. 

A sudden knock on the workshop door shattered the peace. Elias paused, wiping the sawdust from his brow. The sound was unfamiliar in this quiet corner of Oakhaven, usually reserved for the rhythmic hammering and the chirping of sparrows outside. A shiver ran down his spine, a premonition that something was about to change.
