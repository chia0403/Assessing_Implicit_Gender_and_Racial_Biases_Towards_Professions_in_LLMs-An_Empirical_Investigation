The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elias Blackwood like a second skin as he stepped out of his beat-up Ford pickup. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing familiar paths through the dust that perpetually coated his face. The office building across the street shimmered in the midday sun, its windows reflecting the endless blue expanse of the sky above. 

Elias sighed, adjusting the worn leather strap of his briefcase. He was late again. Mrs. Henderson, his current client, was a widow with a penchant for precision and an allergy to tardiness. Elias had hoped that selling her the life insurance policy wouldn't be so difficult. She seemed like a nice enough woman, albeit one perpetually on edge. Now, he feared her icy stare would pierce him through his flimsy excuses before he could even utter a word. 

The office itself was a cramped space tucked away in a dusty strip mall on Highway 98. Its faded sign, proclaiming "Blackwood Insurance: Protecting What Matters Most," creaked gently in the breeze.  The paint chipped and peeled around the edges, much like Elias's own optimism after a particularly bad week.


This story opens in a small town somewhere in rural Georgia. The setting is hot, dusty, and somewhat run-down, mirroring Elias Blackwood's own predicament. He's an insurance agent struggling to keep his business afloat, facing financial pressure and personal challenges.
