Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Benny "Bucket" Buckler's van, each drop a tiny hammer blow against his already frayed nerves. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping debris across the deserted street in the heart of Newhaven's industrial district.  Newhaven was a town built on industry, its steel bones now rusted and creaking under the weight of forgotten progress. Benny himself was a relic of that bygone era, a grizzled veteran with calloused hands and a toolbox overflowing with vintage tools he swore were better than any fancy newfangled gadget. 

He squinted through the greasy window at the address scrawled on his notepad:  34 Hammerhead Lane. A shiver ran down his spine.  Hammerhead Lane was notorious, even for Newhaven, known for its abandoned factories and shady dealings. Benny wasn't usually one to shy away from a challenge, but tonight, even he felt a prickle of unease. 

The flickering neon sign above the building ahead buzzed erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the slick pavement.  It read "Ace Salvage & Reclamation," the "Ace" barely hanging on by its last bulb. Benny sighed, pulled his battered raincoat tighter, and stepped out into the storm.  He was a plumber, damn it, not a ghost hunter, but someone had to fix that leaky pipe. And maybe, just maybe, he'd find himself another story to tell down at The Rusty Tap later.
