The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Vance's office window, mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart. Seattle in October was always moody, but today it felt particularly oppressive, mirroring the dark cloud hanging over the case she'd just inherited. The file lay open on her desk: "Subject - Ethan Hayes, suspected serial killer." 

Amelia, a forensic psychologist with an unerring ability to delve into the minds of the most twisted individuals, took a deep breath and skimmed the details. Three victims in as many months, all seemingly random, all brutally murdered. The press had dubbed him the "Raven's Shadow" due to the single raven feather found at each crime scene. 

Her office was a sanctuary from the storm raging outside. Sunlight streamed through a skylight, illuminating the shelves lined with books on criminal psychology and human behavior. A bonsai tree stood sentinel in the corner, its carefully pruned branches reaching for the light. Yet, despite this ordered space, Amelia felt a tremor of unease. This case wasn't like the others. There was something about Ethan Hayes that gnawed at her, a feeling of familiarity she couldn't place. As if she had encountered him before, in a dream or perhaps a forgotten memory.
