The humid Mississippi air clung to Amelia "Amy" Clementine Bell like a second skin as she knelt amidst a tangled mess of wires and transistors. The radio shack's corrugated metal roof groaned under the relentless summer sun, amplifying the symphony of cicadas buzzing outside. Amy wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, grimacing at the oily smudge left behind by the latest repair job – a battered vintage Zenith console belonging to old Mrs. Henderson down the road. 

She peered into the heart of the radio, its innards illuminated by the dim bulb hanging precariously from a wire above. A tangle of wires led like veins across the circuit board, each one humming with the promise of connection, of carrying voices and music across the airwaves. Amy's fingers, calloused but nimble, traced their paths, searching for the source of the persistent static that plagued Mrs. Henderson's beloved radio. The scent of soldering flux hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of pine needles from the nearby woods. This was her domain – a world of intricate mechanisms and crackling energy, where silence could be more deafening than any storm. 


Amy straightened, her brow furrowed in concentration. She knew this static wasn't just a faulty capacitor; it felt... different. A whisper of something beyond the ordinary tugged at the edges of her senses. It was a feeling she had often dismissed as exhaustion, but today, it pulsed with a strange urgency, pulling her deeper into the heart of the radio and, perhaps, something else entirely.
