The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, bathing Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Hawthorne in a warm, golden glow. She adjusted her designer sunglasses, their lenses reflecting the sleek lines of the Tudor-style mansion before her. This was it - The Harbinger Manor, an architectural masterpiece with a price tag to match and a history that whispered secrets just beneath the surface. 

Amy inhaled deeply, the scent of freshly cut grass mingling with the faint aroma of honeysuckle clinging stubbornly to the air. This wasn't just another house; this was a story waiting to be told, a narrative woven into the very fabric of the old stone walls and intricate stained-glass windows. Amy, known for her ability to unearth hidden stories within homes, felt a familiar thrill course through her. This one, she suspected, would be extraordinary.
