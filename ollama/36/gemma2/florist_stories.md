The bell above the door tinkled its melancholic chime as Iris Petunia pushed her way through, the scent of rain clinging to her coat like a damp shadow. Her shop, "Blooms & Whispers," was tucked away on a cobblestone street in the historic district of Willow Creek, a place where time seemed to flow at a slower pace, guided by the rustling leaves of ancient oak trees and the rhythmic ticking of antique clocks. 

Iris, with her unruly auburn curls perpetually escaping their confines and freckled nose dusted with flour from kneading flower dough earlier that morning, surveyed the shop. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the vibrant arrangements lining the shelves. Roses in every shade imaginable were nestled beside delicate lilies, their sweet perfume mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil. A symphony of color and scent greeted anyone who dared to step inside, a stark contrast to the gloomy November sky outside.


Today, however, the usual vibrancy felt muted, overshadowed by an unspoken tension that hung in the air like the lingering scent of yesterday's wilting lilies. Something was amiss. Iris could feel it in the pit of her stomach, a gnawing unease that wouldn't be silenced.
