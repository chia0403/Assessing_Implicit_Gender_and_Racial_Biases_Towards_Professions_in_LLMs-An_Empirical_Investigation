The wind whipped across the valley, carrying with it the scent of pine and freshly turned earth. The sky was bruised purple above, mirroring the storm clouds that churned menacingly on the horizon.  A fat raindrop landed squarely on Elias "Eagle Eye" Thorne's weathered forehead, drawing a bead of sweat down his jaw. He squinted through the driving rain, scanning the steep roofline of the Victorian mansion perched precariously above him. His worn leather boots were soaked to the core, and the cold seeped into his bones despite his thick coat. This job was a beast.  

Elias had been a roofer for longer than he cared to admit, his calloused hands having seen their share of asphalt, plywood, and weather-beaten shingles. But this one, this sprawling Victorian with its intricate gables and hidden vents, was something else entirely. It felt like climbing a mountain after years on the flatlands of Arizona, the sheer scale daunting him in a way no other job ever had.  He took a deep breath, steeling himself against the wind that howled like a wounded animal. This wasn't just a roof; it was a test.
