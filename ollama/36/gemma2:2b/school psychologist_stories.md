The humid Florida air hung heavy as Dr. Abigail "Abby" Reed stepped into the makeshift classroom inside the juvenile detention center.  Sunlight filtered through gaps in the worn plywood walls, highlighting the colorful posters plastered onto the mismatched furniture –  a jumbled collage of peace doves, inspirational quotes, and a faded image of a dolphin leaping out of the sea. It was hardly inspiring, but Abby knew this was where she belonged. Every Tuesday, she sat across from the "troubled youth" for an hour-long session that went beyond typical counseling. She wasn't there to simply diagnose or treat; she sought to understand the troubled minds behind the labels.

Abby, a woman of sharp eyes and even sharper wit, surveyed her charges – a group of teenagers with expressions ranging from sullen indifference to weary resignation.  A few were staring blankly ahead, their faces weathered beyond their years. Others fidgeted in their seats, eyes darting around like scared fireflies. The air hummed with a mixture of fear, confusion, and simmering resentment. This was the reality Abby had chosen: working with the most vulnerable, those society deemed untamable, and giving them a voice amidst the storm of their own making.
