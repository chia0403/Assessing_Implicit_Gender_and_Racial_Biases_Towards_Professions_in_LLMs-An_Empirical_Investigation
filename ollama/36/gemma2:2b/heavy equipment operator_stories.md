The early morning air was thick with anticipation, dust motes swirling in the sliver of sunlight cutting through the steel-plated roof of the massive construction site.  A symphony of whirring engines and clanking metal filled the air as they awaited their cue to begin work.  All eyes turned to Felix "Big Tex" Thornton, a man whose presence was as large as his imposing orange Caterpillar bulldozer. 

Tex was a mountain of a man, easily six foot three with arms like tree trunks and shoulders broad enough to hold entire redwood forests.  He had the face of an aging warrior – lines etched deep around his eyes, weathered by years spent battling unforgiving terrain and the whims of nature itself. But even in the stark industrial landscape of this sprawling construction project, there was a certain kind of quiet dignity about him; a calmness that came from knowing exactly what he was doing, how to do it, and when to do it. 

He gripped the controls of his bulldozer with the familiar roughness of old leather, a silent mantra humming in his mind as he prepared for battle – an all-consuming, earth-moving battle against the stubborn rock face that threatened to devour their planned road.
