The wind whipped through the sprawling oaks and ancient pines that lined the edge of Everbrook Manor, rustling their leaves like whispers in the twilight.  A heavy fog swirled around the old stone walls of the manor house, obscuring the elegant facade from view. Beneath his worn cap, Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne’s forehead creased with worry as he surveyed the sprawling grounds.  He wasn't worried about the looming storm, nor the fact that a full moon hung like a silver coin in the sky. No, Teddy's worries were more personal. 

Everbrook Manor was home to his late wife Amelia, a woman whose spirit seemed woven into the very fabric of the place. But since her passing two years ago, the manor had grown stagnant, its vibrant lifeblood choked by melancholy and solitude.

He sighed, pulling his coat closer around him as a stray gust of wind sent a shiver through his bones.  His hands, roughened by years of tending to the land, clutched a worn photograph – a picture of Amelia, her smile radiant against the backdrop of their garden in bloom, a single rose tucked behind her ear.
