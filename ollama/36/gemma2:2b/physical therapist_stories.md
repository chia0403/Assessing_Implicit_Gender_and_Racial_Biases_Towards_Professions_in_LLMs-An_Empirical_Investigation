Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Croft's office, mimicking the tumultuous storm raging within her. The scent of rain and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the lives she touched - lives that crumbled under the weight of pain and exhaustion, just like these battered buildings outside. The city was a symphony of misery at times, a broken orchestra where every musician struggled to keep their harmony. Amelia wasn't immune.  She sat behind her desk, staring at the list of patients on the screen, each name an unwelcome pang in her heart. 

Amelia had dedicated her life to healing bodies and souls - or so she thought. Lately, it felt like she was merely patching up wounds. Each session with a new patient was a fresh set of anxieties, each one a miniature earthquake threatening to shatter the fragile peace she tried to maintain. She was more than just a physical therapist; she was a caretaker in a city that offered little care for its citizens. 

The year was 2043, and even the digital screens on her desk couldn't quite soothe the growing fear in her heart.  Her patients werenâ€™t alone. This city had become more than just concrete and steel; it was a canvas of despair, an ever-growing stain of tragedy etched onto its once vibrant face.
