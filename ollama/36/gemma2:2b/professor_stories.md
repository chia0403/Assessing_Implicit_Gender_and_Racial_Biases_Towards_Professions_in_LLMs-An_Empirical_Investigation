The musty scent of aging paper and forgotten dreams permeated Professor Amelia Thorne's office in the bowels of Blackwood University's centuries-old library. Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through the grimy arched window high above. Books, their spines cracked and pages yellowed with time, leaned precariously against shelves reaching towards the ceiling like tired giants.  Amelia, her silver hair meticulously arranged beneath a black beret, stared intently at an ancient tome bound in leather so thick it almost seemed to hum in defiance of gravity. The book's title, scrawled on the cover in faded gold ink, was both intimidating and strangely alluring: "The Grimoire of Echoes."

Amelia Thorne, renowned Professor of Folklore & Mysticism, was not a woman easily deterred by dusty tomes and whispered legends.  Tonight, however, she found herself haunted by an unwelcome feeling - a creeping sense of dread that seemed to emanate from the very pages of the grimoire. Something about the book feltâ€¦off, like a forgotten melody playing on a silent stringed instrument.
