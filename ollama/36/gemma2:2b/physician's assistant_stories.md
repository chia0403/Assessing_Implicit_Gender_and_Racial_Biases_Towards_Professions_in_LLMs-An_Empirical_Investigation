## Setting: The Salt Coast

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne, a physician’s assistant with sandy hair perpetually escaping its ponytail and eyes that held the sun-bleached blue sky she knew so well from growing up on the rugged Maine coast. 

The salty wind whipped at Amy's worn denim jacket as she stood in the doorway of the old brick building overlooking the choppy waves. "Doctor Evans," she called out, her voice lost to the roar of the ocean and the cries of gulls circling above. The storm had just begun to build, a slow, ominous swell that promised to unleash itself upon the unsuspecting beach with the ferocity of a kraken. She shivered, not from the cold, but from the anxiety gnawing at her insides. 

The storm was the least of her worries. Inside, Dr. Evans awaited, his face as grim as the clouds above. The storm wasn't just weather. It was an echo of their recent encounter with a man in the throes of a mental breakdown. He had been found by a passing ferry crew on one of the rocky islands off the coast, muttering about the ocean taking him, like a ghost ship swallowed by the waves. Amy’s initial skepticism gave way to concern as she witnessed his erratic behavior and learned about the strange symptoms he carried—uncontrollable fear of water and an obsession with ancient seafaring tales. It was Dr. Evans' theory that these symptoms were connected to a long-forgotten legend, one whispered in hushed tones by fishermen and seafarers alike - a story of a mythical leviathan buried beneath the waves, said to be capable of pulling unsuspecting souls into its watery embrace. 

Amy closed her eyes for a moment, picturing the rough canvas of the old boat as she'd seen it years ago.  The salty air, the relentless wind and the constant fear of the sea - it was all starting to feel like more than just an idyllic escape from city life, a place where hope was just a whispered prayer on the wind. 
 
What awaited Amy in the storm? Could she navigate this dangerous sea of secrets, or would it claim her too?
