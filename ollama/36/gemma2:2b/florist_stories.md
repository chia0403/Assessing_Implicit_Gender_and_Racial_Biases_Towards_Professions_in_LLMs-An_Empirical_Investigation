The late afternoon sun filtered through the lavender bushes like dying embers, casting long shadows across Rose Mallory’s shop, "Petal & Plume." A gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming lilies, jasmine, and something distinctly untamed - rain-soaked earth. It was a familiar fragrance in her small town of Ashbrook, where life ran slow like a wilting wildflower. 

Rose's world revolved around petals: crafting vibrant bouquets for weddings, funerals, and everyday celebrations. But lately, the vibrant hues had seemed to drain away. The usual buzz of customers, fueled by community gatherings and local festivals, had dwindled to a whisper in the quiet stillness of Ashbrook’s quaint Main Street.

She ran her fingers over a newly-picked bouquet - sunflowers, their faces turned towards the setting sun like tiny beacons of hope - and sighed. A flicker of something akin to despair crossed her face before being replaced by determination. "Don't lose your light," she murmured to the flowers, “Ashbrook needs its blooms.”
