The air hung thick with the scent of formaldehyde and sterile fear in Dr. Eleanor Thorne's office. It was more than just the usual tension that came with a dental appointment - this evening felt heavier, charged with an underlying current of anticipation. Outside, the storm raged, mimicking the chaotic turmoil churning within Eleanor herself. The storm had hit hours ago, a wild fury unleashed on the city below. But here, inside her modest but cozy office, it was a different kind of tempest brewing.

Eleanor's hand tightened around her mug of lukewarm coffee as she glanced at the clock.  It was almost time. She stared at the file on her desk, its contents more unsettling than usual: a complex case involving missing teeth and an unnerving amount ofâ€¦ glitter. 
 
"Dr. Thorne," a voice called from behind the door, hesitant yet familiar. "We've got another one in." 


**Setting:**  Eleanor Thorne runs a dental practice nestled in a quiet neighborhood just on the outskirts of a bustling city. Though well-loved by her regular clientele, the building itself holds an air of slightly neglected charm and whispers of past generations through its creaky floorboards and faded floral wallpaper.

**Main Character:** Dr. Eleanor Thorne - a woman with sharp intellect and a strong sense of justice, yet burdened by a lingering sense of unease about the peculiar cases she increasingly finds herself dealing with.
