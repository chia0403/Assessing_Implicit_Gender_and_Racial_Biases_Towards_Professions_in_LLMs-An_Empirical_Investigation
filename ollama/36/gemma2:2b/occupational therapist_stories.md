The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and old fabric as Evelyn Thorne meticulously organized the small therapy room in her new clinic.  Her fingertips traced the smooth curve of a child’s hand-sized puzzle set, its pieces a rainbow explosion of colors she couldn't quite recall. “Rebuilding,” she murmured, the phrase echoing around the empty space, "rebuilding... after."

Evelyn's heart beat against the rough fabric of her scrubs, mimicking the chaotic thumping of her thoughts. Today was her first day at The Bridge Clinic - a haven for children with disabilities - and Evelyn’s hands trembled as she tried to put together the mental image of the future.  She yearned to see smiles bloom in the tired eyes of these children who had been touched by life's cruelest blows, but also to carve her own path through the rubble of her past. 


**Setting:** The Bridge Clinic - a modest building perched on a quiet street corner, sandwiched between a bustling antique shop and a vibrant bakery.  The clinic itself is warm and inviting with brightly colored murals on the walls and comfortable furnishings designed for playful interaction.

**Character:** Evelyn Thorne, an Occupational Therapist who carries the weight of her personal journey through each hand she touches and the stories she unravels during therapy sessions.
