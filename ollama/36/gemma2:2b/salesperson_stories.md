Rain lashed against the storefront window of "The Curiosity Cabinet," its rhythm echoing the frenetic pace within. Inside, Ms. Eloise Beaumont, her face slick with sweat despite the crisp air conditioning, scanned the cluttered shelves for another lost soul to charm into buying something truly peculiar.  She'd been selling at this antique shop for a decade now - ten years of dodging curious glances and dodging even more awkward sales pitches. Eloise sighed as she reached for another dusty tome bound in faded leather. 

**Setting:** The small, dimly lit antique shop, nestled amongst the bustling streets of Salem, Massachusetts.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged wood, mildew, and the faint sweetness of cinnamon incense.   Old maps, chipped porcelain figurines, and a hundred-year-old Ouija board leaned against walls adorned with faded Victorian paintings.

**Main Character:** Eloise Beaumont

It introduces Eloise, a salesperson struggling to keep her enthusiasm up after ten years of sales that sometimes feel like losing battles against apathy.  You can see her character's inner conflict and desire for something more than just selling dusty trinkets.
