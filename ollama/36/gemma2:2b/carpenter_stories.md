The rhythmic scrape of his plane against the oak was as familiar to Elias as his own heartbeat. He stood in the heart of his workshop, bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sun filtering through the dusty windows. Dust motes danced in the amber light, each one reflecting a memory of past projects - the worn leather handle of a grandfather's toolbox, the intricate carvings on an ancient chest, and the joyous faces of children who had played beneath his swing sets.  

Elias, known by all simply as El, was a craftsman whose work bore no pretenses. His workshop, nestled in the sprawling backyard of his century-old home just beyond the city's urban sprawl, wasn’t a showcase of artistry, but rather a reflection of years spent honing his craft - not to impress the world, but to build it. The wood he worked with whispered tales of past winters, of harvests and storms, and the gentle creak of his tools was the only symphony in this forgotten corner of time. 

He ran a calloused thumb over the surface of an unfinished chair, its worn frame begging for a touch of elegance. It wasn’t just wood he dealt with; it was stories, memories, and dreams. And today, a storm was brewing - not of rain or wind, but of uncertainty that echoed in El's heart like the hollow sound of his plane against seasoned oak.
