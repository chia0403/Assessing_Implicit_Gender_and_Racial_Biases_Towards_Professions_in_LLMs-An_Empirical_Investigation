The roar of the engines was a constant hum in Amelia "Amy" Carter's ears, an almost physical vibration that she knew by heart. It was 7:02 AM on Sunday, a quiet moment before the chaos began in the air. As the captain droned on about the pre-flight routine and safety briefings, Amy couldn't help but feel like she was trapped inside her own personal storm.  The turbulence wasn't from the flight itself; it was coming from within.

The small galley kitchen of a Boeing 747 loomed before her in the sterile white light of the cabin. A half-empty coffee pot sat on the counter, and the faint scent of stale chocolate lingered in the air, an olfactory reminder that her first day back as a flight attendant was proving to be anything but smooth sailing. 

Amy took a deep breath, focusing on the calming rhythm of the preflight checklist.  She adjusted her uniform, smoothing out wrinkles in her crisp blue dress and smoothing down her blonde hair tied back with a bright red ribbon.  Her reflection stared back from the stainless steel countertop â€“ her usual calm facade was there, but behind it, she saw a flicker of fear. Just like this plane, Amelia needed to fly through turbulence to reach the destination - and fast.
