The scent of jasmine and cinnamon hung thick in the air, clinging to Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a forgotten memory. Her office was bathed in the soft golden hues of dusk, casting long shadows on the worn leather armrests of her couch. Outside, the city thrummed with a restless energy, its neon pulse competing with the gentle hum of streetlights. Amy looked at the face of her latest client, a young man named David, whose eyes were wide and panicked. He clutched a crumpled photograph in his hand, the edges frayed from being so tightly held. 

"Where do you want to start, David?" she asked, her voice soothing, measured like a gentle sea breeze against a turbulent storm.  The air crackled with unspoken tension; the photograph, its faded image of two smiling faces - Amy saw their past reflected in the crease on David's brow and the way his lips trembled â€“ held the promise of a story waiting to be told.
