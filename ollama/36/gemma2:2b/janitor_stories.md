The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like an impatient swarm of angry bees in a tin can. Each one throbbed in a synchronized rhythm, adding to the cacophony of sighs and grumbles that emanated from the abandoned museum on Elm Street. Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, his worn-out uniform dusted with the remnants of forgotten dreams, shuffled down the silent hall, his mop handle like a weary conductor leading a symphony of dust bunnies and cobwebs. 

Barty had cleaned this place for ten years, witnessing the ebb and flow of human ambition as it tumbled over itself like an intoxicated king in a drunken waltz. He'd seen children gaze at the faded tapestry depicting ancient battles with awe, then turn to their parents for answers they themselves couldn't fathom. He’d witnessed hushed moments of heartbreak and stolen kisses amidst the dust-covered busts of forgotten geniuses. 

Today was different. There was an undeniable air of urgency about the place; a weight that seemed to cling to the very bricks and mortar. The heavy silence of the afternoon sunbeams cast long shadows, each one stretching like fingers, reaching for Barty's weary soul.  The museum felt heavier than usual tonight. He knew it wasn’t just dust, and he wouldn't be surprised if there was something deeper at play, hidden behind the peeling paint and decaying grandeur.
