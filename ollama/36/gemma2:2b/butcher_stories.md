The air hung thick and heavy in the meat locker, saturated with the scent of sweat, blood, and freshly-ground spices. Dust motes danced in the single beam of light that sliced through the gloom, illuminating the hulking figure of Silas Blackwood, proprietor of Blackwood's Bovine & Boar Butcher Shoppe.  Silas was a man carved from weathered oak, his face etched deep with years spent battling both the brutal nature of meat and the unforgiving hands of fate. His work apron, stained deeper than the night sky itself, bore the faintest outline of a single crimson streak - a testament to yesterday’s struggle against a particularly unruly haunch of venison. 

His shop, tucked away on a side street in the forgotten district of New Albion, was more of a sanctuary for both men and meat than it was a place of business. To those who knew its depths, the air itself whispered stories - tales woven from years of muscle memory and the rhythmic clang of butchering tools. It held an ancient comfort, a primal connection to the earth that Silas swore by with every sinew in his being. 

But today, the usual calm was shattered by a discordant melody emanating from the street outside. A string of brass clanged, followed by the jarring echo of hooves on cobblestones. The sounds drew Silas’s gaze towards the window – a sudden burst of color and movement that interrupted the familiar rhythm of his world.
