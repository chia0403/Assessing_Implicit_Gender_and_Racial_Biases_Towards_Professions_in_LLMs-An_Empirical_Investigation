##  The Ghost of 412 Maple Street

**Setting:** A quaint Victorian mansion nestled on a quiet street in Charleston, South Carolina. Sunlight casts long shadows through the intricately wrought ironwork on the balcony as rain patters down the windows, mimicking the rhythm of Eliza's heart. The scent of jasmine, a constant in this house, hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the musty aroma of old wood and forgotten dreams. 

**Character:**  Eliza Beaumont is not your average interior decorator. With sharp eyes that could spot an off-beat shade of ochre a mile away, she possesses an undeniable talent for breathing life into decaying souls through carefully curated pieces. She's currently working on the daunting task of restoring the famed Blackwood House, its history filled with whispers of forgotten family secrets and lingering traces of its former residents – including the recently departed Mrs. Blackwood, whose ghostly presence has become a local legend.

**Opening:**  “Ghosts,” Eliza muttered, her gaze drifting over a crumbling tapestry depicting a family gathering in an era long passed. “They are just stubborn echoes, clinging to places where they're not welcome.” She traced the faded pattern with her fingers, her touch seeming to whisper against the canvas as if seeking an answer. The house hummed around her, its every creak and groan echoing her own unease. A chill ran down Eliza’s spine, a feeling amplified by the growing silence in the once-bustling drawing room. She wasn't sure if it was the oppressive weight of the Blackwood legacy or the ghostly presence itself that had turned the air into an icy mist.  But one thing was clear: there were secrets swirling in the dust motes that danced in the sunbeam, secrets she needed to uncover before they consumed her.
