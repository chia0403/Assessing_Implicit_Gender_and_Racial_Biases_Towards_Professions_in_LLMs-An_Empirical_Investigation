Rain hammered against the pharmacy windows, blurring the world outside into streaks of grey. Inside, **Drusilla "Dru" Sinclair**, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, scrubbed at a countertop with the practiced efficiency of someone born to deal with chaos. The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting her already pale skin even paler as she sorted through vials of pills and meticulously labelled bottles. It was 2:00 am, and the usual quietude had been disturbed by an onslaught of coughs and sneezes - a familiar symphony in this small town where flu season never truly ended. 

Dru felt the weight of expectation on her shoulders, even heavier than the antique apothecary scales she polished for hours after closing time. The pharmacy's owner had passed away two months ago, leaving behind his legacy - not just the quaint shop with its dusty shelves and whispered secrets, but also a responsibility that Dru had inherited along with his will. She hadn't signed up for this life; instead, she had dreamt of becoming an architect, drawing blueprints of her own future in vibrant colours. But as she counted vials and sorted them by dosage, the weight of the townâ€™s well-being pressed down on her like the heavy rain outside. 

Tonight, however, a new kind of storm was brewing, one with the scent of desperation and fear swirling in its wake.
