Rain lashed against the arched window of Eleanor Blackwood's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her chest.  It was always like this in the fall – a thick layer of gray clinging to the air and whispering discontent just beyond the glass pane. Her world was one of meticulously ordered spreadsheets and endless cups of lukewarm tea. She was Amelia Blackwood’s secretary, a woman whose days were punctuated by the relentless tick-tock of an ancient grandfather clock and the occasional burst of Mr. Featherbottom’s booming voice emanating from his antique gramophone. 

Amelia, a wealthy widow known for her ruthless business acumen and even more ruthless love of gossip, was Eleanor's reason for being. But Amelia wasn't just Mrs. Blackwood’s employer, she was the woman who made the world move – the one responsible for pulling strings in the shadows that governed their city. 

Today, however, the air held a different sort of tension than usual.  A sense of impending doom lingered like a fog settling over the plush velvet seats lining the conference room down the hall. Tonight, Amelia was expected to meet with an intriguing new client – a man whose identity remained shrouded in mystery and rumors whispered through the city’s underbelly like secrets carried on a raven's wings.
