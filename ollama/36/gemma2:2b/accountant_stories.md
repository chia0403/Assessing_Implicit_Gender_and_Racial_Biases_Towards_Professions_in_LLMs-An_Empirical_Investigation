## Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur “Archie” Hemmings’ office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and burnt paper, the remnants of another failed reconciliation meeting with Mr. Van Derlyn. Archie tapped his pen against his worn desk, its rhythmic tap a jarring counterpoint to the storm outside.

The fluorescent lights hummed above him, casting a sickly pale glow on the neat stacks of invoices, receipts, and financial statements that littered his workspace. He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses.  His world, once governed by precise spreadsheets and clean ledgers, had become an unpredictable tempest of demands, deadlines, and unyielding pressure from an increasingly demanding client base. 

Archie was a man who lived by the order of numbers; a meticulous soul drawn to the logic of finance. Yet, lately, those neat lines and equations seemed to blur at the edges, replaced by a growing sense of helplessness. He felt adrift in the storm of his own creation, like a small boat trying to navigate an unforgiving sea.

**Setting:**

Archie's office is located within a small, cluttered accounting firm situated on the edge of a bustling city, somewhere in a state that leans heavily towards the rainy and dreary. The building itself is old, with peeling paint and creaky floorboards, a testament to years of hard work and maybe a few late nights.
