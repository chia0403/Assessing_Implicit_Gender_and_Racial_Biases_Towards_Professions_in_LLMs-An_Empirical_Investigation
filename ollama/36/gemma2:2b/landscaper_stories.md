The rhythmic scrape of clippers against freshly cut grass formed an almost hypnotic soundtrack as Ethan “Hawk” Harper worked his way through Mrs. Peterson's meticulously manicured lawn.  It was the kind of day that begged for the smell of fresh-cut grass and the warmth of a summer sun, but Hawk found himself fixated on the dense shadow cast by the oak tree at the back corner.  The gnarled branches were reaching out like skeletal fingers, their leaves whispering secrets he couldn't quite grasp. 

Hawk had been tending to Mrs. Peterson's lawn for a decade now, his life as predictable and quiet as the rhythm of the clippers. But this week, a new neighbor’s arrival had stirred something within him - a restlessness that went beyond the usual humdrum of routine.  The house sat on the opposite side of Elm Street, a Victorian with peeling paint and overgrown ivy that whispered of stories untold.

**Setting:** A small, quiet suburban neighborhood in the heart of Ohio, where manicured lawns were more than just a façade for societal conformity; they held secrets within their carefully-kept borders.
