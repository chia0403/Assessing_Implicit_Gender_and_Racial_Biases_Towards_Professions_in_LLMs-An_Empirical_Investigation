The air in Amelia's tiny office felt thicker than usual today.  The window boxes overflowing with lavender were struggling against the relentless July heat, their scent doing little to soothe her churning stomach. Outside, the street was a kaleidoscope of colors â€“ tourists in brightly-colored clothes jostled past vendors hawking hand-woven scarves and trinkets, while children chased pigeons across the cobblestone squares. It wasn't the Parisian charm Amelia had so diligently cultivated for her clients that she craved; it was the kind of magic only found on a holiday trip.

Amelia sighed, wiping her palms on her worn apron as she looked at the pile of travel brochures before her. Each one promised exotic locales and untamed landscapes, but each also seemed to hold a silent echo of the last client she'd failed to secure a booking for. A recurring dream about a grand escape was starting to feel like an unfulfilled destiny.
