Cassandra had spent years navigating this landscape, watching lives unravel and reassemble like clockwork. But today, something felt different. This young manâ€™s profile wasn't just another case file; it held a chillingly familiar tension, mirroring her own journey through the labyrinth of youthful rebellion and the agonizing weight of redemption.
