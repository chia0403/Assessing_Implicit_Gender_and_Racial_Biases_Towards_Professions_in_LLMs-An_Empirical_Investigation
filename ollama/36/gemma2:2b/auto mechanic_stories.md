Rain hammered against the rusted awning of "Rusty Wrench Auto," each drop a tiny explosion against the faded red paint.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of motor oil and burnt wire, a familiar aroma to Elias Thorne, owner and sole operator of the small repair shop. The year was 2047, and the world ran on electric vehicles - at least that's what everyone claimed until the recent storm knocked out the entire city grid, plunging the once-bright metropolis into a chaotic darkness.

His brow furrowed as he meticulously inspected the damaged engine of a vintage 1967 Mustang - a rare beauty from before the electric revolution that dominated the world now. He could hear the distant roar of thunder, the storm's fury echoing its anger across the city. The sky was an angry tapestry of grey and black clouds, each flash of lightning casting eerie shadows upon the tools lining his workbench. Elias was a man of machines, born from grease and gears, a man who felt most alive in the chaos of a damaged engine. He knew this Mustang wouldn't be easy to fix, but he had been known to work on anything, regardless of its age or condition. Tonight, however, even he couldnâ€™t fight against the creeping anxiety in his gut as he faced the unknown challenge ahead.
