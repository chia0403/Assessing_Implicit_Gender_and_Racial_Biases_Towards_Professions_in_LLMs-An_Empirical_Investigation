## The Setting:

**Location:**  The quaint seaside town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of Maine. A small, bustling community where friendly faces greet each other on the corner and laughter rings out from the local bakery every Saturday morning.

**Atmosphere:** Despite its charm, a somber air hangs over the town. Locals whisper about the sudden departure of Mr. Peterson, the beloved owner of the harbor-side restaurant, "The Salty Dog."  Rumors swirl: illness, debt, maybe something more...unthinkable. The only thing clear is that he's left behind his wife and their young son, a boy named Ethan who resembles a miniature version of his father in every detail, except for his eyes - shimmering green like the Atlantic waves themselves.

## Character Introduction: 

**Name:** Amelia "Amy" Sinclair.  A sharp-witted and compassionate dental hygienist with a heart that knows no bounds. Despite her easygoing demeanor and infectious smile, Amy harbors an undercurrent of worry. 


**Opening:** 

"The 'Salty Dog's' demise isn't the only thing leaving me feeling like a shipwreck," Amy muttered to herself as she surveyed her patient, Mrs. Henderson. The woman's fear of dental work was legendary in Oakhaven, even for an experienced hygienist like Amy. But that morning, it had taken on a new and unsettling form - a gnawing fear that went beyond the familiar anxiety of going to the dentist. "This town feels...different." 

The aroma of salt air and pine lingered in the air as Mrs. Henderson clutched her worn purse tightly. "I just...don't feel right, Amy," she whispered, her eyes downcast. "Like a storm is coming, but it isn't the kind that brings rain."

"Is there something you're not telling me, Mrs. Henderson?" asked Amy, her voice gentle yet firm. A storm was brewing in her heart, too. And something felt...off about Oakhaven lately.
