It was a routine she'd grown used to over six years serving at The Dusty Spoon â€“ nights like this, when even the ghosts seemed to stay away from the city's forgotten corners, were her solace. 

But tonight, something felt different. A low hum of anticipation thrummed beneath the surface, punctuated by the clink of glasses and the raspy murmur of whispers, a prelude to an evening unlike any other.
