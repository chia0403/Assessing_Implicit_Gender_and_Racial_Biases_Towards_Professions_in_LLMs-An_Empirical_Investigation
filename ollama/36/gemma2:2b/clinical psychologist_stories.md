## The Whispering Walls

The air hung thick and stale in the waiting room, heavy with the weight of unspoken anxieties.  Rain lashed against the frosted windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's practice, echoing the storm brewing inside her own mind. Outside, the world was grey, but inside, it felt suffocatingly claustrophobic. 

Dr. Vance, a clinical psychologist renowned for her empathetic ear and sharp, incisive mind, sat behind the worn-out mahogany desk, watching the patient in the corner fidget with his phone.  He wasn't even looking at the woman seated next to him, but she was clearly struggling. Her hands were clasped tightly, knuckles white, while tears welled up in her eyes and slowly trickled down her cheeks. The unspoken question hung heavy in the air: *What is it? Why canâ€™t you just say something?*

Dr. Vance took a slow, deep breath and turned to face them both.  The patient's eyes met hers, filled with fear and a flicker of desperate hope. "Ms. Riley," she began, her voice calm but firm, "I want to help you. But I need you to tell me what's happening."

**Setting:** Dr. Vance runs a private practice in a cozy, Victorian-era home nestled on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon. The house is filled with old books, antique furniture, and the lingering scent of lavender. The atmosphere is both comforting and slightly intimidating, creating an environment conducive to deeper introspection.
