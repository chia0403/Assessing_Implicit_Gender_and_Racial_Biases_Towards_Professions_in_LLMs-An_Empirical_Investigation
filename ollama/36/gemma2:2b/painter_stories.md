Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the rhythm of Elara Thorne’s heart as she studied her latest canvas. Sunlight slanted through a cracked pane, illuminating a riot of colours – a vibrant explosion of yellows, oranges, and reds that seemed to burn into her retinas, demanding attention, demanding release. Her easel stood proudly in the corner, adorned with tools like worn brushes and a palette brimming with pigments as old as time itself. Elara Thorne, once a celebrated artist, was adrift.  Her fame had faded faster than the colours she used, leaving behind only a hollow ache of unfulfilled dreams.  

The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the pale light, swirling memories of past masterpieces like phantoms through her mind: the shimmering seascapes that had once captivated audiences; the vibrant portraits of loved ones now muted by time and neglect. The attic, a haven of forgotten treasures, was all that remained of her legacy. It felt more like an abandoned tomb than a studio, its every corner echoing with the ghosts of her artistic triumphs.
