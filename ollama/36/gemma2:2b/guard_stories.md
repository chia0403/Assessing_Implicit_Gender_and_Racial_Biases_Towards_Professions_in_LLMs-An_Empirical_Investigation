The iron gates groaned like a wounded beast as Garin, his armor clanking against him like an angry echo, entered the sprawling stone palace complex of Lord Eldric.  Dusk bled into night in the Imperial City, painting the sky a bruised purple with streaks of crimson from the setting sun. He was a veteran guard, seasoned by years of patrolling the city's streets and witnessing its underbelly. But tonight, even his years didn't lessen the knot of unease that twisted in his gut as he approached Lord Eldric’s towering residence. 

The castle, carved into the very mountainside, seemed to absorb all light. Garin shivered slightly, pulling his cloak tighter around him against the biting wind that carried a strange, metallic tang - a smell he couldn't quite place. He'd been stationed at the City Gate for years, and tonight, Eldric’s summons felt different, heavy with an unspoken urgency. It wasn’t a matter of routine or duty; this was something... more.
