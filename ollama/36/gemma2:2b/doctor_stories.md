## Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, each drop resonating like tiny explosions in the otherwise silent sanctum. The storm mirrored the turmoil within the usually stoic woman. She stared at the x-ray images on her desk: skeletal fingers twisted at impossible angles, a skull contorted beyond recognition. The only sound louder than the rain was her own racing heartbeat, echoing through the worn office chairs and the dusty shelves lined with medical journals. 

Evelyn Thorne, M.D., had dedicated her life to the delicate art of healing. But tonight, she felt more like a detective in a locked room, piecing together the shattered puzzle of a patient's fate.  Her eyes narrowed as she flipped through the case file â€“ "The Case of the Twisted Fingers," the title screamed in bold letters. The victim was barely a footnote in her mind: a nameless, faceless statistic lost to the labyrinthine streets and shadowy alleyways of their city. 

**Setting:** A dilapidated yet meticulously organized medical office on the outskirts of a bustling metropolis, where the rhythm of life is as relentless and unpredictable as the storm outside.
