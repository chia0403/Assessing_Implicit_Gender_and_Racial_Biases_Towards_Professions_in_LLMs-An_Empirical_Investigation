The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of pine needles from the Himalayan salt lamps scattered across Amelia's treatment room.  Her small studio, tucked away behind a vintage record store, was an oasis of quiet calm amidst the frenetic pulse of her city.  Amelia, known to her clients as "Amie," ran her fingertips lightly over Maya’s shoulder, feeling the knot of tension thrum beneath the surface of the woman's taut skin. 

The rumble of traffic outside and the distant wail of sirens were muted by the soft music playing on a vintage record player.  Outside, the city was in full swing, but inside Amelia’s studio, time seemed to have stopped – at least for Maya. The tension she had worked so hard to alleviate eased with each gentle stroke of Amie's hands.
