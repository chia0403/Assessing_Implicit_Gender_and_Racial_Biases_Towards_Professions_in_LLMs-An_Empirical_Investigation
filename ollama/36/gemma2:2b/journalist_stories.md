Amelia’s sharp eyes scanned the bustling street, searching for the slightest hint of intrigue - the flicker of a hidden agenda, the telltale sign of a secret society meeting.  She yearned for the next big scoop, something that could shake Atheria's stagnant system to its core and bring about real change.
