## Story Opening:

The dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the towering windows of Blackwood Library, illuminating the faded spines of countless forgotten stories. Eloise Hawthorne, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, ran a weary finger across the spine of a leather-bound volume titled "Legends and Lures of the Deep." Her worn brown cardigan seemed to match the age and melancholy in the air, for even in the heart of this bustling city library, Eloise felt a distinct sense of isolation.  

Blackwood Library was more than just a collection of books; it was an archive of memories, whispers of forgotten dreams, and echoes of lives lived long before. But to Eloise, it was also a cage, its high shelves a prison that kept her tethered to the past.
