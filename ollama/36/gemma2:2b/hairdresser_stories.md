The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and lemon, both synthetic and real in equal measure thanks to Evelyn's signature "Fresh Start" shampoo concoction. The salon door swung open, sending a gust of wind that stirred the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams streaming through the arched windowpanes. 

Evelyn, known as "Ellie" by her regulars, was hunched over a pile of unruly auburn hair, attempting to tame the mane of a woman who had clearly been on an emotional rollercoaster for the past hour. The woman's name, Evelyn could tell from the frantic tapping of her nails against the counter and the way she kept glancing at the mirror as if expecting something terrible to leap out, was Veronica, and Ellie suspected that the "terrible" may have involved a broken engagement or an unexpected inheritance gone sour. 

Veronica’s hair was a chaotic nest of unruly waves and stubborn curls; a testament to her long-suffering relationship with life's daily demands. Evelyn, known in her small town of Willow Creek for her artful hands and the ability to weave magic through every snip and curl, couldn't help but feel she had a chance to bring some semblance of peace back into Veronica’s world.
