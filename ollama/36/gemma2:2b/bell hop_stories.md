Rain lashed against the windows of the opulent Grand Elysian Hotel, mimicking the storm brewing inside 19-year-old Theodore "Teddy" Crane's gut. It was his first week as a bellhop at the legendary hotel, and he hadn't even managed to leave the cramped confines of the staff entrance without being bombarded by tourists who treated him like a mere shadow in their fancy gowns.  

The grand lobby, with its marble floor glistening under the intricate chandeliers, felt more daunting than the city itself. Teddy clung to his battered bellhop uniform, wishing for something – anything – other than another misplaced luggage or disgruntled customer. 

Outside, the world was an endless blur of flashing taxis and downpour, but inside the hotel, a different kind of storm raged: one of hushed whispers, flickering candles, and secrets whispered in shadowed corners. The Elysian held a certain magic, a silent undertow that seemed to swirl with every turn of the clock.  And Teddy, the bellhop on his first week of service, was inexplicably drawn into its heart.
