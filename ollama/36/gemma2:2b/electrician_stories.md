## The Circuitry of Fear

**Setting:**  A decaying industrial complex on the outskirts of Detroit. Rust-eaten metal hulks loom like forgotten giants over cracked asphalt and choked with weeds.  Flickering fluorescent lights from an old office building cast grotesque shadows across broken concrete floors and skeletal remains of machinery. 

**Character:**  Ethan Hayes, a twenty-something electrician who carried more than just tools in his worn tool bag; he held the ghosts of past mistakes in the tangled wires beneath his fingertips. He had started working for Frank's Electric after graduating from trade school, but with every job, Ethan felt like he was navigating a minefield of unspoken tensions and lingering anxieties about his own flawed past. 


**Opening:**  Ethan stood on the creaking platform above the main loading dock, adjusting the battered metal box that housed his most recent repair work. It looked like a relic from some forgotten war, its metal casing warped and stained. He remembered Mr. Krantz’s gruff instructions to “fix it right,” but now all Ethan could feel was the weight of those words clinging to him like dust on his worn overalls. 


His eyes drifted to the peeling paint of the office building, a decaying monument to years of failed promises.  A sense of dread washed over him as he recalled the last time he had been here. It was when he’d met her – Lily - and his world had tilted sideways, tumbling down a terrifying abyss of broken promises and buried secrets.  

He pushed away that memory, a bitter taste in his mouth. He couldn't afford to be swallowed by those ghosts again. Not today.  Today, Ethan Hayes would simply fix the wiring, one faulty circuit at a time, and hope for something better than a repeat performance.
