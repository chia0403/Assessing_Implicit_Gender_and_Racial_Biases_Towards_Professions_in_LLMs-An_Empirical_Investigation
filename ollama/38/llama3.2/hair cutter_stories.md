The scent of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of the blow dryers created a warm atmosphere that made everyone feel welcome.

As the summer solstice approached, Willow Creek was buzzing with excitement. The annual SummerFest celebration was just around the corner, and Amie had been commissioned to create the festival's signature hairstyle â€“ a stunning, intricate design that would adorn the head of the festival queen. With her skills and creativity, Amie was confident she could make this year's SummerFest one to remember.
