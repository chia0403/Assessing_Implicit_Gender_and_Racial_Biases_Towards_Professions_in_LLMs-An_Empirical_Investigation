Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement outside the Grand Hotel, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted lobby. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old leather and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that Evelyn Wellesley had grown accustomed to during her years as concierge. With a quiet efficiency, she polished a glass vase on the reception desk, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone - or something.

It was 11:45 PM on a drizzly autumn evening in New Haven, Connecticut, and the hotel's handful of guests were all tucked away in their rooms or sipping whiskey at the bar. The city outside seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the next morning's dawn. But Evelyn knew better. She had a feeling that tonight was going to be different.

As she gazed out into the darkness, her thoughts turned to the mysterious package that had arrived earlier that evening - a small, unmarked box wrapped in black paper and tied with a faded red ribbon. The hotel's owner, Mr. Jenkins, had summoned her to his office with a curious expression on his face, and Evelyn had spent the past hour trying to unravel the secrets hidden within the box.

Now, as she stood frozen behind the reception desk, the clock ticking away in the background, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just outside the door - or perhaps even inside.
