Here's a potential story opening and setting for an interior decorating novel:

It was a crisp autumn morning in the charming town of Willow Creek, nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont. The sun cast a warm glow over the quaint streets, illuminating the vibrant fall colors that seemed to dance across every brick facade and windowpane. In a cozy little house on Maple Street, Amelia Rose Ellis stirred in her bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes as she gazed out the window at the changing leaves.

As an interior decorator with a passion for preserving history and infusing modern style into traditional spaces, Amelia had spent countless hours scouring the town's antique shops and flea markets for unique treasures to incorporate into her designs. But today, her focus was on preparing for the most important client of her career: a wealthy tech entrepreneur who had hired her to transform his centuries-old family estate into a sleek, high-tech retreat.

With a thrill of excitement, Amelia threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed, planting her feet firmly on the soft, plush carpet. She had always dreamed of working on a project like this â€“ one that would allow her to combine her love of design with her passion for preserving history. And as she made her way to the kitchen to start the coffee, Amelia couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation: what secrets lay hidden within the walls of this stately old mansion? And how would she bring them to life in a way that would delight and inspire the entrepreneur who was counting on her expertise?
