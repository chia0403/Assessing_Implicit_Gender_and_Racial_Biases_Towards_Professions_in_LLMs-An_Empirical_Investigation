Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded behind the ancient stone walls of Saint-Pierre-du-Val, Aurélie Fournier locked up her family's flower shop, Les Fleurs de la Vie, for the final time until morning. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet fragrance of blooming lavender that had been carefully pruned and arranged throughout the shop. Aurélie took a deep breath, feeling the familiar weight of her responsibilities settle onto her shoulders like a cloak.

The Fourniers had owned Les Fleurs de la Vie for generations, tending to the florists' guild in Saint-Pierre-du-Val since their ancestors arrived from the countryside over two centuries ago. Aurélie's great-grandmother, Madame Elara Fournier, was said to have created some of the most exquisite bouquets in all of France, and her descendants had continued to hone their craft, passing down family secrets and techniques through the generations.

As she turned off the lights, a flickering beam from a lantern outside cast eerie shadows on the walls, making Aurélie feel as though the very spirits of her ancestors were watching over her. She smiled wryly, feeling a shiver run down her spine. It was a small-town superstition, perhaps, but one she'd grown accustomed to over the years.

With a final check that all was secure for the night, Aurélie stepped out into the cool evening air, taking with her the secrets and stories of Les Fleurs de la Vie.
