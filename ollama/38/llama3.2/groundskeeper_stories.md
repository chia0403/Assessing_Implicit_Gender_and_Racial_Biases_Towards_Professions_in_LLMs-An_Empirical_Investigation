Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn air clung to the dew-kissed grass as Edwin Fletcher, a rugged yet gentle groundskeeper at Willowdale Manor, emerged from the dense foliage of the estate's oldest woods. The soft chirping of early-rising birds filled the silence, punctuated by the distant rumble of a waterfall that cascaded down the rocky slope on the outskirts of the property.

Edwin breathed in deeply, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filling his lungs as he made his way back to the manor. He had spent the previous night out here, tending to the estate's various gardens and greenhouses, making sure everything was in tip-top shape for the day ahead. The quiet solitude of the woods had provided a welcome respite from the bustling activity within the manor walls.

As he walked, the trees seemed to loom over him, their branches creaking softly in the gentle breeze like Nature's own lullaby. Edwin felt at peace, his thoughts drifting back to the day's schedule and the tasks ahead. But amidst the tranquility, a nagging sense of unease lurked beneath the surface â€“ a feeling that something was off, that the stillness was hiding more than just the morning dew.

What could it be?
