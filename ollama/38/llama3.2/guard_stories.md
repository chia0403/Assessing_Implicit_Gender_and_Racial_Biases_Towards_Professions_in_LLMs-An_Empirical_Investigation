Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenshire City gleamed like polished onyx under the faint glow of streetlamps, casting long shadows across the deserted alleys. It was a night like any other in this forsaken place, where the once-thriving industrial town had been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self.

Inside the imposing stone walls of Ravenshire Castle, Guard Commander Elara Valyrius stood watch at the entrance to the great hall, her eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of disturbance. The flickering candles that lined the walls cast eerie silhouettes on her face, accentuating the sharp angles of her cheekbones and the determined set of her jaw.

A veteran of the castle's guard for nearly a decade, Elara had seen it all - from rebellious princes to marauding bandits, from whispered rumors of dark magic to the brutal suppression of uprisings. She had earned the respect of her fellow guards with her unwavering dedication and unshakeable sense of duty.

But tonight felt different. Tonight, a growing sense of unease hung in the air like a miasma, threatening to seep into every corner of the castle's ancient stones. Elara's instincts told her that something was amiss - and she aimed to find out what it was before it was too late.
