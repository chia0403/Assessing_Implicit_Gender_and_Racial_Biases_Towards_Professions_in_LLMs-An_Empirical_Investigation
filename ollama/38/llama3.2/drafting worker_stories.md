Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Manhattan glistened like polished onyx as Edwin Patrick McAllister stepped out of his apartment building, a haze of cigarette smoke clinging to his worn denim jacket. It was 5:45 AM on a drizzly Monday morning in April, and the city was already waking up from its slumber. Edwin took a long drag on his cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins as he gazed out at the towering skyscrapers of the financial district.

As a drafting worker at the prestigious architecture firm of Smith & Taylor, Edwin spent most of his days hunched over a computer screen, bringing designs to life for some of the city's most iconic buildings. He was meticulous and detail-oriented, with a passion for precision that bordered on obsession. But despite his many talents, Edwin felt unfulfilled, as if he was just a cog in a much larger machine.

As he walked to the subway, the neon lights of the billboards and advertisements reflected off the wet pavement, casting an otherworldly glow over the city streets. The hum of the subway cars grew louder, a constant reminder that even on the most mundane days, New York City was always on the move â€“ and Edwin McAllister was just trying to keep up.

How's this? Would you like me to make any changes or continue with the story?
