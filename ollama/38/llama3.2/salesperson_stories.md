Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, shrouding the towering skyscrapers of downtown in a misty gloom that seemed to match the mood of the office building's fluorescent-lit corridors. Amidst the drabness, one person stood out - Emily Anne Thompson, a salesperson with a gleam in her eye and a smile that could charm the birds from the trees.

At 27 years old, Emily had already made a name for herself on the sales floor of Smithson & Co., a high-stakes firm that peddled cutting-edge tech solutions to the city's top corporations. With a razor-sharp mind and an uncanny ability to read people, she had built a client list that rivaled that of her more senior colleagues - and was rapidly gaining a reputation as one of the company's most ruthless and effective closers.

As Emily stepped out of the elevator on the 23rd floor, the soft hum of the office machines and the murmur of hushed conversations enveloped her like a warm hug. She felt at home here, where the air was thick with tension and the stakes were always high. Little did she know, however, that today would be different - today, Emily's world was about to be turned upside down by a mysterious new client who would challenge everything she thought she knew about sales, power, and herself.

How do you want me to proceed?
