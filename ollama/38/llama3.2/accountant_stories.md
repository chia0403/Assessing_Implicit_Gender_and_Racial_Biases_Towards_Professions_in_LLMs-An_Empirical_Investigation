Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of downtown New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and crowded sidewalks. In a small, windowless office on the 23rd floor of a nondescript high-rise building, accountant Emily Rose Everett sat hunched over her desk, staring blankly at the stack of tax returns in front of her.

It was 8:45 PM on a typical Wednesday evening, and Emily had just wrapped up another long day of crunching numbers for her clients. She let out a deep sigh, feeling the familiar weight of her glasses slipping down her nose as she rubbed her tired eyes. It was going to be one of those nights - the kind where all she could think about was getting home, pouring herself a glass of wine, and forgetting about spreadsheets.

Emily's office, affectionately known as "The Cube" by her colleagues, was a tiny, Spartan space with only a few pieces of furniture: a desk, a chair, and a small filing cabinet. The walls were painted a dull gray, and the only natural light came from a faint glow emanating from the city below. It was a far cry from the bright, airy offices she had dreamed of working in when she first started her career as an accountant.

Despite its drab atmosphere, Emily felt a sense of comfort and familiarity in The Cube. This was where she did her best work - where she could lose herself in the numbers and forget about the world outside. And so, with a resigned expression, she picked up her pen and began to sift through the latest batch of tax returns, searching for any discrepancies or irregularities that might require her attention.

As she worked, the sounds of the city filtered up from below - the distant hum of traffic, the wail of sirens in the distance, and the murmur of conversation from passersby on the sidewalk. It was a soothing background noise, one that Emily had grown to love over the years. For now, at least, she could focus on her work, letting the world outside fade into the background.
