Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the desolate stretch of highway, casting a dark blue shadow over the worn asphalt and rusty guardrails that seemed to stretch on forever. The only sound was the soft hum of crickets and the distant rumble of a passing truck, its headlights casting an eerie glow on the darkening landscape.

In a small, weathered truck, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled highway worker with over 20 years of experience under his belt, pulled up to the side of the road to inspect the damage. His faded denim shirt and sweat-stained overalls told the tale of a hard day's work, and the tired look in his eyes spoke of long hours spent battling the elements and fighting for a decent paycheck.

Hawk had worked on this stretch of highway for years, watching as it slowly disintegrated beneath his feet. He knew every pothole, every crumbling section of asphalt, and every twisted metal guardrail that seemed to pop up like a jack-in-the-box at inopportune moments. But tonight was different. Tonight, Hawk had received a mysterious report about a strange occurrence on the highway - a glowing light that had appeared out of nowhere, leaving behind only a faint scent of ozone and an unsettling feeling of unease.

As he stepped out of his truck to take a closer look at the scene, Hawk's trained eye scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of what might have caused this strange phenomenon. But as he peered into the darkness, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - that whatever had caused the light was still out there, watching him.
