Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel about a movie director:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles gleamed like a dark canvas, reflecting the neon lights of Hollywood's iconic sign. It was a drizzly autumn evening in 2015, and director Julian Alexander Winters sat in his cramped, cluttered office, staring at the stack of rejection letters on his desk.

Julian, a man in his late thirties with unruly brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses, had spent years trying to make it big in Hollywood. He had directed countless commercials, music videos, and short films, but nothing that had landed him a major feature film deal. His latest project, a sci-fi epic titled "Elysium Rising," was still stuck in development hell, with the studio breathing down his neck for a budget-friendly blockbuster.

As he sifted through the letters, Julian's mind wandered to the phone call he'd received earlier that day from his agent. The words echoed in his mind: "Julian, we need to talk about your future." His heart sank as he wondered if it was time to pack up his camera gear and return to his old job at a local ad agency.

Just then, Julian's assistant burst into the room, carrying a cup of lukewarm coffee. "Hey, boss! You've got a visitor," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Julian raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Who could be visiting him on this dreary evening? He stood up, smoothing his rumpled suit, and made his way to the door. Little did he know that this chance encounter would change everything.
