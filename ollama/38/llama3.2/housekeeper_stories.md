Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Elizabeth MacTavish trudged up the path to her small flat above the antique shop on Cumberland Street. The sound of droplets pattering against the pavement was a constant companion for Emilia, one that she'd grown accustomed to over the years. She pushed open the creaky door and slipped inside, shaking the rain from her worn coat as she hung it on the hook by the front door.

Emilia took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the musty scent of old books and dusty trinkets that lingered in the shop below. It was a smell that brought her comfort, one that reminded her of the countless afternoons she'd spent among the shelves, running her fingers over the spines of worn volumes and listening to Mrs. MacDonald's stories about the city's rich history.

As she made her way up the creaky stairs, Emilia couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. It was more than just the rain outside that had her on edge – it was the feeling that something was shifting beneath her feet, that the carefully constructed world she'd built for herself was about to be turned upside down.

With a quiet sigh, Emilia pushed open the door to her flat and stepped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light as she took in the familiar sights of her tiny home. The worn armchair sat by the window, its velvet cushions a deep, rich purple; the old oak table held its usual assortment of scattered papers and dusty jars; and in the corner, a small, flickering candle cast shadows on the walls, like sentinels guarding secrets only Emilia knew.

It was here, surrounded by these small, comforting routines, that Emilia felt most at peace – a feeling she clung to tightly as she began her day's work as a housekeeper for the wealthy and enigmatic Lady Harcourt. Little did she know, however, that today would bring more than just another day of dusting and polishing; it would bring secrets, scandals, and a world of trouble that would threaten to upend everything Emilia thought she knew about herself and her place in the city.
