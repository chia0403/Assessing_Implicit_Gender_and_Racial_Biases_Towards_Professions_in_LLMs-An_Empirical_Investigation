Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Evelyn Alexandra Wynter stood at the edge of the mist-shrouded lake, her eyes fixed on the small wooden boat that had been pulled from the water just hours before. The trees surrounding the lake seemed to lean in, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch anything that dared to disturb the tranquility of the scene. As a forensic psychologist with a specialization in traumatic stress and victim profiling, Evelyn had seen her fair share of gruesome crime scenes, but there was something about this one that unsettled her.

The police department's call had come in just after dawn: a body had been discovered floating face down in the lake, wrapped in a fishing net and weighted down with stones. The initial report had indicated a possible drowning, but as Evelyn surveyed the scene, she noticed something odd - no signs of struggle or trauma on the victim's body, yet they were dressed for boating and carried a small tackle box.

Evelyn took a deep breath, feeling the chill of the morning air fill her lungs. She knew that this was going to be a long day. As she knelt down to examine the fishing net more closely, a gust of wind rustled the leaves, carrying with it the faint scent of something acrid and metallic.

The lake's tranquility was shattered by the sound of crunching gravel behind her - Evelyn turned to see Detective James "Jim" Thompson approaching her, his expression grim. "Evelyn, I've got some news that'll make this case a lot more complicated," he said, his eyes locked on hers with an unspoken warning.
