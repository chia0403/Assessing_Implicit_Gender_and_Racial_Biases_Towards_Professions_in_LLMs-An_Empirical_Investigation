Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Detective Emmet Ryan stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of Seattle's downtown area, shaking his water-drenched jacket as he gazed up at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. The neon lights of the city's nightlife flickered like fireflies in the darkness, casting an otherworldly glow over the wet pavement.

It was a night like any other in Seattle, yet Ryan felt a sense of unease that lingered long after he'd made his way back to the precinct. The rain had brought out the worst in people – petty thieves and desperate souls alike, all seeking to take advantage of the city's vulnerabilities. And tonight was no exception.

As Ryan entered the crowded lobby of the 12th precinct, the sound of murmured conversations and clinking coffee cups enveloped him like a warm hug. His partner, Detective Kate Matthews, looked up from her desk, a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes as she took in Ryan's sodden appearance.

"Rainy night, huh?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Ryan flashed his trademark wry smile. "You could say that."

But before he could change out of his soaked jacket and into something dry, the precinct's PA system crackled to life, and Chief Jameson's voice boomed through the speakers: "All units, we have a 10-13 – multiple victims reported at the downtown art gallery on 5th Avenue. Suspect may be armed. Be advised, units, this one has all the makings of a long night."
