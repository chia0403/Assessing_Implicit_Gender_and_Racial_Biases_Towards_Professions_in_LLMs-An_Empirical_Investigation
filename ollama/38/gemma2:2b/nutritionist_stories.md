The neon "Open" sign buzzed like a trapped bee, its flicker casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's clinic. Outside, the urban sprawl hummed with an impatient energy -  a symphony of sirens and roaring traffic - but inside, everything was quiet save for the rhythmic whirring of a blender filled with freshly chopped kale. Evelyn, her chestnut hair pulled back in a severe bun, surveyed the scene with practiced calm. 

A patient's hesitantly-approached figure materialized through the door, their eyes wide and unsure. The man, Mr. Hernandez, was struggling to carry his bulky medical bag, his shoulders slumped under its weight. His anxiety was palpable; Evelyn recognized it instantly - a familiar knot of fear in the pit of her stomach, mirrored by the way he clutched the paper bag that held his meal plan.

Evelyn's fingers tapped lightly on the waiting room's weathered counter as she looked at him.  "Mr. Hernandez," she began, her voice soothing and warm, "how can I help you today?"
