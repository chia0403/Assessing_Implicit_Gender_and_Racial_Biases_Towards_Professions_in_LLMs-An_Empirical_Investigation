The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed against Amelia Thorne's temple as she polished her already pristine glasses. She was surrounded by the familiar chaos: overflowing filing cabinets groaning under the weight of years of paperwork, a perpetually-running coffee machine that smelled suspiciously like burnt sugar and ambition, and a boss who seemed to believe that "organized" was synonymous with "under-caffeinated." 

Amelia's world revolved around the intricate dance of deadlines, client calls, and Mr. Fitzwilliam's ever-shifting demands for his 'visionary' marketing campaign - which mostly involved shouting into the void.  The only respite she found in this chaotic symphony was her tiny corner desk, where a lone bonsai tree stood sentinel against the encroaching sea of paperwork. 

Amelia's fingers tapped lightly on the keyboard as she reviewed Mr. Fitzwilliam’s latest email, its subject line screaming “Urgent: Global Expansion!” Her eyes flitted to the clock - 3:15 AM.  The world outside was a vibrant tapestry of stars and streetlights, while Amelia was trapped within the sterile walls of her cubicle, dreaming of galaxies far beyond the reach of her fluorescent lights.

* Is there something more to Mr. Fitzwilliam’s 'visionary' campaign that she can uncover?
