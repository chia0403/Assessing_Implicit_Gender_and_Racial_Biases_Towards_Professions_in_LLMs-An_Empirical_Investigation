Today’s shipment was particularly peculiar - bundles of dried kelp and seagrass, rumored to have miraculous properties in the coastal town of Saltwind, a place where even the winds seemed to whisper secrets only she could hear. It was time for her grand-experiment – a cure for the ever-present insomnia plaguing the sleepy populace.
