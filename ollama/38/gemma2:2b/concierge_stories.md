The rain hammered against the ornate glass windows of The Grand Elysian, its rhythm like a steady heartbeat drumming in Amelia's ears as she surveyed the lobby. Each drop seemed to etch a fleeting shadow across the marble floor, highlighting the intricate carvings that whispered of bygone grandeur.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of elegant chatter and hushed whispers was replaced by an unsettling quiet. 

Amelia, with her sharp eyes and even sharper wit as concierge at The Grand Elysian for the past decade, knew something wasn't right. Tonight, the air thrummed with an undercurrent of unease that she couldn’t quite place. Usually, guests flocked to their rooms like moths to a flame, but tonight they were absent, locked within gilded cages of luxurious solitude. The silence was like a suffocating blanket, heavy and unsettlingly devoid of the usual buzz of life that defined The Grand Elysian's existence.

Her name, Amelia Beaumont, echoed faintly as she murmured a question into her wrist communicator. "Did you try calling them, Elias?" 
  
A quiet voice answered from the other side. "Not yet, Amelia," came Elias' voice, his calm tone contrasting sharply with the chaotic symphony that ran through Amelia's veins. “It’s too early for anything to be happening.”


The Grand Elysian was no ordinary hotel – it was a haven for the city's elite and the world's most powerful figures, each room a carefully curated universe of privilege and power. Tonight, however, even their usual opulence felt like an illusion, a fragile mirage in the face of a growing darkness that threatened to engulf everything they held dear.
