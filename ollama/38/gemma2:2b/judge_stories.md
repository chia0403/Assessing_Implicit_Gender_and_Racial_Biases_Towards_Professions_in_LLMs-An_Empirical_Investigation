## The Weight of Justice

**Setting:** A bustling city square in Victorian England, bathed in the fading light of sunset.  The air hums with an undercurrent of excitement as the evening crowd gathers around stalls selling everything from fragrant flower garlands to freshly baked bread. But amongst the jovial atmosphere, a palpable tension hangs heavy on the crisp air, emanating from the imposing silhouette of the Old Bailey, London's premier court house, where the city's most notorious crimes play out under the watchful gaze of countless citizens and journalists alike.  

**Main Character:** Judge Eleanor "Nell" Hawthorne, her sharp silver hair pulled back into a tight bun, is already seated on her high-backed judge's bench. The weight of centuries of precedent and justice hangs in the air around her, each case she hears echoing through the years. Her piercing grey eyes scan the courtroom, taking in every detail of her audience â€“ from the desperate whispers of the accused to the stern gaze of the prosecutor.  

**Opening line:** "Sometimes," Judge Hawthorne mused aloud, stroking her weathered ivory gavel, "even the scales of justice seem to be tipped."
