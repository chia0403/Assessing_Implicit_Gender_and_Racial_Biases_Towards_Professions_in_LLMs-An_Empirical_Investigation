The worn linoleum floor beneath Eleanor 'Ellie' Finch's fingers felt slick as she polished out the mess of her cluttered office. Tax season had begun its annual assault on normalcy, and Ellie was no stranger to its onslaught. The air hung thick with the scent of coffee (always black) and peppermint gum, a familiar aroma that somehow managed to both soothe and enrage her in equal measure. It was 20 minutes past eight am, a testament to how quickly time had flown by since she'd woken up at the crack of dawn to sort through last night's mountains of tax documents. The fluorescent lights hummed over the small table where Mrs. Henderson's form sat open, an anonymous face staring back at Ellie from its blank page. 

The setting was a tiny office space tucked away in a quiet corner of downtown Cleveland. The walls were a faded beige, adorned with chipped paint and what looked suspiciously like hand-drawn peace signs (courtesy of Ellie's eccentric neighbor, who often dropped by). Above the desk, a single window overlooked a dreary street that seemed to stretch on forever, offering a glimpse into the world beyond her little corner.

Ellie sighed, taking a deep breath. It was going to be one of those years again. The kind where the IRS was out for blood and every tax form felt like an intricate puzzle waiting to unravel her sanity. But as she started reading through Mrs. Henderson's forms, Ellie felt a familiar spark ignite in her chest - a spark that came with the joy of helping someone navigate the complexities of their finances. It reminded her why she had chosen this line of work.
