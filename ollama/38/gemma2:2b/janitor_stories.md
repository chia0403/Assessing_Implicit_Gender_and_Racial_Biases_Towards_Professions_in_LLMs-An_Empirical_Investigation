The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thorne's head as he meticulously scrubbed the last remaining crumbs from the stainless steel counter in the Grand Central Terminal dining hall. He was known to many simply as "Eli," but his real name was a whisper within the city's bustling heart, a secret like an old letter tucked away in a dusty box.

He lived for these quiet moments before the rush of commuters. The rhythmic sweep of his mop, the clattering sounds of trains arriving and departing just feet from him – it all held a strange peace he couldn’t quite explain.  This wasn't just cleaning; it was a quiet ritual in the middle of chaos, where time seemed to slow down like an old vinyl record spinning on a worn needle. Eli would stand there, watching people flit by, their lives playing out like fleeting dreams - a businessman with his briefcase, a young girl holding her mother’s hand, an elderly woman gazing at a crumpled newspaper. 

Eli felt strangely connected to them all; a silent observer of human nature in its rawest form. But tonight, something was different. A heavy silence clung to the air, and Eli knew it wasn't just the late hour. It was the feeling of being watched, of an invisible presence pressing against his back like an unwelcome ghost.
