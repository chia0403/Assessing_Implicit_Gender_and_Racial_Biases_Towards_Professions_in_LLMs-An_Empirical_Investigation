Rain lashed against the windowpanes of  **Elianor Blackwood's** bakery, "The Hearth & Home," each drop exploding into miniature fireworks on the frosted glass. The wind howled like a banshee outside, its mournful song mirroring the unease growing in Elianor's chest as she measured out flour for her newest batch of cinnamon buns.  She was supposed to be focusing on the simple beauty of baking – the way the golden dough puffed up around her fingers, the aroma of warm spice filling the air – but the ominous shadow of Mr. Thorne's arrival kept creeping into her mind. 

Mr. Thorne was the town constable, a man whose presence often felt like a storm cloud hanging over the bakery. His visit wasn't about the delectable scent of her treats or the warmth of her oven; it was about something far darker and more unsettling. It concerned the missing children, their disappearance eerily mirrored by the growing whispers of strange lights flickering in the woods bordering their village.   Elianor clutched a faded photograph of two smiling children – the last she'd seen before they vanished - and felt the weight of responsibility settle heavily on her shoulders.
