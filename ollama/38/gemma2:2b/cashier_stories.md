The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of overripe bananas, a pungent aroma that had become almost synonymous with The Sunset Mart. It was a small grocery store nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac in Pasadena, California, a place where time seemed to slow down, even during rush hour.  

But not for Cassandra "Cass" Wright. Her world inside the fluorescent-lit aisles of The Sunset Mart was an orchestra of chaos. Each morning she'd greet her regulars - Mrs. Henderson with her daily bag of organic kale chips and Mr. Peterson, who always insisted on a double scoop of vanilla ice cream in his milk tea â€“  and then the symphony would descend upon her: families clamoring for their weekly grocery staples, teenage girls gossiping over their phone screens as they waited for their allowance, elderly couples arguing about the price of a loaf of bread. 

Cass felt like she was constantly dodging rogue cart wheels and juggling stacks of change with one hand while maintaining her composure. It was a rhythm, this dance between customer demands and cashier duties, but sometimes it left her feeling weary, almost as if the fluorescent lights were dimming her own spirit.
