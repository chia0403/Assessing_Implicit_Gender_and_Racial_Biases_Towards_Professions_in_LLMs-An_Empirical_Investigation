The crimson sun bled across the horizon, painting the sky in streaks of orange and purple as it dipped behind the jagged peaks of Mount Avarice.  A biting wind whipped across the courtyard, whipping rain-slicked leaves into frenzied dances on the weathered stone walls.

Tonight, an unease clawed at the edges of Eldricâ€™s mind, a sense of wrongness that clung to the damp air like a lingering shadow.  He could feel it in his bones, the way the normally placid mountain winds seemed to hum with a restless energy. It felt... sinister.
