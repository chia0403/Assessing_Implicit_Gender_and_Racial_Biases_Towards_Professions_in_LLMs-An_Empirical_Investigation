The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Croft's hair across her face as she stood on the rickety porch of the Victorian mansion overlooking the crashing surf.  Moonlight painted the weathered wood with silver streaks, and an eerie, mournful cry echoed from somewhere in the distance. The vast property stretched before her – sprawling gardens overgrown with roses and wisteria, a crumbling fountain frozen mid-spasm, a grand oak staircase leading to a dusty attic door. This was Blackwood Manor, the estate that had been passed down through generations of the Croft family but now sat neglected, shrouded by whispers of secrets and haunted by memories.  Amy inhaled deeply, the briny air swirling with the scent of mildew and decay. This wasn't just another listing; this was a legacy waiting to be unearthed.

Amelia "Amy" Croft had always felt an irresistible pull towards old houses, their creaking floors whispering tales from centuries past.  She understood them – the slow hum of life that pulsed in their walls, the echoes of laughter and sorrow that lingered within their confines. Amy saw not just brick and mortar but stories waiting to be told. She wasn't your typical real estate agent; she was a historian, an artist, a weaver of dreams. 

Today, though, a distinct chill clung to Blackwood Manor, like a ghost in its own right. Something about the place felt… off. It was as if the air itself held a secret, and Amy, with her innate sense of curiosity and her unwavering spirit, wouldn't let it go unanswered.
