The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and pine needles as Elias Thorne stood at the edge of the forest, the sun already sinking below the horizon.  He ran a calloused hand over his weathered face – lines etched deep from years spent under the harsh glare of the northern sky.  His axe felt heavy in his grip, its familiar weight grounding him amidst the swirling symphony of wind and creaking trees. 

Elias was born to this life, the lineage of loggers running thick in his veins like sapwood through a cedar log. He'd spent his youth learning from his father, whose wisdom was passed down in measured tones and quiet observations about the forest's pulse. The woods had been Elias' solace, his sanctuary, his prison.  He knew every curve of the ancient pines, their silent stories hidden within the bark like the whispers of an old ghost.

Yet, today, a tremor ran through Elias’ heart that wasn't merely the wind. This year, there was something different about the forest. A subtle unease settled in the pit of his stomach as he gazed at the dense woods before him. The trees stood silent and motionless, yet something felt off.  The usual symphony of birdsong had been replaced by an unnerving silence, and a creeping dread filled Elias' heart like cold water seeping into his bones. He knew, with a deep sense of foreboding, that something was deeply wrong in these familiar woods.
