Rain lashed against the windows of “The Anchor,” blurring the city lights into hazy constellations. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of salt spray and burnt caramel from the old-fashioned coffee machine.  A steady drizzle of customers flowed through the doors, seeking warmth and comfort in this seaport town.  Eira Thorne leaned against the bustling counter, a familiar ache settling in her lower back. The worn wooden surface beneath her was soaked with spilled beer and the remnants of a particularly rowdy customer’s last meal.

Her name was Eira Thorne, though everyone called her "El." El had been serving tables at The Anchor for six years now, knowing each creak of the floorboards, each flicker in the gaslight lamps, like a map of the town's soul etched into her memory.  Tonight, though, something felt different. A tension hung heavy in the air, thicker than the rain outside. The sea seemed to hum with an undercurrent of unease, mirroring the unsettling feeling that had been brewing in El’s gut since she started her shift. 

A low growl echoed from below the floorboards.  It was a sound she hadn't heard before, and it sent shivers down her spine. The familiar rhythm of the storm, now tinged with something more ominous, seemed to whisper warnings through the wood planks. El glanced at the clock above the bar: 2:15 AM. A new night had begun, but this time, even the ocean seemed to be holding its breath.
