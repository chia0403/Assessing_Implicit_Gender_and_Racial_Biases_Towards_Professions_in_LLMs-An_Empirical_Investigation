The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, each drop like a tiny fist pounding against the worn planks. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, burnt coffee, and a melancholic yearning for warmth.  Barnaby "Barney" Quillington wiped down the counter with a grimy rag, his tired eyes catching the reflection of the neon sign advertising “World’s Best Bloody Marys” – a beacon in the storm-ravaged night. 

The Rusty Mug was more than just a bar; it was a refuge for drifters, forgotten souls, and weary travelers seeking solace in the company of whiskey and regret. Barney, with his salt-and-pepper beard and worn leather apron, was its heart and soul. He knew every patron's drink order by heart, their story whispered beneath the flickering neon light. Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual murmur of conversation had been replaced by an oppressive silence, as if even the rain had paused to listen.
