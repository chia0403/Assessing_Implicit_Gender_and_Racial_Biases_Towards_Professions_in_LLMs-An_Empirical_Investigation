## The Whispering Eucalyptus

**Setting:**  The sprawling grounds of Moonhaven Orphanage, nestled amidst the ancient gum trees and rugged coastal cliffs of Tasmania's south-west. 

**Character:** Elspeth "Whisper" Ainsworth, a woman with eyes as green as the island's lush forests and hands calloused from years of caring for its creatures.  At 58, she carries the wisdom of the land like a whispered secret on her lips. Whisper was never meant to live among children; instead, she found solace amongst the animals of Moonhaven, becoming their confidant, their caretaker, their silent protector.

**Opening:** 
The salt-laced wind whipped through the eucalyptus grove, carrying with it the scent of sea spray and the lowing cries of cattle. Whisper stood amidst a flurry of orphaned lambs, their bleats echoing through the clearing as she patiently coaxed them to drink from her hand-crafted troughs. The orphans’ eyes held the same unyielding hope that clung to her heart, a hope that whispered against the ever-present hum of loneliness.  She was surrounded by a world full of children, yet somehow, Whisper found herself alone in the stillness, a lone figure with an echo of forgotten childhood clinging to her every step. 

A gust of wind rustled through the gum trees, carrying the faintest scent of woodsmoke and rain. It was then that she noticed it – the distinct shift in the air, a feeling of something off.  Whisper’s gaze lingered on the lone figure emerging from the mist, their back shrouded in shadow. The weight of unspoken expectations hung heavy between them.
