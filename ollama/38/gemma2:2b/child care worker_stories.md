Rain lashed against the windows of Little Lights Daycare, blurring the already grey Seattle skyline into an indistinguishable mess of streaks and swirls. Inside, Mrs. Clara Ainsworth sighed heavily, her gaze sweeping across the scattered toys in the playroom – a tangle of blocks, stuffed animals, and construction paper – each one a testament to the boundless energy of five-year-olds.  

Clara, with her perpetually rumpled hair pulled back in a bun, was a veteran childcare worker at Little Lights. For twenty years she'd nurtured these tiny humans through their explosive imaginations and messy explorations. Her life had become synonymous with this place, its rhythm, its laughter, its chaos. 
But even the comforting familiarity couldn't quite soothe the unsettling feeling that had been clinging to her for weeks. It wasn't just the relentless rain; there was a strange unease in the air, an almost imperceptible change in the children's energy, their playful curiosity somehow muted.  Something felt amiss. 
As the last of the little ones filed out for their parents' pick-up, Clara glanced at her reflection in the dusty mirror. A tired but resolute smile played on her lips as she took a deep breath. She knew what was coming. The storm wasn't just outside; it was inside too, and she was ready to face it head-on.
