The morning mist clung to the hills like a hesitant lover, refusing to break free from its slumber in the crisp air.  A gentle breeze carried the scent of damp earth and pine needles as Elara "Ellie" Blackwood surveyed her work at Maplewood Estates. Her worn boots crunched on the dew-kissed gravel path leading to Mrs. Peterson's sprawling rose garden, a symphony of vibrant reds, pinks, and whites that stood in stark contrast to the pale blue sky above.  

Ellie was more than just a landscaper; she had a touch, an intuitive understanding of how plants breathed and thrived beneath the earth's gentle gaze. She saw not just the rows of carefully pruned roses but the hidden secrets of soil composition, the silent language whispered by trees in the wind, and the dreams of the tiny buds bursting into life under her watchful care. But today, a feeling of unease settled over Ellie like the weight of forgotten memories. A single, scarlet rose lay nestled amongst the withered stems of yesterday's blooms â€“ its delicate petals marred by an unseen puncture, a silent scream against the beauty that surrounded it.
