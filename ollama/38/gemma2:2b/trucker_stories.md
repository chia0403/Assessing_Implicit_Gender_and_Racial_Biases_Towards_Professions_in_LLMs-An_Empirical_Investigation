The midday sun beat down on Jebediah "Jeb" Calhoun's worn leather trucker cap, turning his already flushed cheeks an even deeper shade of red.  Dust kicked up by passing semis swirled lazily in the air, a constant companion to the endless highway that stretched before him like an angry scar across the landscape. He was just another speck on this vast canvas, except for the battered '67 Chevy truck he lovingly called "Betsy," his lifeblood and chariot. 

Jeb's stop tonight was Dust Devil Junction, nestled in the heart of what locals claimed was a place where the desert winds whispered secrets from long-dead pioneers.  He needed to find a place to sleep before setting off again on his route, hauling fresh produce from California to Omaha for an outfit that called itself "The Golden Grain." Jeb wasn't a man of grand ambitions; he just liked the rhythm of the road, the feeling of freedom in his hands and the rumble of Betsy under his feet.  Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sense of unease snaked through him, like stray desert wind finding its way into an already dusty wound.
