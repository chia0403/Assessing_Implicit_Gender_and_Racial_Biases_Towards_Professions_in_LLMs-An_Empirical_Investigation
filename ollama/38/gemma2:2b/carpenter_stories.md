The crisp morning air nipped at Elias Thorne's weathered cheeks as he stood amidst the chaotic symphony of sawdust and whirring power tools. His workshop, tucked away in the heart of the sprawling old town of Oakhaven, was a world unto itself – walls lined with reclaimed wood adorned with intricate carvings, benches groaning under the weight of half-finished projects, and the scent of pine and cedar filling the air. The year was 1895, and while the rest of Oakhaven buzzed with progress and industry, Elias clung to his old ways. He built furniture, not buildings, each piece a testament to his meticulous craft and decades of honed skill.

Elias' gaze fell upon his latest masterpiece – a mahogany dining table, its intricate carvings depicting scenes of life in Oakhaven’s early days.  He traced the delicate lines with his calloused fingers, pride swelling within him as he remembered the countless hours poured into bringing this piece to life. But even amidst the beauty and craftsmanship, a shadow lingered in Elias' eyes, an unease that felt heavier than any wood he labored over. It was no longer just his craft; it seemed like Oakhaven itself was changing around him – a change for which he wasn’t quite sure he was prepared.
