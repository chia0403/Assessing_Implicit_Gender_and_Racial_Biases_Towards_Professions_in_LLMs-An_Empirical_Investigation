The scent of lavender and machine oil hung thick in the air of Clara Thorne's atelier. Sunlight filtered through dusty skylights, illuminating motes dancing on canvases and threads. The year was 1920, and amidst the roaring twenties, there was something both timeless and audacious about Clara's workshop tucked away in the heart of Paris’ Montmartre district. Her small studio held a lifetime’s worth of dreams woven into silks and satins, each piece imbued with an elegance that seemed to defy the very decade it was created in.

Clara, her auburn curls cascading down her shoulders like spun copper, was known for more than just her exquisite craftsmanship.  Her dresses weren't merely garments; they were stories whispered on the breeze. Each stitch carried a history, each seam a secret shared with those who wore them. It was said that when Clara crafted a dress, she captured the essence of the wearer’s soul – their dreams, fears, and hopes, all woven into every delicate fold and curve. Tonight, however, even as Clara worked on her latest masterpiece for Lady Antoinette de Valois, a sense of unease gnawed at her heart.  Her intuition, like an unfurling butterfly's wing, whispered of danger lurking in the shadows.
