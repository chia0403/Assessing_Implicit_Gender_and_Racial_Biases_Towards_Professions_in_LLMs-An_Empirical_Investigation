## Opening: 

The rain hammered against the frosted glass of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's studio window, each drop like a miniature drum solo on her palette.  It was her favourite kind of day - a tempestuous symphony of grey and white that mirrored the chaos inside her head. Amy swiveled in her worn leather chair, frustration simmering hotter than the afternoon sun filtering through the storm clouds. 

Her latest project: restoring a dilapidated mansion for a billionaire's eccentric daughter, was proving more challenging than anticipated. The client, Countess Esm√© de Vere, had an almost pathological fear of "anything that wasn't pristine," her every whim met with a barrage of white marble and handcrafted oak in the most sterile of spaces. Amy, however, felt stifled by the relentless focus on order. 

The storm outside was mirroring the turmoil within Amy - she yearned to create something raw, imperfect, something imbued with the soul she saw in the hidden corners of the mansion's neglected grandeur. She closed her eyes, the smell of dust and old wood filling her senses. A soft glow from a nearby lamp illuminated the intricate carvings on an antique mirror, its ornate frame echoing the turmoil brewing inside Amy.  "Don't let them smother you, darling," she whispered to herself, "there's beauty in the storm." 

## Setting:

The house, built centuries ago by a family of merchants who traded spices from across the globe, had been passed down through generations, yet its interior was slowly losing its magic. It now stood as a monument to an era long past, filled with secrets and echoing with the ghosts of their opulent lives.
