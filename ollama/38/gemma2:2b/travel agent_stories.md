The humid air clung to Eleanor "Elle" Nightingale like a second skin as she stood on the precipice of a bustling street market in Marrakech. The aroma of spices and freshly baked breads assaulted her senses, a stark contrast to the crisp air she'd grown accustomed to back home in Edinburgh.  Her weathered travel brochures lay crumpled in her hand – a constant reminder of her life's purpose: to orchestrate dream vacations for others. 

Elle was no stranger to exotic locales. Her agency, "Midnight Sun Voyages," specialized in crafting bespoke itineraries that catered to the most discerning globetrotters. Today, however, she felt adrift, as if the vibrant energy of Marrakech failed to penetrate the melancholic haze within her. It had been a year since her husband, Alistair, passed away, leaving behind not only an empty life but also a deep sense of unfulfilled purpose.

Her gaze lingered on a group of young children chasing pigeons through the bustling market square, their laughter ringing out like a forgotten melody. This was the essence she missed – the vibrancy of life, the joy in sharing experiences.  Elle knew this city, with its labyrinthine alleys and ancient souks, was where Alistair’s adventurous spirit had flourished. A flicker of determination sparked within her. Maybe, just maybe, she could rediscover that spark, not for Alistair but for herself.
