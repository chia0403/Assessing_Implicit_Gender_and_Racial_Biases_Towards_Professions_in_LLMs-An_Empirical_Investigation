Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne’s apartment, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic beeping of his computer screen.  He rubbed his tired eyes, squinting through the blurry glow of the monitor at a grainy photograph. It was barely recognizable in the flickering light – a young woman with hair like sun-bleached wheat and eyes that held the unsettling blue flicker of storm clouds. He scrolled through the file again, his finger tracing over the name:  Amelia Rose Miller. 

The room smelled vaguely of old books and stale coffee, a comforting yet lonely aroma in this concrete jungle he called home. Elias was an anomaly in the world of forensic psychology – he preferred the quiet company of data and theory to the raucous energy of crime scenes. His office at the city’s psychiatric hospital felt more like a library than a workplace, filled with stacks of case studies and the ever-present hum of his mind piecing together the tangled threads of human behavior. 

Amelia's case was different. It had reached a fever pitch - her supposed suicide attempt in a crowded subway train just hours ago had thrown the city into a frenzy. The police were convinced it was a tragic accident, but Elias saw something deeper. Something that whispered of hidden motives and calculated deception – a puzzle that threatened to consume him whole as he sat, hunched over the image of Amelia's face, waiting for answers.
