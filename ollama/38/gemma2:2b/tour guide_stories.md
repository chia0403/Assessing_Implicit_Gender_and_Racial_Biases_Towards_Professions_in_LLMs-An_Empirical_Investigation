## Story Opening 

The air hung heavy with humidity and anticipation as Amelia "Amy" Blackwood adjusted her floral-patterned scarf, its vibrant colours clashing with the gloomy grey of the London morning. The tourists were beginning to trickle in, their excited chatter filling the cobbled streets surrounding the historic Tower Bridge. Amy watched them swarm towards the towering structure, eager eyes scanning for familiar landmarks as they stepped off the bus like theyâ€™d entered a stage play. 

"Welcome, everyone!" she announced with a grin, her voice ringing out over the bustle of early morning visitors. "For those who haven't been to London before," Amy continued, glancing at the group of wide-eyed tourists, "we're about to embark on a journey through time, guided by the whispers of history itself."
