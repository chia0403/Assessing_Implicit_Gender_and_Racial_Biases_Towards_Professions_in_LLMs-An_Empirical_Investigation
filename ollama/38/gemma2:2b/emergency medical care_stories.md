The sterile white walls of St. Jude’s Hospital seemed to pulse with a life of their own, every beep from the monitors, every clink of equipment, amplifying the frenetic energy swirling around Dr. Anika Sharma's head. It was 3:02 AM, and her shift had been anything but restful.  Anika wasn't new to late nights, especially in a place like St. Jude's, where trauma patients often landed on their doorsteps just after midnight – or during the early hours of dawn. But tonight felt different. Tonight was unlike any other night. 

The setting: **St. Jude’s Hospital**, a sprawling city hospital renowned for its emergency care department and dedication to providing treatment to all socioeconomic backgrounds.  Its reputation meant a constant flow of patients, a chaotic symphony of beeping machines, urgent calls, and the sharp scent of antiseptic. Anika, however, knew this was more than just the hospital's routine.

**Dr. Anika Sharma**, with her keen eyes hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses, was renowned for her calm demeanor in the face of chaos. A former neurosurgery resident, she’d opted for emergency medicine instead, drawn to its immediacy and the sheer scale of impact a single intervention could have on someone's life.  But tonight, something felt different. A weight of anticipation hung heavy, threatening to pull her out of her usual calm demeanor. 


**What will happen next? Will Anika find herself facing a challenge that calls for her expertise? Or will it be a simple routine shift?**
