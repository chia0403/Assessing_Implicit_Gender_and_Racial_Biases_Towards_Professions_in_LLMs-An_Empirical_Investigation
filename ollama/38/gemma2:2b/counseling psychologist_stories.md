## The Weight of Words

**Setting:**  A sun-drenched beachside town in Maine. Quaint cottages huddle together on narrow streets, their porches overflowing with wicker chairs and fragrant potted lilacs. The salty breeze carries the scent of pine needles and the distant sound of crashing waves.  The air feels thick with the weight of summer, a languid stillness clinging to the air. 

**Main character:** Dr. Eleanor Hayes, a counseling psychologist whose sharp wit and even sharper mind are as much a part of her charm as the calming blue eyes that peer over her spectacles. She spent years researching the efficacy of sand therapy for PTSD in children before she opened her own private practice on the shore. It was there, amidst the comforting rhythms of waves and the gentle laughter of sunbathers, that Eleanor found purpose.

**Opening:** The familiar sting of salt air stung Dr. Hayes’ nose as she sat beneath the awning of her modest office, a cup of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hands. A flock of gulls circled overhead, their cacophony a constant reminder of life's chaos and the burden she carried on her shoulders. Her phone vibrated with another text from a grieving mother, "He doesn’t want to talk... I don't know what to do." Eleanor sighed. 

The weight of words always felt so heavy in her hands. Every session was a battle against silence, a quest for the unsaid, the unexpressed grief that clung to each patient like a shroud. This morning, however, she had received another message - this time from a man whose name simply read "John". It felt almost reckless to engage with him, yet the call of compassion tugged at her soul. 

She took a sip of coffee and closed her eyes for a moment, letting the salty wind wash over her, seeking solace in the rhythm of crashing waves. Today, she wouldn’t just listen. She would unravel the threads that bound this man to his pain.  And maybe, just maybe, offer him something more than silence.
