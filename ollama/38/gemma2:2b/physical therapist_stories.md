## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A sprawling, ivy-covered Victorian mansion perched on the cliffside overlooking the restless Atlantic Ocean.  Stormy winds whipped rain against the weathered stone, and the waves crashed below like angry fists. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Hawthorne, a therapist who had traded the sunny beaches of California for this brooding, yet strangely charming, seaside town in Maine. Though her career as a physical therapist was thriving, she yearned for something more than the predictable rhythm of physiotherapy appointments.

**Opening:**  A flicker of movement caught Amelia's eye. She peered through the worn glass panels of the main landing, where her patient, Mr. Fitzwilliam, was struggling with his new walker. He was an imposing figure, a veteran with battle-scarred hands and a stoic face that spoke of untold stories etched deep within its folds.

"Mr. Fitzwilliam," Amelia's voice was soft as she approached him cautiously. "You seem to be having some difficulty." 

He gave her a wry glance, his gaze sharp but weary. “It’s the stairs, child. The steps are anathema to my bones.”

Amelia’s lips twitched into a familiar smirk. She knew Mr. Fitzwilliam's pain as well as he did; she had felt it in his silence and struggled to bridge the chasm between their generations, their struggles.  The whispers of the wind seemed to echo in her ears, murmuring about unspoken secrets buried deep within these walls. The old mansion thrummed with a quiet power that Amelia was only now beginning to understand. 

***
This opening sets up several narrative hooks:

* **Mystery:** Why is the mansion so haunted? What stories are hidden in its very walls? 
* **Conflict:** Mr. Fitzwilliam's struggle reflects Amelia's own internal conflict, her desire for more than just helping patients regain mobility.
* **Atmosphere:** The setting evokes a sense of isolation and mystery, creating a compelling atmosphere for the story to unfold.
