Rain lashed against the worn windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Thorne's office, mimicking the frantic beat of her heart. A single strand of auburn hair escaped the bun on her head, threatening to unravel into chaos as she stared at the file in her hands.  Her patient, Mr. Thomas Blackwood, had a history filled with loss and confusion, but tonight it felt different, heavier. 

The setting was an old-fashioned brick building tucked away on a quiet street corner in Edinburgh. The aroma of rain-soaked stone hung thick in the air, mingled with the faint scent of jasmine from the antique vase on Dr. Thorne's desk.  Her office reflected her own internal chaos - worn leather chairs and chipped porcelain teacups stood shoulder to shoulder with modern therapy tools like a flickering lava lamp and an eclectic array of motivational posters.
