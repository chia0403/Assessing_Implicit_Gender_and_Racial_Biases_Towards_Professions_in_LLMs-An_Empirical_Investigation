## The Dust in Her Steps

**Setting:** A crumbling Victorian mansion on a windswept cliff overlooking the crashing Atlantic.  The year is 1928.

**Main Character:** Eleanor Blackwood, known to everyone as Ellie, was a woman weathered by years of dusting and scrubbing the grand dust motes out of a life lived in shadows. Her days were a symphony of swirling rags and polishing silver, punctuated by the mournful cry of gulls and the chilling wind whipping through shattered panes. 

Ellie was a ghost trapped within the mansionâ€™s echoing halls. A woman whose existence was defined by the ever-present silence that clung to the house like cobwebs after a storm. Her only company was Mrs. Hawthorne, the withered spinster who owned the manor, and the stories whispered from generation to generation about her mysterious past and an inheritance left for the one who dared unlock its secrets.
