## The City Sleeps, But I Dreamt

Rain lashed against the attic window, blurring the cityscape into streaks of gray and charcoal. Inside the cramped room, surrounded by blueprints that looked more like hieroglyphics than architectural plans, sat **Alexander Blackwood**. 

The city slept –  its neon lights dimmed to a soft hum, and its concrete arteries choked with slush. But Alexander's mind was anything but dormant. He traced his fingers along an intricate curve on a model he'd been obsessed with for months: the curve of a skyscraper that would defy gravity, challenge the skyline, become a beacon in the urban storm. 

His latest project, "The Ascendant," had taken him years to conceive. It was more than just an architectural masterpiece; it was a rebellion against the concrete monotony of the city. Alexander believed this building would redefine not only space but human experience within it.  He envisioned soaring libraries, interactive public spaces, and even gardens that spiraled into the sky – all interwoven in a design that embodied the very essence of progress and beauty. 

But as he gazed upon his model, something caught his eye. A faint flicker of movement inside the model’s central atrium. The city wasn't sleeping; it was waking.  The air grew heavy with a strange static, and Alexander could feel an unseen force pulling at him, beckoning him to look deeper. He knew this was no ordinary dream. It felt… prophetic.
