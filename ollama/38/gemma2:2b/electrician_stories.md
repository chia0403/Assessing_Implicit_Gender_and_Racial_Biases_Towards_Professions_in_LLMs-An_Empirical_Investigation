The air hung thick with humidity in the cramped space above the diner's kitchen. Sweat prickled at Ethan Thorne’s hairline as he worked on the flickering fluorescent lights, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the greasy-spoon floors. It was one of those nights where every flicker seemed to scream "electricity overload" – a sentiment echoed by the buzzing in his ears, which was starting to mimic the erratic humming of the faulty wiring. 

Ethan, a man who preferred his world a little less chaotic than the lives he wired into existence, found himself caught between the demands of a late-night diner crowd and the volatile hum of his tools. It wasn't exactly how he envisioned spending Friday night; instead, he was on call for a last-minute repair on Mrs. Peterson's '57 Chevy, an old job that had him wishing for some simple, predictable circuit work.  

Ethan took a deep breath, the smell of stale coffee and frying onions invading his nostrils, before flipping the panel back, his calloused hands working with practiced ease despite the stifling heat. He needed to get this right – it was more than just electricity; it was about saving Mrs. Peterson's night, her vintage ride, her quiet solitude in a world that seemed increasingly noisy and chaotic.
