The humid air hung thick over Elmwood like a shroud, clinging to Detective Lucas Thorne's trench coat as he surveyed the scene. A single, blood-stained rose lay wilting on the curb, its crimson hue jarring against the grey concrete and chipped pavement of 4th Street. The setting sun cast long shadows from the boarded-up liquor store across the street, where a faint but unsettling stench of decay wafted out from behind the broken glass. Detective Thorne’s eyes narrowed, his gaze fixed on the jagged hole punched through the front door like a predator's mark on its prey. He pulled the collar of his coat tighter around his throat as he began to piece together the puzzle pieces of this case – or rather, what remained after someone had decided to play hide-and-seek with justice. 

His partner, Officer Miller, approached him from behind, carrying a small bag filled with evidence bags. “Anything on the victim yet?” he asked, his voice hushed as they approached the makeshift crime scene.

“Just some scattered paperwork,” Lucas replied, his tone flat. "And what appears to be a single bullet casing nestled amongst the shattered glass.” 
  
The victim was a quiet businessman named Mr. Evans – one of Elmwood’s own, known for his charming smile and soft-spoken demeanor, now lying cold in this forgotten corner of town. The murder had shocked the community, leaving them speechless as they witnessed their quiet lives disrupted by a horrifying act of violence. Now, Detective Thorne was left to unravel the mystery behind Mr. Evans' demise.
