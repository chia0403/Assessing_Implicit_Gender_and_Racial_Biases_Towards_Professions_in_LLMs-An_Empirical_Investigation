The midday sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of Oldtown, turning them to shimmering gold dust.  A thin haze hung over everything, thick with smoke from the many chimneys that dotted the skyline, each one a defiant flicker in the endless expanse of grey sky above.  Inside "Miller's Meat & More," Bartholomew "Bart" Miller ran through his daily routine – the rhythmic clang of cleavers against meatbones, the sharp scent of salt and iron, the familiar murmurs of customers – all set to a soundtrack of clanging pots and clattering trays.   Bart wasn’t just any butcher; he was known for his unorthodox but effective method of curing meats.  His secret recipes were whispered in hushed tones amongst food critics, praised by discerning palates, and feared by those who dared question them.  Today was a busy day – the local festival was approaching, and Bart had an army of sausages to make.

Bart paused mid-chop, his brow furrowed. The air wasn't just thick with smoke; it felt charged, as if something hummed just beneath the surface of the world, waiting to burst.  His gut twisted uneasily. He glanced at the clock, a dusty grandfather clock in the corner that had seen many seasons pass. Time was running out.
