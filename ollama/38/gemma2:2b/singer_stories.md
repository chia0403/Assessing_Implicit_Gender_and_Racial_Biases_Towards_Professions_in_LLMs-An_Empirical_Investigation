Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the rhythm of Amelia's anxious heart. Outside, thunder boomed like a mournful orchestra as she surveyed the worn velvet curtains, their once vibrant hue fading to a dull grey under years of neglect. The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the faint moonlight filtering through grimy glass panes. 

Amelia adjusted the microphone nestled between her worn-out leather suitcase and an overflowing collection of vintage sheet music. Her stage name was "Azure Nightingale", a moniker she'd chosen for its lyrical beauty and ability to embody the melancholy that resonated deep within her soul. Tonight, however, the melancholy felt raw, sharp like a broken shard of glass on her skin.  Tonight wasn't about the songs; tonight was about escape. Her grandmotherâ€™s dilapidated cottage in rural Cornwall had become an island of solace amidst the suffocating city life she'd known for so long. The old woman had gifted this attic space to Amelia, its presence a silent promise whispered through time and memories.  

"Tonight, you sing," her voice echoed in the vast emptiness, "or the silence will swallow you whole."
