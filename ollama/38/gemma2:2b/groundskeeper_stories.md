## Story Opening: 

The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was a fragrance Elias Thorne had known all his life; the scent of home, the scent of his grandfather's old farm, now a sprawling estate that bordered the edge of the Whispering Woods. For twenty years, he'd tended this land, carefully carving out his own space within its ancient borders â€“  clearing overgrown paths, coaxing fragile wildflowers into bloom, and battling the relentless march of ivy and encroaching thorns. 

His weathered hands, calloused from years of work, ran through the golden leaves of a towering oak, its gnarled branches casting long shadows across his path. He was a solitary figure, Elias Thorne, the groundskeeper, content with the quiet rhythm of his days and the company of the whispering pines. But today, something felt different. A strange restlessness pulsed within him, a feeling that this peaceful solitude was about to be broken.

The estate is steeped in mystery and old secrets, whispered through generations of families who once called it home.
