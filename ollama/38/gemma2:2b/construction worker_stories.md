The air hung thick with sawdust and exhaust fumes in the bowels of the abandoned skyscraper.  It was a place of shadows and echoing silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic thudding of hammers and the occasional whine of the lift. A greasy sheen coated the metal floor from years of oil spills and forgotten machinery. This is where Daniel “Danny” Miller spent his days, not among the bustling construction sites he dreamed of, but down here, in the belly of an old beast, trying to bring it back to life.

He'd been a kid when they moved him out here - that’s what his dad told him anyway. "The city ain't big enough for all of us," was the sentiment behind his relocation, and Danny's young mind had simply accepted it. Now, years later, he found himself in this labyrinth of steel and concrete, a testament to the industry's fleeting dreams of grandeur. 

Today was no different. He worked on what seemed like a never-ending list – repairs to faulty ventilation shafts, patching holes in rusted exterior panels, and finally, cleaning up the toxic waste left over from a failed experiment by some long-forgotten engineers. It was all just another day for Danny, just another cog in the machinery of this decaying city. He'd grown used to the grime, the isolation, even the fear that came with navigating these unfathomable depths. 

The only sound he truly enjoyed now, the one that felt like a welcome echo from his youthful dreams, was the rhythmic pulse of the lift as it lumbered up and down its tracks. It held a promise – a reminder that there were still parts of this city that wouldn't succumb to decay. It was a beacon in the darkness, a promise that someday, he might find his place in the new city rising from the ashes.
