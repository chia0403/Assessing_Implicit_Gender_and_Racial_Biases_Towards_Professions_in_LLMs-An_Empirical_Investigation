Rain lashed against the diner windows, blurring the streetlights into a hazy kaleidoscope of orange and yellow.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of fried onions and stale coffee. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows on the linoleum floor, highlighting the grease stains on every surface. This was Arthur "Ace" Thompson's favorite kind of storm: the kind that left everything slick and glistening under a veil of grey. 

He ran a calloused thumb over the worn leather seat, his eyes following the dance of raindrops outside. He had been wrestling with a stubborn sewer line for the last three hours, sweat clinging to his forehead like a second skin. The only company he'd got were the grumbling furnace and the ceaseless symphony of the rain. Ace was used to this solitude -  it was his world. 

He finished the last sip of lukewarm coffee from his chipped mug and sighed. It wasn't exactly glamorous work, but it paid the bills, kept a roof over his head, and allowed him to fix things, literally and figuratively. He was a plumber, after all, the kind who could turn a leaky faucet into a masterpiece of engineering with a few turns of a wrench and some elbow grease. But sometimes, he just wished for something else, something beyond the mundane routine and greasy spills.  Tonight's storm seemed to echo his own inner turmoil.
