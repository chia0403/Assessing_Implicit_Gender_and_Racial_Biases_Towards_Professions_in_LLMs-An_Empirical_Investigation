The rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's small cottage, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, the cozy aroma she’d always associated with her secluded home in the Scottish Highlands. But tonight, it felt suffocatingly heavy, mirroring the weight on her shoulders. 

For years, Eleanor had been a beacon of hope for the small village nestled at the foot of Ben Nevis. She treated ailments both physical and emotional, dispensing wisdom earned through decades of patient observation and quiet compassion. Yet tonight, she wasn't treating illness; she was confronting death.

The telegram lay on her desk like a withered rose – a crisp white paper that held the finality of an echoing silence.  The words were stark and undeniable: "Mr. MacLean… succumbed to complications." 
 
Eleanor, known for her unflappable demeanour in times of crisis, found herself struggling against the tide of despair. Her small hands clenched around a worn, leather-bound medical book she’d inherited from her grandfather, its pages whispering stories of countless lives saved and lost within their weathered lines.  Tonight, however, those whispers seemed hollow, their echoes lost in the deafening silence of grief.
