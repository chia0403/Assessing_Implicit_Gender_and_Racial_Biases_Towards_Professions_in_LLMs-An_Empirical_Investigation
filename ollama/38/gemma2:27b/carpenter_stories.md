The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and cedar as Elijah Thorne meticulously sanded the curve of a rocking horse's mane. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its path. Outside, the rhythmic clang of the shipyard echoed across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a bustling coastal town where salt spray mingled with chimney smoke and the cries of gulls. Elijah, his calloused hands gripping the sandpaper, paused to listen, a familiar ache settling in his chest. The sea had always called to him, its siren song weaving through his dreams. Yet here he was, bound to the earth by the weight of his father's legacy â€“ Thorne & Son Carpentry, established 1842.

His workshop, crammed with tools and half-finished projects, felt like a cage sometimes. He longed for the freedom of the open ocean, the wind whipping through his hair as he steered a ship towards the horizon. But responsibility tethered him to Port Blossom, to the steady rhythm of hammering wood and crafting furniture that filled homes with warmth and comfort.

Today was different, though. Today, a peculiar commission had arrived, one that whispered of adventure and perhaps, just perhaps, a chance to escape his earthly constraints.
