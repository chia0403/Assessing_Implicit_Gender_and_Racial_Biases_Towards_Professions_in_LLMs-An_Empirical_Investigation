Rain lashed against the stained glass windows of St. Jude's Pharmacy, blurring the vibrant depictions of saints into abstract watercolour washes. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously counted out thirty-two blue capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic clatter of pills hitting the plastic vial was a familiar comfort in the otherwise hushed space.

Eleanor had inherited the pharmacy from her grandmother, a formidable woman with a penchant for floral prints and dispensing wisdom along with prescriptions. It stood nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint town steeped in history and secrets.  The scent of lavender polish and ancient wood mingled with the faint tang of medicinal herbs, creating a unique aroma that was as much a part of St. Jude's as the chipped counter and dusty shelves stacked high with apothecary jars.

Today, however, Eleanor couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something was amiss. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, but instead of the usual friendly greeting bubbling to her lips, Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine. Turning, she saw a figure shrouded in a dark hooded cloak standing hesitantly by the counter.
