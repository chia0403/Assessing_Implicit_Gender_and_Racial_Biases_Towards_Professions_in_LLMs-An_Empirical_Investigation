Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, mimicking the hammering in his chest. He stared at the flickering neon sign outside – "Thorne Chiropractic: Align Your Life" – its promise feeling hollow tonight. It had been three months since he’d last seen a patient. Three months since the whispers started, swirling around him like the relentless storm outside.

The quaint coastal town of Havenwood, Maine, once a haven for Elias, had become his prison. The accusations were whispered, not shouted, but their venom lingered: “Chiropractor with crooked hands,” they murmured. “Healers can be healers and hurtlers.”


Elias ran a hand through his already disheveled hair. He'd built his practice on trust, on the gentle art of realignment. Now, suspicion gnawed at him, a constant ache more painful than any misaligned vertebrae. 

The bell above the door jingled, startling him. A shadow loomed in the doorway, framed by the rain-streaked glass. It was time to face his fears, whatever lay beyond that threshold.
