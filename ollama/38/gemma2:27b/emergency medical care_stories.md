Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear.  Eliza Marie Santiago, her dark curls escaping from under her EMT cap, wrestled with a gurney overflowing with equipment, navigating the slick sidewalk towards the flashing red and blue lights of the scene. The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid bite of burning rubber. A mangled motorcycle lay on its side, its rider sprawled beside it, unmoving. Eliza's heart hammered against her ribs, a grim counterpoint to the siren's wail. This was what she lived for â€“ the adrenaline rush, the chaotic dance between life and death, the chance to make a difference.

Eliza took a deep breath, steeling herself. Tonight, she would be the hand that reached out from the abyss.
