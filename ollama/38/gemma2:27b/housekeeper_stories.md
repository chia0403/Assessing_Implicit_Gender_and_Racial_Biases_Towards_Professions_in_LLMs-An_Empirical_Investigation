The musty scent of aged velvet and forgotten dreams clung to Elara Thistlewick like a second skin as she navigated the labyrinthine hallways of Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the shafts of morning sunlight slanting through grimy windows, illuminating faded grandeur and whispering tales of a bygone era. Elara, with her weathered hands and a heart as sturdy as the oak banisters she gripped, was no stranger to these whispers. For twenty years, she'd been the silent guardian of Blackwood Manor, polishing its tarnished soul and tending to its overgrown memories.

Today, however, felt different. A tension thrummed through the air, thick as the cobwebs draping the chandeliers. Elara could sense it in the creaking floorboards beneath her feet, hear it in the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the ivy-choked windows. Something was amiss. And for the first time in two decades, Elara Thistlewick felt a shiver of apprehension crawl down her spine.
