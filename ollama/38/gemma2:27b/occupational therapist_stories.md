Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already dismal cityscape beyond. Inside, fluorescent lights hummed, casting an antiseptic glow over the worn linoleum floors and chipped paint. Eloise Finch, her fiery red curls escaping their haphazard bun, adjusted the wheelchair brakes with a sigh.

It had been six months since she’d accepted this position at St. Jude's, lured by the promise of making a real difference in people’s lives. Six months of exhaustion, paperwork, and facing down the bleak realities of recovery for patients ravaged by accidents, strokes, and disease. Today, however, Eloise felt a flicker of hope.  She was meeting Michael O’Connell, a young sculptor whose world had been upended by a car accident leaving him with limited mobility in his right hand.

Eloise took a deep breath, smoothing down her rumpled scrubs. Maybe today she could help Michael rediscover his passion. Maybe today, even amidst the dreary rain and the sterile walls, a spark of creation would ignite.
