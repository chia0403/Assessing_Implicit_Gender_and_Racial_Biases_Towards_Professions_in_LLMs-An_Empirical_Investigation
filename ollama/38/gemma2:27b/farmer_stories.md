The rooster's crow was swallowed whole by the thick fog that blanketed Silas Blackwood's farm like a damp wool blanket. The mist clung to the gnarled branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel at the edge of his field, obscuring its normally majestic silhouette. Silas squinted through the ethereal veil, his breath puffing out in frosty plumes. He could barely make out the rusted fence line separating his wheat from his neighbor's barley. 

The air held a chill that sank into Silas' bones, reminding him that winter was fast approaching. This year, it felt like an unwelcome visitor knocking on his door too early. His harvest had been meager, plagued by a relentless summer drought. The worry lines etched around Silas' weathered face deepened as he contemplated the lean months ahead.  He needed a miracle â€“ a sudden downpour to revive the parched earth, or a buyer willing to pay a decent price for his dwindling grain.
