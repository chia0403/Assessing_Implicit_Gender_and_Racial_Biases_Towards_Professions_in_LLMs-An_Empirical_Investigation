Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop an insistent hammer blow against the fragile peace inside. Dr. Amara Singh traced her finger along the worn spine of a medical textbook, its pages dog-eared and stained with years of sweat and turmeric tea. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and woodsmoke from the makeshift stove in the corner. Outside, the village of Chamba huddled beneath a shroud of monsoon clouds, its narrow cobbled streets slick with mud.

Amara sighed, her breath fogging the single dusty windowpane. It had been three days since the last delivery truck arrived, bringing much-needed supplies and news from the outside world. Now, their stores were dwindling, and the only connection to civilization was a crackling radio perched precariously on a stack of medical journals.

A sudden cough, sharp and insistent, broke the silence. Amara's head snapped up, her gaze drawn to the curtained doorway leading into the makeshift examination room. It was time for another day in Chamba, where hope and despair walked hand-in-hand under a relentless sky.
