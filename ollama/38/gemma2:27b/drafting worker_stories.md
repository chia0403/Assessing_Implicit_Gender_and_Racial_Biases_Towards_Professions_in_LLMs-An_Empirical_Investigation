The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile white glow on Elias Finnigan's cluttered workspace. Blueprints sprawled across his desk, overlapping like fallen leaves, each one a testament to the towering structures he helped bring to life. He traced a calloused finger along the delicate lines of a proposed skyscraper, its steel skeleton reaching for the heavens in his imagination. Outside the window, the gritty cityscape of New Alexandria stretched out before him, a symphony of concrete and glass that mirrored Elias's own passion: building something enduring from the mundane.


But today, the city seemed to press down on him, the constant hum a reminder of the ticking clock, the deadline looming. The new bridge project – his most ambitious yet – was demanding every ounce of his concentration. Every angle had to be perfect, every calculation precise, for this wasn't just about creating a structure; it was about connecting two fractured communities, bridging not only land but lives. Elias leaned back in his chair, the worn leather creaking under him, and took a deep breath, steeling himself for another hour of meticulous work. He had a bridge to build.
