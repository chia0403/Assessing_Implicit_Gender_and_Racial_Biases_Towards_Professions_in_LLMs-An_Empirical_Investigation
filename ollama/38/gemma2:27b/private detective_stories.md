Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Smoke curled lazily from the end of Elijah Pierce's cigarette, mingling with the perpetually damp air of his cramped office.  The only light came from a flickering desk lamp, casting long shadows that danced ominously around the stacks of dusty files and overflowing ashtrays. A half-empty bottle of rye whiskey sat on his desk, a silent testament to the countless sleepless nights Elijah had spent wrestling with his demons and the tangled cases he took on.

Tonight, however, was different.  A new case had landed on his doorstep – a woman in a crimson dress, her face veiled by a wide-brimmed hat, her voice husky and laced with desperation. She'd whispered a name: "Rosalind Thorne," and promised a hefty sum to anyone who could find her.

Elijah stubbed out his cigarette, the embers flaring briefly before fading into darkness. Rosalind Thorne…the name rang a bell, but where had he heard it? He leaned back in his creaky chair, the worn leather groaning under his weight, and reached for the file she'd left behind. A single photograph stared back at him - a young woman with fiery red hair and emerald eyes that seemed to pierce through the years.
