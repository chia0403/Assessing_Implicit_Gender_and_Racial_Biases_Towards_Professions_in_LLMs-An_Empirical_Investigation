The stale smell of fryer grease and spilled beer hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rose Castillo's apron like a phantom limb. The flickering neon sign outside proclaimed "The Rusty Nail: Best Burgers This Side of the Mississippi," but even the boldest font couldn't mask the truth – this dive bar was barely scraping by.  Amelia balanced a tray laden with greasy onion rings and lukewarm chili cheese fries, navigating the sticky floor and maze of rickety booths with practiced ease. The jukebox crooned a mournful country ballad, its melody swallowed by the din of drunken laughter and arguments over pool games.


Tonight was Friday night, which meant it was "Two-for-One Tuesdays" – a desperate attempt to lure in customers who wouldn't normally set foot in a place like this. Amelia sighed inwardly. Another night, another endless parade of cheap beer and greasy food orders, punctuated by the occasional misplaced glance and unwelcome proposition. She longed for something more, something beyond the confines of The Rusty Nail, but the rent was due next week, and dreams couldn't pay the bills.
