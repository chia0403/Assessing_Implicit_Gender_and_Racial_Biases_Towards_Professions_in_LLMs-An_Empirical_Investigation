Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across his cluttered desk, littered with cold coffee cups and case files threatening to spill over. Outside, the neon glow of the city reflected in the puddles, a symphony of sirens and distant shouts adding to the oppressive atmosphere. Tonight, the city felt like a wounded animal, lashing out in pain.

Elias, a man weathered by years on the force, rubbed his tired eyes. He'd been staring at the same crime scene photographs for hours, each gruesome detail etching itself deeper into his mind. A young woman, barely out of her teens, found lifeless in an abandoned alleyway. The brutality of it all gnawed at him, a relentless ache he couldn't ignore. This wasn't just another case; this was personal. 

He had a daughter around the same age as the victim.
