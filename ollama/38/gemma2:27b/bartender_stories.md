The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the ghosts of spilled whiskey. Neon signs buzzed outside the cracked windowpanes of The Rusty Nail, casting an unsettling green hue over Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes' tired face. She wiped down the sticky mahogany counter for the tenth time that night, her movements practiced and weary. It was a Wednesday, which meant slow business – mostly regulars nursing their sorrows and the occasional hopeful tourist lured in by the faded promise of live music on the peeling doorway sign.  

Ellie sighed, pushing a stray strand of fiery red hair behind her ear. The clinking of glasses and muffled conversations formed a dull soundtrack to the night. She glanced at the clock above the liquor shelf – 11:42 PM. Two more hours before closing. Two more hours of pretending she wasn't drowning in a sea of regret and bad life choices.
