The rusty red sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the cracked runway of Dustbowl airfield. Amelia "Ace" Lancaster squinted, her aviator sunglasses barely cutting through the glare. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, mingling with the grime that seemed permanently etched into her face. This desolate stretch of Arizona desert was a far cry from the manicured airfields she'd flown out of during her time in the Air Force, but Ace had learned to appreciate the raw beauty and unforgiving nature of this place.

Today's cargo was different - not crates of munitions or humanitarian aid, but a single, battered biplane with faded green paint and an engine that coughed more than it roared. It was a relic from another era, destined for a museum in Phoenix. Ace wasn't sure what possessed her to take this job, maybe it was the challenge, or perhaps the wistful longing for a simpler time she saw reflected in the biplane's weathered wings. Whatever the reason, she was determined to get that old bird airborne and soaring again.

As she reached up to adjust the harness on her flight suit, Ace felt a familiar thrill course through her veins - the anticipation of the unknown, the raw power of the engine about to roar beneath her, and the freedom that came with soaring above the world. Today was going to be a good day.
