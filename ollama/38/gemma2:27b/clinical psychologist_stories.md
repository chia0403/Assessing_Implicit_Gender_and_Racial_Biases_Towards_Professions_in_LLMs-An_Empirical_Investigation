Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Cavendish's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The plush armchair across from her desk remained empty, its velvet cushion an accusatory splash of burgundy in the gloom.

Eleanor ran a hand through her fiery red curls, frustration twisting in her gut. Three canceled appointments today. It wasn't unheard of, but something about the timing felt off. Like the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to break. Her office, nestled on the fifth floor of an aging brownstone in Boston's Back Bay, usually buzzed with the energy of anxieties and hopes shared. But today, a suffocating silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the insistent drumming of the rain. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock - 4:15 pm. Time for her final session of the day, the one she'd been looking forward to all week: meeting with Daniel Blackwood, a young musician struggling with crippling stage fright. Eleanor hoped she could help him find his voice again, both literally and metaphorically.  

But as the minutes ticked by, a gnawing unease took hold. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.
