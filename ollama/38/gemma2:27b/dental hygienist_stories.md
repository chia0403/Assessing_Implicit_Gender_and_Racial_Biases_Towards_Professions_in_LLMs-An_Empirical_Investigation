Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Lewis's practice, blurring the already dreary view of Elm Street.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, competing with the low thrum of the nitrous oxide machine in the next room. Eloise Beaumont, her blonde ponytail escaping its elastic band, sighed as she stared at the overflowing sterilization tray. Another Tuesday afternoon, another cascade of appointments. 

Eloise wasn't sure what had possessed her to become a dental hygienist. She'd always been fascinated by teeth, their intricate structure and hidden stories.  But lately, the endless scraping, polishing, and flossing felt more like a soul-crushing routine than a passion. Still, Eloise prided herself on doing a good job, on making her patients feel comfortable and cared for. 

Today, though, she felt a nagging sense of unease. The rain outside seemed to mirror the storm brewing inside her.  Something was off.
