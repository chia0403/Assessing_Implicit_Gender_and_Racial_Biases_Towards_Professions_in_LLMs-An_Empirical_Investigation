Rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Elara Finch's office window, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the aging building. The smell of damp plaster and mildew hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from Elara's perpetually-burning candle.  She hunched over her ledgers, the rhythmic scratching of her quill against parchment the only sound louder than the storm's fury. 

The year was 1899, and London was shrouded in a perpetual gloom thanks to the relentless drizzle. Elara Finch, a woman of sharp intellect and even sharper cheekbones, kept the books for a dozen struggling merchants in the labyrinthine alleys of Whitechapel. Her office, tucked above Mrs. Higgins' bakery, wasn't much to look at – cramped, cluttered with ledgers and dusty inkwells – but it was her haven.

A sudden bang from downstairs startled Elara. It sounded like a heavy crate hitting the cobblestones outside. She peered cautiously through the window, peering into the swirling mist. A figure, cloaked in shadow, stood hunched over something on the wet street below.  Curiosity piqued, Elara grabbed her shawl and descended the creaking stairs. The storm seemed to intensify as she stepped out into the night, the rain stinging her face.
