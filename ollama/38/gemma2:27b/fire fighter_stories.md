The acrid smell of smoke stung Elias Thorne's nostrils even before he saw the flames licking hungrily at the old Victorian house across the street. It was barely dawn, the sky bruised purple and orange behind the skeletal branches of bare oak trees. A thin layer of frost still clung to the cracked asphalt road, crunching under the weight of his heavy boots as Elias sprinted towards the inferno.

The siren's wail echoed through the deserted street, a jarring counterpoint to the chirping sparrows that hadn't yet fled the approaching chaos.  Elias could already feel the heat radiating from the blaze even at this distance, the windows glowing molten orange against the darkening sky. His heart hammered against his ribs, adrenaline surging through him.

This wasn’t just another house fire. This was the old Blackwood Manor, a crumbling landmark shrouded in local legends of tragedy and hidden secrets. Elias had heard whispers about it since he was a boy – stories of a family cursed by fire, of restless spirits trapped within its decaying walls. He dismissed them as folklore then, but now, standing before the inferno, a shiver traced its way down his spine.

This wasn't just another call. This felt different.
