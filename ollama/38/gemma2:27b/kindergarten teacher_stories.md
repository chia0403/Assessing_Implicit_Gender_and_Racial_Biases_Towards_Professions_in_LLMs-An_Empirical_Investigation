The pungent aroma of construction glue hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of crayons and the faint whiff of stale juice boxes. Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's kindergarten classroom, illuminating the vibrant alphabet mural adorning one wall and casting dancing shadows on the mismatched tables below. It was a chaotic symphony of giggles, squeaks, and the rhythmic thumping of tiny feet against linoleum.

Eloise, her auburn braid swinging as she bent down to tie a little boy's shoe, couldn't help but smile. Despite the constant organized chaos, this was where she belonged: surrounded by boundless energy, unfiltered curiosity, and the heartwarming innocence of five-year-olds on the verge of discovering the world. Today, however, a subtle unease tugged at her heartstrings. A new student was arriving, and whispers had been circulating among the staff about his unusual circumstances.
