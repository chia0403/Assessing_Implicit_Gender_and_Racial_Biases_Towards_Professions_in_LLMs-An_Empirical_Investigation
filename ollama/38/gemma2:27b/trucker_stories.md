The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Nail Diner cast long, skeletal shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Thunder grumbled in the distance, mirroring the rumble emanating from Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's eighteen-wheeler. Jed sat slumped in the vinyl booth, nursing a lukewarm coffee and staring out at the relentless downpour. He was supposed to be hauling a load of lumber to Springfield by morning, but with the weather showing no signs of letting up, he knew he was stuck for the night. 

Jed sighed, running a hand through his salt-and-pepper beard. The life of a trucker wasn't glamorous. Long hours, endless highways, and greasy spoon diners were the norm. But Jed wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. The open road was in his blood, a legacy passed down from his grandfather who'd driven freight across the country during the Dust Bowl.  Jed just wished this particular stretch of highway hadn't decided to turn into a raging river.
