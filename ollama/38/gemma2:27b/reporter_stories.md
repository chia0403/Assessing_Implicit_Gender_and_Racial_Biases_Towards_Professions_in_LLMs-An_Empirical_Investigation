Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Blue Moon Diner, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the greasy spoon's worn booths and chipped Formica tables. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead, stared into her lukewarm coffee, its surface swirling with oily rainbows. 

The diner was deserted save for Eleanor and Lenny, the grizzled owner who stood behind the counter polishing glasses with a rag that looked older than Eleanor herself. The air hung heavy with the scent of bacon grease and stale cigarettes.  Eleanor wasn't sure why she came to the Blue Moon so often. Maybe it was the familiar misery of the place, mirroring her own mood. Or maybe it was Lenny, who always seemed to know when Eleanor needed a refill or a sympathetic ear.

Today, though, even Lenny’s gruff kindness couldn't penetrate the fog of anxiety swirling within her. The story she was chasing - a possible corruption scandal involving the mayor and a shadowy construction firm – felt like quicksand, threatening to pull her under.
