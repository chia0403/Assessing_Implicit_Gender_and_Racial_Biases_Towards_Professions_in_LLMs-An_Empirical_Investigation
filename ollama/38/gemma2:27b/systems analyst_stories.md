Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's tiny apartment, mimicking the relentless pounding in his head. The flickering neon sign across the street cast an anemic glow over his cluttered desk, illuminating lines of code that swam before his eyes like phantoms. Elias, a man whose world was built on logic and precision, felt a growing unease he couldn’t quite pin down.

He was deep in debugging a complex financial system for Obsidian Industries, a shadowy corporation known more for its secretive dealings than its transparency. The deadline loomed, a hungry beast demanding to be fed with flawless code. But tonight, something felt…off. Strange glitches kept appearing, errors that defied his understanding of the system's architecture. It was as if someone, or something, was deliberately sabotaging his work.

Elias took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising tide of anxiety. He knew he couldn't afford distractions. His career depended on delivering this project on time. But a nagging voice in the back of his mind whispered warnings: there were things about Obsidian Industries that didn't add up, rumors swirling around its CEO, the enigmatic Mr. Alistair Blackwood, and his questionable business practices.

Suddenly, the flickering neon sign outside sputtered and died, plunging Elias into darkness. A shiver ran down his spine as he fumbled for the desk lamp. The silence in the room felt heavy, pregnant with unseen threats. Was it just the storm playing tricks on him? Or was there something more sinister at play, lurking within the depths of Obsidian's code?
