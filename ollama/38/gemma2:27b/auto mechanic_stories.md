The air in Benny "Greasemonkey" Garcia's garage hung thick with the scent of gasoline, motor oil, and something vaguely metallic - the unmistakable perfume of a hard day's work. Benny himself was a walking advertisement for his profession: grease stained overalls, calloused hands, and a mop of perpetually oily hair sticking out from under his faded blue cap.

The sun, already dipping towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the cluttered yard, illuminating a graveyard of rusted car parts and forgotten engines. Benny whistled a jaunty tune as he wrestled with a stubborn carburetor, the rhythmic clang of his wrench echoing in the twilight.

His latest project, a cherry red 1967 Mustang, sat patiently on the lift, its sleek lines promising untold adventures once Benny coaxed it back to life. This wasn't just any car for Benny; it was a symbol of hope, a reminder of a time when dreams seemed within reach.

But today, Benny's usual optimism was tinged with unease. A stranger had arrived earlier that afternoon, a woman with eyes as sharp as shattered glass and a voice as smooth as silk. She offered him a hefty sum to "fix" the Mustang, but her request was cryptic at best: she needed it running "perfectly," by sunrise tomorrow.

Something about the encounter left Benny feeling uneasy, like he'd stumbled into a story with an ending he couldn't quite foresee.  As he tightened the last bolt on the carburetor, a shiver ran down his spine. The Mustang was ready to roar, but what secrets did it hold beneath its gleaming hood?
