The scent of cardamom and ginger hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint aroma of bleach emanating from the industrial-grade kitchen appliances. Anika Sharma, RD, CDE – Registered Dietitian and Certified Diabetes Educator – wrinkled her nose, but not in distaste. It was a familiar olfactory cocktail, one she'd come to associate with both comfort and challenge.

The setting: The bustling heart of "Spice & Soul," a community center nestled in the vibrant, yet often overlooked, neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above stainless steel counters and worn wooden tables piled high with vibrant vegetables – emerald green spinach, ruby red beets, sunshine yellow squash. Today was market day, and Anika was prepping for her weekly cooking demonstration.

Her mission: to demystify healthy eating for the predominantly South Asian community she served, proving that deliciousness and nutrition weren't mutually exclusive. But today, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Her grandmother, Nani Maa – the culinary matriarch who instilled in Anika a love for both food and family – had fallen ill.


Would she be able to inspire others with her recipes when her own heart felt heavy?
