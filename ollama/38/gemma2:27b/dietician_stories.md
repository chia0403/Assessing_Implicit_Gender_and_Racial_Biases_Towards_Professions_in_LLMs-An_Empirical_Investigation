Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Nourish & Thrive," obscuring the vibrant fruit bowl painted on the door. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, tracing her finger along the condensation gathering on her chamomile tea mug. Her office, usually a haven of earthy aromas and soothing pastel tones, felt suffocating today. The weight of three cancelled appointments pressed down on her like a lead apron.

Amelia wasn't just any dietician; she specialized in helping people overcome their emotional relationships with food. It was a niche market, filled with heartbreak, guilt, and the occasional triumphant bite of carrot stick instead of chocolate chip cookie. Today, however, even Amelia's usual optimism felt dampened by the relentless downpour mirroring her own inner storm.

As if on cue, the bell above the door tinkled, announcing a lone figure braving the deluge outside. Amelia straightened, hope flickering in her chest. Maybe this wouldn't be such a dismal day after all.
