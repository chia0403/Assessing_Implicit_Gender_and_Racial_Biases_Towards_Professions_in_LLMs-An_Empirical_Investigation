Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Blackwood's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. The flickering neon sign across the street cast grotesque shadows that danced on the worn Persian rug, a relic from a time when his practice was thriving. Now, the mahogany desk was cluttered with overdue bills and half-eaten takeout containers, testaments to sleepless nights spent chasing dwindling cases.

Alistair ran a hand through his greying hair, the weight of his current predicament pressing down on him. He had been known as "The Hammer" in his younger days, renowned for his aggressive courtroom tactics and unwavering pursuit of justice. But years of disillusionment and ethical compromises had chipped away at his idealism, leaving behind a jaded shell of the man he once was.
