The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins before the sight did. It was a greasy, metallic tang that clung to the back of his throat like cheap gin. Bart grimaced, adjusting his tool belt and hauling himself up the creaky wooden stairs leading to Mrs. Henderson's basement.  He squinted in the dim light filtering through the cobwebbed windowpane, trying to make sense of the tangle of rusted pipes snaking across the concrete floor. 

This wasn't Bart's first rodeo â€“ he'd seen his fair share of plumbing nightmares in his twenty years on the job. But something about this basement felt...off. A shiver prickled down his spine as he heard a faint, rhythmic dripping echoing from somewhere deep within the bowels of the house. It sounded almost like...a heartbeat.

Bart shook his head, dismissing the thought as fatigue-induced paranoia. He was just tired. This was the third call of the day, and each one seemed to involve plumbing disasters of increasingly epic proportions. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something strange was afoot in Mrs. Henderson's basement. Something beyond a simple clogged drain.
