The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the mountain of discount candy bars piled precariously beside the register.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, which meant the usual lull before the after-school rush. Amelia idly tapped her manicured nails on the scratched countertop, her gaze drifting towards the rain-streaked window overlooking the desolate strip mall parking lot. The only sound besides the monotonous hum was the occasional "ding" of the door opening and closing as solitary customers wandered in and out, searching for solace in the aisles crammed with discounted bath towels and novelty mugs.

Amelia sighed, wishing she were anywhere but here.  She dreamed of dusty bookstores overflowing with forgotten tales, cobblestone streets echoing with laughter, and maybe even a touch of magic sprinkled in for good measure. But reality was the sticky residue on her fingers from scanning endless cans of beans and the weary ache in her feet from standing for hours on end.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival.  Amelia straightened up, plastering on her best customer service smile as a figure emerged from the gloom outside, their silhouette shrouded by the rain.
