The acrid smell of dust and sweat hung heavy in the air of Elias Thornwood's workshop. Sunlight, fractured by stained glass panes above, painted colorful stripes across the rough-hewn floor. Elias himself, his face grimy with granite grit and etched with years of toil, knelt beside a massive block of Carrara marble, his chisel whispering against the stone like a lover's secret. He was carving an angel, its wings poised for flight, its expression serene despite the chaos of creation swirling around it. 

Outside, the clangor of the city – Florence in all its bustling glory – rose and fell like the tide. Merchants hawked their wares, children shrieked with laughter, and the rhythmic thud of a blacksmith's hammer echoed from down the narrow cobblestone street. But within Elias' workshop, time seemed to stand still. It was just him, his tools, and the silent promise of beauty struggling to be released from the heart of the stone.
