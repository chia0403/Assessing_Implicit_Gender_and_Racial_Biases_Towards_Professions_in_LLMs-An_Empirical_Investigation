The Grand Blackwood Hotel, perched on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a monument to faded grandeur. Its once pristine facade was now pockmarked with salt stains, and peeling paint clung to the ornate balconies like scabs. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of dust and mothballs, punctuated by the occasional squeak of a rusty trolley wheel.

Elias Thorne, a lanky young man with a mop of perpetually disheveled brown hair, pushed a groaning luggage cart through the cavernous lobby. The worn red carpet beneath his feet felt like sandpaper against his threadbare shoes. Elias had been a bellhop at the Blackwood for three months, long enough to know that the guests who checked in were as varied and peculiar as the chipped china figurines lining the dusty shelves. Today was no exception. A woman with hair the color of storm clouds and eyes that glittered like ice chips stood impatiently by the registration desk, clutching a battered suitcase adorned with faded travel stickers. She looked out of place amidst the Blackwood's melancholic atmosphere, a vibrant splash of scarlet against the dull backdrop. Elias knew, from the way she tapped her manicured nails on the mahogany counter, that this guest wasn't going to tolerate any delays.

He braced himself for the inevitable interrogation about room preferences and amenities, hoping he wouldn't get stuck carrying her luggage up to the top floor - a feat that often left him gasping for breath and cursing the Blackwood's antiquated elevator. As he approached, he couldn't shake the feeling that this woman was not just any guest; there was something about her piercing gaze that made Elias feel like he was being seen through, his every thought laid bare.
