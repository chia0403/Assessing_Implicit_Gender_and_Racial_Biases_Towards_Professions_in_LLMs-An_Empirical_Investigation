The air hung heavy with pine needles and woodsmoke as Jeremiah "Red" Blackwood wrestled another Douglas fir to the ground. Sweat stung his eyes, mingling with the grime ingrained on his face. The sun, a pale disc through the towering canopy, cast long shadows across the clearing. He could hear the rhythmic whine of his chainsaw echoing off the ancient redwoods that ringed the logging site â€“ giants silent and watchful over the domain they'd ruled for centuries.

But today, it was just him, alone in the heart of the Emerald Forest. An uneasy feeling tightened in his gut. Something wasn't right.
