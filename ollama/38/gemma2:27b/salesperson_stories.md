Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Earl's Emporium," a dusty antique shop crammed with forgotten treasures and the ghosts of bygone eras. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead and mascara running in streaks down her cheeks, glared at the overflowing gutters outside. Another dreary Tuesday in Port Blossom, Maine â€“ a town so steeped in salt spray and melancholy it felt like it was perpetually caught in a drizzle. 

Eleanor sighed, straightening a chipped porcelain doll with unsettlingly vacant eyes. As the shop's sole salesperson, she was used to slow days. Her livelihood depended on tourists stumbling upon Earl's Emporium while searching for seashells or lobster rolls. But today, even the seagulls seemed reluctant to brave the storm. 

The bell above the door jingled faintly, startling Eleanor from her thoughts. A figure stood silhouetted against the grey light, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Eleanor plastered on her best smile, hoping it wouldn't drip off like the mascara. "Welcome to Earl's Emporium! Can I help you find something special?"
