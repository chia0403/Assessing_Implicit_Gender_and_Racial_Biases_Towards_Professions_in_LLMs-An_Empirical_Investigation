The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and formaldehyde, a peculiar combination that Amelia Rose Cartwright had come to associate with both comfort and chaos. Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye," nestled in a vibrant corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, buzzed with activity.

She was renowned for her transformative touch, able to coax beauty from even the most unruly of tresses. But today, a shadow hung over her normally effervescent spirit. A cryptic message scrawled on a dusty mirror in her salon's back room threatened to disrupt the joyous revelry and unravel Amelia's carefully crafted world.
