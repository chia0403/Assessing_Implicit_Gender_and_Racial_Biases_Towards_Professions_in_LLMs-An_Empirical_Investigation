Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the Parisian skyline into an impressionistic smear of grey and gold. Inside, however, the lobby hummed with opulent warmth. A fire crackled merrily in the marble hearth, casting flickering shadows across the plush velvet armchairs and the gleaming brass lamps that adorned every surface.  

The air was thick with the scent of lilies, mingled with a subtler hint of cigar smoke drifting from the nearby gentleman's lounge. Above the murmur of polite conversation and the gentle clinking of crystal glasses, the soft tinkling melody of a grand piano filled the space. 

Standing ramrod straight behind the mahogany concierge desk, his crisp white uniform immaculate despite the dampness seeping in from the cobblestone streets outside, was Jean-Luc Dubois. He surveyed the scene with a calm, almost hawk-like gaze. His silver hair, meticulously swept back, contrasted sharply with his youthful, sapphire blue eyes, which darted between guests with an uncanny ability to anticipate their every need before they even voiced it. For thirty years, Jean-Luc had been the heart and soul of the Grand Blackwood, a silent guardian ensuring its guests' comfort and discretion in equal measure.
