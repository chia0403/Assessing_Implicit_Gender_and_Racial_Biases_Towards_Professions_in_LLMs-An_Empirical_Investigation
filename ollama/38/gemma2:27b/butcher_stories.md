The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary, a familiar perfume that clung to Barnaby Quince like a second skin. His hands, calloused and scarred from years wielding cleavers and bone saws, moved with practiced ease as he divided a hefty side of beef into primal cuts. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of Quince's Butcher Shop, illuminating motes of blood-red dust dancing in the air. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oldhaven bustled with the morning market, but inside Barnaby’s world was one of hushed precision and the rhythmic thud of cleaver on bone. 

A bell tinkled above the door, momentarily shattering the quiet. Barnaby didn't need to look up to know who it was. Mrs. Hawthorne, her silver hair piled high atop her head like a meringue, always arrived precisely at ten o’clock for her weekly supply of lamb chops. He smiled, knowing she’d complain about the price yet again, but secretly relishing their familiar banter.

But today, something felt different. A tremor ran through the floorboards, subtle but undeniable. Barnaby paused, cleaver hovering mid-air, a prickle of unease crawling up his spine.  He glanced towards the door, the bell still swaying gently. Outside, the market seemed to hold its breath, the usual cacophony muted as if the world itself were listening.
