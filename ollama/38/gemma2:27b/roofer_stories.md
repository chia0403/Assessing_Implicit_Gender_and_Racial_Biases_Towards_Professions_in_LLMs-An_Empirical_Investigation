The August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled a bundle of asphalt shingles onto the steeply pitched roof. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy skyline of Baltimore. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of a thunderstorm that never seemed to break. Eli, perched precariously on the ridge, squinted at the horizon, hoping for even the slightest breeze to cut through the stifling humidity.

He'd been working on this Victorian row house for three days, replacing the entire roof after a particularly nasty hail storm ripped through the neighborhood. The homeowner, an elderly woman named Mrs. Goldstein, was anxious to get it done before the fall rains set in. Eli understood â€“ he'd seen enough leaky roofs in his lifetime to know how quickly a small problem could turn into a disaster.

He adjusted his grip on the shingles, hauling them towards the edge of the roof where his partner, Marco, waited. Marco was younger than Eli, with a wiry build and boundless energy. He whistled cheerfully as he hammered down the previous row of shingles, seemingly unfazed by the oppressive heat.
