The fluorescent lights flickered above Elias Bartholomew Finch III, casting his shadow in a grotesque dance across the chipped linoleum floor. The air hung thick with the smell of stale sweat, disinfectant, and something faintly metallic - a reminder of last week's unfortunate incident involving a rogue weightlifter and a poorly secured barbell. Elias sighed, tucking a stray strand of grey hair behind his ear. Another night shift at the Iron Temple Gym, another symphony of clanking weights, guttural grunts, and the rhythmic thump of treadmills. He wasn't complaining - well, not too much. The quiet hours allowed him to contemplate life's mysteries, like why people insisted on leaving their sweat-soaked towels scattered across the floor instead of using the designated bins.

Tonight, however, a strange unease gnawed at him. As he mopped up a puddle of protein shake near the free weights, he swore he heard a faint whisper echoing from the darkened cardio room. It sounded like... a name? He paused, listening intently. The only sound was the steady whirring of the air conditioning unit. Elias shook his head, attributing it to fatigue. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.
