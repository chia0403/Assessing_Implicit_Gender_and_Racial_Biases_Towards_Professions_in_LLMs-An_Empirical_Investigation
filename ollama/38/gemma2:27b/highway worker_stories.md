The sun beat down on Theodore "Theo" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already ruddy skin the color of overripe tomatoes. Theo swatted at a persistent fly buzzing around his ear as he squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him. The Nevada desert shimmered in the heat haze, distorting the distant mountains into jagged, wavering shapes.

Theo was part of a three-man crew tasked with patching up a particularly nasty stretch of Highway 50, notorious for its bone-jarring potholes and tendency to swallow tires whole. Today's job involved replacing a section of pavement torn apart by a rogue semi-truck. The air hung thick with the smell of tar, diesel fuel, and sweat. Theo wiped his brow with a greasy rag, his calloused hand leaving streaks of black across his forehead.
