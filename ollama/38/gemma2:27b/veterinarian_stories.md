Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop echoing like a drumbeat through the dimly lit waiting room. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead. It was one of those nights where the storm seemed to mirror the unease churning in her gut. 

The clinic, nestled on the edge of sleepy Oakhaven, was usually bustling with furry patients and their worried owners. Tonight, however, only an elderly Beagle named Winston lay whimpering softly on a worn blanket. His owner, Mrs. Higgins, a woman weathered by years but radiating warmth, sat beside him, gently stroking his head.

Amelia glanced at the clock – almost 10 pm. She should be home curled up with a book and a cup of chamomile tea. But Winston's whimpers tugged at her heartstrings. He was clearly in distress, and Amelia couldn't bring herself to send them home into the storm. This was why she’d chosen this life - to ease the suffering of creatures great and small, even on stormy nights like this.
