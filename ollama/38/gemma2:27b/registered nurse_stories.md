The harsh fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Emergency Room buzzed overhead, their monotonous hum punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the occasional groan from a patient in pain. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her name tag pinned crookedly to the pale green scrubs, leaned against the nurses' station, exhaustion pulling at her eyelids like invisible weights.  She'd been on her feet for twelve hours straight, navigating a relentless tide of broken bones, allergic reactions, and anxiety attacks. The ER was her battleground, and tonight, she felt the familiar sting of defeat.

The doors flew open with a whoosh, revealing a frantic young man carrying an unconscious woman in his arms. Amelia straightened up, the weariness momentarily forgotten as her years of training kicked in. This was why she did this â€“ to be there when people needed her most. She took a deep breath and prepared to meet the storm.
