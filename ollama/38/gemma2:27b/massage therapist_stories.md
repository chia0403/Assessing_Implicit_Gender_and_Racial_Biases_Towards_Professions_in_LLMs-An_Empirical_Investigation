Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Eliza "Ellie" Beaumont's tiny massage therapy room. The rhythmic drumming was almost comforting, masking the nervous flutter in Ellie's stomach.  She sat perched on the edge of her worn leather stool, nervously smoothing down the folds of her lavender linen tunic. Today was the day. After years of building her practice from scratch, she was finally hosting her first workshop: "Release and Renew: A Journey Through Self-Care Massage."

The quaint room, tucked away above a bustling antique shop in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, exuded warmth despite its modest size. Dried lavender bundles hung from the exposed rafters, their scent mingling with the faint aroma of sandalwood oil. Soft, amber lighting bathed the space, illuminating shelves stacked with hand-crafted soaps and beeswax candles. Ellie glanced at the empty chairs arranged in a circle on the worn oak floor, her heart sinking slightly. Only three participants had registered. Still, she wouldn't let doubt dampen her spirit. This workshop was her chance to share her passion for healing touch, to empower others to find solace and strength within themselves.
