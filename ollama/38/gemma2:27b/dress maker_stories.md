Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the rhythm of Eloise Beaumont's frantic needlework.  The cramped space, smelling faintly of lavender and mothballs, was bathed in the warm glow of a single oil lamp, illuminating spools of silk thread in jewel tones and bolts of shimmering fabric stacked haphazardly against the sloping walls. Outside, the cobbled streets of Paris were slick with storm water, but inside Eloise's world, all that mattered were the delicate pleats she was coaxing into existence on a gown destined for Madame Dubois, a notorious courtesan known for her extravagant taste.

Eloise, her auburn hair escaping its braid and wisping around her face, bit her lip in concentration. This commission was crucial - it could mean the difference between scraping by and finally affording to move her atelier out of this drafty attic.  She had poured all her skill and artistry into the gown, dreaming of the moment Madame Dubois would slip into its luxurious embrace and gasp at its ethereal beauty.
