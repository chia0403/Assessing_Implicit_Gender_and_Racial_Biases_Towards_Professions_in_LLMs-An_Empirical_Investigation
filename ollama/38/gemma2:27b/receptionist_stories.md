The insistent chirp of the antique cuckoo clock pierced through Evelyn Penelope Hawthorne's haze of paperwork. Three o'clock sharp. Time for the afternoon rush. Evelyn sighed, pushing her spectacles back up the bridge of her nose and straightening the already immaculately aligned pens on her mahogany desk. The Grand Blackwood Hotel, a behemoth of Victorian grandeur overlooking the windswept Cornish coast, hummed with anticipatory energy. Seagulls squawked outside, their cries echoing through the opulent lobby where Evelyn reigned supreme. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine as she glanced at the clock again. Three-oh-five. The afternoon rush was late.
