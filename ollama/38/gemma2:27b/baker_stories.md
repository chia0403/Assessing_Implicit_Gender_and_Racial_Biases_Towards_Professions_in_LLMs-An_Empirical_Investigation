The aroma of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne like a comforting perfume. Outside, rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the vibrant hues of the painted storefront: Buttercup Yellow with gingerbread trim. It was a Tuesday morning, just past dawn, and Eloise was already on her third batch of sourdough, her hands dusted with flour as she expertly kneaded the dough, feeling its resilience yield under her touch.

The rhythmic thump of her movements echoed in the quiet bakery, punctuated by the occasional hiss of steam escaping from the oven. Eloise loved these early hours, the solitude allowing her to connect with the rhythm of baking, a meditative dance between ingredients and intuition. Today, however, a nervous flutter stirred in her chest. It was the day she would finally unveil her new creation: lavender-honey croissants, inspired by the fragrant blooms spilling over the wall of her neighbor's garden.
