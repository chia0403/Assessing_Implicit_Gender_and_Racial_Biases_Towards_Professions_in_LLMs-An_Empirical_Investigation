Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound.  The air hung thick with the mingled scents of hay, damp earth, and something faintly metallic â€“ fear. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne crouched beside Buttercup, her ginger tabby cat trembling violently in Ellie's arms.  

Buttercup was normally a fearless creature, the self-proclaimed queen of the ramshackle animal sanctuary Ellie called home. But tonight, even she seemed cowed by the howling wind and the flashes of lightning that illuminated the storm clouds gathering over the rolling hills of Yorkshire.


Ellie stroked Buttercup's fur, whispering soothing words into her ear.  She knew this storm was more than just bad weather; it held an unsettling energy, a prickling sense of danger. 

Her sanctuary housed a menagerie of rescued creatures: a one-eyed sheepdog named Patch, a flock of skittish hens, and even a grumpy old badger Ellie fondly called Mr. Grumbles.  She felt responsible for each and every one, a duty she took seriously, but tonight, that responsibility felt heavier than usual.
