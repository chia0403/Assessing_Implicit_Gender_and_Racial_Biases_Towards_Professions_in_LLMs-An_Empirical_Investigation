The insistent chirping of cicadas filled the humid Louisiana air, their song punctuated by the occasional croak of a bullfrog from the swamp bordering Dr. Eliza Benoit's clinic. Eliza wiped the sweat gathering on her brow with the back of her hand, the thin fabric of her scrubs already clinging uncomfortably. The waiting room was packed, as usual, filled with the worried murmurs and shuffling feet of Bayou des Anges' residents seeking relief from everything from heatstroke to snakebites.

Eliza wasn't just a physician assistant; she was a lifeline in this remote corner of Louisiana. Her patients trusted her implicitly, their weathered faces reflecting years spent battling the elements and the occasional gator. Today, however, Eliza felt a knot of unease tightening in her chest. The last few weeks had seen an unusual surge in cases, people presenting with strange symptoms â€“ fever, disorientation, even hallucinations.

She glanced at the chart on her desk: Marie Dupree, 62, complaining of tremors and vivid nightmares. Eliza knew Marie well; a kind, gentle woman who ran the local bakery. To see her struggling like this was unsettling.  Eliza took a deep breath, reminding herself that she couldn't afford to be rattled. She needed to focus, find answers, before whatever was plaguing Bayou des Anges claimed another victim.
