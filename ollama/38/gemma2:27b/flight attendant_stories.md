The recycled air hummed with a low thrum that resonated deep in Amelia Kensington's chest. It was a familiar sound, one she'd grown accustomed to over her five years as a flight attendant for SkyReach Airlines. Yet, today, the hum seemed louder, more insistent, mirroring the unease bubbling in her stomach.

Amelia smoothed down her navy blue uniform, the crisp fabric doing little to quell the tremor in her hands. They were preparing for takeoff from Heathrow, London bound for Tokyo. The usual pre-flight jitters were amplified today, a strange sense of foreboding clinging to her like a second skin. Outside the window, dusk painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, the city lights twinkling like fallen stars below.  

She caught the eye of Captain Reynolds across the aisle, his weathered face creased with a reassuring smile. He gave a small nod, his unspoken message clear: *We've got this.* But Amelia wasn't so sure. Something felt off, a subtle dissonance in the rhythm of the routine that set her teeth on edge.
