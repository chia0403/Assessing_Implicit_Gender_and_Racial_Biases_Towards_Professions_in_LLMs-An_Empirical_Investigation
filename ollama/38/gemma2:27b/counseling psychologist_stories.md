Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dreary cityscape beyond. The low rumble of thunder echoed through the concrete walls, mirroring the unease churning in Eleanor's stomach. Her client, a young man named Lucas, sat across from her, picking nervously at a frayed thread on his worn jeans.  He hadn't spoken for five minutes, staring into the distance with eyes that held a haunting mix of fear and exhaustion. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her seat, fought the urge to fill the silence. This wasn't her first rodeo – she'd seen countless patients grappling with their demons – but something about Lucas felt different, heavier.

The air in the small, book-lined office crackled with unspoken tension. The aroma of chamomile tea, usually a comforting scent, seemed to hang thick and cloying. Eleanor took a deep breath, reminding herself to be patient. "Lucas," she began softly, her voice barely audible over the rain's relentless drumming, "you don't have to rush. We can take things at your own pace."  

She watched him closely as he finally lifted his gaze, his blue eyes meeting hers with a flicker of desperate hope. The question hung unspoken in the air: would she be able to help him navigate the darkness threatening to consume him?
