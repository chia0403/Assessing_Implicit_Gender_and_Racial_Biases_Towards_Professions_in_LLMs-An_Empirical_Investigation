The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Elias Finch like a second skin as he wrestled with the tangle of wires beneath the old Zenith console.  His workshop, tucked away in a dusty corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a symphony of clicks and whirs, punctuated by the occasional exasperated grunt from Elias himself. Outside, jazz music bled through the open window, a joyful counterpoint to the tense silence within.

Elias, with his grease-stained fingers and perpetually furrowed brow, wasn't exactly known for his easygoing nature.  But beneath his gruff exterior beat a heart devoted to the magic of sound â€“ the way it could transport you across continents, weave stories into thin air, or simply offer solace in the stillness of night.  Today, however, the Zenith was proving stubbornly resistant, its innards refusing to cooperate with Elias's expert touch.

A bead of sweat trickled down his temple as he adjusted a capacitor, muttering under his breath about "stubborn tubes" and "faulty wiring."  The clock on the wall ticked past noon, reminding him of the deadline looming: Madame Evangeline, the city's most renowned fortune teller, was expecting her radio repaired by nightfall.
