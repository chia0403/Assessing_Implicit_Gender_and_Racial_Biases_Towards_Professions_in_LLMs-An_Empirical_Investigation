Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. Inside Sunnyside Daycare, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale crayons and disinfectant. Emilia Cartwright, her bright red hair escaping its braid and plastered to her forehead, sighed as she mopped up another puddle of spilled juice. Three-year-olds were like tiny, sugar-fueled tornadoes, leaving a trail of chaos in their wake.

Today was particularly trying. The usual assistant, Mrs. Henderson, had called in sick, leaving Emilia to wrangle the dozen energetic toddlers solo. She surveyed the scene: Leo was attempting to climb the bookshelf, Maya was smearing peanut butter on her face instead of her bread, and Liam was sobbing uncontrollably because someone had dared to touch his beloved toy truck.

Emilia took a deep breath, reminding herself why she loved this job. Sure, it was exhausting, messy, and often felt like controlled pandemonium, but there was something incredibly rewarding about nurturing these little minds and watching them grow.
