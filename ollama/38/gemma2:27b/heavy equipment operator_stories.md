The air hung thick with diesel fumes and the scent of pine needles, a familiar cocktail to Elias "Eli" Blackwood. Sunlight glinted off the dusty windshield of his Caterpillar D8R bulldozer, turning the world outside into a hazy kaleidoscope of greens and browns. The engine rumbled beneath him, a steady heartbeat in the stillness of the pre-dawn forest. Eli gripped the control levers, his calloused hands sure and strong. Today was a big day. 

He was carving a new path through the dense wilderness of northern Idaho, clearing land for a long-awaited logging operation. The contract was lucrative, promising enough to finally buy that beat-up Ford truck he'd had his eye on. But more importantly, it meant proving himself â€“ proving to his father, a man whose gruff silence spoke louder than any words, that Eli could handle the weight of Blackwood Timber, the family business he hoped one day to inherit.
