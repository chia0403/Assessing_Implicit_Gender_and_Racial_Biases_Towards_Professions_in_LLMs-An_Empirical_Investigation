The air in the showroom hung thick with the smell of polished mahogany and regret. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her perfectly coiffed blonde bob, fighting down the wave of nausea that rose each time she passed another pristine, untouched car.  It was Wednesday afternoon at Auto Palace Motors, and business had been as sluggish as a Ford Pinto on a hill.

Eleanor was desperate for a sale. Her commission this month was pitiful, barely enough to cover her rent, let alone the expensive lip gloss she swore was vital for maintaining her professional image.  Her boss, Mr. Bartholomew "Big Bart" Higgins, wasn't known for his patience, and Eleanor had a sinking feeling he wouldn't hesitate to replace her with someone more... successful.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the lot, turning the once gleaming chrome into dull reflections of a fading hope. Outside the showroom window, a stray cat hissed at a discarded pizza box, its mournful meow echoing the emptiness in Eleanor's heart.  She knew she had to make something happen. 


Someone. Anything.
