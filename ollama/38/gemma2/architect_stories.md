Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Amelia Everly's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The city lights blurred into streaks of neon as thunder rumbled, casting an unsettling glow on the half-finished blueprints spread across her mahogany desk.  Amelia, a rising star in the architectural world, stared at the plans for the Apex Tower, her latest and arguably most ambitious project. A sleek, futuristic skyscraper designed to pierce the clouds, it was meant to be her masterpiece – a testament to innovation and elegance. But now, staring at the tangled lines and disjointed sections, she felt a growing sense of dread. The client, a notoriously demanding billionaire with an iron grip on his vision, had just delivered another round of revisions, each one more outlandish than the last.  

Amelia's office was perched high above the city in the Skylight Building, a sleek Art Deco structure that seemed to defy gravity with its cantilevered wings and panoramic views. It was a space designed for creativity – bathed in natural light during the day, it transformed into a haven of warm, incandescent glow at night. But tonight, the storm outside mirrored Amelia's inner turmoil. The city below hummed with life, oblivious to the battle raging within her: the clash between artistic integrity and commercial pressure.
