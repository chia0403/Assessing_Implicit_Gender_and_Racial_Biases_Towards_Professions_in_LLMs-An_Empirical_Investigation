The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office was thick with the scent of antiseptic and nervous sweat. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the space between the gleaming machines and worn orthopedic charts.  Eleanor watched as her latest patient, a lanky young man named Daniel, winced as he gingerly shifted his weight on the examination table. 

Daniel had come to her with a torn rotator cuff, the result of a particularly ambitious rock climbing session gone awry. He was a talented climber, she’d learned, and clearly frustrated by his current limitations.  Eleanor met his gaze, her own reflecting empathy and unwavering professionalism. 

“Alright Daniel,” Eleanor said, her voice calm and reassuring, “Tell me about the pain. Where exactly does it bother you most?”


The setting is a small, bustling physical therapy practice in a coastal town in Maine. It's a mix of modern equipment and charmingly outdated decor, reflecting the town’s blend of old-world charm and contemporary life.
