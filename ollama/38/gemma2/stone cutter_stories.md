The quarry air hung thick with dust, the scent of granite and sweat clinging to Elara Thistlewood's roughspun tunic.  A tapestry of sunlight and shadow danced across the uneven floor as she worked, each swing of her hammer a measured thump in the symphony of creation. The late summer sun cast long shadows from the jagged cliffs that towered above, their sheer faces scarred with years of tireless quarrying. 

Elara paused, wiping her brow with the back of her hand.  She squinted at the smooth grey slab she’d been shaping, its surface catching the light like a polished mirror. It was for Lord Auberon’s new fountain, a commission that promised to be both challenging and lucrative. Elara had carved countless monuments and memorials in her time, but this felt different. This was a piece of art, not just stone.  


The sound of hammers ringing out around her faded as she concentrated, her mind lost in the intricate patterns she'd envisioned within the stone. The quarry was usually alive with the chatter of men, but today, an unsettling silence hung heavy in the air.
