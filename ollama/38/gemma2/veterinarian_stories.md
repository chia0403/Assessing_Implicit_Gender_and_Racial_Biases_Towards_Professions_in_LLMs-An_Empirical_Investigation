The crisp autumn air bit at Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cheeks as she stepped out of the small, white clinic nestled against the vibrant hillside. The familiar scent of pine and damp earth filled her lungs, mingling with the faint aroma of disinfectant lingering from inside. Her small town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was a world away from the bustling city where she’d trained, but Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything.

Her eyes swept across the sprawling landscape – golden aspens danced in the breeze, their leaves cascading down onto the worn wooden porch steps. Beyond the town, the towering peaks of Mount Hood and its surrounding volcanic range rose like silent guardians against the azure sky. A lone hawk circled lazily overhead, a stark silhouette against the canvas of the early morning sun. 


Amelia adjusted the collar of her worn denim jacket, a stray leaf clinging to the fabric, and took a deep breath. Today promised to be another day filled with furry faces, anxious owners, and the quiet satisfaction of healing wounds, both physical and emotional. It was a life she wouldn't trade for anything.
