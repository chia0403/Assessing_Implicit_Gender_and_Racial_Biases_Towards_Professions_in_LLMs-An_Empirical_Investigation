The bell above the door chimed with a tired, tinny note as Amelia Rose Hawthorne glanced up from her work. It was just after 8:00 AM, the sun barely peeking over the frosted rooftops of Maple Creek, casting long shadows across her cluttered pharmacy floor. The scent of lavender hand sanitizer mingled with the dusty aroma of old books and the faint metallic tang of cough syrup - a familiar perfume in her little corner of the world.  

Maple Creek was a town where secrets whispered on the wind and time seemed to move at its own, leisurely pace. Amelia, known affectionately as "Rosie" by most townsfolk, had inherited the Hawthorne Apothecary from her grandmother, a woman who believed in the power of herbs and home remedies as much as she believed in community. Rosie carried on that tradition, dispensing both medications and wisdom with equal measure. 


Today, though, something felt different. The air crackled with an unusual stillness, and a prickle of unease danced along her spine.  She couldn't quite place it, but Rosie had a feeling this ordinary Tuesday morning was about to become anything but.
