But even she couldn't mask the exhaustion that had settled deep into her bones.

A whispered rumour about a hidden treasure, a powerful corporation with shady dealings, and a missing heir - it had all the makings of a legal thriller. And Amelia, buried under paperwork for months, found herself strangely drawn to its promise of something more.
