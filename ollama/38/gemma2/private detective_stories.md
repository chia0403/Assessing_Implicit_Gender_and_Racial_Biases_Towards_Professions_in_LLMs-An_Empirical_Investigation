The rain hammered on the corrugated tin roof above Elias Thorne's makeshift office, each drop like a tiny fist pounding on his skull. A symphony of dripping water echoed through the cramped space, punctuated by the occasional groan of the building settling in its weary bones. The scent of stale coffee and despair hung heavy in the air, mingling with the dampness seeping from the cracked windowpanes. 

Elias Thorne, a private investigator whose reputation was built on grit rather than glamour, stared out at the desolate Seattle street below. Neon signs flickered through the deluge, casting garish reflections on the slick asphalt.  It was the kind of night that swallowed hope whole and spat it back out as something bitter and unrecognizable.

The phone rang, its shrill cry a discordant note in the melancholy symphony. Elias snatched up the receiver, his voice gruff, "Thorne." 


He had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another case of a missing spouse or a stolen antique. This call held the promise of something darker, something that would pull him deeper into Seattle's underbelly, where the rain seemed to wash away everything but sin and desperation.
