The aroma of disinfectant and peppermint hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of cinnamon from Eleanor Beatrice Finch's morning tea. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting squares of warmth on the worn linoleum floor of her modest practice. Outside, the bustling town of Oakhaven hummed with the usual Monday morning energy, oblivious to the anxieties brewing within Eleanor's patient-occupied waiting room. 

Eleanor herself felt a knot tightening in her stomach, a sensation that had become increasingly familiar in recent weeks. It wasn't the usual pre-surgery jitters – she was a skilled dentist, after all, with twenty years of experience easing pain and transforming smiles. No, this feeling was deeper, more personal. 

It stemmed from the arrival of Dr. Liam Carter, a handsome young dentist who had set up shop across the street just last month.  His modern practice, filled with sleek stainless steel and digital displays, seemed to be drawing patients away like moths to a flame. Eleanor’s once bustling waiting room was now frequently half-empty, leaving her feeling both frustrated and increasingly insecure about her future in Oakhaven.
