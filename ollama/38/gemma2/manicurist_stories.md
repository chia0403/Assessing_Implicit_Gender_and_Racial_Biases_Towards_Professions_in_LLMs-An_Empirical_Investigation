The air in "Mani-Cure" hung thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine, a heady perfume that clung to Seraphina Celeste's skin like a second layer. She ran a gloved finger over the edge of a chipped nail, her brow furrowed in concentration. The woman sitting across from her, Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop, fidgeted nervously, her gaze darting between Seraphina's focused face and the half-painted nails on her hand. 

Seraphina’s salon was tucked away on a cobblestone street in Greenwich Village, a haven of tranquility amidst the bustling chaos of New York City. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating rows of colorful nail polishes and vintage perfume bottles lining the shelves. Outside, the city hummed with its usual frenetic energy: taxis honked, construction crews clanged, and pedestrians jostled each other on the narrow sidewalk. But inside "Mani-Cure," time seemed to slow down, leaving only the gentle click of clippers and the soft murmur of conversation. 


Today, however, a palpable tension filled the air. Mrs. Winthrop's anxiety was almost tangible, her breaths shallow and rapid. Seraphina knew something was amiss, but the older woman hadn't offered any explanation for her unease. 

"Just tell me what you need," Seraphina said gently, her voice as soothing as warm honey. "Let me take care of it."


Mrs. Winthrop hesitated, then took a shaky breath. “It’s not just my nails, Seraphina. I need...a miracle.”
