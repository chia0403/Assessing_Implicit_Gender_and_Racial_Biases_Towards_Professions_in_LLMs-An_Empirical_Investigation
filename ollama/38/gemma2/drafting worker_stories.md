The air in the workshop hung thick with the scent of graphite and sweat.  Amelia "Amy" Harper squinted at her blueprint, the harsh fluorescent lights casting deep shadows across her face. She was hunched over her drafting table, a tangle of pencils and rulers surrounding her like a fortress of precision. Outside, the city of New Albion pulsed with its usual chaotic rhythm, but here, in the dim recesses of the Drafting Guild's workshop, time seemed to move at a different pace. 

Amy meticulously etched lines onto the translucent parchment, each curve and angle representing another piece of the colossal clock tower that was dominating their collective efforts. This wasn't just any clock tower â€“ it was meant to be a marvel of engineering, a testament to New Albion's burgeoning technological prowess. And Amy, despite her quiet demeanor, was responsible for ensuring every gear, pulley, and cog meshed perfectly. 


This world, a steampunk metropolis on the brink of revolution, buzzed with innovation and invention.  New Albion was a city built upon gears and steam, where clockwork automatons walked the streets and airships skimmed the sky. The Drafting Guild, the heart of this mechanical symphony, existed to translate grand visions into tangible reality. But for Amy, every blueprint felt like a puzzle, a challenge she relished tackling with her tools and unwavering focus.
