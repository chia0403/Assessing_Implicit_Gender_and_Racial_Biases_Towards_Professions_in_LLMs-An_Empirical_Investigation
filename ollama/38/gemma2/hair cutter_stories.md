The air in "Shear Perfection" hung heavy with the scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the haze above rows of colorful bottles lined up like soldiers on the shelves.  

Eloise Penelope Cartwright, known to most as Ellie, expertly snipped away at a young boy's unruly mop of brown curls, humming along to the 70s hits crackling from the vintage radio tucked into a corner. She moved with a practiced grace, her shears singing a quiet melody against the sharp scissors clatter on the metal countertop.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. Ellie paused, glancing up at the figure silhouetted against the afternoon sun.  A woman, dressed entirely in black, stood hesitantly in the doorway, her face shrouded in shadows. A shiver ran down Ellie's spine â€“ something about this woman felt different, off-kilter like a frayed thread on an otherwise perfect tapestry.
