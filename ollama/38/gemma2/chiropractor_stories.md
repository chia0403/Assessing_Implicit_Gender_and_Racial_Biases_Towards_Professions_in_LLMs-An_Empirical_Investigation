The scent of lavender essential oil mingled with the sterile tang of disinfectant hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above the worn Persian rug.  Eleanor, her blonde hair pulled back in a neat bun, surveyed her waiting room. It was quiet this morning, an anomaly for her bustling practice nestled on Main Street in quaint Willow Creek, Oregon. 

The only sound besides the gentle ticking of the antique clock by the fireplace was the faint melody of a bird chirping outside. Eleanor glanced at the schedule pinned to the corkboard. Her first appointment wasn't until ten, giving her a precious hour of solitude before the day truly began.  She took a deep breath, savoring the quiet, knowing that soon enough the familiar symphony of cracking joints and murmured sighs would fill her office once more.
