The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Briarwood's head, casting a sterile glow over the examination room. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee from the break room down the hall. It was 8:15 am, fifteen minutes into her shift at St. Jude's Community Hospital, and already Amelia was feeling the familiar tug of fatigue. Another night on call had left its mark, the memory of a particularly difficult draw still fresh in her mind.

Amelia wasn't one for complaining. She'd chosen phlebotomy because she enjoyed the quiet precision of it, the steady rhythm of needles piercing skin and blood filling vials. It was a simple job, she told herself, yet somehow essential. 

Today, however, felt different. A knot of unease sat in her stomach, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that had nothing to do with the cold steel of the tourniquets she kept neatly arranged on the tray beside her.  She glanced at the patient chart on the wall: Mrs. Eleanor Harding, 72, admitted for routine check-up. Nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
