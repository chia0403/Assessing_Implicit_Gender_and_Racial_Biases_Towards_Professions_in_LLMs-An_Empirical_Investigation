The rhythmic hum of the Himalayan salt lamp cast a warm glow across Amelia Juniper's small office. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of her cozy storefront tucked away on a quiet side street in Wicker Park. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the city lights into a watercolor wash. Amelia inhaled deeply, the scent of lavender and eucalyptus oil grounding her amidst the storm's fury.  She smoothed down her faded lilac scrubs, her hands calloused but gentle from years of kneading tension from weary bodies. A chime announced the arrival of her next client, a woman shrouded in a heavy coat, her shoulders hunched as if carrying the weight of the world on them. 


Amelia smiled, ready to melt away the stress with her signature blend of Swedish and deep tissue massage.  For Amelia, each touch was a chance to help someone find solace, to ease their burden, even for a little while. But tonight, she had a feeling this session would be anything but ordinary.
