The air hung thick with the smell of frying onions and simmering tomato sauce, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach from the perpetually-cleaning manager, Mrs. Periwinkle. The clatter of silverware against plates and the murmur of conversation swirled around Amelia Rose Carter as she weaved her way through the packed tables of "Mama Lucia's," a bustling Italian trattoria tucked into a quiet corner of downtown Chicago. The worn linoleum floor was slick with spilled wine and forgotten marinara, and the walls were adorned with faded photographs of smiling families enjoying plates piled high with pasta. Amelia, with her tired smile and mismatched socks peeking out from under her too-short apron, was a familiar sight amidst the chaos.  

It was a Friday night, the busiest time of the week at Mama Lucia's, and Amelia knew this shift would be a marathon. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along her spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place. It wasn't just the usual thrill of hustling orders and keeping customers happy; there was a deeper hum beneath it all, like the quiet thrumming of an approaching storm.
