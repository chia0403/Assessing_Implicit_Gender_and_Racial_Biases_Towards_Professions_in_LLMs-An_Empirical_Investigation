The rhythmic thump of cleavers against bone echoed through Elias Thorne's shop like a primal heartbeat. He stood in the center, apron stained crimson from yesterday's haul, his face illuminated by the warm glow of hanging lanterns and the flickering flames of the forge nestled in a corner. Outside, the cobblestones of Thistlebrook market were slick with morning dew, reflecting the faint light of dawn creeping over the surrounding hills. Inside, Elias' Butcher's Block was already bustling – a symphony of sizzling fat, clanging knives, and the low murmur of haggling customers.

Elias ran his calloused hand across the counter, feeling the familiar roughness of the aged oak beneath his fingertips. He inhaled deeply, savoring the heady scent of iron, spices, and raw meat that permeated every inch of his shop – a fragrance as comforting to him as his mother's stew on a cold night. But today, there was a different scent in the air, sharper, more unsettling: the metallic tang of blood, not from any animal he had butchered himself. 


Elias Thorne knew something was amiss.
