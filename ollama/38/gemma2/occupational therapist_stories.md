The scent of antiseptic clung to Elara Rose Thorne like a second skin. Not that she minded; it was the perfume of purpose, the aroma of healing. Her office, tucked away in a bustling rehabilitation center overlooking a perpetually overcast London skyline, felt more like her sanctuary than a workplace. The muted greens and blues on the walls calmed the frayed nerves of patients, while the sunlight filtering through the large window painted fleeting squares of warmth across the worn wooden floor. 

Elara glanced at the clock: 8:57 am. Just three minutes until Mr. Davies, a retired accountant with Parkinson’s disease, arrived for his session. She straightened her navy scrubs, smoothing down the white coat that hung open over them.  Her mind, already buzzing with exercises and strategies tailored to his specific needs, settled into its familiar rhythm – a symphony of empathy, analysis, and determination. 


The faint click of the door opening pulled Elara from her thoughts. “Good morning, Mr. Davies,” she greeted warmly, stepping towards the man who shuffled in, leaning heavily on his cane.
