The lobby of The Grandview Hotel buzzed with the kind of low-grade chaos that only came with hosting hundreds of guests simultaneously. Suitcases trundled like metal behemoths, voices competed in an orchestra of clipped conversations and muffled laughter, and the scent of jasmine from the front desk’s overflowing vase mingled with the greasy aroma wafting from the restaurant down the hall.  

Elias Thornhill, or Ellie as his colleagues affectionately called him, navigated this maelstrom with practiced ease. He was a bell hop born and bred, his movements fluid and silent, his eyes constantly scanning for dropped bags or frantic faces. Ellie knew every inch of The Grandview, from the worn grooves in the marble floor to the hidden service passage behind the tapestry in the main hall. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Ellie’s spine, an unsettling sensation he couldn't place. Maybe it was the hushed whispers he overheard amongst the staff about a missing guest, or perhaps it was the peculiar darkness that seemed to cling to the shadows, deepening as twilight settled over the city. Whatever it was, Ellie felt a knot tightening in his stomach, a feeling that this routine night at The Grandview was about to take a very unexpected turn.
