The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Amelia Beatrice Davenport's tidy desk. Its warm glow illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, each particle catching the light like a miniature galaxy. The scent of stale coffee and old paper hung heavy in the air of Mr. Blackwood's office, a familiar comfort to Amelia after twelve years as his secretary.

Mr. Blackwood himself was currently engaged in a heated phone conversation, his voice a low rumble punctuated by the sharp clicks of his antique typewriter. He paced back and forth behind his mahogany desk, scattering papers like autumn leaves.  Amelia watched him with a practiced detachment, her fingers hovering over her own battered typewriter, waiting for the inevitable moment when Mr. Blackwood would snap off the phone and unleash whatever storm brewed within. 

She knew this office well, every creak of the floorboards, every stain on the Persian rug, every faded photograph pinned to the corkboard behind his desk. It was a world unto itself, separate from the bustling city outside the windows, where Amelia rarely ventured past lunch hour. Here, in Mr. Blackwood's domain, she was the silent observer, the keeper of secrets, and the only shield between him and the chaos of the world.
