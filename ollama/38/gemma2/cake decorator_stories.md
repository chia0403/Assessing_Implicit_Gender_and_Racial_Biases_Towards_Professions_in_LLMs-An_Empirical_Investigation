The air in "Flour Power" hung thick with the scent of vanilla, sugar, and anxiety. Emilia Grace Hawthorne, perched precariously on a rolling stool, surveyed her creation with a frown. It wasn't supposed to be this way. The four-tiered monstrosity before her, meant to be a whimsical forest scene for Lord Pembrooke’s grand ball, was a disaster. Instead of delicate sugar mushrooms and buttercream swans, it resembled a warzone of frosting smears and crooked trees. A single rogue marzipan bear glared at Emilia with beady, icing-coated eyes.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cramped bakery in the heart of Brighton. Outside, the quaint cobblestone streets were already bustling with evening life, but inside, it was a battle against the clock and Emilia’s mounting despair. Lord Pembrooke's ball was only twelve hours away, and his cake –  the centerpiece of the evening – was on the verge of becoming an edible catastrophe.
