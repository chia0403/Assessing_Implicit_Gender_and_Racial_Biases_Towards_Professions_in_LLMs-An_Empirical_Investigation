The scent of lilac hung heavy in the air, clinging to the damp cobblestones and whispering through the wrought iron gates of Blackwood Manor. Elara Thistlewood, her linen apron dusted with flour from the morning’s baking, surveyed the sprawling estate with an almost familiar weariness. For twenty years, she had tended to this house, its grand halls echoing with the ghosts of forgotten laughter and hushed secrets. 

Elara knew every creak in the aged floorboards, every crack in the intricate stained-glass windows, every shadow that danced in the twilight. The manor, with its peeling facade and overgrown gardens, held more stories than she could ever unravel. And lately, those stories seemed to be whispering louder, echoing with a new urgency that sent shivers down her spine. Today, as she watered the roses near the south wing, a single crimson bloom fell from its stem, landing at Elara's feet like a whispered warning.  


Blackwood Manor stood on the edge of a sleepy village in Devon, England, shrouded in perpetual mist and an air of melancholy grandeur. The manor’s once-vibrant facade was now faded and marred by time, its windows like watchful eyes peering out into the world.
