The air in "Blushing Belles" was thick with the scent of lavender and artificial cherry blossom.  It wasn't quite the Parisian salon Esmeralda DuBois envisioned when she first opened her doors, but it was home. The once-grand storefront, now nestled between a discount vape shop and a laundromat, boasted faded floral wallpaper and an antique mirror that reflected more chipped paint than clientele. 

Esmeralda, a woman whose auburn hair was meticulously sculpted into an intricate updo and whose perfectly lined lips held a hint of perpetual disapproval, surveyed the scene with a sigh. It was Monday morning, and the only sound besides the hum of the air conditioner was the rhythmic tapping of her manicured nails against the counter. Business was slow, even for a rainy August day in dreary downtown Duluth.
