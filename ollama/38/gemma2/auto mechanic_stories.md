The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and gasoline, a familiar perfume to Elara “Ellie” Vance. Her calloused hands moved deftly around a rusted engine block, her brow furrowed in concentration as she diagnosed a sputtering fuel line. The grease-stained overalls clung to her lean frame, testament to hours spent hunched over engines, coaxing life back into forgotten machines.

Her garage, tucked away on the dusty outskirts of Rustbucket Creek, was Ellie’s sanctuary. A jumble of vintage car parts, tools scattered like fallen soldiers across workbench surfaces, and the rhythmic clang of hammers against metal provided a comforting soundtrack to her solitary world.  The only window in the cavernous space faced out onto a desolate highway, its ribbon of asphalt disappearing into the endless horizon of Montana’s rolling plains. 


Rustbucket Creek wasn't much, just a collection of ramshackle buildings clinging to life along a forgotten route, but it was home. And for Ellie Vance, there was nowhere else she’d rather be than surrounded by the comforting chaos of her garage, her wrench her sword, and every engine her battlefield.
