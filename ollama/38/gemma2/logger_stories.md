The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. Dawn was just beginning to blush on the horizon, casting long shadows through the towering Douglas firs that dominated the Cascade foothills. Dew clung to Elijah Blackwood's beard like frost as he adjusted the straps of his pack, the familiar weight comforting against his broad shoulders. 

Elijah, a man built like an oak himself, ran a calloused hand over the smooth wood of his grandfather's axe, its handle worn smooth by years of use. It was more than just a tool; it was a legacy, a connection to generations of Blackwoods who had felled these giants before him.  This morning, the task felt both daunting and exhilarating: clearing a swathe of ancient timber for the new development on the outskirts of town. As he surveyed the silent forest, Elijah knew this day would be different. He could feel it in his bones.
