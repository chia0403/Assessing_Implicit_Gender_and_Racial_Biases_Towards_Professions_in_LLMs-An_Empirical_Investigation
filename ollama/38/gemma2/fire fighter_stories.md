The acrid tang of smoke clung to Fiona "Fifi" O'Malley's nostrils like a second skin.  It was the smell that had become her constant companion, the scent that defined both joy and terror. Joy because it meant she was doing what she loved: protecting people, battling blazes, being a hero in a moment of chaos. Terror because it often signaled tragedy, loss, the flickering light of life fading out amidst the roaring inferno. 

Tonight, the smell wasn't from a raging fire, but from the smoldering wreckage of a car that had careened off the highway and plunged into the ravine below. The emergency lights from the ambulance cast an eerie, fractured glow on the scene. Fiona stood at the edge of the ravine, her firefighter helmet pulled low over her brow, surveying the mangled metal carcass of the vehicle.  A chilling wind whipped through the valley, carrying with it the whimpers of someone trapped inside.

The setting sun bled crimson across the bruised sky, painting the rugged landscape of the Appalachian Mountains in shades of fire and ash. The town of Harmony Ridge, nestled at the foot of these ancient peaks, was usually a haven of peace, its quaint houses huddled together like comforting friends. Tonight, however, the silence was broken only by the sirens wailing their mournful song and the desperate cries for help echoing from the depths of the ravine.
