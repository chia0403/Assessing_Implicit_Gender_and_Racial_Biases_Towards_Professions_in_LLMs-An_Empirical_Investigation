The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Brighton's head, casting a sterile glow over the interrogation room. Outside, rain lashed against the reinforced glass, mimicking the storm brewing within Amelia. Across the table sat Ethan Caldwell, his face pale and drawn, a stark contrast to the vibrant murals depicting idyllic landscapes that adorned the walls. He was accused of a horrific crime, brutally assaulting his wife, leaving her barely clinging to life. 

Ethan's eyes, however, held an unsettling emptiness. He stared blankly ahead, seemingly oblivious to Amelia's probing questions and the weight of the accusations hanging in the air. His silence was more unnerving than any confession, a chilling testament to the depths of his possible depravity.  Amelia knew she had to navigate this carefully; Ethan wasn't just a suspect, he was a puzzle she needed to decipher. The answers to the brutal crime lay hidden beneath layers of repression and possibly something far darker.


The setting: A cramped interrogation room within a high-security police station in Portland, Oregon, where the relentless rain outside mirrored the tension within the walls.
