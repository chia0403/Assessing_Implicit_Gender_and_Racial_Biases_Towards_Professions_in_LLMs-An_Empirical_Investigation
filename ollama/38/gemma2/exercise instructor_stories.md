The air thrummed with anticipation, thick with sweat and the scent of industrial-strength disinfectant. A disco ball pulsed, casting fractured rainbows across the mirrored walls of "Sweat it Out," the most popular fitness studio in Brighton.  Elara Rosewater adjusted her headphones, the beat of Beyoncé's "Run the World (Girls)" pulsing through them like a jolt of energy. Her smile was bright, but Elara felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Today wasn't just another class; today was her big break – the studio owner had promised to send a video of her session to several major fitness brands. 

Elara surveyed her eager faces, twenty pairs of eyes gazing up at her with hopeful smiles and the promise of a good workout.  The familiar surge of adrenaline kicked in, washing away the butterflies. This was where she belonged, leading these people through their journeys of strength and self-discovery. It was time to run the world.
