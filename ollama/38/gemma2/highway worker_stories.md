The sun beat down on Elias Thaddeus Blackwood’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, each ray scorching through the thin cotton of his work shirt. Sweat beaded on his brow, tracing paths through the dust caked onto his face. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, smearing grime across his cheek.  Elias squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him, a shimmering mirage in the midday heat. 

The highway snaked its way through the desolate expanse of Nevada, flanked by scraggly scrub and skeletal Joshua trees reaching for the unforgiving sky. The air hummed with the drone of passing trucks, their engines groaning like tired beasts hauling unseen burdens across the vast emptiness.  Here, on this stretch of Route 95, Elias was a solitary sentinel, his yellow vest a beacon of warning amidst the desolate beauty. He surveyed the scene with practiced eyes, searching for any imperfection in the asphalt – a crack, a loose gravel, a sign of wear and tear that demanded his attention.


His work wasn't glamorous, but it was honest. And out here, on this lonely stretch of highway, honesty was a virtue more valuable than gold.
