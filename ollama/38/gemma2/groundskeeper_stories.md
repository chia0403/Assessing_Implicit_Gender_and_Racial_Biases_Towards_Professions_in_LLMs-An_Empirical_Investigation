The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  A fine mist hung in the air, clinging to the vibrant red geraniums lining the stone path and swirling around Reginald Bartholomew Thistlewick's ankles as he pushed his ancient wheelbarrow towards the tool shed. 

Reginald, or Reg as most people called him (though Mrs. Haverford insisted on Bartholomew), had been the groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for over thirty years. He knew every inch of this sprawling estate like the back of his hand: the secret grove where shy bluebells bloomed in spring, the gnarled oak that whispered stories in the wind, the forgotten rose garden that held the faint scent of a bygone era. 

Tonight, however, Reg felt an unusual chill settle over him. The usual soothing hum of crickets and owls seemed absent, replaced by an unsettling silence. Even the mist felt heavy with a foreboding he couldn't shake. He hurried towards the shed, his weathered face creased with worry as he fumbled for the latch.
