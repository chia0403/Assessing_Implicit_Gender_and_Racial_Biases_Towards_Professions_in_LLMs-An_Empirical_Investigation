The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and fear in the cramped emergency room at St. Jude's Hospital.  Dr. Eleanor Claire Vance, her normally meticulous auburn hair escaping its braid like unruly tendrils, wrestled with a tangled IV line, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

The ER was always bustling, but tonight felt different – an electric tension thrumming through the sterile space. The city had been hit by a storm earlier that evening, a tempestuous downpour that unleashed its fury on the already struggling community. This influx of patients, many bearing injuries sustained during the storm's chaotic dance, had stretched their resources thin.  Eleanor felt the familiar weight settle on her shoulders – the burden of responsibility for these fractured lives, these stories waiting to be pieced together.

She glanced at the digital clock above the gurney: 3:17 am. Another night, another storm weathered. But this one felt different, as if a darkness had seeped in with the rain, casting a long shadow over St. Jude's hallowed halls.
