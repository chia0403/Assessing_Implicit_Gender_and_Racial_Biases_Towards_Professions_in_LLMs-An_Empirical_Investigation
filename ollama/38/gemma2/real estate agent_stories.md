Rain lashed against the windows of Penelope Everly's office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  The small space, tucked away in a brick building on Elm Street, usually felt cozy and familiar, but today it seemed to be closing in on her. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old windowpanes. It was the kind of storm that made people want to stay inside, curled up with a good book and a warm blanket â€“ anything but face the elements and try to sell houses. But Penelope had a showing at 2:00 PM, one she couldn't reschedule for the life of her.  

The house itself was nestled on a cliff overlooking the churning sea. A sprawling Victorian mansion known as "Seaglass Manor," it was steeped in history and rumored to be haunted. Most people wouldn't dare set foot inside during this kind of storm, but that's exactly what Penelope had to do. She hoped she wasn't going to regret it.
