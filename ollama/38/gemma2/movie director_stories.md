The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Rain lashed against the windows of Stella Maris "Starr" Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. A stack of rejection letters sat on her desk, each one a paper tombstone marking the demise of another dream. 

She lived in a cluttered walk-up apartment above a noisy bodega in Greenwich Village, New York City. Her once vibrant living room had become more akin to a film set graveyard - props from failed shoots littered every surface, forgotten scripts stacked precariously on shelves, and the ever-present scent of popcorn lingered like a phantom memory.  


Stella Maris Thorne was a filmmaker with a vision, but the reality of her situation often felt more like an unedited blooper reel than a masterpiece in progress.
