Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The small space felt suffocating, the plush armchairs draped in dusty velvet offering no comfort. A single lamp cast long shadows on the walls lined with framed diplomas and certificates - each one a testament to years spent studying the human psyche, yet here she was, feeling utterly lost. 

Eleanor's gaze drifted to the worn leather journal lying open on her desk. It belonged to her latest patient, Thomas Blackwood, a recluse who claimed to be haunted by fragmented memories and whispered voices from an unseen world.  His words, initially dismissed as ramblings of a troubled mind, had begun to burrow into Eleanor's own thoughts, leaving her questioning the very fabric of reality she once held so firmly. 

The city outside was a symphony of grey: rain-slicked streets, fog swirling around streetlamps like phantom apparitions. This was Boston in late November - bleak and unforgiving. But tonight, the darkness seemed deeper, more sinister, mirroring the growing unease that coiled tightly in Eleanor's stomach. She knew she should call it a night, but something – perhaps Thomas' plea for help, or her own morbid curiosity – kept her rooted to her chair.  She picked up the journal again, her finger tracing the faded ink of his last entry: 


"The voices are getting louder. They promise answers... if I just listen."
