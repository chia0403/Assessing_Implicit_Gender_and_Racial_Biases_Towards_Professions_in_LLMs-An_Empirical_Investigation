The humid Miami air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez like a second skin. Sweat beaded on her forehead, threatening to drip into her eyes as she crouched beside the body sprawled across the pristine white sand of South Beach. The turquoise water lapped gently against the shore, a jarring contrast to the crimson stain blooming around the victim's chest. The sun, a fiery orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the crime scene. It painted the usual vibrant spectacle of beachgoers in surreal hues, their laughter and music now drowned out by the heavy silence Izzy felt settle over her.  

This wasn't a typical Miami murder. This was personal.
