The salt spray stung Amelia "Ace" Brighton's face as she wrestled the small fighter jet through a tempestuous storm over the Atlantic. Rain lashed against the cockpit canopy, blurring the already-disorienting panorama of roiling grey clouds and churning sea below. The turbulence bucked her like a bronco, each jolt threatening to rip control from her grasp.  

Ace gritted her teeth, her knuckles white on the control stick. Her comms crackled with static, the desperate pleas for rescue from her squadron mates swallowed whole by the howling wind. They were separated, scattered by the sudden storm, and Ace was the only one who had managed to maintain some semblance of radio contact.  

The setting sun bled through the storm clouds in fiery streaks, casting an eerie glow over the churning ocean. It was a breathtakingly beautiful spectacle, but Ace wasn't in any mood for beauty. Her mission - intercepting a rogue weather satellite - now felt trivial compared to the immediate threat of being swallowed whole by the unforgiving sea. 


She had to find her squadron. She had to get through this storm.  And she had to keep reminding herself that Amelia "Ace" Brighton never gave up. Not in the air, and certainly not when the fate of her comrades hung in the balance.
