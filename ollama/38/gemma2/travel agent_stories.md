The air in "Wanderlust & Co." hummed with a low murmur of chatter and ringing phones. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the aroma of cinnamon from the gingerbread-shaped cookies decorating the counter. Sunlight streamed through the large windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above rows of travel brochures.  

Eleanor Beatrice Finch, or Ellie as everyone called her, leaned back in her creaky office chair, a half-eaten granola bar clutched between her fingers. Her bright pink stapler lay abandoned on her desk beside a tangled mess of itineraries and flight confirmations. The constant stream of requests - from family vacations to solo backpacking trips - had left her feeling more like a travel fire warden than an adventure architect. 

Ellie sighed, rubbing her tired eyes.  It was days like this that she questioned her entire career choice. Had she truly been passionate about opening a travel agency? Or had the allure of far-off lands and exotic adventures simply blinded her to the reality of endless paperwork and demanding clients? Perhaps it was time for a vacation of her own. 


This wasn't just any office, though. This was Ellie's dream - built with the savings she'd painstakingly accumulated from years of working as a flight attendant. A space where she could guide others on their journeys, whispering tales of ancient ruins and hidden beaches, and weaving together magical travel experiences.  But right now, all Ellie wanted was to escape the mundane reality of spreadsheets and cancelled flights. 


And then, the phone rang.
