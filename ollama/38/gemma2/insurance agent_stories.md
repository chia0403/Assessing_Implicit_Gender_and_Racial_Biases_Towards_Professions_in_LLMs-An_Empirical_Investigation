The humid Louisiana air hung heavy over Amelia "Amy" Dubois's floral-print sundress as she navigated the bustling French Quarter Market. The scent of beignets, fresh crawfish, and old books mingled in the warm breeze, creating a sensory symphony that both comforted and overwhelmed Amy. She adjusted her straw hat and squinted at the vibrant stall before her, its surface laden with hand-painted voodoo dolls and colorful sachets. It was a far cry from the sterile office of her insurance firm, "Secure Futures," where she spent most days wrestling with spreadsheets and deciphering arcane policy jargon. 

Amy wasn't cut out for the corporate world. She yearned for the warmth and vibrancy of New Orleans, the city that thrummed with life just beneath its quaint, colonial facade. But bills had to be paid, and insurance was a steady gig, if not particularly exciting. Today, however, Amy hoped things would be different. A peculiar case had landed on her desk â€“ a claim for an "unforeseen paranormal event" submitted by the owner of a local antique shop.  


The dusty, cluttered shop was nestled between a creperie and a bustling bar, its windows filled with chipped porcelain dolls and tarnished silver lockets. It felt like stepping into another world, one where stories whispered from the cobwebs and secrets lingered in the air. As Amy approached the counter, she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another claim. This was a plunge into the heart of New Orleans' magic, and she had a front-row seat.
