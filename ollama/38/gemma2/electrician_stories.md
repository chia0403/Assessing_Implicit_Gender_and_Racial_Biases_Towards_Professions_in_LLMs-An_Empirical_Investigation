The humid Florida air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and impending rain. Rain that never seemed to come in this part of the Keys, only brewed like a simmering pot, threatening but ultimately elusive. Elias "Eli" Blackwood wiped sweat from his brow, squinting at the tangle of wires spilling out from the rusted hulk of a fishing boat named "The Salty Siren." 

This wasn't Eli's usual gig. He preferred the clean lines and predictable wiring of a modern home over the chaotic jumble of marine electrical systems. But Captain Miguel, a gruff man with eyes as deep and blue as the ocean itself, had promised him triple his usual rate. And frankly, after his ex-wife had cleaned him out in the divorce, triple anything sounded pretty good. 


Eli ran a calloused hand over the corroded metal casing of a control panel, its faded paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  The "Salty Siren" looked like she'd seen her fair share of storms, and Eli suspected her electrical system was just as battered.
