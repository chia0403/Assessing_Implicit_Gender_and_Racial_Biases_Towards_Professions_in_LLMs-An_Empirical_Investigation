The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of fresh pine.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Elijah Thorne's workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the warm breeze. Outside, the quaint seaside town of Oakhaven hummed with its usual morning bustle. Seagulls cried overhead, fishermen cast their lines into the shimmering harbor, and children shrieked with laughter as they chased each other down cobblestone streets. 

But inside Elijah's workshop, everything was still. He stood hunched over a half-finished rocking horse, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously carved the intricate details of its mane. The wood whined under the rasp of his tools, a familiar symphony that usually soothed him. Today, however, it only served to amplify the gnawing tension in his chest. His hands trembled slightly, betraying the storm brewing beneath his calm exterior. 


Elijah had received a letter that morning. One he hadn't wanted to read, and one that threatened to upend the carefully constructed world he had built for himself in Oakhaven. It spoke of family obligations, long-held secrets, and a past he desperately tried to forget.
