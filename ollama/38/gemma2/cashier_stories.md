The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bonanza."  Her eyes, a startling shade of emerald green against her pale skin, scanned the conveyor belt as another customer unloaded their cart. The air was thick with the scent of discount perfume and stale popcorn, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia like a second skin.  It was Wednesday afternoon, prime time for retirees on fixed incomes and college students scraping by, and Amelia's fingers itched to start tapping out her usual rhythm on the register keys. This wasn't glamorous, but it was a steady job in this sleepy town of Havenwood, where dreams went to die and everyone knew your business. 


Amelia sighed, adjusting her bright blue hairnet that threatened to slip with each swipe of her arm. A bell chimed as the door swung open, revealing a tall figure shrouded in shadow. The chill that followed seemed to cut through the air conditioning, and Amelia felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. This wasn't just another weary customer; there was something different about this one. Something...unsettling.
