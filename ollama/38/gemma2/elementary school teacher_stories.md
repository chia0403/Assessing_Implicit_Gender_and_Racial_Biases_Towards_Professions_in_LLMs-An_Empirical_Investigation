The sun was barely cresting over Mrs. Eleanor Willowbrook's apple orchard when she arrived at Spring Meadow Elementary. The crisp autumn air smelled of fallen leaves and cinnamon buns from the bakery across the street.  Eleanor inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar scent as she unlocked her classroom door. 

Inside, a rainbow of hand-drawn fall leaves adorned the bulletin board, each one bearing a student's name. Eleanor smiled, feeling the warm anticipation for another year with her vibrant third graders. She straightened the colorful alphabet banner hanging above the chalkboard, then surveyed the room. Her heart ached with a familiar pang - this was her last year before retirement. 


What stories would these leaves tell by spring? What laughter and tears would fill these walls one last time?
