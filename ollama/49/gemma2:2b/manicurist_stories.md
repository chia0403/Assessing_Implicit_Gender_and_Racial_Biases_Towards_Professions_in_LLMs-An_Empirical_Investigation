The scent of acetone and lemon polish clung to the air in "The Polished Pearl," a quaint salon nestled on a quiet side street in Santa Monica. Inside, the only source of light besides the warm lamps adorning the mirrors came from the vibrant turquoise ceiling tiles that seemed to pulse with each flick of the nail clippers. This was Amelia's domain -  a world where chipped nails were repaired and manicures transformed into masterpieces under the watchful eyes of her loyal customers and the gentle hum of classical jazz. 

Amelia, known as "Amy" by everyone who stepped foot in her salon, had a knack for wielding not just nail polish but also a gentle hand and an effervescent spirit. Today, however, was different. A storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. Just moments ago, she'd received news that sent her world crashing down: her fianc√©, Mark, had been in a car accident. The news was relayed by the call center worker who spoke with hesitant voice over the phone line - an unwelcome shock that left Amelia numb and adrift. 


The rhythmic tap-tap of her fingers against the glass polish tray served as a metronome to her anxiety.  She couldn't shake the feeling that she was drowning in this sudden deluge of despair, unsure where to turn or how to navigate the storm. The only solace came from the familiar comfort of shaping perfect nails - a silent ritual amidst chaos and an attempt at controlling the tide of emotions threatening to overwhelm her.
