The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and forgotten dreams. It clung to the plush carpet of the Grand Astoria Hotel like a damp shroud, muffling the symphony of city sounds just beyond its velvet curtains.  Inside, amidst swirling patterns in the ornate wallpaper and echoing footsteps through the lobby, stood Jasper Blackwood, his name almost swallowed by the roar of the elevator door closing behind a bustling family.  He was tall and lean, bearing the weight of his responsibilities with an unspoken weariness that only years spent serving others could yield.  

Jasper's days were a blur of checking in guests, lugging up luggage, making polite small talk – all while battling the pervasive hum of the city outside and the relentless demands of his employer: Mr. Theodore Sterling, whose ambition extended beyond mere business dealings, and whose heart was as hard and unforgiving as the granite he used for his building's facade. 

He stood patiently at the foot of a mahogany desk, watching as Mr. Sterling’s secretary, Ms. Evelyn Albright – a creature of sharp angles and iron will – scrawled away on her notepad.  The Grand Astoria was Jasper’s life, but tonight, it felt less like home and more like a prison cell.
