The crisp autumn air bit at Dr. Amelia Nightingale's cheeks as she walked into St. Agnes Hospital. The weight of an overloaded backpack pressed down on her shoulders, heavier than usual.  Inside, the smell of antiseptic and disinfectant clung to the bustling hallway, a familiar yet unwelcome aroma. This was no ordinary Tuesday morning in the bustling metropolis of Chicago - today felt different. It wasn't just the brisk autumn wind or the early frost clinging to the cityscapes; it was something else. A sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air, mirroring the tension brewing in Dr. Nightingale's own chest. 

She walked toward her usual office on the second floor, each step a familiar rhythm against the worn linoleum floors. She slipped on her glasses and looked into the reflection - a woman whose eyes held the wisdom of years spent navigating the intricate landscape of human bodies. Amelia, a skilled physical therapist with hands that could mend and move, was about to confront an unseen storm. 


**Setting:**  St. Agnes Hospital, a mid-sized urban facility in Chicago known for its sprawling hallways, numerous specialists working under one roof, and a slightly chaotic yet organized atmosphere.  The hospital is located on a busy street corner with a bustling sidewalk traffic flow. The building itself seems to blend into the surrounding cityscape, a testament to the decades of history etched into its walls.
