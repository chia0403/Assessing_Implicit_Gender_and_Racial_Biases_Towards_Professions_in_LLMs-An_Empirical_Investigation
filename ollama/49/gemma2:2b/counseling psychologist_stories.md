The humid air hung heavy in the waiting room, thick with unspoken anxieties and the faint scent of chamomile tea. Dr. Eleanor Rhys adjusted her glasses as she looked at the clock, 10 minutes past the start of her evening session. Each tick echoed the mounting tension in her chest. The waiting area was usually a peaceful tableau, but tonight, it felt like a pressure cooker about to explode. She hadn't even seen her first patient yet, and already the weight of expectation was pressing down on her shoulders. 

Eleanor was known for her quiet demeanor and gentle touch with patients struggling through life’s toughest moments.  Years spent practicing in the heart of a bustling city had honed her skills, allowing her to navigate the complexities of human emotions with a calm precision that many admired. Tonight, however, seemed different. The air crackled with an electricity she hadn't encountered before. It was as if the very walls themselves were holding their breath. 

The young woman seated on the edge of the couch looked pale and drawn. Her name, etched in a worn leather journal held by Eleanor’s hand, whispered "Sophia." A deep melancholy seemed to cling to her presence, like a shadow trailing through a forgotten hallway. The silence stretched before them, punctuated only by the soft hum of the air conditioning unit.
