## Story Opening

The air hung thick with the scent of salt and distant adventure in the bustling terminal.  Rain lashed against the glass windows, blurring the neon lights of the departure screens into abstract streaks of colour.  Inside the cramped office nestled in the corner, Amelia Thorne ran a weary hand through her chestnut hair, the weight of another day's itinerary pressing upon her shoulders like an unkempt backpack.

Her name was a whisper among seasoned travellers and wanderlust-seekers alike: Amelia Thorne, the woman who could weave dreams into travel itineraries, a master of curating experiences, and an eternal optimist in the face of ever-changing destinations and unpredictable fates. For years, she'd been guiding souls across oceans, crafting bespoke journeys for individuals and families seeking the perfect escape from their ordinary lives. 

Today, however, a peculiar chill clung to the air, a silent foreboding Amelia couldn't shake off despite the bustling energy around her. It was a feeling far deeper than just another storm brewing on the horizon - it was a sense of unease that whispered of something sinister lurking beneath the comforting veneer of normalcy.
