Rain slicked the cobblestone streets of Prague like a million scattered sequins, each one reflecting the amber glow from streetlamps barely visible through the relentless downpour.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet asphalt and woodsmoke, punctuated by the tinny, mournful wail of a distant ambulance siren. A bead of sweat trickled down Amelia "Ace" Davenport's temple as she pulled her worn trench coat tighter around herself, the collar damp against her skin. 

Her partner, Viktor, stood impatiently tapping his foot on the cracked pavement outside their small office – an anonymous brick box nestled in a maze of cobbled alleyways, hidden behind faded yellowed lettering that read "Private Investigations." His thick eyebrows knitted together as he watched the rain.  "Ace," he said, his Czech accent thick and gravelly, "This case isn't moving fast enough. The client is getting restless." 

Ace knew what Viktor meant. Mr. Novak, a man with an unsettlingly wide grin and eyes like chipped ice, had hired her for the disappearance of his wife.  He wanted answers, and Ace always provided them - even if those answers came in the form of a bloody fistfight or a stolen passport.

"Don't worry," Ace muttered, pulling out a map from the overflowing satchel that doubled as her office supply. The map showed the city sprawled like a map to nowhere, with faded red dots marking key locations: Novak's opulent apartment, the last known hangout of his wife, and the infamous "Devil's Stairway" - a crumbling passage rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of Prague’s past.
 
**Now, it was time to choose her next move.**
