##  The Setting: 

Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun, painting the worn hardwood floor with fleeting streaks of light and shadow. The air hung heavy with the scent of cedar and something faintly floral, like old books and dried lavender. In this quiet haven nestled between a vintage bookstore and a bustling laundromat on Elm Street,  worked Esmeralda "Esme" Pierce, a real estate agent whose calm demeanor was as much a feature of her business as her carefully curated collection of antique keys she kept tucked into her leather apron.

## The Opening: 


"A little dust never hurt anyone, Miss Bell," Esme said with a slight smile, her voice barely audible over the hum of the dryer next door. "Besides, what's life without a touch of nostalgia?" 

Clara Bell, a woman whose age was as elusive as the shadows that clung to the corners of her once-grand home, sighed deeply and looked at the worn floorboards with a troubled expression. “It’s not just dust," she said in a voice choked with memories. "There are echoes, Esme, whispers of things I've tried so hard to forget.”

Esme's eyes held a knowing glint as she adjusted her glasses, peering at Clara through the haze of light filtering through the dusty window.
