Rain lashed against the attic windows of Amelia Thorne's childhood home, mimicking the drumming in her chest. The air was thick with the aroma of dust and damp wood, the only sounds beyond the wind and rain the creak of old floorboards and the muffled rhythm of an unseen clock.  Amelia, clad in a worn sweater and a pair of paint-splattered jeans, pushed aside a cobwebbed frame adorned with faded, hand-painted floral designs. The room was a symphony of muted tones: grey walls, chipped paint, faded tapestry draped over a wooden chair; a stark testament to the passage of time. 

She was here, in this forgotten corner of her life, trying to make sense of a canvas that felt as blank as the attic itself. Her name, once whispered with reverence, now held a weight she hadn't anticipated - Amelia Thorne, the woman who had painted her grandmother's portrait and whose art had been hailed for its raw talent, only to disappear from the scene when she was twenty-two years old.  Now, she was back in the place where it all began, trying to unearth that lost voice again.
