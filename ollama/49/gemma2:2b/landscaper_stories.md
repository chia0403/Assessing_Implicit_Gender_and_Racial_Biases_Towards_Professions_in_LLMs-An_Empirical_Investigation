The morning mist clung to the rolling hills like dampened gauze, obscuring the quaint cottages and sprawling lawns that dotted the hillside town.  Even in this early hour, the crisp air carried the scent of pine needles and wet earth, an aroma that was both comforting and melancholy for 28-year-old Elias Blackwood, whose calloused hands were used to more than just tending the greenery he cultivated.

Elias was a landscaper, his life's work being meticulously manicured hedges, perfectly raked lawns, and vibrant flowerbeds bursting with color.  He was known for his meticulousness and quiet demeanor; he wasnâ€™t one for small talk or bravado, but rather focused on the art of crafting beauty out of nature itself. However, today, Elias felt a weight settle upon him like an unwanted visitor, something that wasn't related to the weather or his work. It was the lingering presence of Mrs. Hawthorne, her frail frame almost invisible against the backdrop of the lush green lawn he was tending to, and the unsettling silence that followed every word that escaped her lips.
