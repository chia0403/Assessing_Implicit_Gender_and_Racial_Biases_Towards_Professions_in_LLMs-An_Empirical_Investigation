Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the quaint streetlights into halos of orange. Inside 'The Comb,' the air was thick with the scent of rosemary shampoo and freshly-cut hair. Amelia Willow, her nimble fingers poised over a pair of scissors, leaned back in her chair as she worked on Mrs. Peterson's unruly silver curls.  Amelia, known by regulars simply as "Millie" for her knack of coaxing even the most stubborn locks into submission, was engrossed in her work. Her gaze, however, flicked to the reflection in the salon mirror every few seconds. It was a habit she couldn't quite shake –  a silent reassurance that beneath the worn apron and faded blue overalls, Amelia still held the youthful spark of a woman half her age.

The bell above the door chimed as Mrs. Peterson stepped out, leaving behind the lingering scent of lavender hand lotion and the echo of her soft "Thank you, Millie." The rain continued its relentless assault on the shop window, the drops etching lines across the already worn glass. But inside 'The Comb,' a warm fire crackled in the hearth, casting long shadows that danced with Amelia's reflection as she picked up a stray comb from the floor, its teeth glinting like tiny silver stars under the dim light.  This was her haven – a place where the world outside melted away, replaced by the rhythmic hum of scissors and the scent of hope in every perfectly curled strand.
