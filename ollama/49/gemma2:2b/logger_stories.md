The air hung thick with humidity and pine needles, clinging to Silas Blackwood like a damp blanket as he trudged through the woods.  Sunlight filtered weakly through the canopy, turning the familiar path into an indistinct labyrinth of emerald and brown. His boots crunched on fallen leaves, each step echoing in the silence broken only by the occasional rustle from unseen creatures skittering beneath his feet. The scent of pine, a constant companion for years, held a sharper edge than usual today, as if something was off-kilter about the forest itself. 

Silas Blackwood, all broad shoulders and calloused hands, had been a logger since he was old enough to walk. Heâ€™d inherited his father's weathered axe and an innate understanding of the woods that bordered on mystical.  Today, though, the usual quiet rhythm of felling trees felt jarringly strange.  The forest seemed to hold its breath, the normally playful wind whispering warnings in a language Silas couldn't understand.
