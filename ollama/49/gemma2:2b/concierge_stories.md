The rain was relentless, hammering against the leaded glass windows of The Astor House, turning the already hushed lobby into an abyss of gray mist.  A single figure stood amidst the storm’s fury, his posture as rigid and elegant as the carved mahogany desk beside him. His name was Julian Thorne, a concierge of impeccable lineage and even more impeccable demeanor. 

He watched the incessant patter on the glass with weary eyes, each bead a tiny mirror reflecting the city's chaotic beauty. A wave of melancholy washed over him, its source not in the relentless rain or the looming storm clouds but in the empty space beside his desk - a space reserved for a guest he hadn’t yet met, a guest whose presence was both anticipated and feared. 

The air in The Astor House always held a certain tension, an undercurrent of expectation that Julian himself couldn't quite explain. But tonight, it felt particularly thick, a weight pressing down on him like the storm itself. He knew the arrival of this guest, who had been shrouded in mystery since their initial request for accommodation, was about to unravel something much larger than just a single room.
