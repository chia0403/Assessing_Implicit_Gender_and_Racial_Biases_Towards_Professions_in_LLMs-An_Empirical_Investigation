The neon "Open Mic" sign flickered like a dying ember in the damp Seattle night.  Rain hammered on the corrugated roof above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The stage lights cast an ethereal glow on the worn-out wood of the tiny club's floor as she nervously adjusted the microphone stand. Her throat was dry, and a bead of sweat trickled down her temple. This wasn't just another open mic night; tonight was Amelia's shot at breaking out from the underground circuits where her music - raw, bluesy, and laced with a touch of magic - had found an audience for years. 

Her heart pounded in her chest like a runaway drummer as she took a deep breath. Her fingers traced patterns on the worn leather strap of her guitar case, each note vibrating with a familiar fear. Tonight was everything or nothing.  Amelia, known by some as "The Nightingale of the Emerald City," stood at the precipice of the spotlight - ready to sing for her life.
