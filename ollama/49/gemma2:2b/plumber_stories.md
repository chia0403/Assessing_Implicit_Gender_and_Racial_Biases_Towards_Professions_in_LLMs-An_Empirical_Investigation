The insistent drip-drip from beneath the sink was like a bad omen. It echoed through the cramped apartment, bouncing off the mismatched furniture and the stacks of unlabeled boxes that made up most of the space.  This was no ordinary leak; this was an emergency, and for 37-year-old Thomas "Tommy" Miller, it came with a weight far heavier than just plumbing problems. 

The apartment belonged to his grandmother, a woman who hadn't been seen in months. The silence she once filled was now broken only by the echoes of Tommy’s worries and the steady drip, drip, drip that seemed to be growing louder each day.  Tommy’s tools were lined up like an army on a table beside him – wrench, pipe pliers, a toolbox overflowing with every imaginable plumbing gadget - ready for anything from a simple faucet repair to something much more complex.  He adjusted his worn leather cap and leaned against the cracked sink, taking a deep breath. 

**Setting:** A rundown apartment in Chicago's North Side. The place was cluttered and dusty, a testament to time and neglect, with a hint of faded elegance from when it had been a bustling family home.  


The scent of mildew hung heavy in the air; Tommy knew better than anyone that this city held secrets, both good and bad. He closed his eyes briefly, trying to remember the warmth of his grandmother's hugs and the smell of her cooking before she went quiet.
