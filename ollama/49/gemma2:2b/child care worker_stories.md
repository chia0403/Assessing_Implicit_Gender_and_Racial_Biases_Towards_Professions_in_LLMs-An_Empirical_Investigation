Rain pattered against the worn glass window of Mrs. Peterson's house like miniature, frustrated raindrops. Inside, the air hummed with the quiet chaos of five children - three boisterous boys in their pre-teen years and two spirited girls barely reaching double digits - all vying for attention from a slightly frazzled Amelia Carter, her twenty-year career as a child care worker etched onto her weary face. 

Amelia took deep breaths, trying to soothe the tension that prickled at her scalp from the incessant chatter. The familiar routine of Wednesday afternoon was a tightrope walk between managing an unruly group and keeping her sanity intact, especially with the recent influx of new parents and their demanding schedules throwing everything into disarray.  The storm outside mirrored the tempest brewing within Amelia's mind - she just wished for something as simple as a warm cup of coffee to ease the chaos.
