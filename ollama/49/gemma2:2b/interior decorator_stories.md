The crisp white box lay on the worn wooden floor of Amelia Thorne’s studio apartment. A lone, crimson bow clung precariously to its side, a silent testament to yesterday's failed attempt at sending a "happy birthday" message to her estranged grandmother. It was a gesture steeped in childhood memories, the kind that often triggered Amelia's bittersweet journey through time. Her grandmother's old silk scarves, once vibrant canvases of color and life, now lay folded and faded, echoes of a past she couldn't quite grasp.

Amelia Thorne, with her sleek bobbed hair and sharp eyes framed by thick-rimmed spectacles, was known for transforming dilapidated spaces into opulent sanctuaries. Her studio, an airy loft nestled in the heart of a bustling city, echoed with the delicate hum of air conditioners, the gentle rustle of fabric, and the occasional burst of vibrant color from a newly painted wall. 

She surveyed the mess: half-finished upholstery projects stacked precariously on her workbench, paint splatters still visible on the wooden floorboards, scattered swatches of fabric like fallen leaves underfoot - each one whispering a story, a reminder of the many lives and dreams she was helping to materialize. But today, the usual creative energy felt muted, overshadowed by a weight that seemed to linger in the air. A weight of longing, loss, and perhaps even fear. Today, Amelia's canvas wasn’t just fabric and paint; it was her own life.
