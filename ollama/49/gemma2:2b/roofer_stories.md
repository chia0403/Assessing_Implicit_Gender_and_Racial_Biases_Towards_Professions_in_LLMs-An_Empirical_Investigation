## The Rust-Coated Sky

The sky above Havenwood was the colour of a bruised plum, the sun sinking below the line of towering pines, casting long, skeletal shadows across the weathered rooftops.  It wasn't just the fading light that made Liam feel like he was caught in one of those gothic fairy tales he used to read as a kid. It was the weight of it all â€“ the constant drone of his hammer against tin, the rhythmic creak of wood on wood, and the acrid sting of old oil on his face mask.  He was "Liam Thorne," but most folks just called him "Spike" - a name he wore like a badge of honour after years of relentless toil under the unforgiving sky. 

His worn work boots crunched the gravel as he surveyed the sprawling expanse of Havenwood's main street, its Victorian architecture crumbling into a tapestry of brown and orange brick, their once-proud paint peeling away like sunburnt skin.  Liam, with his thick auburn hair streaked with grey at the temples and eyes that held the wisdom of a man who'd seen more storms than sunshine in his lifetime, adjusted his worn leather cap.  This was Liam Thorne's world - one of rusted gutters, creaky scaffolding, and the steady pulse of a life lived on the roofline.
