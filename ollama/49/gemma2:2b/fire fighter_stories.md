The wind whipped around Lieutenant Daniel "Dan" Riley's face, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and wet earth. The late August air was biting through his worn firefighter jacket, but he wouldn't trade this view for anything. Towering above him, the redwood giants of Redwood National Forest seemed to sigh in a perpetual dance of light and shadow.  Their canopies, dappled with sunlight, shielded Dan from the harsh glare of the rising sun as he stood on the edge of one of the forest's vast logging trails, his helmet reflecting the last remaining embers of dawn. 

The call had come at five minutes past three â€“ a structure fire in the outskirts of Redwood National Park.  It wasn't unusual to get calls during the dry season, but this one felt different. There was something about the urgency in dispatch that went beyond a simple wildfire alert. The setting sun cast long, ominous shadows over the dense trees, and Dan knew, deep down, that this fire might just be more than just a usual summer blaze.
