The fluorescent hum vibrated in Elias's ears like a tired metronome.  He adjusted his worn-out uniform cap, its faded blue fabric barely covering a mop of greying hair, then turned his focus to the task at hand: the echoing emptiness of Mrs. Henderson’s opulent mansion was no place for a man who valued company more than quiet contemplation. 

Elias, known to the residents as "Eli," navigated the sprawling halls and dust-laden rooms with practiced ease.  His life had always been about keeping order in chaos – a janitor’s job was an unspoken art of maintaining the delicate balance between ostentatious grandeur and humble upkeep, something he excelled at, yet found profoundly unsatisfying. 

The year was 1932, and New York City thrummed with a symphony of anxieties and ambitions.  Mrs. Henderson's estate, nestled within the gilded cage of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, stood as a monument to both wealth and solitude. A world away from Eli's own modest life in Brooklyn, it was a place where whispers flowed like wine through velvet curtains, where hushed tones disguised secret agendas, and where time seemed to stretch out on a luxurious canvas of wealth and despair. 


Eli’s cleaning supplies sat at his side – his trusty mop, bucket of soapy water, and an assortment of dustpan and brush - waiting for the day's inevitable chaos to unfold.
