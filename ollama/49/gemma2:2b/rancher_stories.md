The sun bled orange across the horizon, staining the sky in hues that mirrored the dried blood pooling on Calloway “Cal” Pierce’s hands.  He stood in the stillness of the ranch house kitchen, watching as the last rays clung to his aging father's weathered face, casting long shadows on the worn wooden floorboards.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dust, sage, and simmering beef broth, a familiar comfort that did little to ease Cal’s stomach churn.  His father, Jebediah Pierce, had been like a well-worn saddle, solid, reliable, a comforting weight in the years Cal had known him. But tonight, Jeb's face was etched with a sorrow deeper than the canyons that cradled their homestead. 

Cal's family ranch, "Sunrise Valley," stretched as far as his eye could see, its sprawling fields punctuated by lone mesquite trees and dotted with cattle grazing in lazy contentment. It had been in Jeb’s blood for generations; it was more than a way of life, it was a legacy.  But the whispers swirling through the dry air were turning into harsh winds.  The drought, that relentless beast, had gnawed at their livelihood for years, leaving their land parched and barren. Now, with every storm gone silent and every hope seemingly extinguished, Cal felt himself adrift, unsure of how to navigate this sea of despair.
