## Opening

The mahogany clock in the corner chimed twice before Arthur Blackwood's morning coffee even arrived at his desk.  A subtle, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the usually-stoic face of the man known as "Blackie" to clients and associates alike. 8:00 AM sharp on Wall Street was a time when nerves twitched, futures contracts glittered with potential losses, and the unspoken pressure of another day in the relentless churn of the financial world weighed heavy on his shoulders.  

Arthur Blackwood’s office looked like every other high-rise window onto New York’s skyline - sleek, modern, sterile. But within its polished surfaces and crisp lines, a storm was brewing. The recent crash of Titan Industries, once a titan of the tech sector, had sent ripples through Arthur's carefully constructed world of stock options and sophisticated portfolio management. 

**Setting:**  A luxurious penthouse suite on the 53rd floor of one of New York’s most prestigious skyscrapers.
