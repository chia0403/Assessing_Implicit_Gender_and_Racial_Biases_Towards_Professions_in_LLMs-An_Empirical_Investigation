Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the already hazy neon sign of the diner across the street into an abstract swirl of colours. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke, stale coffee, and suppressed tension. Elias Thorne, his name etched onto the crisp black tie as starkly as the storm outside, sat at a corner table in the dimly lit booth, his eyes fixed on the file in his hands. 

**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Age:** 38
**Occupation:** Probation Officer for the city's juvenile court system

Elias was on probation officer duty for the infamous "The Runaways" case - a notorious gang of teenage delinquents that had terrorized the city for weeks, culminating in a daring heist from a local antique shop. He was tasked with monitoring their movements and ensuring they stayed off the grid â€“ a seemingly impossible feat considering his current ward's penchant for trouble. 

He tapped the file, the name on top: **Samuel "Sawdust" Riley**. A freckled mess of a boy, barely sixteen years old, who lived for mayhem and mischief.  He had a charm that could melt butter, but it was paired with a slyness that felt dangerously calculated. Tonight's probation meeting at 7pm at the courthouse seemed less about rehabilitation and more about containing another potential disaster in the making.
