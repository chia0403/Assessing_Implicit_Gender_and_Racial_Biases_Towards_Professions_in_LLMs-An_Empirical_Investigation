The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a second skin as she scrubbed down a blood-stained gurney in Room 3B. It was past midnight and the late shift at Mercy General Hospital was winding down, a chorus of clicking beeping monitors the only soundtrack that punctuated the quiet hum. The setting sun cast long shadows across her work area, turning the normally sterile white walls into something almost eerie. Outside, the city pulsed with life – sirens wailing in the distance, laughter and conversations spilling from nearby cafes, but here, inside the belly of the beast, Amy was lost in a world of broken bodies and silent pain. 

Tonight, though, there was something different in the air. A prickling unease settled on her like a damp sheet, leaving a chill behind it even as she continued her work with a practiced ease. It had been months since she'd faced a true crisis like this - a wave of unexplained illnesses sweeping through the city – and the whispers circulating about a "shadow epidemic" made Amy feel like her world was tilting on its axis. Tonight, though, something felt different.  Something had shifted. The unease was no longer just a feeling; it had become a palpable presence in the room.
