## Setting: The Night Shift at Mercy General Hospital

The humid air hung heavy in the sterile hallways of Mercy General Hospital's blood lab, smelling faintly of disinfectant and metallic tang.  Neon lights hummed above, casting an unsettling blue glow on the rows of stainless steel biohazard cabinets lining the walls. It was 3 AM on a Tuesday, well past most peopleâ€™s bedtime, yet the quiet of the night offered a peculiar kind of solace to Amelia Grace Miller. She adjusted her white lab coat, feeling its crispness against her skin, and took a deep breath. Tonight was another one of those nights where the humdrum routine felt like a dance with an old, worn-out record player. 

Amelia had been a phlebotomist at Mercy General for ten years, and while she'd seen countless blood tests come through, tonight's patient list held a particular gravity. A young woman, barely out of her teens, was scheduled to undergo a bone marrow transplant. It wasn't just the weight of hope she felt; it was a tangible presence in the room that made Amelia's own heart beat a little faster.
