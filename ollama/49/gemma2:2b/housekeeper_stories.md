The humid air clung to Amelia's shoulders like cling film, heavy with the scent of lilies and old money.  The sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor was a labyrinth of polished mahogany and worn velvet, its quiet grandeur amplified by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hallway. It had been nearly a century since the last Blackwood left, yet Amelia kept her heart set on a time she could no longer touch - a world where servants were still revered rather than relegated to dustbin duties.  Her worn apron felt like a faded shield against the casual dismissal that seemed to be inherent in this new age of "independence." 

Amelia's hand brushed against the intricate gold lettering on her nameplate: "Amelia Thornton," it proclaimed, a legacy she was fiercely proud of. Today, however, the weight of expectation pressed down upon her like the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams that streamed through the vast windows. This wasn't just any old cleaning; this was Mr. Blackwood's granddaughter, Eliza, throwing a lavish dinner party for the city elite. 

Amelia looked over her shoulder at the grand staircase, where Ameliaâ€™s reflection seemed to twist and shimmer, a phantom of herself in this house of ghosts and fading grandeur. Tonight, she couldn't just dust; she had to conjure an illusion of pristine perfection from the shadows of Blackwood Manor itself.
