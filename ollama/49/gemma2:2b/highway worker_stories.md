The air hung thick with diesel and exhaust fumes in the midday sun, baking the asphalt of Route 6 like a giant, grimy oven.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, momentarily obscuring the towering steel carcasses of semi-trailer trucks that lined the roadside.  Even after ten years working alongside these giants, the sheer scale of their presence still left Elias feeling insignificant, like a mote in the cosmos.

Elias "Eli" Jackson shifted his worn work boots, the scuffs on the leather reflecting the harsh glare. He ran a calloused hand through his sandy hair, tugging at a loose strand as he stared down at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him.  His eyes scanned for any signs of trouble: a stray tire, a pothole hidden beneath layers of grime, or even just the tell-tale sheen of oil on the pavement â€“ all potential hazards for drivers speeding by on their way to nowhere in particular.

Eli was a highway worker, his life a constant dance between the roar of engines and the rhythmic thump of heavy equipment. His work was about bridging gaps, keeping the road flowing, but every day felt like an impossible race against time.  He knew he wasn't making a difference on a grand scale, but something in him held onto that hope. He dreamt of creating a new highway, one that would weave its way across desolate land and connect communities long separated by rugged mountains and unforgiving plains.
