The air in Veridian Keep was thick with tension, mirroring the oppressive humidity clinging to Elara's tunic.  The midday sun, an unwelcome spotlight against the weathered stone walls, did little to pierce the gloom that clung to the place. It had been months since the last attack - a night of chaos and bloodshed that left more than just scars on Veridian's borders. It hadnâ€™t even been a week since Elara had returned from his patrol at the border, fresh wounds still raw beneath the layers of his chainmail. 

**Elara, guard of the Northern Gate, ran a calloused hand over his jaw.** The weight of responsibility was a familiar ache in his bones. Every shadow seemed to hold a threat, every gust of wind carried the scent of danger. He checked his belt one last time, his eyes catching on the glint of his silver-edged blade hidden within its intricate leather straps - a gift from his grandfather, who'd taught him more than just how to wield a weapon. Elara had inherited the legacy not only of fighting but also of safeguarding the city.

But guarding the Keep felt like being locked in an endless battle against unseen enemies. Even the familiar faces that passed by on the narrow stone path, merchants returning from markets, and weary travelers seeking shelter - they all seemed to carry a sense of anxiety beneath their smiles.  He saw it in the way their eyes darted between him and the city walls, and he felt it gnaw at his own chest.
