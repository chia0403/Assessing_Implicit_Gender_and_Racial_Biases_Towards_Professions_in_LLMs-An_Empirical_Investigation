## The Weight of Words

**Setting:** A quaint, seaside town nestled between rolling hills and crashing waves in coastal Maine.  The air carries a mix of salt and seaweed, and laughter blends with the gentle rhythm of seagulls. **Oakhaven,** its name whispered on the wind as if promising a quiet life by the ocean. 

**Main Character:** **Dr. Evelyn Thorne**, her auburn hair pulled back tight in a bun, her eyes mirroring the deep blue expanse of the nearby bay. Dr. Thorne wasn't born to this sleepy town; she came seeking something more than the predictable routine, craving the freedom that comes from shaping lives and understanding their needs. She'd spent years studying nutrition as a way to unlock the potential for healthier living, but lately, Oakhaven felt like an echo chamber of forgotten dreams. 

**Opening:** Dr. Thorne glanced out the window of her quaint office overlooking the harbor, watching children chase each other on the sandy beach. It was a scene that once ignited hope, now left her feeling strangely empty.  "It's all about balance," she murmured to herself, swirling a spoonful of kale smoothie in her hand. "Just like life." But the words felt hollow, echoing off the walls of her own soul as much as her empty pantry. Tonight's meal plan was untouched. A quiet wave crashed against the shore, its rhythm mirroring her inner turmoil.
