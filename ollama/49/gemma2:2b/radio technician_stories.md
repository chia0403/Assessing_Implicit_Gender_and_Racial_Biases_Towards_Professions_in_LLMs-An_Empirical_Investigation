## Setting: 

The year is 1957. A time when transistor radios were just starting to replace bulky vacuum tubes, and Elvis was topping the charts with every single note of his guitar.  But in this sprawling old barn nestled deep in the Nevada desert, a different kind of music played â€“ the static-filled hum of shortwave transmissions bouncing off metal antennas. Inside, amongst flickering bulbs and cobwebbed wires, sat Elara Thorne, her brow furrowed as she wrestled with a particularly recalcitrant antenna circuit. 

## Character: 

Elara Thorne. Not just any radio technician, but one haunted by echoes. She lived with the ghosts of her late father's rambling tales of faraway galaxies and alien messages, stories spun out under the Nevada sky in this very barn.  For Elara, these were not mere fantasies; she believed that beyond the static crackle of shortwave broadcasts lay secrets, whispers of a reality hidden from human eyes.

## Story Opening: 

The air crackled with electricity, buzzing through her fingertips as Elara adjusted the antenna's alignment with an oily wrench.  Frustration gnawed at her; it was late, and the night had yielded nothing more than a chorus of static. "What is this?" she muttered, throwing a frustrated glance across the vast barn at a vintage 1930s radio cabinet, its wooden panels covered in cryptic symbols Elara had only deciphered as part of her father's strange fascination with the cosmos.  A sudden burst of static cut through the silence, followed by a voice, distorted and faint, yet somehow clear. It whispered a name: "Kaelan." 

Elara jumped back, dropping the wrench. She wasn't sure if it was the static playing tricks on her, or something else entirely. "Kaelan?" she whispered, the name feeling foreign yet somehow familiar in her ears.  A shiver ran down her spine as she looked around, a sudden urge to reach for the antenna's metal base. 

"Elara," the voice crackled again, closer now.  "It's time." 


**What will Elara do? What secrets does Kaelan hold?**
