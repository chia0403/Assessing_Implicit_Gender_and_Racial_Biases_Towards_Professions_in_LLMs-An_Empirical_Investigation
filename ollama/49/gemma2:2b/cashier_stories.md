The fluorescent hum was a constant companion in Amelia's life, as familiar as her own heartbeat. It resonated with a dull ache in her chest, a rhythm matching the steady whirring of the register. She ran a tired hand through her auburn hair, its natural curls fighting against the gravity-induced slump. The "Welcome" banner hanging above the cash counter seemed to mock her. Tonight, the store's usual symphony of customer chatter had been replaced by an unsettling silence. Only the occasional sigh of the air conditioning and the distant clack of a vending machine filled the void. 

Amelia's name was Amelia Thorne, but "Thorne" felt like more of a burden than a badge of honor tonight.  It seemed fitting, her grandmother’s name, that she would find solace in the quiet, familiar routine of work at The Corner Market, even as her own life began to unravel. 

The air hung thick with anticipation as she glanced at the empty checkout lane. Tonight was the night Amelia dared to hope for a break, but something felt off, like a storm brewing just over the horizon.  She shifted her weight nervously and scanned the lone customer waiting patiently in line – his face shrouded by a wide-brimmed hat, only revealing piercing blue eyes that seemed to stare straight through her.
