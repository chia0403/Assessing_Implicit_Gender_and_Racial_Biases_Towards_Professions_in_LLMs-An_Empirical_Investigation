The oily sheen under the fluorescent lights of Rusty Wrench's Garage seemed to pulse with a life all its own.  Even after nearly three decades in the business, Ethan Avery still found himself mesmerized by the symphony of clangs and whirs that filled the air. The smell – a heady blend of gasoline, burnt metal, and the faintest hint of old engine grease - was both comforting and a stark reminder of his calling.  

Ethan ran a calloused thumb across a dented fender on a battered Ford Mustang, its faded red paint job barely clinging to life. A young woman's voice echoed from inside: "Mr. Avery? Is this the place?" Ethan squinted, seeing her through the dust-filled air as she hesitantly entered the garage.  Her face was obscured by the thick hood of the car she had brought in. It was a 1970’s era Fiat. A beat-up relic from a life lived and lost on far too many roads.  His work, he knew, would be more than just fixing the rust; it would be a glimpse back into time.

**Setting:**  A modest garage in a forgotten corner of New York City's industrial district. The place was filled with the ghosts of countless car repairs and stories, each one etched onto the worn grease stains on the floors and the chipped paint on the walls. 


**Character:** Ethan Avery – a gruff but kind mechanic with hands that knew every twist and turn of any engine he touched. He'd been born and raised in the city, his life intertwined with the ebb and flow of its endless traffic.  He was known for his deep understanding of cars and a stubborn streak that could rival a rusty bolt.
