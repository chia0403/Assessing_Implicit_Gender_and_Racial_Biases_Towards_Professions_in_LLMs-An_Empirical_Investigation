## Setting: 

The bustling heart of Denver was just beginning to stir with morning light as Amelia "Amy" Evans prepared for another day at the clinic. Outside, the air was crisp and clean, carrying the faint scent of pine needles and freshly-ground coffee from the nearby coffee shop that had become her daily ritual.  Inside, however, the sterile white walls of Evergreen Dental held a stark contrast to the city's vibrant exterior â€“ quiet, organized chaos reigned supreme. 

**Main Character:**

Amy Evans was known for her meticulous approach to her job as a dental hygienist. With her bright smile and gentle demeanor, she had the reputation for being more like a friendly therapist than a dentist's assistant. Her hands were precise instruments, wielding scalers and probes with an almost artistic touch. Amy believed that even in this world of sharp tools and strong chemicals, there was room for kindness. 


**Story Opening:**

The morning began with the familiar symphony of whirring drills and the soft hum of sterilization machines.  Amy paused briefly at the water cooler, a steaming mug of chamomile tea clutched in her hand, before taking her usual spot near Dr. Miller's exam room. It was his patients she loved most - their vulnerability, their fear that mirrored her own. She had always been drawn to helping others navigate the sometimes-scary world of teeth and gums, even if she occasionally felt like a therapist with an overactive imagination. This morning, however, the usual calm was shaken by the unexpected arrival of Mrs. Peterson.  Her eyes, usually bright with life, were filled with a deep sadness as she sat on the chair. 

"Ms. Evans," her voice was shaky. "It's... it's about my husband."
