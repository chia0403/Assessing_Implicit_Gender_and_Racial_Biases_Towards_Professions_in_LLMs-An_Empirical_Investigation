The desert wind whipped through Elara Thorne's hair as she gripped the controls of her vintage Stearman biplane, dust swirling around her boots.  Sun bleached sand stretched out in every direction, blurring under the relentless glare of the midday sun. Above her, an endless expanse of azure sky held only the occasional puffy cloud that seemed to mock the harsh beauty of this desolate land. Elara's battered red-and-yellow plane hummed with a tired energy as she banked sharply over a dried riverbed, its belly low over the cracked earth.  She was headed for the Devil's Elbow, a treacherous mountain range notorious for its unforgiving winds and sudden storms.

Her name was Elara Thorne - "Whisper" to those who knew her well, thanks to her ability to weave through the sky with an ease that defied reason. But today, all she could think about was getting to the other side of the Devil's Elbow, where the rumored remains of a long-lost airfield lay hidden.  A relic from a forgotten era, whispered to hold secrets as old as time itself, and perhaps, a way to escape this desolate land.
