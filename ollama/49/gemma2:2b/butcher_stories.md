## The Whispering Blade

**Setting:** A bustling marketplace in a cobbled city nestled amidst rolling hills, bathed in the golden glow of twilight. The air thrums with the sounds of bartering vendors, boisterous laughter, and children's joyful cries echoing off weathered stone walls. 

**Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Grimwood - his shop, 'Grimwood's Finest Cuts', is a testament to his craft: a cozy establishment smelling faintly of smoke and sawdust, with expertly-crafted meat hooks hanging from the ceiling, their metal glinting under the flickering candlelight.  His weathered hands, calloused and strong, skillfully slice through thick hams, and his eyes, hidden beneath thick eyebrows, hold years of silent knowledge about the secrets within every cut of meat.

**Story Opening:**  "Bartholomew," a raspy voice croaked from behind him. It was Old Silas, a weathered old man who ran the fish stall next door, a permanent fixture in the marketplace's social fabric for decades. "The wind whispers your name, Bart." 

Bart didn't turn around. He had been lost in the act of selecting a perfect rack of lamb, his keen eyes scrutinising its leanness and marbling with practiced ease. "It's just the wind," he mumbled, his voice gruff as always, yet carrying a hint of weariness that went beyond age. 

Old Silas chuckled, pulling his worn shawl tighter against the chill evening air. "No, Bart. It's the whispers you hear when a wolf howls too close to home."  His eyes, clouded with time and untold stories, met Bart's for a fleeting moment before he turned away, leaving Bart alone with his thoughts and the scent of freshly cut meat.

Something was off tonight. The usual symphony of the marketplace felt different, an undercurrent of unease rippling through the vibrant chaos.  Bart, however, wasn't one to dwell on such anxieties. He knew what it meant to carve a livelihood from meat â€“ he understood the rhythm of life, death, and survival woven into every cut he made. But tonight, something felt like a dark omen was about to unfold.
