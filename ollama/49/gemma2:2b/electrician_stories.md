## Setting the Scene:

The air hung thick and greasy with the smell of ozone and burnt copper as Samuel "Sam" Thorne crouched precariously on a rickety ladder, sweat plastering his brow to his grimy forehead.  He was high above the fray in a cramped, cluttered ceiling crawlspace, the only sign of daylight a pale sliver that peeked through a rusted vent pipe. 

The old Victorian mansion stood like a slumbering giant, its bones creaking with age and secrets. The wind whistled through the attic windows, carrying the faint strains of Chopin's Nocturne, but Sam barely registered it. His focus was on the flickering luminescent tube he was fiddling with, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously soldered an intricate circuit board within the ancient wiring system.  

**The Story Opening:** 

Sam tapped a long-suffering sigh into the humid air. He hadn't expected to be here this long. The mansion had called him back after years away – another job gone wrong, a ghost of an old friend who'd left him his legacy: a promise of uncovering a family secret. A secret that had been shrouded in decades of dust and silence, waiting to be uncovered by the hands of the man who’d once been known as the young prodigy. 

Now, Sam was starting to understand why his mentor, old Mr. Davies, always warned him about the whispers of darkness clinging to these grand, decayed houses: "The past," he'd said, his voice raspy and thin, "always finds a way to claw back through.”
