Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in New Haven, Connecticut, the kind of night that made you want to stay inside with a good book and a cup of tea. But for Private Investigator Emilia Ruby Wellesley, there was no comfort to be found in being indoors.

As she stepped out of her office, a small, cramped room above a vintage bookstore on Main Street, Emilia gazed up at the rain-soaked streets below. The neon lights of the diner across the street cast a gaudy glow over the sidewalk, and the smell of wet pavement and coffee wafted through the air.

Emilia adjusted her trench coat, feeling the familiar weight of her fedora in her pocket. She had been hired by the enigmatic heiress, Sophia Markham, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Emilia's business partner, James Reed. The police were stumped, and Sophia was willing to pay top dollar for someone who could get to the bottom of things.

As she walked down Main Street, Emilia noticed a sense of unease settling over the city. The rain seemed to be bringing out the worst in people, and the streets were filled with the sound of angry shouts and the rustle of papers being torn apart. It was going to be one of those nights, Emilia thought, her mind already racing ahead to all the possibilities.

And then, as she turned onto Elm Street, she saw him â€“ a tall, imposing figure standing under the awning of the old movie theater, watching her with an unnerving intensity.
