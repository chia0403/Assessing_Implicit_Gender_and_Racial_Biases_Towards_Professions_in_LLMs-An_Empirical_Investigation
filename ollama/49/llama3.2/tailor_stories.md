Here's a potential story opening:

The snowflakes fell like tears from the sky as Asher Elijah Wychwood stepped out of his small tailor shop on Raven's Peak Street. The narrow alleyway was lined with the dimly lit windows of old bookstores and antique shops, their shelves stacked high with dusty tomes and forgotten trinkets. The air reeked of damp earth and wood smoke, carrying the scent of winter into Asher's lungs like a familiar friend.

Asher, a man in his late twenties with unruly brown hair and hands stained with thread and ink, gazed out at the quiet street. His eyes, a deep shade of indigo that seemed almost purple in the fading light, held a hint of sadness as he took in the sight of the snow-covered rooftops and the frozen puddles reflecting the pale moon above.

His tailor shop, passed down through generations of Wychwoods, had been struggling to stay afloat in this changing world.

The seal was embossed with an intricate silver crest â€“ the symbol of the esteemed House of Blackstone, one of Raven's Peak's most influential families.
