Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Atlanta glistened like polished steel as Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of the office building where she spent most of her days hunched over spreadsheets and financial reports. As an accountant at the prestigious law firm of Smith, Johnson & Associates, Emilia had grown accustomed to the fluorescent glow of the office lights and the hum of the air conditioning unit that seemed to vibrate through every cell in her body.

At 32 years old, Emilia was a rising star in the accounting world, known for her attention to detail and unwavering commitment to accuracy. But as she gazed out at the darkening cityscape, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The rain seemed to be falling in a peculiar pattern, as if it were trying to spell out a message on the wet pavement.

As she walked back to her car, parked in a crowded lot across the street from the office building, Emilia noticed a piece of paper stuck to the windshield wiper of her Honda Civic. She pulled off into the parking garage and approached the car cautiously, wondering what could have been stuck there by mistake. That's when she saw it: a single sheet of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it in red ink:

"Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Emilia's heart skipped a beat as she read the words over and over, her mind racing with possibilities. Who could have written this? And what did they want from her? As she turned to walk back into the office building, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to take a drastic turn.
