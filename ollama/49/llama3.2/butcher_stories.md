Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and alleyways. In a small shop on Main Street, the scent of freshly cut meat wafted through the air, mingling with the sounds of sizzling sausages and lively chatter from the lunch crowd.

Amidst the bustling activity, Emrys Fletcher stood behind the counter of his family's butcher shop, "Fletcher's Fine Cuts." His hands moved with precision as he trimmed a batch of tenderloin steaks, the soft hum of the meat saw slicing through the din. At 32 years old, Emrys had spent most of his life learning the art of butchery from his father and grandfather before him. He took pride in providing the freshest, highest-quality meats to the good people of Ravenswood.

As the day wore on, a familiar figure pushed open the door, her bright blue eyes scanning the shop as if searching for something - or someone. It was Alice Wellesley, the town's owner of the local bakery and Emrys's closest friend since childhood. Her long, curly brown hair seemed to bounce with each step, and her smile could light up a room on even the gloomiest of days.

"What brings you here today, Alice?" Emrys asked, his voice low and warm as he wrapped a package of ribeye steaks for her.

"Just grabbing some supplies before I head home," she replied, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "But I was thinking... maybe we could discuss something else? Something more important?"

Emrys raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the hint of mystery behind Alice's words. He leaned against the counter, his hands clasped together in front of him as he waited for her to reveal what was on her mind.
