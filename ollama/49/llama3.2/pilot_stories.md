Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, Captain Everett Ryder Banks gazed out at the vast expanse of ocean stretching before his small charter plane, the "Maverick's Revenge". The engines, now silent, seemed to hum softly in their resting state, as if trying to lull him into a false sense of security. The air was heavy with the scent of saltwater and the distant tang of diesel fuel, a reminder that this remote stretch of coastline was still a hub of industrial activity.

The small island of Red Rock, Oregon, was a tiny speck on the map, its crumbling concrete airstrip stretching out like a scarred ribbon across the rugged landscape. The sea breeze whipped up the scrubby vegetation, sending tufts of dry grasses swirling around Banks' feet as he stood at the open door of his plane. It was a spot he'd grown to love over the years, where the harsh beauty of the coastline and the isolation from the world made him feel most alive.

Banks took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill his lungs, and began to shut down the engines. He had spent months preparing for this flight â€“ months of planning, of waiting, of watching the weather patterns shift in his favor. And now, finally, he was here.
