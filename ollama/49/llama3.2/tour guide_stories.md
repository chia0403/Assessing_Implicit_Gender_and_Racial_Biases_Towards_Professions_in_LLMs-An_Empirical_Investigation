Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the intricately carved facades and bustling streets. The air was thick with the scent of cardamom and rosewater, carried on the gentle breeze that rustled through the narrow alleys.

Ava Maria Hassan, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for history and archaeology, stood at the edge of the Monastery Square, surveying her group of eager tourists. They were a lively bunch, all clad in comfortable clothing and cameras slung around their necks, each one champing at the bit to explore the secrets of this ancient city.

As Ava began to greet her guests with a warm smile and a firm handshake, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership over the place. She had grown up here, in the shadow of the majestic Treasury and the Al-Khazneh, and knew every hidden nook and cranny, every fascinating fact and anecdote.

"Welcome to Petra, everyone!" Ava called out, her voice carrying across the square as she ushered her group towards the entrance of the Monastery. "Today, we'll be exploring one of the most impressive ancient structures in the world – the majestic Al-Deir, or Monastery, built by the Nabataeans over 2,000 years ago."

As Ava led her group into the square, she felt a sense of excitement and anticipation build within her. She had been leading tours here for years, but there was always something new to discover, some hidden gem that would leave her guests in awe.

Little did Ava know, today's tour would be more than just another day on the job – it would lead her down a path of discovery that would change her life forever.
