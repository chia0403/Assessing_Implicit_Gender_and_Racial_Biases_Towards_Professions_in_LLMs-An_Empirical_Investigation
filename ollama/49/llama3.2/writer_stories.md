Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving in March, but this year felt different. The grey skies seemed to have absorbed all color, leaving only a dull, drizzly haze that clung to everything like a damp shroud. It was the perfect weather for Emily Jena Wynter, writer and loner, who preferred the solitude of her small apartment above the coffee shop on Pike Street.

Emily Wynter huddled deeper into her worn armchair, cradling a lukewarm cup of coffee in her hands as she stared out the window at the wet world below. Her eyes were red from lack of sleep, and her dark hair was mussed with the remnants of a restless night's dreams. The words that had been swirling in her mind for weeks finally began to take shape on the page, but the more she wrote, the more elusive the story seemed to become.

The old apartment building creaked and groaned around her, its wooden beams complaining about the damp air seeping through the walls. It was a reminder that even in this rainy city, there were still places where time and history lingered, waiting for someone like Emily Jena Wynter to uncover them. And as she scribbled down another paragraph of uneven sentences, she couldn't shake the feeling that her latest obsession was leading her further down a rabbit hole than she'd ever been before.
