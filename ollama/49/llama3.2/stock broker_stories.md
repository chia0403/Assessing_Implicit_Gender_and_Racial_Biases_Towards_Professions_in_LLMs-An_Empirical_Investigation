Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, casting a golden glow over the bustling streets of Wall Street, Alexander "Xander" Thompson stood at the edge of his office window, gazing out at the glittering lights of the financial district. A successful stock broker in his mid-thirties, Xander had spent years climbing the ranks of his prestigious firm, earning a reputation as a shrewd and calculated risk-taker.

His dark hair was tousled from a long day of meetings and phone calls, and his sharp jawline was flecked with stubble. Despite the weariness etched on his face, Xander's piercing blue eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, betraying a sense that he was always plotting his next move.

Xander's office, nestled high above the trading floor, offered a panoramic view of the city. The hum of the computers and chatter of his colleagues provided a constant background noise, but Xander tuned it out, lost in thought as he contemplated the latest market trends and potential investments for his clients.

Little did Xander know, however, that tonight would bring more than just another long day at the office â€“ it would be the night that everything changed.
