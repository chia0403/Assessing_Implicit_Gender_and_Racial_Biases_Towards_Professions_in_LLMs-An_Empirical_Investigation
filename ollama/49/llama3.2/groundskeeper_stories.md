As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, a lone figure emerged from the mist-shrouded gardens of Willowdale Manor, the grand estate that had been his family's home for generations. Emrys Ffynnon-Williams, or Emmet to those who knew him well, breathed in the damp morning air, his eyes squinting against the faint dew-kissed light.

As a groundskeeper, Emmet took pride in his work, tending to the manicured lawns and meticulously pruned hedges that framed the manor's facade. His family had tended to the gardens since the estate was built in the late 18th century, and Emmet felt a deep connection to the land and its history.

The air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Emmet could hear the distant hum of birds awakening in the nearby woods. He smiled to himself, feeling a sense of peace wash over him as he began his daily routine, one that had been repeated countless times before.

But on this particular morning, something felt off. A faint tension lingered in the air, like the whisper of a secret kept hidden beneath the manor's stately facade. Emmet couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he sensed that today would be different from any other day in the long history of Willowdale Manor.
