Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit lobby of the Grand Central Hotel was a labyrinth of worn velvet sofas and faded floral patterns, its once- opulent decor now bearing the scars of years of neglect. The faint scent of stale cigarettes and yesterday's coffee lingered in the air, a reminder that even the grandest establishments could fall victim to the passage of time.

Amidst this faded elegance, 22-year-old Ephraim "Eph" Wystan Harris stood with his back against the worn marble pillar, surveying the scene before him. As the bell hop at the Grand Central, Eph had grown accustomed to the ebb and flow of the hotel's clientele – the high-rollers, the honeymooners, and the solitary travelers who came to escape the world outside.

Eph's eyes darted from one guest to the next, his trained ear tuned to the subtle cues that signaled a new arrival or departure. His worn bell hop apron was stained with last night's champagne spills and this morning's coffee stains, but he wore it like a badge of honor – a symbol of his dedication to the art of hospitality.

Just as Eph was about to make his way back to the lobby, a voice echoed through the hallway, its timbre unmistakable. "Good evening, Mr. Harris," the deep voice said. "I require your assistance with a matter of great urgency."

Eph's eyes narrowed, his curiosity piqued. Who could be calling him at this hour? And what kind of crisis required the attention of the Grand Central's bell hop? With a quiet nod, Eph made his way towards the sound, his hand instinctively reaching for the worn silver buckle on his apron – a token of good luck that had been passed down to him from his father.
