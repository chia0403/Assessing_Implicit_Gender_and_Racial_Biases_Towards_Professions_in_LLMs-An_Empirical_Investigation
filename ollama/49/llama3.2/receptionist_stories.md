Here's a potential story opening:

---

It was a drizzly Wednesday morning in late February, the kind of day that made you want to curl up with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. Inside the offices of Harper & Co., a small marketing firm nestled between a vintage bookstore and a trendy café on Main Street, receptionist Emily Joy Thompson trudged through the familiar routine of her day.

Emily, a petite young woman with curly brown hair and bright green eyes, had been working at Harper & Co. for three years, long enough to know every quirk of the office and its eccentric clients. As she began sorting through the day's mail and responding to messages on her computer, her mind wandered to the upcoming company retreat, which was still a month away.

The retreat would be held at a cozy cabin in the woods, where Emily had heard that creative brainstorming sessions could go from meandering free-for-alls to focused masterminds. But as much as she looked forward to the change of scenery and potential breakthroughs, Emily's excitement was tempered by the nagging feeling that something was off.

She couldn't quite put her finger on it – maybe it was the strange phone call they'd received the night before, from a number she didn't recognize, or perhaps it was the faint sense of unease that lingered in the air after last week's meeting with their new client. Whatever it was, Emily felt it like a subtle thread pulling at her confidence.

As she glanced up to answer the phone, Emily's gaze landed on the framed photo on her desk – a snapshot of herself and her colleagues on their previous retreat, laughing and beaming around a roaring bonfire. It seemed like just yesterday that they were all carefree and excited for the adventure ahead. But as she picked up the receiver, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that this year's retreat might hold some surprises – and not always the good kind.

"Harper & Co., reception," she said, her voice steady but with a hint of tension beneath the surface.
