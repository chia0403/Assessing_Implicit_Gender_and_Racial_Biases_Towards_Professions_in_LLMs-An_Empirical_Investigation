Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, nestled between rugged cliffs and scenic beaches in the Pacific Northwest. It's the late summer of 2023, and the tourists have begun to leave, leaving behind a quiet, laid-back atmosphere that's both peaceful and slightly eerie.
