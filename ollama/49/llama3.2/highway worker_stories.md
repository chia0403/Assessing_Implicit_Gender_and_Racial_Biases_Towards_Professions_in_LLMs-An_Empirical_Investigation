Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the desolate stretch of I-80, casting a pale orange glow over the endless expanse of asphalt that stretched out before Highway Worker Kaiden Ryder. It was 4:30 AM on a typical Wednesday morning, and Kaiden was already halfway through his routine inspection of the highway's northbound lanes. His worn denim jacket flapped in the gentle breeze as he knelt beside a particularly potholed section, his eyes scanning the road surface for any signs of damage or wear.

As he worked, the hum of his truck's engine and the soft crackle of the radio provided a soothing background noise, punctuated only by the occasional rumble of traffic in the distance. Kaiden had been working on this stretch of highway for nigh on 10 years, and he knew every twist and turn, every pothole and patchwork repair like the back of his hand. He took pride in his work, knowing that the smooth asphalt beneath his feet was a small but vital part of keeping the country's transportation network running smoothly.

But as he stood up to adjust his gloves, Kaiden caught sight of something odd out of the corner of his eye - a dark smear on the side of the road, partially obscured by the underbrush. It looked like nothing more than a discarded tire, but there was something about it that didn't quite add up.
