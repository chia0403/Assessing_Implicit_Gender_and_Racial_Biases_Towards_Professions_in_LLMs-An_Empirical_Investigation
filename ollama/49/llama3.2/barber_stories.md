The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street. The smell of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers filled the air, mingling with the sound of lawnmowers and the occasional bark from a passing dog.

Inside, 32-year-old Julian Everett Thompson was hard at work, carefully crafting a fade for his latest client, a rugged-looking young man named Jake.

Julian had been the town's go-to barber since he was 16, and over the years, he'd built up a loyal customer base of folks from all walks of life.
