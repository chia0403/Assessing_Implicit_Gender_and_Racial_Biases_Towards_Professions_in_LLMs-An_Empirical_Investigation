The scent of warm yeast and caramelized sugar clung to Amelia Clementine Beaumont like a second skin. It was a comforting aroma, one that had always enveloped her in the small bakery nestled on the cobbled corner of Rue des Lilas in Paris.  Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating rows upon rows of glistening pastries: pain au chocolat cradled in their paper sleeves, croissants plump and golden, and delicate macarons piled high like miniature jewels. Amelia hummed along to Edith Piaf's melancholic melody drifting from the radio, her hands deftly kneading dough for a fresh batch of sourdough. Outside, the city bustled with its usual chaotic symphony – car horns honking, laughter echoing through the narrow streets, and the rhythmic clatter of café chairs scraping against cobblestone. But inside Amelia’s bakery, time seemed to move slower, lulled by the gentle rhythm of baking and the sweet aroma that whispered promises of indulgence. 


This was Amelia's sanctuary, a world she built with flour, sugar, and a pinch of Parisian magic. Today, however, something felt different. A sense of anticipation, tinged with a hint of trepidation, hung in the air like the wisp of smoke curling from her freshly brewed coffee. It was Bastille Day, Paris' most celebrated holiday, and Amelia had a secret recipe up her sleeve – a creation that could change everything.
