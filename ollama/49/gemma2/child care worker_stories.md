The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the miniature plastic jungle gym in the corner of Room 2B.  It was 3:57 pm, precisely seven minutes before the chaos of dismissal would engulf this haven of nap-time and crayon scribbles.  Amelia could almost feel it coming - the clamouring for coats, the frantic farewells from frazzled parents, the inevitable sticky handprint smeared across the once-pristine white wall. She sighed, her breath misting in the cool air. 

It was days like these, with the looming threat of after-school pandemonium, that Amelia questioned her life choices. Maybe a career as a librarian wouldn't have been so bad. At least there, the only chaos would come from misplaced Dewey Decimal numbers and the occasional overdue book.  But then sheâ€™d catch little Liam's eye, his face alight with pure joy as he built a tower of blocks taller than himself, or watch Lily painstakingly paint a picture of her family, and Amelia knew she wouldn't trade it for the world.


The setting is a brightly-coloured, but slightly chaotic preschool classroom on the last day before a long weekend.
