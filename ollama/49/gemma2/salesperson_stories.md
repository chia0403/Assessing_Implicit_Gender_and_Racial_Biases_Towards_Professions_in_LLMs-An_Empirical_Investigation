The fluorescent lights hummed over Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head like a swarm of agitated bees. She ran a hand through her meticulously styled auburn hair, the faint scent of jasmine perfume clinging to her fingertips. Her mirrored reflection stared back at her, eyes sharp and determined despite the weariness etched around them. 

Amelia was a woman who thrived on commission. A seasoned salesperson at "Luxury Living," an upscale furniture store in the heart of Manhattan, she had a knack for selling dreams, weaving narratives around velvet sofas and marble countertops that left customers convinced they were investing in more than just objects. But lately, the gleam of the city hadn't felt as bright. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. The usual buzz of affluent shoppers was replaced by a hushed murmur of anxiety. Even the meticulously arranged displays seemed to droop under the weight of an uncertain future. Amelia knew their quarterly reports were dismal, and whispers of layoffs echoed through the showroom like chilling drafts.  


The clink of a glass door opening jolted her from her thoughts. A tall man, dressed in a rumpled suit, stepped into the cool air of the showroom, his face etched with the same troubled line as Amelia's own reflection. This was it. He was their last hope for hitting their target this month.
