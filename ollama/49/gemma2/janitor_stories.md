The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Barth" Hemmingsworth like a damp towel as he pushed his mop bucket down the cavernous hall. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the linoleum floor that mirrored the grime Barth was tirelessly battling. 

It was 3:00 AM at the Grand Magnolia Theatre, its majestic Art Deco facade hidden behind a veil of pre-dawn mist.  The air smelled faintly of stale popcorn and spilled soda, remnants of the boisterous crowds that had thronged the theatre just hours before for the final showing of the smash-hit musical "Midnight Symphony." Now, silence reigned except for the rhythmic squeaking of Barth's mop and the distant hum of the cooling system struggling to combat the relentless southern heat.  


Barth meticulously scrubbed the spilled cherry soda from the red velvet carpet in front of the stage entrance, a familiar chore after every performance. He dreamt of someday seeing "Midnight Symphony" himself, but his reality was confined to these shadowed hallways, cleaning up after the dreams and fantasies of others.
