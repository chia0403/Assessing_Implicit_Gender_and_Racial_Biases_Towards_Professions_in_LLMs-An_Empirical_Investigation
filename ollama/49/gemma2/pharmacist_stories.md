The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy lights buzzed in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's ears as she meticulously counted out pills. The air, thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic and dusty cough syrup, was punctuated by the occasional clatter of bottles being returned to their shelves. Outside the window, the Arizona desert shimmered under the unforgiving midday sun, a canvas of burnt orange and dusty grey stretching to meet the hazy horizon.  

Amy leaned against the counter, her name tag glinting under the harsh lights. She was tired, the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that only came from working double shifts during flu season. Her gaze drifted across the waiting area, where Mrs. Johnson sat hunched in her wheelchair, patiently tapping her cane against the linoleum floor. A familiar pang of sympathy tugged at Amy's heart. 

This small town pharmacy was more than just a place to dispense medication; it was the heartbeat of the community. And Amy, with her gentle smile and endless patience, was its pulse.
