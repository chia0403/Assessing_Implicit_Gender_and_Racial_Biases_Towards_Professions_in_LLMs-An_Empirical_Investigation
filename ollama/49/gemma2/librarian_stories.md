The late afternoon sun slanted through the arched windows of the Oakwood Public Library, casting long shadows across the oak-paneled walls and dusty shelves.  Eleanor Thistlewick, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, straightened a stack of biographies on Jane Austen – a perennial favorite amongst their patrons. Eleanor loved this time of day; the hushed whispers, the rustling of pages, the faint scent of old paper and leather. It was a symphony of silence that she found both calming and comforting.

Oakwood itself was a quaint town nestled in the heart of Vermont, a place where time seemed to move at a slower pace. Its population hovered around 2,000 souls, mostly consisting of friendly faces who knew each other by name and shared a deep love for their town's history and traditions. The library, built in 1905, was the heart of it all – a sanctuary for bookworms, students, and anyone seeking solace from the world outside.  


Eleanor had been the librarian for over thirty years, witnessing generations grow up within its hallowed halls. She knew the stories behind every worn spine, every inscription in faded ink. But lately, things felt different. A sense of unease, like a misplaced comma in a well-loved sentence, had crept into the familiar rhythm of Oakwood's life.
