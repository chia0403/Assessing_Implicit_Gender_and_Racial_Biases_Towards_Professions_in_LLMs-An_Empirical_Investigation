The late afternoon sun beat down on Coach Amelia "Amy" Hayes's weathered face as she surveyed her domain. The dusty, cracked asphalt of Willow Creek High School's football field stretched before her, baked hard and shimmering in the summer heat. The bleachers, rusting with neglect, cast long shadows across the grass that struggled to grow in patches between the cleats and faded goalposts. 

Amy sighed, pushing a strand of auburn hair from her forehead.  This wasn't the picture-perfect field she'd envisioned when she agreed to coach the Wildcats. The budget was tighter than a drumhead, the team smaller than last year's roster, and most players looked more interested in their phones than the playbook clutched in Amyâ€™s hand. But something about those tired faces, that flicker of hesitant hope in their eyes, kept her going. They needed someone to believe in them, and Amy Hayes was determined to be that someone.


The first tentative whistle pierced the humid air, signaling the start of practice. This year, she had a plan. A plan to build something more than just a team. She wanted to build a family.  And maybe, just maybe, win a few games along the way.
