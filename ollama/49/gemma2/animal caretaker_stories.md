The first rays of dawn painted the dew-laden grass with shimmering emerald stripes. A thin veil of mist clung to the valley floor, obscuring the towering peaks beyond the enclosures.  Inside the warm, comforting chaos of Willow Creek Animal Sanctuary, Elara Rosethorn hummed softly as she swept fallen hay from the spacious barn aisle. The scent of damp earth and sweet alfalfa filled her lungs with a familiar contentment. 

Elara loved this time of day. While the sanctuary was still slumbering, she had a few precious moments of quiet before the day's cacophony began: the bleating of sheep, the grunts of pigs, the chirps of rescued birds demanding breakfast. As Head Caretaker, Elara held a special bond with every creature under her watch, knowing their individual quirks and needs by heart.  Today, however, a sense of unease fluttered in her chest. A new animal was arriving, a mystery shrouded in secrecy, and Elara couldn't shake the feeling that this newcomer would change everything.
