The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay in the bustling port of Aisling Harbor.  Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries swallowed by the cacophony of clanging ship hulls, hawkers’ calls, and the rhythmic slap of waves against weathered dock pilings.  

Amelia "Amy" Grace Thorne, her trench coat collar pulled high against the damp chill, navigated the crowded space with practiced ease. She was used to the chaos; it was a symphony she'd learned to appreciate, each discordant note adding to the vibrant tapestry of Aisling. Her keen eyes, framed by unruly auburn curls escaping their braid, scanned faces, searching for a particular one – Mr. Silas Blackwood, the portmaster, known for his gruff demeanor and even grumpier frown.  He was rumored to be holding secrets that could sink a ship, and Amy intended to unearth them.
