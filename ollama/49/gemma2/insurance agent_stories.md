The midday sun beat down on Amelia Claire Davenport's neck as she stepped out of her air-conditioned office into the humid Georgia heat.  Sweat beaded instantly on her brow, despite her best efforts to keep her powder blue suit pristine. This wasn't exactly how she envisioned spending a Tuesday afternoon – stuck in Macon with another routine home appraisal for an insurance claim.

The address led her to a ramshackle Victorian house perched precariously on the edge of town, surrounded by overgrown weeds and creaking porch swings. The paint peeled like sunburnt skin, revealing faded patches beneath. Amelia adjusted her designer sunglasses and took a deep breath, hoping she wouldn't find herself needing one of those "accidentally swallowing a bee" insurance policies she often peddled. This was definitely not the kind of property that drew in young families with their pristine white picket fences and gleaming SUVs. 

The porch creaked ominously as Amelia stepped onto it, the floorboards groaning under her weight like an ancient lament. A rusted mailbox hung askew, its contents spilled out like forgotten secrets. She knocked tentatively on the warped wooden door, a hollow sound echoing in the stillness of the afternoon.  


Amelia Claire Davenport was not one for unsettling mysteries. But duty called, and she had a reputation to uphold – even if it meant facing down the ghosts of Macon's past.
