The air hung heavy with the scent of stale pizza and teenage angst in the cramped counselling room at Northwood High. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's face as she stared down at the crumpled note on her desk. 

It was unsigned, scrawled in uneven handwriting: "Theyâ€™re coming for me. Help."

Ellie sighed, massaging the bridge of her nose. It was Friday afternoon, the time when stress levels typically peaked among both students and staff.  She hoped this was just another case of a student overreacting to a minor conflict, a common occurrence in the high-pressure environment of Northwood High. But the starkness of the message sent a shiver down her spine. This wasn't like the usual anxieties about tests or crushes. 

This felt different. 


Northwood High was a sprawling brick building on the outskirts of a quiet suburban town, nestled amongst rolling green hills and manicured lawns. A seemingly idyllic setting for teenage life, yet beneath the surface lurked a simmering unease. Ellie had been noticing it lately: whispers in the hallways, withdrawn expressions, an underlying tension that seemed to permeate every corner of the school. This note, however, was a stark reminder that something was truly amiss.
