The flickering crimson lights of the console painted Alexandra "Alex" Petrova's face in an unsettling glow. The hum of the Aurora's engines was a constant, reassuring drone, a counterpoint to the static crackle of the comms. Outside her cockpit window, the swirling nebula of Epsilon Eridani blazed like a celestial firestorm, a breathtaking tapestry of crimson and violet against the black velvet of space. 

Alex gripped the control stick, knuckles white against the worn leather. Her ship, the Aurora, a battered but reliable freighter, danced precariously on the edge of the nebula's turbulent currents. It was a risky route, one avoided by most experienced pilots, but Alex wasn't known for her prudence.  

"Alex to Command," she spoke into the comms, her voice steady despite the churning in her stomach. "Approaching designated coordinates. ETA five minutes." 


The response was met with static silence. Alex sighed. Typical. Command had been distracted by a diplomatic crisis on Proxima Centauri for weeks now.  She wasn't surprised they were ignoring her routine cargo run to the mining colony of Kepler-186f. Still, she wished for some confirmation, even a curt "Roger that," before plunging further into this volatile cosmic storm.
