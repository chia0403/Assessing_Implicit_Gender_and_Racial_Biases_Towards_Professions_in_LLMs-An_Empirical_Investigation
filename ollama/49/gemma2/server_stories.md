The air in The Rusty Spigot hummed with the low murmur of conversation, punctuated by the clinking of glasses and the occasional boisterous laugh.  Heat radiated from the worn wooden floorboards beneath Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's feet, remnants of the day’s sun trapped within the crowded bar's brick walls. Dusty beer signs hung precariously above the sticky tables, their faded paint whispering tales of long-forgotten promotions and even longer nights. Ellie navigated the throng with practiced ease, a worn notepad tucked behind her ear and a smile plastered on her face, the grease from the day’s shift clinging to her blonde curls. 

It was Saturday night in Pine Ridge, a town where secrets were traded like gossip over lukewarm beer and dreams came to die as quickly as they bloomed. Ellie knew them all, these regulars – their stories, their vices, their unspoken desires. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she took in the scene: a stranger at the far end of the bar, his face obscured by shadow, his eyes fixed on her with an unnerving intensity. He was a storm cloud in the otherwise familiar landscape of The Rusty Spigot, and Ellie knew, with a chilling certainty, that his arrival would change everything.
