The air in The Grand Bellagio hummed with a familiar symphony: hushed voices murmuring in languages both foreign and familiar, the clinking of champagne flutes against crystal, and the soft thrum of Italian opera emanating from the hidden ballroom downstairs. 

Eleanor Persephone Beaumont, or "Ellie" as she preferred, stood sentinel at her post, the mahogany concierge desk gleaming under the opulent chandeliers. Her tailored emerald dress hugged her slender frame, a vibrant splash of color against the muted golds and creams that dominated the lobby. Ellie, with her pearl-strewn bun and a smile that could charm a viper out of its scales, was the undisputed guardian of this world of luxury, ready to solve any problem, fulfill any whim, as long as it lay within the gilded walls of The Grand Bellagio.  

Tonight, however, felt different. A storm raged outside, lashing against the towering windows like an angry beast. Ellie could feel a shift in the air, a palpable tension that had the patrons whispering nervously amongst themselves. And then, just as the opera crescendoed, a figure swept through the grand doors, bringing with them a gust of rain and a whirlwind of secrets.
