The aroma of freshly baked cinnamon rolls wafted through Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s open-door studio, mingling with the scent of sawdust and paint thinner. Sunlight streamed in through the expansive windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across her chaotic workspace.  Amelia, a whirlwind of auburn hair and impulsive energy, surveyed her latest project: an antique chaise lounge she'd salvaged from a dusty flea market. Its faded velvet upholstery cried out for restoration, its intricate wooden frame begging to be polished back to life.

Her studio was nestled in the heart of Savannah, Georgia – a city where history whispered from every cobblestone street and moss-draped oak tree. The air hummed with the languid rhythm of Southern life: the gentle clinking of teacups on wrought iron balconies, the rhythmic strumming of a banjo from a nearby porch, and the occasional honk of a car weaving through the charmingly chaotic streets. Amelia loved this city, its vibrant energy, and the endless stories it held within its walls. 


Today, however, the familiar charm felt overshadowed by a knot of anxiety in Amelia’s stomach. A particularly demanding client, a renowned fashion designer known for his flamboyant style and even more extravagant demands, was arriving that afternoon. This project could make or break her burgeoning business.
