The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air, a calming shroud over Evelyn Rosethorn's small practice nestled on a quiet side street in Portland, Oregon. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the city lights into a hazy watercolor. Inside, the muted glow of candles and fairy lights danced across the worn wooden floor, casting long shadows that stretched with each flickering flame. 

Evelyn, her name whispered like a secret melody by those who knew her touch well, was kneading the knots from Mr. Henderson's shoulders. He was a regular, a stoic accountant with a spine perpetually hunched from years of staring at spreadsheets.  His sighs, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of Evelyn's palms against his back, were the only sounds that broke the quiet symphony of the storm outside. 


But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Evelynâ€™s spine as she worked, a sense of watchful eyes lingering in the periphery of her vision. She dismissed it as nerves, telling herself it was just the anticipation of a new client scheduled to arrive in ten minutes, someone recommended by Mr. Henderson himself.
