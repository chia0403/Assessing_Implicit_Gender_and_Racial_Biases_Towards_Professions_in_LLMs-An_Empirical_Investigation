The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung thick in the air, a soothing veil over the rhythmic hum of Dr. Eleanor Rosethorn's adjusting table. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stillness of her sun-drenched office. Outside, the bustling heart of Asheville, North Carolina, throbbed with life – tourists browsing artisan shops, musicians filling the air with melodies, and the ever-present aroma of apple cider donuts from the nearby bakery. But inside Dr. Rosethorn's haven, time seemed to slow. 

Eleanor hummed softly as she prepared her tools, her fingers expertly gliding over the smooth surface of a stainless steel adjusting tool. She loved this quiet before the storm – the anticipation of easing another person's pain, watching their tense shoulders melt away, and witnessing the return of their effortless movement.  


This morning, however, a prickle of unease danced at the edge of her focus. A new patient was scheduled to arrive soon, someone who had requested an appointment with "Dr. Rosethorn specifically." Their file held no details beyond that cryptic note, leaving Eleanor both intrigued and slightly apprehensive.
