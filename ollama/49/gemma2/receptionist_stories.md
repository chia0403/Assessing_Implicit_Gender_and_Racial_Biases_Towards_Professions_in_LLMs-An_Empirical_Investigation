The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Brighton's head, casting a sterile glow over the polished reception desk. Her fingers tapped impatiently against the cool surface, a metronome marking the agonizingly slow passage of time. The only sound besides the incessant hum was the faint whirring of the office air conditioner struggling to combat the August heat. 

Amelia longed for the ocean's salty breeze, the crashing waves a far cry from the monotonous drone of the office phone. This small dental practice, tucked away in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Brighton Beach, was hardly the glamorous dream she'd envisioned upon graduating with her degree in Communications. Still, rent was due, and dreams didn't pay the bills. 


She glanced at the clock again â€“ 9:48 AM. Where was Dr. Singh? He was always late, but this was ridiculous even for him. Amelia stifled a sigh, wishing she could be anywhere else. She yearned for adventure, for something more exciting than scheduling appointments and fielding complaints about dental insurance. Perhaps tomorrow would bring a change, a spark of excitement in this otherwise predictable routine.
