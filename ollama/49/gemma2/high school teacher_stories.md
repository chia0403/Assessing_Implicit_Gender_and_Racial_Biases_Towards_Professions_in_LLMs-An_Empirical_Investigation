The scent of stale chalk dust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, her crimson cardigan stretched taut over a burgeoning belly, surveyed her classroom with a sigh. Empty desks lined the worn linoleum floor, each one bearing the ghost of a teenage soul who had passed through her English Lit class. She ran a hand over the chipped paint on her desk, imagining the countless hours spent grading essays, debating Shakespeare, and trying to instill a love for literature in a generation more interested in TikToks and their dwindling attention spans. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cracked windowpane, painting the room in hues of dusty rose and fading gold. Outside, the familiar sounds of a small town – crickets chirping, car engines humming – seemed to whisper promises of an evening filled with quiet solitude. Amelia craved it, her mind already buzzing with anxieties about the upcoming parent-teacher conferences, the mounting pile of lesson plans, and the ever-present ache of loneliness that had become a constant companion since her husband’s passing two years ago.
