The aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the brisk November chill that seeped through the cracks in Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's cozy office window. Outside, leaves the color of burnt umber pirouetted down onto the pavement, their dance mirroring the restless energy swirling inside Ellie herself.

Her small practice, tucked away on a quiet side street in Boston's charming Beacon Hill neighborhood, was usually a sanctuary of calm. But today, the air crackled with an unspoken tension.  Ellie, normally a beacon of sunshine and encouragement, fidgeted with her jade bracelet, its smooth coolness failing to soothe her nerves.

This wasn't just another appointment. Today, she was meeting with Mr. Alistair Worthington III â€“  a man whose family name echoed through Boston society, whose wealth was legendary, and whose health was rapidly deteriorating. He had been referred to Ellie by his doctor, a last-ditch effort to salvage a lifestyle that seemed to be spiraling out of control. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing Alistair's arrival, and Ellie took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenge ahead.
