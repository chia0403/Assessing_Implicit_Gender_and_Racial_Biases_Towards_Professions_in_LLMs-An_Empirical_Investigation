The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Ebonreach, whistling through the gaps in Sergeant Elara Thorne's armor. Her breath frosted in the air, each exhale a miniature dragon against the backdrop of the perpetually grey sky.  Ebonreach was known for its harsh beauty: jagged obsidian cliffs rose like petrified teeth against the horizon, and the wind carried whispers of ancient magic that chilled the bones. 

Elara stood at the head of her watchtower, a squat stone structure built into the side of one such cliff. From this vantage point, she could see for miles in every direction, but there was nothing out there today except the desolate landscape and the occasional scavenging vulture circling overhead. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the ever-present wind and the rasp of Elara's own breath. It had been weeks since their last sighting - weeks filled with an unsettling stillness that spoke louder than any roar of battle.  


Elara shifted her weight, her gaze fixed on the horizon. She wasn't sure what worried her more: the silence or the knowledge that whatever lurked out there was patient, waiting.
