The Arizona sun beat down on Elias Montgomery's neck as he wrestled a stubborn bougainvillea into place. Sweat beaded on his forehead, blurring the vibrant red blossoms before him. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of creosote and dust, punctuated by the distant buzz of cicadas. 

Elias surveyed the scene: a sprawling estate nestled against the foothills of Camelback Mountain, its manicured lawns a stark contrast to the rugged desert landscape beyond.  He worked for Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne, a wealthy couple who seemed perpetually on some whirlwind jet-setting adventure, leaving Elias to maintain their Eden in their absence. 


This particular day was different, however. A large moving truck sat parked at the end of the driveway, its contents spilling onto the pristine lawn like spilled secrets. And perched precariously on a stack of cardboard boxes, eyes wide and wary, stood a young girl with unruly brown hair and a backpack nearly as big as herself. Elias felt a pang of sympathy for her; the desert was unforgiving, and this wasn't exactly the welcoming committee she deserved.
