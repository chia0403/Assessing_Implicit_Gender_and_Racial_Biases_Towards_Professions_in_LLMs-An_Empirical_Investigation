The rhythmic chirping of Mrs. Eleanor Willowbrook’s classroom pet canary, Pip, was usually enough to drown out the early morning chatter of her second-grade class at Sunnyside Elementary. But this Monday, a different kind of buzz filled the air – one laced with nervous energy and hushed whispers.  

Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, casting rainbows across the worn linoleum floor. Rows of miniature desks sat like brightly coloured blocks, each adorned with a child's unique hand-drawn picture taped to the front. A giant globe stood sentinel in the corner, its continents swirling with shades of blue and green like a forgotten dream. Mrs. Willowbrook, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the scene with a mixture of amusement and concern.  Something was different today, something beyond the usual Monday morning jitters. A thick silence hung between the children, their eyes darting around the room like butterflies caught in a sudden gust of wind. 

She smiled warmly. "Good morning, my sunflowers! What's all the whispering about?" she asked, her voice as bright and reassuring as the yellow daffodils adorning the windowsill. But the silence remained unbroken. It was as if a hush had fallen over Sunnyside Elementary, leaving only Mrs. Willowbrook to break through it.
