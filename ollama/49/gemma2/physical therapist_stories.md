The rhythmic thrum of rain against the windowpane was Amelia Grace Thorne's favorite soundtrack for Mondays. It washed away the remnants of weekend chaos and created a tranquil atmosphere in her small, sun-drenched office nestled above The Book Nook in sleepy Oakhaven, Maine. The scent of fresh lavender, emanating from a diffuser by the waiting area, mingled with the earthy aroma of rain-soaked leaves, creating an almost magical ambiance. 

Amelia, tall and lean with a mane of unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping her messy bun, adjusted her glasses and surveyed the space. Everything was in its place: colorful yoga mats neatly stacked against one wall, gleaming weights arranged on shelves, and a whiteboard filled with inspiring quotes – all designed to put patients at ease and encourage healing. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along Amelia's spine. It wasn’t just the familiar Monday morning energy; it was a new patient scheduled for her first appointment slot – Mr. Samuel Blackwood, a renowned novelist whose latest bestseller had become a national sensation. He had come to Oakhaven seeking rehabilitation after a mysterious fall during a book signing tour in London.  

Amelia straightened her scrubs and smiled, the anticipation blooming into a quiet excitement. This wasn't just another appointment; it was an opportunity to work with someone both talented and enigmatic, a puzzle she couldn't wait to unravel.
