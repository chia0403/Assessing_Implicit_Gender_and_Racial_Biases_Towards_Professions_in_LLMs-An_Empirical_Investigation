The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" McGraw's neck like an angry blacksmith, sweat stinging his eyes as he squinted at the scaffolding towering above him.  He wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead, and took another swig from his lukewarm thermos. The air vibrated with the cacophony of construction: the guttural clang of metal against metal, the rhythmic thud of hammers, and the constant hum of machinery.  

Bart stood on the dusty ground floor of the new skyscraper rising in the heart of Chicago, a steel behemoth dwarfing everything around it. Buildings like this were becoming commonplace these days, monuments to progress and ambition that seemed to pierce the very sky. Bart wasn't sure he felt particularly ambitious, just grateful for the steady work, even if it meant enduring another scorcher in this concrete jungle.
