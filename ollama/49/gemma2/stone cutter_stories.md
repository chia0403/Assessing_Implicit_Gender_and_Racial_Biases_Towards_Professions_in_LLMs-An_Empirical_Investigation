The wind whipped across Silas Stonehollow's weathered face, carrying the scent of salt and brine from the churning sea just beyond the village walls. He squinted against the grey sky, his rough calloused hands gripping the worn handle of his chisel. The rhythmic clang of hammer against granite echoed through the bustling market square, a familiar soundtrack to life in Oakhaven. 

Silas was known throughout the village for his meticulous work. His creations, ranging from simple grave markers to elaborate monuments, were prized for their beauty and durability. Heâ€™d inherited his trade from his father, who'd inherited it from his, a lineage stretching back generations, their names carved into the very heart of Oakhaven itself. 

But today, Silas felt a knot of unease twisting in his gut. A shadow had fallen over the village, not just from the encroaching storm clouds, but from whispers carried on the wind. Whispers of a curse, of an ancient evil stirring within the depths of the nearby mountain.  He hoped it was nothing more than superstition, but as he glanced towards the looming peak, his heart pounded with a primal fear. The mountain held secrets, old and dark, and Silas had always been wary of its whispers.
