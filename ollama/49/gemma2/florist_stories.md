The air in Emilia Rosethorn’s shop always smelled like rain-soaked earth and promises. Not just any promises, mind you, but the kind whispered by lilies on dew-kissed mornings and breathed into existence by blushing roses.  

Emilia herself was a whirlwind of freesia-yellow hair pulled back in a loose braid, her emerald eyes constantly flitting between the overflowing vases and the customers shuffling through the door. Her shop, nestled on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh’s Old Town, was a riot of color. Crimson geraniums spilled from hanging baskets, fragrant lavender danced in the breeze from open windows, and vibrant sunflowers practically screamed with joy.  

Today, however, a tremor of unease ran through Emilia like a misplaced thorn. It started with the raven that perched on her windowsill, its obsidian eyes seeming to pierce into her very soul. Then came the customer - a gaunt man shrouded in shadows, his face pale as alabaster, who requested a bouquet of lilies, their white petals stained a sinister crimson at the edges.  

Emilia’s intuition, usually as sharp as a freshly honed knife, whispered of danger. This wasn’t just a simple flower order; this was a request laden with unspoken intent, a prelude to something she couldn't quite grasp but knew would change her life forever.
