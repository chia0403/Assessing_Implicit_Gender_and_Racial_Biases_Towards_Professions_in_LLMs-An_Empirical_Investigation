The stale air hung heavy in the catacombs beneath Paris, thick with the scent of damp earth and centuries-old dust.  A single flickering bulb cast long, dancing shadows on the rough-hewn stone walls, highlighting the intricate carvings that adorned them.

Eloise Dubois-Martin, a petite woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its braid, adjusted her headset microphone with a sigh. "And as you can see," she announced in a clear, lilting voice, "these ossuaries are a testament to the sheer number of souls who have found their final resting place here.

Eloise, despite her passion for history and the macabre allure of the Parisian catacombs, found herself feeling a familiar pang of unease. The silence, broken only by the hushed whispers of the tourists and the occasional drip-drip of water, always seemed to amplify the weight of history pressing down upon them.
