The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed in harmony with Amelia Thistlewood's methodical tapping on her keyboard. Her world was one of neat rows of figures, balanced equations, and meticulously organized spreadsheets. The rhythmic click-clack of her keys was a soothing counterpoint to the frantic energy that always seemed to permeate the rest of the bustling insurance firm she worked for. 

Amelia Thistlewood, a woman who found solace in the immutable logic of numbers, had no need for such chaos. Her world was contained within the four walls of her cubicle, a small island of order amidst the storm of paperwork and phone calls that threatened to engulf everything else.  She felt safest there, surrounded by the comforting scent of stale coffee and printer toner, with only the gentle glow of her computer screen illuminating the familiar space. 

But today, something was different. A disquieting silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the distant hum of a malfunctioning air conditioner. It was the kind of stillness that preceded a storm â€“  a feeling Amelia usually dismissed as a quirk of her own overactive imagination. But this time, she couldn't shake it off. The hair on the back of her neck prickled with an unnerving sense of foreboding. 


The setting is a mid-sized insurance firm in a nondescript office building somewhere in a bustling city.
