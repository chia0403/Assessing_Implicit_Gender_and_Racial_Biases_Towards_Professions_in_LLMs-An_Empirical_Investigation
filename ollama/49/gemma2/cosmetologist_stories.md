The scent of lilac-scented shampoo hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of hair dye. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Brushed Up Beauty," bathing the rows of vibrant beauty products and mismatched vintage furniture in a warm glow.  

Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois expertly worked her magic on Mrs. Petrov's unruly silver curls, humming along to the 80s pop song playing softly on the radio. Esme wasn't just a cosmetologist; she was an artist, a confidante, and a weaver of transformations. Her salon wasn't just a place for haircuts and manicures; it was a haven where women could shed their worries and emerge refreshed, empowered, and ready to face the world.  

But today, something felt different. A nervous energy buzzed beneath Esme's usual calm facade. She couldn't quite place it, but there was a sense of anticipation hanging in the air, thick as the hairspray she liberally applied.  A shadow seemed to fall across the normally cheerful space, and Esme felt a shiver run down her spine. It was more than just the draft from the old, creaky door that had swung open â€“ it was something deeper, something unsettling.
