Rain lashed against Detective Alistair Finch's trench coat, each drop exploding like a miniature supernova on the slick cobblestones of Edinburgh's Royal Mile.  A biting wind whipped through the narrow alleyway, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something else, something metallic and acrid â€“ blood.  The flickering gaslights cast long, distorted shadows that danced along the crumbling brick walls, turning familiar shapes into grotesque phantoms. 

Finch, his face etched with weariness under his worn Stetson, crouched beside a body sprawled in a pool of crimson. The victim, a young woman dressed in a vibrant tartan shawl, lay still, her eyes vacant and staring up at the unforgiving sky. A silver letter opener glinted beside her hand, its sharpened tip stained an ugly red.  

This wasn't just another homicide; this was personal.
