The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room. Outside, the August heat shimmered on the asphalt, turning the world into a hazy mirage. Inside, it was a different kind of heat â€“ the one that comes from an overloaded air conditioner struggling against humidity and anticipation. 

Amelia, her name tag reading "A. Thorne" in bold blue letters, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck. It felt heavy with the weight of countless patient stories she'd silently listened to, each beat a rhythm of worry, hope, or simply exhaustion. She was good at her job.  Good enough to navigate the tangled web of veins on even the most squirmy patients, good enough to calm their nerves with a reassuring smile and a well-placed joke. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, like an unwelcome premonition.


This wasn't just another Tuesday morning at Willow Creek Clinic. Today, she had a feeling things were about to get complicated.
