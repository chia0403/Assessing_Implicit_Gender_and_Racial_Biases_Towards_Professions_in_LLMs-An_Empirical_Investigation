The asphalt ribbon stretched before him like a shimmering promise, vanishing into the hazy distance under the relentless glare of the Arizona sun. Dust devils danced on either side of the highway, swirling miniature tornadoes that spat gravel and grit onto Bartholomew "Bart" Callahan's eighteen-wheeler. Bart squinted through his sunglasses, adjusting the worn leather of his steering wheel as he navigated the endless sweep of Interstate 10.  He was hauling a load of cherries from California to Texas – another day, another delivery, another step closer to home. He just needed to get this haul through the Mojave Desert and over the mountains before nightfall.

The air inside the cab was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and stale coffee. Bart hummed along to a classic country tune crackling from the radio, its rhythm matching the steady thrum of the engine. His CB crackled intermittently, dispatch calls punctuated by the occasional trucker banter – jokes about long hauls, roadhouse cafes, and the ever-present threat of speeding tickets. 

Outside, the desert landscape remained unchanging: a vast expanse of sand dunes, scrub brush, and skeletal Joshua trees reaching for the unforgiving sky. Bart was alone in this world, a solitary figure navigating the highways that crisscrossed America, carrying with him not just cargo but also stories – tales whispered on CB radios, glimpsed in dusty roadside diners, or encountered in fleeting interactions at truck stops. Each story added another layer to his map of the country, and each delivery brought him closer to the life he craved: a quiet farmhouse, a porch swing, and the warmth of home.
