The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Thorne like a chorus of anxious cicadas. Each flicker cast her office in a flickering dance of shadow, mirroring the nervous energy that buzzed through the room.  

Amelia, perched on the edge of her desk, felt it keenly – the palpable tension radiating from the teenager seated across from her. He fidgeted with his phone, thumb scrolling listlessly while avoiding eye contact. This wasn't the usual "bored-of-high-school" malaise Amelia encountered every day; there was a deeper current of worry swirling beneath the surface. 

The small office, nestled in the labyrinthine corridors of Willow Creek High, held a comforting familiarity for Amelia. Posters of inspirational quotes adorned the walls – motivational slogans that felt increasingly hollow in this moment. She longed to peel back the layers of teenage angst and offer genuine solace, but she knew the key lay in his own words, unspoken yet heavy with unspoken pleas. 


"So," Amelia began, her voice gentle yet firm, "What brings you here today?"

The boy sighed, a sound like air escaping from a punctured balloon. He finally met her gaze – a sea of worry masked by teenage defiance.

"It's about college," he mumbled, his voice barely audible.
