Outside, a fierce autumn wind whipped fallen leaves across the cobblestone streets of downtown Salem, Oregon, but inside "Ellie's Emporium," warmth reigned supreme.

She glanced at the half-empty waiting area, her usual clientele of chatty retirees and bookish college students absent for once. Perhaps it was the autumn equinox – a day often associated with change and the unknown. Or maybe, just maybe, something else was brewing in Salem tonight.
