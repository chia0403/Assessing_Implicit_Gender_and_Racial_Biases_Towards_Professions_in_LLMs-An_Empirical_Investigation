The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety. Amelia "Amy" Harper, her starched white uniform crisp against her lean frame, maneuvered through the crowded waiting room of Dr. Lawson's clinic. 

It was a Thursday afternoon, prime time for walk-ins battling everything from sniffles to sprained ankles. A cacophony of coughs and sniffles filled the air, punctuated by the intermittent wail of a baby in distress.  Amy, with her calm demeanor and reassuring smile, was a beacon of order in this swirling sea of discomfort. Her stethoscope hung around her neck, ready to be deployed against the symphony of aches and pains that echoed throughout the room. 

Her gaze fell upon a woman hunched over, clutching her stomach with a grimace. Amy approached her gently, offering words of comfort and a promise of swift attention. The womanâ€™s face, etched with worry lines, softened slightly.  


This was the world Amy knew: a world of pain, fear, and the desperate hope for healing. She thrived in it, finding purpose and satisfaction in alleviating suffering, one patient at a time.
