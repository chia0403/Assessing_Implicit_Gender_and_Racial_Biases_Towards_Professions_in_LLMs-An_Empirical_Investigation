The crisp autumn air whipped through Eleanor Thistlewick's grey braids as she surveyed the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor. A veil of mist hung low over the manicured lawns, clinging to the ancient oak trees like spectral shrouds. Sunlight, pale and watery, struggled to pierce the gloom, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the crumbling stone walls. 

Eleanor, a woman of quiet strength with calloused hands and eyes as sharp as a hawk's, adjusted the worn leather strap of her gardening gloves.  This was her domain â€“ every twist of ivy, every bloom of forget-me-not, every rustling leaf whispered secrets only she could decipher. For thirty years, she had tended to Blackwood Manor, a symphony of life amidst the melancholy grandeur of decay. But this morning, a disquieting stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual autumnal hush.  

Something was amiss.
