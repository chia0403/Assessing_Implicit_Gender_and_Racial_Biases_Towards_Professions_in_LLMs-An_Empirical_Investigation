The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Brighton's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of waiting chairs in Dr. Henderson's office. Amy sighed, adjusting her green scrubs and wishing she'd worn her comfy shoes instead of these unforgiving, white-soled sneakers. It was 7:45 am on a Tuesday, and already the air buzzed with the nervous energy of patients bracing themselves for their twice-yearly dental check-up.

Amy loved her job; there was something strangely satisfying about making people smile – literally. But mornings like this, before the coffee kicked in and the first patient walked through the door, were always a bit... sterile. 


The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint tang of peppermint from the mouthwash dispensers. Through the open doorway to the treatment room, Amy could hear Dr. Henderson’s cheerful morning greeting – “Good morning, Sarah!  Ready for your cleaning?” - followed by a sigh that sounded suspiciously like resignation. 

Amy took a deep breath and smoothed down her name tag, ready to face another day of scraping away plaque and reminding people about flossing. Today, however, felt different. Something in the air, maybe even the way the light hit the waiting room carpet, whispered that this Tuesday wouldn't be just another Tuesday.
