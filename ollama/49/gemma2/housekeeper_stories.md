The scent of lemon polish clung to Elara Beatrice Hawthorne's apron like a second skin. She hummed along to the radio as she meticulously dusted the grandfather clock in the grand foyer of Blackwood Manor. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the polished marble floor. It was a Saturday morning, quiet save for the ticking of the grandfather clock and the distant cawing of crows beyond the manicured gardens.  Elara, however, wasn't alone in her tasks. 

The manor hummed with unseen presences, whispers flitting through the halls like autumn leaves caught in a breeze. She could almost feel their eyes on her, watching her every move as she straightened the velvet cushions on the chaise lounge and fluffed the silk pillows on the ornate settee. It wasn't something she discussed with anyone â€“ not Mrs. Blackwood, who lived in a perpetual state of melancholic grandeur, nor the groundskeeper, a gruff man who seemed more comfortable with the earth than the house itself.  But Elara knew. Blackwood Manor held secrets, whispered through its ancient walls, and she felt drawn into them like moths to a flickering flame.
