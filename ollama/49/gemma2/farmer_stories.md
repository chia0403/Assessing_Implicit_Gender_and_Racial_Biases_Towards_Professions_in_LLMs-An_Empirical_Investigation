The sun beat down on Silas Jebediah Thorne's neck as he squinted at the parched earth. Dust devils danced across his cornfield, mocking him with their carefree pirouettes. The wind, usually a welcome companion rustling through his sunflowers and carrying whispers of rain, was now a relentless desert demon, sucking every last drop of moisture from the soil. 

Silas lived on Thorne's Ridge, a sliver of land nestled between two sprawling mesas in the forgotten corner of Arizona. Generations of his family had tilled these fields, wrestling life from this unforgiving landscape. But this year, even Silas’ tenacity felt threadbare against the relentless grip of drought. His calloused hands, usually rough but comforting, trembled slightly as he picked up a withered stalk of corn, its husk dry and brittle.  

He spat into the dust, his face grim. This wasn't just about the failing crops; this was about survival. If there wasn't rain soon, Thorne’s Ridge wouldn't be a refuge, but a graveyard.
