The whirring of the antique Remington typewriter was Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's favorite sound in the world. It meant she was at work, which meant order, purpose, and a temporary reprieve from the chaos that often erupted in her personal life. Her fingers danced across the keys, transcribing a frantic message from Mr. Davenport, the head of the publishing house, to his elusive agent, requesting an update on the manuscript for "The Shadow's Requiem." 

Eleanor sat perched at her mahogany desk in the dimly lit corner office, bathed in the warm glow of the single lamp illuminating her workspace. Outside, London was a symphony of clattering trams and boisterous voices, but within these walls, it was just Eleanor, Mr. Davenportâ€™s incessant demands, and the comforting rhythm of the typewriter. Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling like tiny constellations against the rich velvet curtains drawn tight against the chill October evening.  


Eleanor straightened her spectacles, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. A pang of loneliness stabbed at her chest as she imagined Mr. Davenport's wife sipping tea by the fire, surrounded by laughter and warmth, while she remained here, the silent guardian of his literary world.
