The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Accounting Solutions" office hummed like a chorus of agitated bees, their buzz competing with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Beatrice Thornton's fingers against her keyboard.  Her small cubicle, crammed with stacks of invoices and overflowing filing cabinets, was bathed in the pale glow of her computer screen, casting long shadows that danced across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast a hazy orange light through the dusty windowpanes, but Amelia barely noticed. 

She was lost in a labyrinth of numbers, desperately trying to reconcile last month's sales figures with the inventory reports, a task made infinitely more complicated by Mr. Henderson's insistence on "creative accounting."  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Another day, another dollar, she thought wearily.  Or maybe not, considering the way things were going.
