The sun beat down on Bartholomew 'Bart' Callahan’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, sweat slicking his already grimy brow. He squinted through the haze, the smell of tar and hot asphalt mingling with the exhaust fumes from the distant highway. Below him, the city sprawled like a concrete jungle, shimmering in the midday heat.  Bart, perched precariously on the peak of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian, felt a familiar thrill course through him – the dizzying heights, the wind whipping at his hair, and the satisfaction of knowing he was literally building something beautiful, one shingle at a time.

The year was 1957, a time when men still wore hats and built things with their bare hands.  Rooftops were Bart’s domain, each house a puzzle to be solved, each repair a testament to his craft. He wasn't just fixing roofs; he was mending dreams, patching up broken promises whispered by the wind that whistled through these ancient eaves.
