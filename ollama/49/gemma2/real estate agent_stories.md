The late August sun beat down on Amelia Josephine "Millie" Cartwright's neck as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian manor across the street.  The peeling paint hung like scabs, and ivy clawed its way up the walls with an almost desperate tenacity. This was it – 27 Willow Creek Lane, the fixer-upper that had been Millie’s ticket to a promotion at "Living Dreams Realty," if she could manage to sell it.

Willow Creek Lane itself was a quaint, tree-lined street nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a town where time seemed to flow at a different pace.  Gabled roofs and manicured lawns were the norm, but 27 Willow Creek Lane stood out like a forgotten relic, a silent testament to past grandeur now shrouded in decay. Millie hoped that beneath the layers of neglect lay a story waiting to be told, a story she could use to entice a buyer willing to breathe new life into this architectural gem.  


She smoothed down her crisp white blouse and adjusted the brim of her sunhat, ready to face the inevitable questions from the curious neighbors who would inevitably emerge, their whispers swirling around her like summer cicadas.
