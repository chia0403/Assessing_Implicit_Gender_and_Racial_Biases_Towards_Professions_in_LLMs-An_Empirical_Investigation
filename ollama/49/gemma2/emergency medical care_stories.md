Inside the ambulance, Amelia Grace Thornton braced herself against the jolting ride, her eyes fixed on the pre-hospital monitor displaying a rhythmic flatline. She could feel the pulse of the city thrumming through the metal chassis, a chaotic symphony of sirens and screeching brakes punctuated by the worried murmur of her partner, Danny.

"Another hit-and-run, Grace," he said, his voice tight with fatigue. "This one's bad."

Amelia swallowed, her jaw clenching. This city, with its relentless energy and shadowed alleys, had a way of turning beautiful chaos into brutal tragedy. The rain seemed to amplify the sense of urgency, each drop drumming like a tiny hammer on the roof.  They were racing against time, not just for the man lying motionless in the back, but also for the fragile hope clinging to his heart-rate monitor. 


Amelia glanced at him once more â€“ a young man, barely out of his teens, with dark hair plastered to his forehead and eyes squeezed shut. He wore a faded leather jacket, a hint of defiance against the storm raging both outside and within.  

"We've got to get him to Mercy General," she said, her voice calm and focused, despite the knot of anxiety in her stomach. "Time is critical."
