Here, on this rugged coast, amidst the ever-changing moods of the sea and sky, she found solace, capturing fleeting moments of light and shadow that whispered stories untold. Today, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck, a hushed tension in the air, like the ocean itself was holding its breath.
