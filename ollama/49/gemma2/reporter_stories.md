The stale cigarette smoke clung to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather like a second skin. It wasn't her scent, but it was the aroma that permeated the dingy tavern she called her temporary office – The Rusty Mug, tucked away in the seedier side of Newgate City. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already murky streetlamps into halos of yellow light.

Amy hunched over a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, her fingers drumming impatiently on the worn wood table. She squinted at the crumpled note clutched in her other hand – "Meet me at midnight. The docks. Come alone." A shiver ran down her spine, not entirely from the cold seeping through the tavern's threadbare curtains. This wasn't your average tip about a missing cat or a leaky roof. 

This felt different.  Dangerously different. And Amy Bellweather, despite the weariness etched on her face and the skepticism in her voice, thrived on danger.


The docks at midnight. A city shrouded in rain. A whisper of secrets on a crumpled note. This was where the story began.
