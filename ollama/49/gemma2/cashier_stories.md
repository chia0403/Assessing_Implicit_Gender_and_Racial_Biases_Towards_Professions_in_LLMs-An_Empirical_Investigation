The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Valencia's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of discount toiletries and dusty DVDs. She tapped her acrylic nails against the chipped counter, counting down the minutes until her shift ended. Another Tuesday night at Discount Dreams, another symphony of beeps from the cash register, endless questions about loyalty cards, and the occasional muttered insult from a customer who couldn't find the "2 for $5" deal on their favorite brand of ramen.  

Esmeralda glanced at the clock: 9:47 pm. Just three minutes until freedom. She idly swiped through her phone, scrolling past cat memes and news articles about politicians arguing over something she didn't understand. The bell above the door chimed, breaking the monotonous silence. A lone figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the neon glow of the "Open" sign. He was tall and wore a dark coat that swallowed his frame.  Esmeralda felt a shiver run down her spine. It was late, and this was definitely not a regular customer.

He walked towards the counter, each step echoing in the cavernous space. Esmeralda forced a smile, her practiced cashier demeanor suddenly feeling flimsy and inadequate.


"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.
