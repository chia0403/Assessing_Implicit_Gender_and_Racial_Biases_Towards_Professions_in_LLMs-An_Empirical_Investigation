The flickering fluorescent lights of Mercy General Hospital cast long, sickly shadows across the linoleum floor. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her lavender scrubs already rumpled from a morning of drawing blood, sighed as she pushed her cart down the hallway. The air hung thick with the antiseptic tang of bleach and the faint metallic scent of fear. Today was one of those days where every vein seemed determined to hide, every patient insisted they were "terrified of needles," and the coffee machine in the break room had chosen, cruelly, to malfunction. 

Amelia rounded a corner, her eyes scanning the names on the doorplates. Room 305. Mrs. Eleanor Davies, 82, requiring a routine blood draw for a check-up. Amelia braced herself. She was good at her job, efficient and compassionate, but dealing with elderly patients could be tricky. Their veins were often fragile, their skin paper thin.

She knocked gently on the door, steeling herself for the usual chorus of groans and complaints.
