The air in Mrs. Hawthorne's office hung thick with the scent of lavender polish and regret. Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she surveyed the chaos on her desk. Stacks of unopened letters threatened to topple, a half-eaten biscuit lay forgotten next to a chipped teacup, and Mrs. Hawthorne's latest dictation, scrawled in furious ink across three pages, seemed to pulsate with unspoken rage.

Eleanor sighed, straightening a crumpled photograph of a stern-faced man – presumably Mr. Hawthorne, long deceased – perched precariously on the edge of a dusty ledger. The clock on the mantelpiece chimed four o'clock, reminding her that Mrs. Hawthorne was due back any minute from her weekly bridge game.

Eleanor braced herself. This week's dictation had been particularly unsettling, filled with veiled threats and allusions to "unscrupulous competitors" and "lost opportunities."  Mrs. Hawthorne, once a formidable socialite and now a reclusive widow, seemed increasingly consumed by paranoia and bitterness. Eleanor worried about her employer's sanity, but what could she do? She was merely the secretary, a silent observer in this crumbling mansion overlooking the stormy North Sea.
