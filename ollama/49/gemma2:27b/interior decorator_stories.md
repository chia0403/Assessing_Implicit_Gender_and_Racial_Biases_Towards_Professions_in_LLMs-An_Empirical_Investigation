Rain lashed against the arched windowpanes of Genevieve Beaumont's studio, mimicking the frantic drumming in her chest. Outside, the Parisian sky was the color of pewter, mirroring the storm brewing within her.

Genevieve ran a hand through her fiery curls, frustration making them frizz further.  Three weeks. Three weeks she had poured over blueprints, fabric swatches, and antique furniture catalogues for Madame Dupont's grand salon. The prestigious client wanted a space that whispered old-world elegance while still exuding the vibrancy of modern Parisian life. 

But inspiration, usually Genevieve's constant companion, had abandoned her.  The empty canvas stretched before her - a digital mock-up on her computer screen – remained stubbornly devoid of personality. Today was the final presentation and Genevieve felt the cold grip of panic tightening around her heart.


She needed a spark. A jolt to reawaken the dormant creativity within. And then, through the driving rain, she saw it - a flash of vibrant yellow against the dreary grey backdrop.  A vintage Citroën Deux Chevaux, its roof adorned with sunflowers, chugged past her window.

Genevieve's breath hitched. Sunflowers...sunshine...a burst of color in a monochrome world. Could that be the key?
