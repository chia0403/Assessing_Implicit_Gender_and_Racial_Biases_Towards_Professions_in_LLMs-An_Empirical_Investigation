Rain lashed against the windows of The Critter Clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Evelyn "Ev" Blackwood.  The pungent smell of disinfectant couldn't mask the metallic tang of fear that clung to her scrubs. In the dimly lit examination room, a small whimper pierced through the drumming rain. A shivering chihuahua mix, its brown eyes wide with terror, huddled in a corner, a bandage crudely wrapped around its front paw.

Ev took a deep breath, steeling herself. This wasn't just any stray; this was Sparky, her childhood dog, lost for ten years.  He'd been gone since she was twelve, vanished one rainy night, never to be seen again. Now, here he was, battered and bruised, deposited on her doorstep by a kind stranger who found him whimpering in an alley. 

Ev knelt beside Sparky, offering a tentative hand. "Hey there, boy," she whispered, her voice trembling.  "It's me, Ev."


The rain continued to fall outside, but within The Critter Clinic, a storm of emotions raged: disbelief, joy, fear, and a desperate hope that the bond they shared ten years ago hadn't been broken by time and circumstance.
