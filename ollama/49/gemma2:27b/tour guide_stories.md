The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to cling to Amelia Roseweather's skin like a second shirt. Despite the suffocating heat, she plastered on her brightest smile as she gestured towards the crumbling facade of the ancient Mayan temple. "And here," she announced to her group, voice ringing out surprisingly clear above the cacophony of cicadas and chattering monkeys, "we have El Castillo, the 'Castle' â€“ a testament to the ingenuity and architectural prowess of this incredible civilization."

The tour group, a motley crew of sunburnt retirees and wide-eyed college students, murmured appreciatively. Amelia scanned their faces, searching for signs of boredom or disinterest. Engaging them was crucial; keeping them captivated meant good tips, and good tips meant she could afford another week in this enchanting, albeit sweltering, corner of Belize.


The jungle, a verdant tapestry of towering trees and tangled vines, pressed in around them, alive with the chirping of unseen birds and the rustle of unseen creatures.  El Castillo, bathed in dappled sunlight, stood sentinel amidst the emerald chaos, its moss-covered steps leading towards an unknown past.

Amelia took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of damp earth and blooming orchids, a heady mix that both grounded her and transported her back centuries. This wasn't just a job; it was a privilege, a chance to share the magic and mystery of this ancient world.
