The sun hammered down on Esmeralda County, Nevada, baking the already dry earth to a dusty crisp. Cicadas shrieked from the scrub brush lining the dirt road as Caleb Jericho wrestled his aging pickup truck up a steep incline. Dust plumed behind him like a ghostly apparition, coating the windshield in a fine layer of grime. Caleb squinted through it, his weathered face creasing further in frustration. 

This damn drought was going to be the death of him. His cattle were gaunt, their ribs showing through their dusty hides. The once-lush pastures were now brittle and brown, cracked like ancient pottery. He'd been forced to sell off half his herd already, a painful decision that gnawed at his soul.  Caleb Jericho, fourth generation rancher on this unforgiving land, wasn't about to give up without a fight. But the odds felt stacked against him, as relentless and scorching as the Nevada sun itself.
