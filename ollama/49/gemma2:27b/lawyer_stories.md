Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the neon cityscape beyond into an impressionistic smear of red and gold. The incessant drumming echoed the anxiety churning in her gut.  Eleanor, a sharp-tongued defense attorney with a reputation for taking on impossible cases, stared at the file splayed open on her desk.

The name glaring back at her: "State v. Gabriel Finch." A cold dread settled over her. This wasn't just another case; it was personal. Gabriel Finch, accused of embezzling millions from his own tech startup, was Eleanor's former fianc√©, the man who had broken her heart and shattered her faith in love five years ago.

Now, he sat behind bars, facing a sentence that could ruin him forever. And Eleanor, bound by both duty and a flicker of lingering affection, was the only one who could save him.
