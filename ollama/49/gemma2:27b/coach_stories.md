Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Coach Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow hue over the faded posters on the walls - motivational slogans promising "Victory" and "Teamwork," now mocking Bart with their unattainable ideals.  

The air hung thick with the scent of stale sweat and old coffee, a familiar aroma that usually brought him comfort. Tonight, however, it only amplified his despair. His team, the Ironwood Wolverines, were in freefall. They'd lost five games straight, their once-fierce spirit replaced by a dejected shuffle and averted gazes.  Bart stared at the whiteboard covered in Xs and Os, a strategic diagram that now felt as pointless as a wish upon a star. 

Outside, the wind howled like a wounded beast, its icy breath seeping through the cracks in the window frame. Bart shivered, pulling his worn leather jacket tighter around himself.  He had poured his heart and soul into this team, sacrificing time with his family, ignoring the growing ache in his knees. He'd promised them greatness, but all he'd delivered was disappointment. 

The question gnawed at him: Was it him? Had he lost his touch? Or were the Wolverines simply destined for failure? The answer, Bart knew, lay hidden somewhere within the storm raging both outside and within himself.
