The bell above the door tinkled merrily, announcing yet another arrival to "Curl Up & Dye," a cozy salon nestled in the heart of Oakhaven. Outside, autumn painted the leaves in fiery hues of orange and crimson, but inside, the air was warm with the scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braids piled atop her head like cinnamon buns, glanced up from the intricate pattern she was braiding into Mrs. Henderson's silver hair. A smile bloomed on Amelia's freckled face as she greeted the newcomer. "Welcome to Curl Up & Dye! What can I do for you?" 

The young man standing awkwardly in the doorway shifted his weight, a tangle of nervous energy barely concealed beneath a faded band T-shirt and ripped jeans. He fidgeted with a beanie perched precariously on his head, revealing a mop of unruly dark curls begging for some intervention.
