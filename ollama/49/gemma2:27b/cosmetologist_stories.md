The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and bleach, a familiar perfume in Elodie Marie LeBlanc's world.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating motes dancing in its path and catching on the strands of silver threading Elodie's braid.  She leaned over her client, Agnes, whose fiery curls were being meticulously transformed into a cascade of rose gold waves.

Elodie's salon, "The Painted Lady," nestled in the heart of New Orleans' Trem√© neighborhood, was more than just a place to get your hair done. It was a sanctuary, a haven where women shared secrets whispered over steaming cups of chicory coffee and stories spun between snips of scissors.  But today, a tremor of unease vibrated through Elodie as she worked. Agnes, usually a font of local gossip, was uncharacteristically quiet.
