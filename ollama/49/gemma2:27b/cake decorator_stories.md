The scent of vanilla bean and almond extract hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Elara Rosalind Finch's frazzled nerves. But today, even the sugary sweetness couldn't mask the tremor in her hand as she carefully piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake. The grand ballroom of the historic Oakhaven Hotel buzzed with pre-wedding chaos: caterers scurrying, musicians tuning, and nervous bridesmaids fluttering about like agitated butterflies. Elara, however, felt frozen in place, her usually steady hand betraying her anxiety.

This wasn't just any wedding cake; it was for Olivia Hawthorne, daughter of the notoriously demanding socialite Vivienne Hawthorne.  One wrong swirl, one misplaced petal, and Elara's fledgling bakery, "Sugar & Spice," could crumble faster than a day-old croissant. The weight of expectation pressed down on her like a fondant elephant.
