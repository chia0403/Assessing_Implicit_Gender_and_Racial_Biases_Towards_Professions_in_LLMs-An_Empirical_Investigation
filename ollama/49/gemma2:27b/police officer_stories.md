Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the squad car, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign hanging crookedly above Benny's Burgers. Detective Elias "Eli" Finch sighed, wiping a smear of condensation from his view with the back of his hand. The greasy spoon was usually teeming with late-night diners and truckers fueling up for long hauls, but tonight, it stood deserted except for a lone figure hunched over a booth in the corner. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and fried onions, a familiar comfort to Eli despite the unsettling gloom that had settled over him ever since he received the call about the body found down by the docks. This wasn't some run-of-the-mill mugging gone wrong. This felt different - colder, more deliberate.

Eli pushed open the door, the bell above it jangling a forlorn tune. He pulled his trench coat tighter around him, the chill of the October night seeping through despite its thick wool. The lone figure in the booth looked up, their face obscured by the shadow cast from the brim of a worn fedora.  Eli approached cautiously, his hand instinctively hovering near the holster beneath his jacket.
