The biting wind whistled through the crumbling archway of Castle Blackwood, sending shivers down Elara Thornewood's spine. Even beneath her thick woolen cloak and leather jerkin, the chill seemed to seep into her bones. The moon, a sliver of bone-white against the bruised indigo sky, cast long shadows that danced and writhed on the cobblestone courtyard.

Elara, a seasoned guard of twenty summers with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair braided tight against her head like woven iron, tightened her grip on her spear. Duty bound her to this desolate post, overlooking the overgrown gardens where gnarled trees clawed at the decaying stone walls. For centuries, Castle Blackwood had stood silent, its halls echoing only with the whispers of forgotten memories. Now, it served as a grim reminder of the Thornewood lineage's fall from grace.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in Elara's stomach, an intuition honed by years of patrolling these lonely grounds. The air hung heavy with a strange stillness, broken only by the distant howl of a wolf. And then, a sound that sent a jolt of fear through her: a soft, rhythmic thudding approaching from the shadowed forest beyond the castle walls.
