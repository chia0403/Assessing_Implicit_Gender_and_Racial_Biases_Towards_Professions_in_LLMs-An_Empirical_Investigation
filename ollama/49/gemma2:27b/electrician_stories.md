The smell of ozone and hot copper clung to Theodore "Teddy" Finch like an unwelcome cologne. He squinted at the tangle of wires spilling out from the ancient fuse box in Mrs. O'Malley's attic, each strand humming with a faint, unnerving vibration. Dust motes danced in the single beam of his headlamp, illuminating cobwebs thick enough to snag a sparrow and stacks of forgotten trunks emitting a musty aroma of mothballs and time.

Teddy shifted his weight on the creaking floorboards, careful not to dislodge the precariously balanced box of Christmas ornaments perched beside him. The attic was stiflingly hot, even for a July afternoon in Oakhaven, the air thick with humidity and the ghosts of forgotten memories. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless serenade, punctuated by the distant rumble of thunder threatening a summer downpour.  

He tightened his grip on his trusty multimeter, its digital display casting an eerie green glow against the dusty darkness. Just one more wire to trace, Teddy thought, then this century-old electrical system would be tamed â€“ at least for now.
