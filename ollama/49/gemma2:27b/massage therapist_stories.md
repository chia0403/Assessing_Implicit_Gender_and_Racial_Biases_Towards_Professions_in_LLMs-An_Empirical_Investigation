Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of "Tranquil Touch," obscuring the bustling Seattle street outside. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, a soothing counterpoint to the storm raging beyond. Eloise Beaumont, her fingers calloused but gentle, kneaded the tense muscles in Mr. Henderson's back. His sigh, a mixture of relief and exhaustion, resonated through the small, dimly lit room.  Eloise was known for her intuitive touch, able to pinpoint knots and release tension with uncanny precision. But tonight, something felt off. A strange prickling sensation danced along her fingertips, an unsettling premonition that she couldn't quite place. As Mr. Henderson drifted into a state of blissful relaxation, Eloise found herself drawn to the window, her gaze fixed on the swirling storm clouds. The rain seemed to be falling harder now, its rhythm mirroring the insistent thudding in her chest.
