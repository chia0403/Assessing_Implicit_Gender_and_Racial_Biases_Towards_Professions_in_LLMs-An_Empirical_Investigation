The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the sterile white walls of Mercy General Hospital's ER. Amelia Rose Callahan, her auburn braid whipping across her shoulder as she hurried, scanned the triage list in her hand. 

A young boy, barely five, clutched at his mother's arm, his face etched with pain and fear. A man lay groaning on a stretcher, clutching his chest with alarming force. An elderly woman whimpered quietly, her eyes glazed over. Each case represented another life hanging precariously in the balance, demanding Amelia's immediate attention.  

Tonight felt different though. The usual frenetic energy of the ER seemed tinged with something darker, an unspoken tension that crackled beneath the surface. A shiver ran down Amelia’s spine as she approached the latest arrival – a man slumped against the wall, his face pale and drawn, clutching a bloody wound on his chest. 

This wasn't just another night at Mercy General. Something was wrong, terribly wrong.
