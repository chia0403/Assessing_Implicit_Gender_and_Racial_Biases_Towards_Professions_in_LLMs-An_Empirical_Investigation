The smell of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of bleach and something faintly metallic - the ghost of a hundred razor nicks, perhaps. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes of "Salvatore's Shear Serenity," casting stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Salvatore Esposito, a man whose face was as creased and weathered as an old leather wallet, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. 

He ran a hand over the faded red velvet of his barber chair, its springs groaning in protest.  The mirror above it, once gleaming, now held a web of hairline cracks, mirroring the fine lines etching themselves around Salvatore's own sapphire blue eyes.


It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Deluca would be coming in for her weekly perm and gossip session, followed by young Tony from down the street, desperate for a "fade" to impress the girls at school.

Salvatore sighed. Business wasn't what it used to be. Times were changing, people were rushing about, haircuts weren't the leisurely ritual they once were. But he still held onto hope, a stubborn ember flickering in his chest, that maybe, just maybe, someone would walk through that door today and remind him why he loved this worn-out little shop more than anything else in the world.
