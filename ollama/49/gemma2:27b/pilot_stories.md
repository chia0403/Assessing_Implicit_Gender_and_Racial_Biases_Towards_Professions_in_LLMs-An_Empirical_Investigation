The acrid scent of burnt engine oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang of the approaching storm. Amelia "Ace" Sanchez grimaced, wiping grime from her forehead as she surveyed the mangled wreckage of her Cessna 172. It lay crumpled amongst the scrubby bushes on the edge of the desolate airstrip, a testament to her misjudged approach in the face of sudden wind gusts. The sky above churned with ominous grey clouds, spitting fat raindrops that stung her exposed skin.  

Ace wasn't one to panic. Years spent flying cargo across remote Alaskan landscapes had taught her resilience and resourcefulness. Still, she felt a gnawing unease. This tiny, forgotten airstrip in the heart of the Nevada desert was miles from civilization. No cell service. No buildings. Just endless sand dunes and the brooding mountains in the distance. She needed to find shelter, and fast.
