Rain lashed against the warped glass of the pharmacy window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a shimmering smear. Inside, Elias Finch meticulously counted out twenty-four tablets of lisinopril, his movements precise and economical. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and vanilla - a lingering aroma from the cinnamon bun Mrs. Henderson had left as a thank you for helping her decipher her new diabetes medication. 

Elias sighed, tucking the pills into their amber vial. It was nearly midnight, and he was the only soul awake in this sleepy coastal town. The storm, brewing all day, had finally broken with a vengeance, leaving Main Street deserted and shrouded in an ethereal mist. He yearned for the warmth of his cottage overlooking the churning sea, but duty called. 

Tonight, Elias wouldn't be just dispensing prescriptions; he'd be facing something far more unsettling than a stubborn cough or a persistent rash. A stranger had arrived earlier that evening, cloaked in shadow and urgency, requesting a rare herbal concoction. An concoction Elias hadn't seen in decades, whispered about only in hushed tones among older apothecaries. 

An icy shiver ran down his spine as he recalled the stranger's chilling words: "This is for someone very illâ€¦ someone who needs to remember." Elias wasn't sure what it all meant, but he knew this night wouldn't be like any other.
