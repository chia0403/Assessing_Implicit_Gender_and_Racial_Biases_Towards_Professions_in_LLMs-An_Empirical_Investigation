The stench of mildew hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste. A rusted pipe groaned above Esmeralda "Em" Delgado's head, its metallic wail echoing through the cavernous basement. Moonlight filtered weakly through a grime-coated window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air. Em, grease-stained overalls hugging her lithe frame, knelt beside a bubbling puddle of murky water, her brow furrowed in concentration. The ancient boiler wheezed like a dying dragon, spewing plumes of acrid steam into the already oppressive atmosphere. 

This wasn't the glamorous plumbing job Em had dreamed of as a girl, tinkering with faucets in her grandfather's workshop. This was a battle against years of neglect and creeping decay in a crumbling Victorian mansion perched precariously on a hill overlooking the foggy San Francisco Bay.
