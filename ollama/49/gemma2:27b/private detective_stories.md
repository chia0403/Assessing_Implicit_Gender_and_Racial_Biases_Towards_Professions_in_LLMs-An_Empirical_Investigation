Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finch's office, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of grime.  The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the cluttered desk piled high with files and half-eaten takeout containers.  Alistair himself was hunched over a faded photograph, his weathered face illuminated by the pale glow of a desk lamp. The photo depicted a woman with eyes the color of jade and a smile that could charm the birds from the trees. 

“Missing persons,” Alistair muttered to himself, tracing the outline of her delicate jawline. “Never gets easier.”

He ran a calloused hand through his thinning grey hair, the weight of years spent navigating the city's underbelly settling heavily on his shoulders.  Alistair Finch, once a promising detective in the NYPD, had traded the badge for a beat-up fedora and a rusty revolver after a case gone wrong left him disillusioned and yearning for something more tangible than justice.

The door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a woman cloaked in shadows.  She hesitated on the threshold, her silhouette barely visible against the stormy backdrop. 

“Mr. Finch?” she asked, her voice laced with desperation.
