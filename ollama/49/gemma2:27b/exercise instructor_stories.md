The humid Miami air clung to Elara Flores like a second skin as she adjusted the speakers blasting an infectiously upbeat salsa track. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the "Sunset Sweat" studio, illuminating a kaleidoscope of brightly colored yoga mats laid out across the polished hardwood floor.

Elara, her dark curls escaping their loose braid and beads of sweat already gathering on her brow, grinned at the expectant faces staring back at her. Today's class was a full house â€“ retirees eager to stay limber, young professionals seeking stress relief, even a few tourists lured by the promise of a "Miami Beach Body Blast." 

But as she launched into her usual energetic introduction, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A shadow seemed to lurk at the edge of her vision, a flicker of movement just beyond the shimmering heatwaves rising from the pavement outside.
