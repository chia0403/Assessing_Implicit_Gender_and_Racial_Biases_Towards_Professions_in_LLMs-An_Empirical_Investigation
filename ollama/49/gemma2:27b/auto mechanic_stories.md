The air in Silas "Si" Blackwood's garage hung thick with the smell of motor oil and gasoline, punctuated by the sharp tang of ozone from the welder he'd been using to patch a rust hole in a '67 Mustang. Sweat beaded on Si's forehead, catching the pale light filtering through the grimy windows. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly, turning the asphalt lot into a shimmering mirage.

Si wiped his brow with the back of his grease-stained hand and sighed, the sound swallowed by the hiss of the cooling welding torch. It was another sweltering summer day in Harmony Creek, a dusty crossroads town where time seemed to move at the pace of a sputtering engine. He loved working on cars, bringing them back from the brink with a combination of ingenuity and brute force. But lately, he'd been feeling like his own engine was running on fumes. Business had been slow, and the weight of unpaid bills pressed down on him like a leaden crankshaft.
