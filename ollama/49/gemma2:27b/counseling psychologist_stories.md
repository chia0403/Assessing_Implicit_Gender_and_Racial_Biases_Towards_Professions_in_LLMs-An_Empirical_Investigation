The scent of lavender hand soap hung heavy in the air, barely masking the underlying note of stale anxiety that permeated Dr. Amelia Blackwood's office. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the storm brewing inside her chest. Amelia stared at the untouched cup of chamomile tea on her desk, its steam long dissipated. Today marked five years since she’d lost her husband, Michael, and the anniversary always brought a fresh wave of grief crashing over her carefully constructed walls.

Her office, nestled in a quiet corner of an old Victorian house turned therapy center, was meant to be a sanctuary for others navigating their own emotional storms. Sunlight usually streamed through the stained-glass window above her desk, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn Persian rug. Today, however, the sky outside mirrored Amelia's internal turmoil – dark, brooding, and threatening.

As the clock ticked past 3:00 pm, Amelia braced herself for the arrival of her next client. A young woman named Chloe, struggling with debilitating social anxiety. It was time to put on her therapist mask, the one that hid the cracks beneath its surface. Time to be a beacon of hope in someone else's storm, even if her own raged within.
