Rain lashed against the grimy attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Eliza Thorne's brushstrokes. The cramped space, barely big enough to hold her easel, canvas, and overflowing paint pots, smelled faintly of turpentine and damp wood. Dust motes danced in the sliver of grey light that pierced the gloom, illuminating the unfinished portrait before her â€“ a hauntingly beautiful woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas. Eliza sighed, frustration knotting her stomach. The painting felt lifeless, lacking the spark that usually ignited her canvases. 

The incessant drumming of rain seemed to mock her struggle, each drop a hammer blow against her waning confidence. Eliza longed for the sun-drenched days she spent sketching in the rolling lavender fields of Provence, where inspiration flowed as freely as the wine at local cafes. But those days were gone, replaced by this dreary attic studio in London and the gnawing fear that her creative well had run dry.
