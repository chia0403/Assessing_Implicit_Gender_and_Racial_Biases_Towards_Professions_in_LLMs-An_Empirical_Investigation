The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez's head as she scanned another carton of milk. It was 3:17 pm on a Tuesday, which in the grand scheme of things at Bargain Buy Groceries meant it was peak toddler-meltdown time. A chorus of high-pitched wails echoed through the aisles, punctuated by exasperated sighs from parents. Esme sighed internally.

Bargain Buy wasn't exactly known for its ambiance. The linoleum floor perpetually felt sticky beneath her worn sneakers, and the air hung heavy with the scent of bargain-bin cleaning supplies and slightly bruised fruit. Still, it was a job, and Esme needed one to keep a roof over her head and ramen noodles in her pantry.
