The air crackled with static, mirroring the anxiety buzzing in Elias Finch's chest. He hunched over the workbench, the dim fluorescent light reflecting off his grease-stained fingers and the tangle of wires spilling out from the antique radio before him. This wasn't just any radio; it was a relic from a bygone era, its mahogany casing etched with intricate carvings and its brass dials gleaming like forgotten treasures.

Elias had inherited it from his grandfather, a man who spoke in whispers about hidden messages and frequencies only he could hear.  Now, Elias, a seasoned radio technician in the heart of bustling 1950s Chicago, was faced with deciphering his grandfather's cryptic notes, hoping to unlock the secrets hidden within the machine's dusty circuits.

The airwaves hummed with the usual symphony of voices - news broadcasts, crooning singers, and crackling advertisements - but Elias knew there was something more, something waiting just beyond the veil of static. His grandfather had hinted at a frequency, a "ghost channel" that carried whispers from another world, a place where time itself seemed to bend.


Elias took a deep breath, adjusting the dial with a practiced hand. The room grew silent, save for the soft click of the tuning mechanism and the rhythmic thumping of his own heart. This was it. He was about to step into the unknown.
