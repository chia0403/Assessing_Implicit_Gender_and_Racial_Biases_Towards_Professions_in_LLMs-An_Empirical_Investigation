Rain lashed against the arched windows of Professor Eleanor Winthrop's study, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. The scent of aged parchment and pipe tobacco usually calmed her, but tonight, it did little to soothe the gnawing unease in her gut. A telegram lay crumpled on her mahogany desk, its stark message a harbinger of something ominous: "Arrival imminent. Meet us at dawn."

Her pursuit had been met with skepticism from her peers, who dismissed it as fanciful speculation. Yet, she knew deep within her bones that this discovery was real. And now, a message from a clandestine organization she'd long believed to be fictional confirmed it. They were coming for the tomb, and they wanted Eleanor to guide them. 


The question wasn't whether to go; it was whether to trust them.
