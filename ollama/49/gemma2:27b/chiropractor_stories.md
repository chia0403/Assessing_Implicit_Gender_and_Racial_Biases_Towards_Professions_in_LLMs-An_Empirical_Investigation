Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Hawthorne's clinic, mimicking the hammering anxiety in his chest. He stared out at the blurred cityscape, neon signs bleeding into streaks of color through the downpour. The rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to mock him, each second a reminder that he was running dangerously late for his first appointment. 

Elias ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair, tugging at the strands in frustration. It had been a rough morning: spilled coffee, a dead car battery, and now this torrential downpour threatening to flood the city. He needed this day to go right. He'd poured his heart and soul into setting up this practice, painstakingly renovating the old Victorian townhouse into a welcoming sanctuary for weary backs and aching necks. Today was crucial â€“ he had scheduled a series of new patient appointments, each one a potential lifeline for his fledgling business.
