The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across the greasy asphalt. "Gus's Used Autos - Where Dreams Get Driven!" it proclaimed in bold, faded letters. Evelyn Beatrice Finch grimaced. Dreams rarely materialized here, usually replaced by sputtering engines and questionable upholstery. Still, she straightened her floral print blouse and plastered a smile on her face as the rusty bell above the door jangled, announcing her arrival.

Evelyn had been selling cars for five years, bouncing from one shady dealership to another. Gus's was her latest stop, a ramshackle lot crammed with vehicles that looked like they belonged in a junkyard, not on display. The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and desperation, a familiar perfume in Evelyn's world.


She inhaled deeply, pushing back the feeling of unease. Today was a new day, a chance to make something of herself. After all, even rusty dreams could be polished to shine, right?
