The air hung thick with the smell of fryer grease and desperation. Amelia "Amy" Dubois sighed, adjusting her nametag – slightly crooked as usual – and forced a smile at the couple entering the diner. The vinyl booths were mostly empty, save for a lone trucker nursing a coffee in the corner, his eyes fixed on the flickering television mounted above the counter.  Outside, the neon sign buzzed, casting a sickly green glow over the cracked asphalt parking lot. Rain lashed against the greasy windows, blurring the already fading cityscape beyond. Amy knew it wouldn't be a busy night.

Tonight was another Tuesday, another slow drip of customers and meager tips, punctuated by the endless clinking of cutlery and the hiss of the griddle. She yearned for something more – anything more – than the routine monotony of this greasy spoon diner on the edge of nowhere.  But for now, she had tables to clear, orders to take, and a dream to cling to, tucked away in the pocket of her faded apron.
