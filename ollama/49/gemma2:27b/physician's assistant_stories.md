It was another sweltering afternoon in St. Landry Parish, where time seemed to move at a languid pace punctuated by sudden bursts of frantic activity. 

Elara, a physician assistant fresh out of Tulane University, surveyed the waiting room with a sigh.

Yet, despite her dedication and training, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.
