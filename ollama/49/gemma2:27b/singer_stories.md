The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation in The Rusty Trumpet.  Neon flickered over chipped Formica tables, casting an unsettling green glow on Esmeralda "Esme" Nightingale's face as she nervously adjusted the microphone stand. Esme was used to dive bars â€“ they were the lifeblood of aspiring musicians like her. But tonight, something felt different. 

Maybe it was the weight of unsent demo tapes sitting in her backpack, each one a tiny beacon of hope sent into the vast abyss of the music industry. Maybe it was the way the barkeep eyed her with pitying amusement, already assuming she'd be another forgotten face lost in the neon haze. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the man seated alone at the back, his fedora casting a shadow over his face, who seemed to be listening intently to her every whispered note during soundcheck. 


Esme took a deep breath and closed her eyes, channeling all her anxieties into the melody she was about to sing. Tonight, she wouldn't just perform. She would pour her soul out onto that dimly lit stage.
