The sun beat down on Jasper Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already-tanned skin a shade darker. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, squinting at the expanse of shingles before him. The roof of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion sprawled out like a giant jigsaw puzzle, each shingle needing to be laid with meticulous precision.  Jasper preferred this kind of work – intricate and challenging. He wasn’t cut out for the mundane repetition of simpler roofs.

He was perched precariously on a scaffold that swayed gently in the summer breeze, the scent of freshly cut grass mingling with the tarry aroma of roofing felt. Below him, the manicured lawns of the affluent neighborhood stretched out like a green tapestry, dotted with ornate fountains and meticulously pruned hedges. A lone robin trilled from a nearby oak tree, its cheerful song a stark contrast to the steady clang of Jasper's hammer against the copper nails.

Today was different though. Today, as Jasper carefully maneuvered himself towards the dormer window, he felt a strange prickling sensation on his skin, like being watched.
