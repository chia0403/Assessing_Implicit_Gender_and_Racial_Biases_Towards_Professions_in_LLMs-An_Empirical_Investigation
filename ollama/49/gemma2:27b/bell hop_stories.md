The Grand Blackwood Hotel shimmered under the midday sun, its ornate facade a beacon of opulence against the backdrop of bustling 1920s Chicago. Inside, the air hummed with whispered secrets and the clinking of champagne glasses.  

Elias "Eli" Davenport, his uniform crisp and hat perched at a jaunty angle, weaved through the throng of guests in the lobby. He was a young man, barely twenty, with eyes that held the wisdom of someone far older. Years spent witnessing the triumphs and tragedies unfolding within the Blackwood's gilded walls had etched lines onto his face, lines invisible to the casual observer but deeply felt by Eli. Today, however, a spark of anticipation danced in those eyes. He was expecting a guest unlike any other, a guest who promised to change everything. 

Eli straightened his bowtie and smoothed down the creases in his trousers as the elevator doors pinged open. This wasn't just another delivery. This was destiny arriving on the tenth floor.
