Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright's cramped office, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. The flickering fluorescent light above cast long, unsettling shadows across the stacks of W-2s and 1099s that threatened to engulf her desk. April 15th loomed just three days away, and Bea, a seasoned income tax preparer with tired eyes and a caffeine dependency bordering on the unhealthy, felt the familiar pang of dread.

This wasn't some sterile corporate cubicle farm; Bea's domain was tucked away in a forgotten corner of downtown Cleveland, above a Chinese takeout joint that perpetually reeked of garlic and sesame oil. The walls were faded yellow, plastered with motivational posters featuring kittens dangling from tree branches with the caption "Hang in there!" - a cruel joke given Bea's current state.

The incessant ringing of her phone punctuated the symphony of rain and distant sirens. Each call was another frantic taxpayer begging for last-minute salvation, their voices a chorus of desperation and delayed filing anxiety. Bea sighed, massaging her temples, knowing she was in for another long night wrestling with deductions, credits, and the labyrinthine complexities of the American tax code.
