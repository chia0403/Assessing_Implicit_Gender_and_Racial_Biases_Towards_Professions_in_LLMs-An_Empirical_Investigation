The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous tune, casting a sickly yellow glow across the linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Theatre. Edgar Bartholomew Thistlewick III, armed with his trusty mop and bucket, surveyed the aftermath of another sold-out performance. Stray popcorn kernels littered the plush red seats like confetti, crumpled playbills whispered forgotten stories from beneath them, and the sweet, lingering scent of spilled champagne mingled with the metallic tang of dust.

Edgar sighed. He'd seen countless performances in his twenty years as the Grand Blackwood's night janitor - everything from grand operas to raucous rock concerts. Each left its own unique residue, a fingerprint of sound and emotion imprinted on the very fabric of the theatre. But tonight was different. Tonight, the air crackled with something unseen, a palpable hum beneath the usual symphony of settling dust and creaking floorboards. Something told Edgar this wouldn't be an ordinary clean-up.
