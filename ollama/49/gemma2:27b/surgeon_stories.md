Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the tempest raging inside Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the cramped operating room. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the chill in the air. Her hands, usually steady as rock, trembled slightly as she sutured the delicate tissue of her patient's heart.

Evelyn wasn't known for losing her composure.  She was, after all, one of the most gifted cardiac surgeons in the country, renowned for her cool head and unwavering focus. But tonight was different. Tonight, the life hanging precariously on the balance was that of her younger brother, Liam.

The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor filled the silence, each pulse a hammer blow against Evelyn's already strained nerves.  Liam had been in a motorcycle accident earlier that evening, and his injuries were severe. Now, Evelyn was fighting against time to repair the damage and give him a chance at survival.
