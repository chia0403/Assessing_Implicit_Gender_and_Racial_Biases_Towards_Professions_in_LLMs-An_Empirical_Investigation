The Miami humidity clung to Amelia "Amy" Diaz like a second skin, making her silk blouse feel more like plastic wrap. She adjusted her sunglasses, squinting at the sprawling Spanish Colonial mansion before her. Bougainvillea vines, bursting with magenta blooms, clawed their way up the stucco walls, framing arched windows that glinted in the midday sun. This was "Casa del Sol," a legendary estate rumored to have housed movie stars and rumrunners back in its heyday. Now, it sat vacant, yearning for new life.

Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable barrage of questions from her client, Mrs. Eleanor Cavendish. A woman who wouldn't know a fixer-upper from a Fabergé egg, Mrs. Cavendish was determined to find "a charming little bungalow" in Miami Beach – a request that Amy knew clashed spectacularly with Casa del Sol's grandeur. Still, she had a reputation to uphold.

As Amy unlocked the wrought iron gates, her phone buzzed. A text message from her assistant, Miguel: "Mrs. Cavendish just arrived. She's wearing white gloves."  Amy sighed inwardly. This was going to be interesting.
