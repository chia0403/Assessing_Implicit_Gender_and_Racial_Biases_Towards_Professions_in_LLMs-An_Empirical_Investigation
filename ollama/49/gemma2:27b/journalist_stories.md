The air in Havana hung thick with humidity, tinged with the salty tang of the Caribbean Sea and the ever-present scent of cigar smoke. Emilia Rodriguez squinted through the glare bouncing off the cobblestone streets, her notepad clutched tightly in her hand. The crumbling facades of pastel-coloured colonial buildings seemed to lean precariously, whispering stories of a bygone era.  Emilia, a tenacious journalist for the independent online magazine "Cubano Libre," was on the hunt for a story that could shake the foundations of this enigmatic city – and perhaps even the nation itself.

She stood before the imposing doors of the Museo de la Revolución, its entrance guarded by a pair of stern-faced soldiers in olive green uniforms. Emilia's heart pounded with anticipation; inside lay whispers of revolution, whispers she intended to amplify.  Today, she was determined to unravel the truth behind a rumour that had been circulating amongst the island’s underground network: a trove of previously unseen documents detailing Fidel Castro's early years, rumored to be hidden somewhere within the museum's vast archives. 

If true, these documents could rewrite history as Cubans knew it, and Emilia was prepared to risk everything to expose them to the world.
