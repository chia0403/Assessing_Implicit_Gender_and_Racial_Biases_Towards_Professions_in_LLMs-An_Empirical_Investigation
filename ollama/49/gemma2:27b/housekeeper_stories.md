Rain lashed against the windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop an icy fingernail scratching at the ancient glass. Amelia Thistlewick sighed, her breath fogging in the chilled air of the cavernous hall. Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the stained-glass window above the grand staircase, swirling like tiny phantoms in the gloom. The manor, once a beacon of opulence, now wore its grandeur like a tattered cloak – faded, threadbare, and heavy with forgotten memories.

Amelia, her silver hair pulled tight in a bun beneath a starched white cap, adjusted the weight of the laundry basket on her hip. She navigated the echoing silence of the hallway with practiced ease, her sensible shoes clicking softly against the worn marble floor. For twenty years, Amelia had been the sole keeper of Blackwood Manor's secrets – polishing silver tarnished by time, dusting portraits of ancestors long gone, and listening to the whispers of the house itself.
