The pungent scent of ammonia and lavender hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that always seemed to cling to Elara Rose Blackwood's clothes long after she left the salon. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Curl Up & Dye," illuminating motes dancing in its wake.

Outside, the rhythmic clang of a trolley bell and the distant rumble of the city woke up the sleepy street corner.

Elara paused, scissors poised above Mrs. Henderson's silver curls, her mind wandering far from the snip-snip symphony of hairdressing. She was waiting for a call. A call that could change everything.
