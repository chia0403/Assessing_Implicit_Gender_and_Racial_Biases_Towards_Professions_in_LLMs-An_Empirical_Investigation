The late afternoon sun, already dipping below the jagged peaks that surrounded the courtroom, cast long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Judge Amelia Cartwright leaned back in her chair, the plush leather sighing beneath her weight. Her gaze drifted towards the ornate stained-glass window depicting Lady Justice, blindfolded and holding her scales. A wry smile touched Amelia's lips; irony wasn't lost on her. 

Justice, it seemed, was rarely blind in this dusty mountain town of Ridgewood, Colorado. It was colored by prejudice, shaped by whispers, and often swayed by the clink of coins exchanged under the table. Today, though, Amelia was determined to see past the tangled web of half-truths and desperate pleas that threatened to ensnare her judgement. For today's case held a weight unlike any she had encountered before - a murder trial with implications that could shake Ridgewood to its core.
