The whirring of the mechanical pencils filled Elias Finch's ears like a symphony of industry.  He sat hunched over his drafting table, a beam of fluorescent light cutting across the faded blueprints spread before him. The air in the cramped office was thick with the scent of graphite and stale coffee, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of Elias's ruler against the drafting paper. Outside, the city of New Albion hummed with its late afternoon bustle â€“ the clanging trams, the distant cries of street vendors, the muffled roar of traffic. Yet inside this small, windowless room on the third floor of a dilapidated building, time seemed to stand still. Elias was lost in the meticulous world of lines and angles, his mind translating the architect's vision into precise, tangible reality. 

Today's project: a new wing for the city hospital, a labyrinthine structure that promised to be both challenging and rewarding. Elias traced the curve of a hallway with his pencil, his brow furrowed in concentration. He could almost picture patients shuffling through these corridors, nurses rushing past with gurneys, the air thick with hope and anxiety.  

But something was missing. A nagging sense of incompleteness tugged at him. This building, while functional, lacked a certain...soul. Elias sighed, pushing away from his drafting table. He needed fresh air, a break from the sterile lines and angles that had consumed him for hours.
