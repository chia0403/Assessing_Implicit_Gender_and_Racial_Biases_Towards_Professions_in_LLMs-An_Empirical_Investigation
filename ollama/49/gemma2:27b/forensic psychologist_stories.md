Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Evelyn Albright's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the Chicago skyline. The air hung heavy with the scent of old coffee and desperation. Evelyn, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped a pen impatiently against the worn wooden desk, her sharp grey eyes fixed on the file in front of her.  It held the details of the latest case: a brutal triple homicide in a quiet suburban neighborhood, the victims seemingly chosen at random. The police were baffled, and they had called upon Evelyn's expertise to delve into the mind of the killer. 

Evelyn's phone buzzed, startling her. It was Detective Miller, his gruff voice crackling through the receiver. "Dr. Albright, we need you down here ASAP. We have a lead." Her breath caught in her throat. This case was already weighing heavily on her conscience, and she knew that whatever awaited her at the precinct wouldn't be pleasant. Still, she steeled herself, gathering her files and pulling on her raincoat. The storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. This wasn't just another case; it felt personal. Something about the senseless violence tugged at a hidden nerve, a chilling familiarity that she couldn't quite grasp.
