The scent of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center.  Eliza Beaumont, her auburn braid bouncing against the crisp white of her uniform, navigated the bustling hallways with practiced ease. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows lining the physiotherapy wing, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden rays. Today was Eliza's first day working as a senior occupational therapist at St. Jude's, a position she had coveted for years.  

Eliza paused outside Room 214, her heart thumping with a mixture of excitement and apprehension.  Through the frosted glass pane, she could see the silhouette of an elderly woman perched on the edge of a bed, staring intently out the window. This was Mrs. Eleanor Croft, Eliza's first patient â€“ a stroke survivor struggling to regain her independence. Taking a deep breath, Eliza squared her shoulders and pushed open the door.
