The incessant chirping of the phone jolted Eloise Beaumont back to reality. It was 8:02 am, precisely two minutes past her official start time, and already the deluge had begun. Outside, the grey London sky wept a steady drizzle, mirroring the dreary mood settling in Eloise's stomach.  She smoothed down her lilac blouse, took a fortifying sip of lukewarm tea, and braced herself for another day at The Cavendish Practice.

The waiting room was a beige purgatory – bland wallpaper, threadbare armchairs, and a magazine rack groaning with outdated copies of "Hello!" and "Good Housekeeping." Eloise knew every chipped corner, every scuff mark on the linoleum floor. This wasn't just her workplace; it was a second home, one she longed to escape.  

As the phone rang again, Eloise sighed. She knew the voice on the other end wouldn't be pleasant – Mrs. Higgins, demanding an emergency appointment for her perpetually sniffling pug. Eloise picked up the receiver with a forced smile, ready to navigate another day in this beige battlefield of anxieties and ailments.
