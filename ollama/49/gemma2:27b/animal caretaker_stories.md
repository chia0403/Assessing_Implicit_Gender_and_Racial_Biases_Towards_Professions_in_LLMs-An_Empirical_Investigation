Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, drowning out all other sound except for the occasional distressed whinny from a nearby stall. Eleanor Ainsworth hurried across the slick concrete floor, her boots squelching with every step. She clutched a heavy bucket filled with steaming mash, its warmth a welcome contrast to the chill seeping through her threadbare overalls.

The air was thick with the mingled scents of hay, manure, and damp fur. Eleanor paused at the stall door labelled "Sparrow," her heart sinking as she heard the familiar rattling cough emanating from within. Sparrow, a once magnificent chestnut stallion, had been plagued by a persistent lung infection ever since he'd arrived at Meadowbrook Sanctuary three months ago. He was Eleanor's favorite resident, his gentle nature and soulful brown eyes captivating her from the moment she laid eyes on him.

Eleanor pushed open the stall door and stepped inside, her breath catching in her throat as she saw Sparrow lying listlessly on his side, his chest barely rising with each labored breath.
