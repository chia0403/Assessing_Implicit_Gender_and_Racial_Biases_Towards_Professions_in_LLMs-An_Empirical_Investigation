Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The pungent aroma of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic hung in the air, doing little to mask the underlying scent of despair that permeated the cramped space.  Elias ran a weary hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, his reflection in the dusty mirror above the sink showing a man worn thin by years of struggle.

The clinic, nestled in the heart of the forgotten industrial district of Veridia City, was Elias's last stand against the encroaching tide of corporate medicine.  He'd built it from scratch, brick by brick, fueled by a stubborn belief that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. But lately, even his unwavering resolve was beginning to crumble under the weight of mounting debts and dwindling patients.

Tonight, however, a new patient had arrived - one who promised to change everything.  A young woman, her face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat, stood hesitantly in the doorway. Her eyes, when they met Elias's, were filled with an unsettling mix of desperation and defiance.  She clutched a worn leather satchel close to her chest, as if guarding its contents with her life.

"Dr. Thorne?" she rasped, her voice barely audible above the storm raging outside. "I need your help."
