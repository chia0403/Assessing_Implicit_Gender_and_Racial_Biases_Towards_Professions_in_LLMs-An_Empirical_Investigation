The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Elias Finchworth knelt beside a bed of petunias, meticulously pinching off withered blooms. His weathered hands moved with practiced ease, each snip precise and deliberate. The sprawling gardens of Thornhill Manor were his domain, a vibrant tapestry woven from centuries-old rose bushes, cascading wisteria, and delicate ferns that whispered secrets in the breeze.

Elias loved this place. He knew every twist and turn of its hidden paths, the exact time the sun dappled through the ancient oak by the fountain, and the song each bird sang as it flitted among the branches. But today, a sense of unease prickled beneath his skin. The air felt charged, like before a thunderstorm, and an unsettling quiet had fallen over the usually bustling manor.  Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.

He straightened, stretching his aching back, and cast a wary glance towards the grand, ivy-covered house. The windows stared back blankly, their glass reflecting the gathering storm clouds. Something wasn't right.
