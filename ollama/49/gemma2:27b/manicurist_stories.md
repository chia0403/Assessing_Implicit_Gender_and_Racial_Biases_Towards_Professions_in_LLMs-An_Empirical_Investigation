The pungent scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sickly sweet aroma of strawberry hand cream. Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes leaned back against her worn leather chair, its red upholstery faded from years under the harsh fluorescent lights of "Nails by Esme." Outside, the neon sign buzzed intermittently, casting a lurid glow on the cracked asphalt parking lot. A late afternoon sun, filtered through the greasy film coating the window, painted streaks of orange and purple across the worn linoleum floor.

Esme sighed, tracing a chipped nail with her thumb. Business had been slow. Lately, it seemed everyone in El Paso preferred acrylics or gel manicures – trends Esme, with her decades-old techniques and preference for classic polish, couldn't quite keep up with. Still, she held onto the hope that someone would walk through those dusty glass doors craving a simple, perfectly polished manicure.

A flicker of movement outside caught Esme’s eye. A woman, shrouded in shadow, hesitantly approached the door.  Maybe, just maybe, this was her lucky break.
