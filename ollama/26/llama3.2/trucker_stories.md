Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the desolate stretch of Highway 66, casting a dark orange glow over the endless expanse of asphalt. Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled and seasoned truck driver with over twenty years of experience behind the wheel, pulled into the crumbling gas station like a man in a hurry. The neon sign above the pumps creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Eddie's Fill-Up" in flickering letters.
