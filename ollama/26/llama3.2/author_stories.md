Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Paris were always at their most melancholy on autumn mornings like this one. The Seine River, which had once been a symbol of the city's romance and beauty, now seemed to flow sluggishly through the grey concrete canyons, its waters reflecting the somber mood that hung over the city like a damp shroud.

In her small apartment above the Shakespeare and Company bookstore on the Rue de la Bûcherie, Adèle LaFleur stirred the embers of last night's cigarette, watching as the dying flames cast flickering shadows on the walls. Her eyes, a deep shade of indigo that seemed almost purple in the dim light, scanned the cluttered room, taking in the scattered pages and dog-eared novels that covered every available surface.

Adèle LaFleur, writer and professor at the Sorbonne, was known for her poetic prose and her ability to capture the essence of modern Parisian life in her stories. But today, as she stood amidst the detritus of a late night spent pouring over her latest manuscript, Adèle couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of disquiet had been growing inside her for weeks, and now it seemed to be spreading its dark tendrils through every part of her life.

With a sigh, she turned away from the fire and began to pace back and forth across the room, trying to clear her mind and focus on the task at hand. But as she walked, her eyes kept drifting out the window, where the rain continued to fall in relentless sheets, casting a melancholy spell over the city that seemed to match the one that had settled inside Adèle's own heart.
