Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain pattered against the windows of St. Michael's Hospital, casting a gloomy mist over the bustling emergency room where Nurse Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson worked tirelessly to keep up with the never-ending stream of patients. It was 3:47 AM on a Tuesday morning, and Lexi had already seen her fair share of heartbreaks, headaches, and hernias.

As she swiftly changed into a fresh pair of scrubs, the hospital's intercom system crackled to life, announcing a code blue in Room 304. Lexi's eyes locked onto the floor display above her station, where the patient's name flashed on the screen: "Emily Wilson - 45 years old, female." Lexi's heart skipped a beat as she quickly grabbed her phone and pulled up Emily's chart.

She had worked with Emily before, during her residency at St. Michael's two years ago. The young mother had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that had taken her husband just a few months prior to their daughter's birth. Lexi had watched from the sidelines as Emily struggled to cope with the loss, and she had made it a point to check in on her whenever possible.

As Lexi rushed toward Room 304, the hospital's corridors seemed to grow darker and more ominous. The fluorescent lights overhead cast eerie shadows on the walls, making her skin prickle with anticipation. What would she find in that room? Would Emily be okay?

With a deep breath, Lexi pushed open the door and stepped into the unknown.
