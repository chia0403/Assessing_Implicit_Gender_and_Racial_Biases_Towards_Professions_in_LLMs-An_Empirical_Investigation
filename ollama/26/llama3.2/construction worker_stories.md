Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the dusty, rundown industrial park where Ryder Jameson made his living. A 35-year-old former Army veteran, Ryder worked as a roughneck on the construction site of a new office complex in the neglected part of town. He was one of the few workers who showed up early, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as he surveyed the chaotic landscape of half-built walls and exposed ductwork.

The air reeked of tar, concrete, and stale cigarettes, a familiar smell that clung to Ryder like an old friend. His calloused hands grasped the worn wooden handle of his hard hat, which had been his constant companion since day one on this job site. The building's skeletal frame seemed to loom over him, a behemoth of steel and glass that threatened to swallow up the small, rundown storefronts of the town's struggling businesses.

As Ryder began to make his way across the site, he spotted a piece of paper tacked to the fence near the entrance. It was a crumpled up flyer, half-forgotten but still bearing the faint scent of fresh ink. The words "Free breakfast for all workers" were scrawled in messy handwriting, accompanied by a crude sketch of a plate piled high with bacon and eggs. Ryder raised an eyebrow - what was going on here?
