Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Chicago glistened like polished onyx as Reginald "Reg" Everett III, a seasoned salesperson, stepped out of his sleek black sedan and onto the wet pavement. His tailored navy blue suit and crisp white shirt seemed to glow in the dim light of the streetlamps, a stark contrast to the drizzly grey atmosphere that had settled over the city.

Reg was a man who always presented himself as polished and put-together, but beneath his confident exterior lay a complex web of insecurities and ambitions. As one of the top salespeople at McAllister & Co., a high-end luxury goods firm, Reg had built a reputation for being ruthless in his pursuit of deals and unforgiving to his competitors.

But as he gazed out at the crowded sidewalks, Reg's thoughts were no longer on closing the next big sale or climbing the corporate ladder. His mind was consumed by the nagging sense that something was off – a feeling that had been growing inside him for weeks, like a gentle hum in the background of his consciousness.

It started with small things: a missed phone call from an old client, a cryptic message on his office voicemail, a faint memory of a whispered conversation that seemed to have never happened. Reg tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the unease lingered, gnawing at the edges of his confidence.

As he lit a cigarette and inhaled the acrid smoke, Reg couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change – something big. And when it did, nothing would ever be the same again.
