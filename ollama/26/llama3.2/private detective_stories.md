Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, shrouding the streets of Ravenswood in a gloomy mist. It was a typical winter evening in this small, gritty town, where the only sound was the steady beat of raindrops on the pavement.

As he stared out the window, lost in thought, the phone on his desk jolted him back to reality. The shrill ring cut through the din of the rain, and Gus's eyes snapped to the receiver with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. Who was calling at this ungodly hour? And what did they want?
