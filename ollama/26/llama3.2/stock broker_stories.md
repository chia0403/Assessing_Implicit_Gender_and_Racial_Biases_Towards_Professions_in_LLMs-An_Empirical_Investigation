Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the glittering Manhattan skyline, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling streets of Wall Street. The sounds of honking cars and chattering pedestrians filled the air as Alexander "Alex" Thompson, a seasoned stock broker, stepped out of his high-rise office building and onto the sidewalk. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening breeze fill his lungs, and gazed out at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever.

As he walked towards his waiting taxi, Alex's mind was still focused on the deal he had been working on all day - a high-stakes merger between two of the biggest tech firms in the country. He had been up for hours, poring over financial reports and crunching numbers, trying to find any weakness in the other side's offer. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.

As he slid into the taxi and gave the driver an address on the Upper East Side, Alex's thoughts turned to the mysterious message he had received earlier that day. It was a cryptic email from an unknown sender, with only two words: "Watch yourself." The warning had sent a shiver down his spine, but Alex had no idea who could have sent it or what they wanted him to watch out for.

Little did he know, the message was just the beginning of a very long and very complicated night.
