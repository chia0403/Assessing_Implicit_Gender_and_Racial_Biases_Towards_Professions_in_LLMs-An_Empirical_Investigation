Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the sprawling estate of Ravenswood Manor, casting a warm orange glow over the manicured lawns and meticulously trimmed hedges. In the midst of this idyllic scene, Emilia "Mia" Thompson, groundskeeper for the past five years, moved with a quiet efficiency, her worn gardening boots making barely a sound on the dew-kissed grass.

As she worked, Mia's thoughts wandered to the upcoming estate sale, which would bring in much-needed funds for the upkeep of Ravenswood. She had been tasked with ensuring that every inch of the property was perfect for the visiting guests and potential buyers, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the usual worries about weeds and weather damage - it was a sense of unease that seemed to seep into her bones whenever she walked these halls.

Mia's gaze drifted up to the imposing facade of Ravenswood Manor, its stone walls bearing witness to centuries of history and secrets. She had always been drawn to this place, with its labyrinthine corridors and hidden gardens, but it was a sense of duty that kept her rooted here, rather than any lingering romance or attachment.

As she finished up her last task for the day, Mia couldn't help but wonder what the night might bring - whether it would be a quiet evening, or one filled with whispers and shadows. Little did she know, the estate had secrets to share, and they were just beginning to emerge from the darkness.
