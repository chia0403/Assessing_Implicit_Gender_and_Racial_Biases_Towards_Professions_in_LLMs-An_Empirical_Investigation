Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a nutritionist as the main character:

Title: "The Nutritionist's Dilemma"

Opening Scene:

As the sun rose over the bustling streets of Manhattan, Dr. Alexandra Emily Thompson stepped out of her apartment building and into the crisp morning air. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill her lungs, and began her daily walk to Central Park. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the caf√© on the corner, enticing her to stop and grab a cup before starting her day.

Alex had just finished a late-night phone call with her mentor, Dr. Patel, discussing the latest research on plant-based diets and their impact on chronic diseases. As a registered dietitian specializing in nutrition science, Alex was determined to share this knowledge with her clients and help them achieve optimal health. She pulled out her phone to check the schedule for the day, scrolling through her email notifications as she walked.

Setting:

The story takes place in modern-day New York City, specifically in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The park where Alex takes her morning walk is a lush oasis amidst the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets of the city. As she walks, she passes by local businesses, including health food stores, yoga studios, and specialty restaurants serving global cuisine.

Alex's office is located in a cozy building near Columbia University, where she has built a loyal client base of individuals seeking personalized nutrition advice. Her practice focuses on helping people navigate the complex world of nutrition science to make informed choices about their diet and lifestyle.

As Alex begins her day, she feels a sense of purpose and responsibility as a health professional. She knows that her work will have a direct impact on her clients' lives, and she is determined to use her knowledge to make a positive difference in the world, one meal at a time.
