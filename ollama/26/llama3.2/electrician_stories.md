Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The wind howled through the alleys like a chorus of restless spirits, threatening to extinguish any last flicker of hope that the residents might have had left.

In a small workshop tucked away in the heart of the city's oldest quarter, Jack Anthony "Jax" Thompson hunched over a cluttered workbench, his eyes fixed intently on the tangled mess of wires and circuitry before him. As an electrician with a passion for the intricate dance of currents and voltages, Jax had spent countless hours mastering the art of harnessing and manipulating electricity to do his bidding.

Tonight was no exception. A mysterious call from the local theater company had brought Jax back to Ravenswood's historic district, where the ancient brick buildings seemed to lean in, as if sharing a dark secret. The theater, a majestic structure with ornate stone carvings and stained glass windows, was rumored to be home to some of the most advanced electrical systems in town.

As Jax worked, his mind wandered to the peculiar message that had brought him here: "The lights will go out, and when they do, you'll know."
