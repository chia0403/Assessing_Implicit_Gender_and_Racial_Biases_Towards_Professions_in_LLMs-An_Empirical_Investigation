Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, 25-year-old Emiko Nakahara closed up her nail salon, "Hana no Ki" (Flower Child), with a satisfied smile. The smell of lavender and lemon essential oils still lingered in the air, carried on the gentle breeze that rustled through the cherry blossom trees outside. It had been a long day of pedicures and manicures, but Emiko felt fulfilled as she wiped down the countertops for the last time.

Just as she was about to lock up, a text message from her best friend, Yui, popped up on her phone. "Meet me at the rooftop bar on the 10th floor of the Shinjuku Centrair building in an hour," it read. Emiko's curiosity was piqued - what could Yui want to talk about after hours? And why did she need to meet at such a late hour? With a thrill of excitement, Emiko finished up her cleaning and headed out into the Tokyo night.

Outside, the neon lights of the city seemed to pulse with an energy all their own. The streets were crowded with people rushing to and fro, but Emiko felt like she was in a world of her own. As she made her way through the throngs of pedestrians, the towering skyscrapers loomed above her, casting long shadows across the sidewalk.

Little did Emiko know, this ordinary night on the town would be about to take an extraordinary turn...
