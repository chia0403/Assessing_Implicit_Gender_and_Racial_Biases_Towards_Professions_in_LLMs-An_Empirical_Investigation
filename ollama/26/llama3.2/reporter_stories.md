Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy mist over the streets of New Haven, Connecticut. It was a typical autumn evening in this small coastal town, where the air was crisp and the smell of saltwater filled the lungs. But amidst the tranquility, a sense of unease hung over the residents of 23rd Street, where investigative reporter Evelyn Mae Thistlewaite sat hunched over her desk, pouring over stacks of dusty files and yellowed newspaper clippings.

Evelyn's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar sights of her cramped newsroom at the New Haven Daily: the flickering fluorescent lights, the worn leather armchair that had seen countless late-night interviews, and the stack of dog-eared copies of The New York Times that lined one wall. It was a space that felt both intimate and isolating, a reflection of Evelyn's own nomadic past and her dedication to uncovering the truth.

As she delved deeper into her research, Evelyn's mind wandered back to the cryptic message she'd received earlier that day - a single phone call from an anonymous source with a claim that would shake the very foundations of New Haven's history. It was a tantalizing lead, one that had Evelyn's instincts on high alert and her journalist's senses tingling.

Little did she know, this night would change everything.
