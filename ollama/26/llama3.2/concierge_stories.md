Here's a potential story opening:

---

The soft chime of the hotel's doorbell signaled another arrival on this drizzly Tuesday evening in April. Amidst the hum of the lobby, where the smell of freshly brewed coffee and yesterday's newspapers wafted through the air, Eugenie "Genevieve" LaFleur expertly juggled a dozen tasks at once. As the esteemed concierge of Le Coeur de la Vie, one of Paris' most charming boutique hotels, Genevieve had spent years honing her craft to provide an unparalleled level of service to the city's discerning travelers.

With a practiced glance around the lobby, where a lone businessman checked his phone and a young couple giggled as they waited for their room keys, Genevieve's eyes landed on the newest guest, a stylishly dressed woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair. She was checking in for one night, and Genevieve sensed an air of mystery surrounding her arrival.

"Bonjour, mademoiselle," Genevieve said with a warm smile, extending a manicured hand as she took the woman's passport. "Welcome to Le Coeur de la Vie. I'm your concierge, Genevieve LaFleur."

The woman's gaze locked onto Genevieve's, and for an instant, it seemed as though time had slowed down. Then, with a soft nod, the woman replied, "Bonjour, Mademoiselle LaFleur. Thank you for having me."
