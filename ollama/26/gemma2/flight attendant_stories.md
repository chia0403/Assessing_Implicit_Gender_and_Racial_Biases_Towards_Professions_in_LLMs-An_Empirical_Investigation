She was on United Flight 742, cruising at 35,000 feet above the Atlantic, headed for JFK. Another transatlantic trek, another sea of tired faces and spilled coffee stains. The usual Thursday night routine. But tonight felt different. A prickling sensation danced along her spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place. She glanced out the tiny porthole window at the endless expanse of darkness, speckled with a million twinkling stars that seemed to stare back at her with ancient wisdom.

Something was amiss. Something beyond the usual turbulence and delayed luggage. 


Amy swallowed, adjusting the name tag pinned on her crisp blue uniform. It read: "Amelia Celeste, Flight Attendant."  A simple title for an extraordinary journey that had just begun.
