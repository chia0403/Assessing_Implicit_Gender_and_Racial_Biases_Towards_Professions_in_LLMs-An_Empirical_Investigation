The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Sterling's head like a chorus of overworked bees, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room.  Amelia, her name tag proclaiming her as "Phlebotomy Technician," wiped down the armrest of the worn brown chair she'd been assigned to patrol for errant elbows and sticky candy wrappers. 

The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of someone's over-perfumed hand cream. Amelia stifled a sigh. It was always like this at Mercy General. A symphony of coughs, sniffles, and hushed whispers punctuated by the occasional sharp intake of breath from a patient bracing for the needle. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing another weary soul entering their purgatory. Amelia straightened, her usual practiced smile ready to launch. She was good at this, she told herself. Good at drawing blood, calming anxieties, and pretending she didn't notice the fear flickering in those wide, pale eyes every time the needle came out.  It was just another Tuesday at Mercy General.
