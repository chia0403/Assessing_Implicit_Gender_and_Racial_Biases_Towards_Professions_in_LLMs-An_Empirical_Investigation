The air in Mrs. Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne's classroom hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage desperation. It was the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break, which meant everyone was either counting down the minutes until freedom or bracing themselves for the onslaught of relatives who would inevitably ask, "So, what are your plans after graduation?"

Evelyn tapped her pen against the cluttered desk, her gaze sweeping over the sea of faces staring back at her with varying degrees of disinterest. They were all seniors in AP Literature, a class she'd poured her heart and soul into for the past four years. Yet, today, they looked like zombies who’d just been told their beloved cafeteria was serving broccoli casserole for lunch – which, ironically, might be preferable to whatever existential dread filled their young minds. 

She cleared her throat, hoping to pierce through the haze of apathy. "Alright, class," she began, her voice carrying a weariness that hadn't quite settled in yet, "let's finish up this chapter on…"  But before she could utter another word, a loud crash echoed from the hallway outside, followed by a chorus of startled gasps. The classroom, already teetering on the edge of chaos, descended into full-blown pandemonium.
