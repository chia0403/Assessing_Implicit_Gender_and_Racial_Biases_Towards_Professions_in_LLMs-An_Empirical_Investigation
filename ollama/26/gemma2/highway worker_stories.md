The sun hadn't even thought about rising yet when Silas Montgomery pulled his beat-up Ford truck onto the shoulder of Highway 42.  Headlamps sliced through the pre-dawn darkness, illuminating a world of asphalt and dew-kissed gravel. The air was crisp with the promise of another scorching summer day in the Mojave Desert.  Silas rubbed his gritty eyes, squinting against the glare reflecting off the dusty windshield. Another shift on the highway. Another chance to dodge trucks, mend potholes, and wrestle with tangled weeds growing up through the cracks in the pavement. 

It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest. And Silas found a kind of solace in the repetitive rhythm of it all: the clang of his hammer against metal, the roar of passing engines, the endless expanse of asphalt stretching before him like a ribbon unfurling into the horizon.  He took a deep breath of the desert air, its scent tinged with sagebrush and gasoline. It was home.  Even if it wasn't exactly paradise.
