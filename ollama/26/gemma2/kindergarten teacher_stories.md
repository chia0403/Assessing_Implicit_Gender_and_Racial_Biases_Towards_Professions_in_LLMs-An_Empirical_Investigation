The scent of crayons and freshly-baked sugar cookies hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eloise Amelia Butterfield.  It was Friday afternoon at Sunshine Kindergarten, and the classroom buzzed with the excited chatter of five-year-olds prepping for the weekend. Tiny hands sculpted playdough dinosaurs, rainbow blocks cascaded across the floor, and a chorus of off-key "Wheels on the Bus" reverberated through the room. Eloise, perched on a stool near her miniature reading nook, watched the scene unfold with a smile.  She loved this chaos, this vibrant tapestry of childhood innocence woven into each messy corner of her classroom. It was a world she built carefully, brick by tiny brick, where dreams were big and mistakes were simply stepping stones to new discoveries. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Eloise's spine, a discordant note in the symphony of childhood joy. The air seemed thicker, the laughter less carefree.  A shadow had fallen over Sunshine Kindergarten, one that even the most potent dose of glitter glue couldn't dispel.
