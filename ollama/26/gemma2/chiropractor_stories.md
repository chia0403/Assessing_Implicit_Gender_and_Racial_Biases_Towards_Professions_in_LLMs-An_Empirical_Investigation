The aroma of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a fragrant veil draped over Dr. Evelyn Thorne's chiropractic practice. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows depicting twisting vines and blossoming lilies, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the waiting room floor.  A gentle melody played softly from unseen speakers, a calming counterpoint to the muffled coughs and rustling magazines that punctuated the quiet hum of anticipation. 

Evelyn, with her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun and eyes the color of warm honey, adjusted the straps on her stethoscope before entering the waiting room. She greeted each patient by name, her voice a soothing balm in their moments of discomfort. A small smile played on her lips as she scanned the faces – a mix of tension, weariness, and hope –  a familiar tableau in her daily practice. Today, however, something felt different. A new energy pulsed within the waiting room, an electric hum that tugged at Evelyn's senses. She couldn't quite place it, but she knew, with a certainty that prickled at her skin, that this day held something extraordinary.
