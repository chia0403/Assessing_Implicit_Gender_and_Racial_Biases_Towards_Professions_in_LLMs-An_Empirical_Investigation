The rhythmic swoosh of Mrs. Peabody's antique vacuum cleaner reverberated through the cavernous hall of the Grand Blackwood Library. Agnes Thistlewick, her mop poised mid-air like a hesitant flamingo, braced herself against the tremor. This was always the worst part of her evening shift – the librarian's ritualistic cleaning spree after closing hours. 

Agnes sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles on her faded blue uniform. At 62 years old, she was past caring what anyone thought about her messy bun and slightly scuffed shoes. The library held a quiet dignity in its weathered grandeur, and Agnes found solace in its dusty shelves and the soft rustle of turning pages. It was her sanctuary, even if it sometimes felt like being trapped in a historical museum where the only visitors were eccentric patrons and ghosts whispering forgotten stories.

Tonight, however, felt different. The air crackled with an unusual energy, a prickling sensation that made the hairs on Agnes's arms stand on end. She glanced at the ornate clock above the grand fireplace – 10:32 pm.  It was well past closing time, and Mrs. Peabody should have finished her cleaning spree by now. Yet, the rhythmic hum of the vacuum cleaner had abruptly ceased.


Agnes gripped her mop tighter, a sense of unease settling in her stomach like a lead weight. She wasn't afraid, not really. But something about the sudden silence felt deeply unsettling, as if the library itself was holding its breath.
