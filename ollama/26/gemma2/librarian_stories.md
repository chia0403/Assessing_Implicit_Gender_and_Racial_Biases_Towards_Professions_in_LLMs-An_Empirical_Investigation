The air in the Elmwood Public Library hung thick with the scent of aging paper and hushed whispers. Sunlight, filtered through the arched windows above, cast long, dusty stripes across the worn wooden floor. Amelia Thistlewick, head librarian for the past fifteen years, meticulously straightened a stack of overdue notices on her desk. Each slip bore the weight of a broken promise, a forgotten deadline, a silent plea for forgiveness from the library's patrons.  

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her silver braids. It was always quieter in Elmwood after school let out, a lull before the storm of summer reading programs and frantic homework searches. But this quiet felt different today, heavier somehow. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine, an unsettling premonition that something was amiss.  The library, usually her sanctuary, suddenly felt claustrophobic, every creak of the floorboards echoing with unspoken anxieties.
