The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm raging within her. Across from her sat Daniel Hayes, his face pale and etched with exhaustion. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the room, amplifying the tension that crackled between them like static electricity. 

Eleanor, a woman of meticulous routine and unwavering composure, found herself unnerved by Hayes' case. He wasn't your typical patient; he was a successful architect accused of murdering his wife, a crime he vehemently denied. But his pleas felt hollow, his eyes betraying a depth of darkness she hadn't encountered before.

The setting - her small, cluttered office on the outskirts of Boston - usually offered a sense of security, a haven from the chaos of the criminal mind. But tonight, with Hayesâ€™ chilling account of the night his wife died still echoing in her ears, even Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine. The rain hammered against the windowpanes, each drop like a tiny hammer blow on her resolve, as she prepared to delve into the darkest recesses of Daniel Hayes' psyche.
