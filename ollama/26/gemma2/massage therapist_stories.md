The bell above the door chimed softly as Amelia Brighton, weary from a morning filled with knots and tension lines, wiped down her reception desk. The scent of lavender oil lingered in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the gray, drizzle-slicked day outside. 

Her small studio, nestled on the second floor of a quaint brick building in downtown Asheville, was a haven from the bustling world below. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating the plush massage tables draped in soft linen and the shelves stacked with her eclectic collection of essential oils and herbal remedies. 


But today, Amelia's sanctuary felt oddly hushed. Her usual morning rush of appointments had been cancelled, leaving an unsettling silence in its wake. She sighed, idly tracing patterns on the wooden surface of her desk. A quiet day was fine, she supposed, a chance to catch up on paperwork and restock supplies. But a part of her yearned for the familiar warmth of human touch, the unspoken communication that flowed between her hands and those seeking solace in her care.
