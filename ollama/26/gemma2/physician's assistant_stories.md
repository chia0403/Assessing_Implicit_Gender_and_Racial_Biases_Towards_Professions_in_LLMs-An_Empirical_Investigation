The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Hayes, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor. It was the kind of light that seemed to drain colour from everything, leaving behind a world of muted greys and washed-out blues. The waiting room at Mercy General was always this way - hushed, expectant, a place where anxieties simmered just beneath the surface. Amelia, a physician's assistant with a perpetually furrowed brow and tired eyes, pushed her cart down the hallway, its wheels squeaking in protest against the worn linoleum. 

She paused outside Room 3B, taking a deep breath before opening the door. Inside, a young woman sat clutching a crumpled tissue to her nose, her face pale and drawn. Amelia knew this scene well - the fear, the vulnerability, the desperate hope that someone, anyone, could offer solace in this place of pain and uncertainty.

"Hello," Amelia said softly, her voice carrying the weight of countless similar encounters. "My name is Amelia Hayes. I'm here to help."
