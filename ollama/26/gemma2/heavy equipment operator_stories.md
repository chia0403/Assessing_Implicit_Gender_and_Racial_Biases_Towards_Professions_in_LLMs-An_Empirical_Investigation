The sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Callahan's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat trickled down her spine, stinging her eyes as she adjusted the mirrored visor of her hard hat. The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of dust and diesel fuel, a familiar aroma that clung to everything in this desolate stretch of Nevada desert. 

Amy gripped the controls of the Caterpillar D9R bulldozer, its massive steel treads churning through the parched earth, pushing aside scrub brush and tumbleweeds like they were mere paper scraps.  Before her stretched the yawning maw of a new quarry, a scar on the landscape carved by the relentless pursuit of progress. This was where Amy found her solace - in the symphony of roaring engines, the rumble of metal on stone, and the quiet satisfaction of shaping the world with her own two hands. 


Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease sat at the back of her neck, a sense that she was being watched. The desert stretched around them, vast and empty, but Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something lurked just beyond her vision, waiting for its moment to strike.
