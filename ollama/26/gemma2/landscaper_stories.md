The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Quince's weathered face as he surveyed the overgrown chaos of Mrs. Periwinkle's backyard.  

His hands, calloused and strong from years of coaxing life from the earth, tightened on the handle of his trusty trowel. This wasn't just another job for Bartholomew; this was a rescue mission. The once vibrant garden had been swallowed by weeds, its carefully placed hedges now gnarled and tangled monstrosities. Roses choked on vines, their delicate blooms hidden beneath a thick blanket of green. 

Mrs. Periwinkle, her spine perpetually stooped like an ancient willow, stood beside him, tears welling in her cloudy blue eyes. "It's all gone so wild, Bartholomew," she whispered, her voice brittle with despair.  "I just... I don't know what to do."


The setting was a quaint, historic neighborhood on the outskirts of Charleston, South Carolina. Wisteria-laden porches draped over cobblestone streets, and the air hummed with the buzz of cicadas and the sweet scent of honeysuckle.
