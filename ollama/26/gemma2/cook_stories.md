Amy, with her flour-dusted apron and fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid, was the newest chapter in that story.

The air grew cooler, bringing with it the sound of foghorn cries echoing across the water. Amy wiped her hands on her apron, catching a glimpse of herself reflected in the stainless steel of her griddle: tired eyes framed by freckles, a determined set to her jaw, and a smudge of batter clinging stubbornly to her cheek. She knew the night was just beginning.
