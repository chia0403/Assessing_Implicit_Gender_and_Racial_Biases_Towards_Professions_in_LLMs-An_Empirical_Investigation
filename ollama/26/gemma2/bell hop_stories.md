The stale scent of cigarette smoke mingled with the faint aroma of jasmine from Mrs. Perkins’ eternally-blooming orchids, clinging to the worn velvet lining of the elevator as Bartholomew "Barty" Bellweather descended to the lobby. It was nearly midnight and the Grandview Hotel, usually abuzz with the clatter of heels and laughter, stood eerily quiet. A single lamp cast a sickly yellow glow across the marble floor, reflecting in Barty’s scuffed shoes.  

He adjusted his starched white cap, its crispness a lonely beacon in the dimness. The silence was broken only by the distant hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen and the muffled thrumming of an unseen bass line from a room upstairs. 

Barty sighed, running a hand through his unruly auburn hair.  It wasn’t just the emptiness that weighed on him; it was the story etched into every crack of the hotel's once-grand facade. He could almost feel the echoes of forgotten laughter and whispered secrets in the air, remnants of a time when the Grandview was truly grand. Now, it felt like a mausoleum, preserving not just memories, but also the weight of its decline.
