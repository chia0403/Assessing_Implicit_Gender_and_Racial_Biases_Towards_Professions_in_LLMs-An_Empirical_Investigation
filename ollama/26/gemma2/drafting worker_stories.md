The air in the Drafting Room hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and graphite dust. A faint hum vibrated through the room, a rhythmic counterpoint to the click-clack of keyboards and the scratching of pencils against blueprints. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stagnant air. 

Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright, her brow furrowed in concentration, painstakingly shaded in the intricate curves of a bridge design. The paper before her was littered with red lines and cross-outs, testament to the countless revisions that had gone into this project.  She chewed on the end of her pencil, her mind wrestling with the structural integrity of the span. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, unnoticed amidst the chaos of the drafting board. 

Evelyn was a draftswoman in a male-dominated world, and she knew every line on those blueprints like the back of her hand. But today, a sense of unease gnawed at her. The foreman had been unusually tight-lipped all morning, his face grim beneath his greasy cap. A new project was coming, one rumored to be bigger and more complex than anything they'd tackled before.  And Evelyn had a feeling it would change everything.
