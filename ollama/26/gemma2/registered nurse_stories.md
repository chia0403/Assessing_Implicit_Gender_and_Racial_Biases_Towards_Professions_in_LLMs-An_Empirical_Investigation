The antiseptic scent hung heavy in the air, a familiar shroud over the bustling emergency room.  Elena Reyes, her badge proclaiming her RN status, hurried down the hallway, her white shoes whispering against the linoleum floor. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worried faces gathered around gurneys and examination tables. 

Elena paused at triage, taking in the scene: a young boy with a bandaged arm, a woman clutching her chest, another man sprawled unconscious on a stretcher. She glanced at the board displaying patient vitals, her brow furrowing as she saw the ominous red flashing beside "Mr. Johnson."  It was going to be a long night. 


The setting: A bustling, high-volume emergency room in a large city hospital during a particularly hectic shift. The atmosphere is tense and chaotic, with nurses and doctors working tirelessly to save lives under pressure.
