Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elara Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own heart. The wind howled outside, rattling the panes and casting fleeting shadows across the room, each one momentarily twisting familiar objects into grotesque shapes. Elara sat hunched over her desk, a mug of lukewarm tea growing cold beside a half-written note. Her patients were piling up, their anxieties mirrored in the relentless downpour. 

She was supposed to be on vacation this week, sipping cocktails under a sun-drenched sky somewhere far from Seattle's grey drizzle. But then came the call. Her sister, Lily, had been admitted to the hospital, diagnosed with something that Elara couldn't quite bring herself to Google - something that sounded like a death sentence whispered in hushed tones.

Now, instead of sand and sunshine, she was drowning in a sea of cancelled appointments, worried calls from colleagues, and the gnawing dread that Lily wouldn't be there when she finally got to her bedside. The rain hammered on, a relentless reminder of the fragility of life, the precariousness of happiness. Elara knew it wasn't just the weather making her feel so overwhelmed; this was something deeper, a fear of losing what little light still flickered within her own soul.
