The flickering neon sign of "Lucky's Diner" cast an oily sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt.  A steady drizzle fell, blurring the city lights into hazy halos. The wind whipped around Fiona Amelia Blackwood, her paramedic jacket clinging tightly to her as she navigated the crowded sidewalk. Fiona, known to most as Amy, had grown accustomed to this symphony of urban chaos – the screech of tires, the distant wail of sirens, and the murmur of countless conversations swirling in the humid air. 

Tonight, though, there was an edge to it all, a tension that prickled the hairs on her neck. A sense of unease clung to the city like a damp fog. Maybe it was the news reports about a string of robberies targeting small businesses, or perhaps it was just the way the shadows seemed to stretch longer tonight, reaching out like grasping fingers. Whatever it was, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.


She ducked into Lucky’s, its warm interior a welcome relief from the cold night air. The familiar smell of frying bacon and coffee hung heavy in the air, mixed with the chatter of late-night patrons and the clatter of dishes.
