The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of gleaming steel instruments. A faint scent of peppermint and disinfectant hung in the air, punctuated by the occasional sharp, metallic tang that spoke of freshly scraped enamel. 

It was 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, which meant Amy had just finished her usual morning ritual:  a scalpel-sharp critique of the coffee from the break room pot, followed by a quick scan of the patient schedule for any particularly challenging mouths (usually those belonging to the town's mayor or that cranky old Mr. Henderson who always claimed his teeth were "too sensitive"). 

Today, though, something felt different.  A peculiar stillness hung in the air, even with the usual symphony of drill whispers and suction hiss filling the background. Amy chalked it up to a Monday hangover lingering into Tuesday. Until she saw the new patient's file: a young woman named Elara Vance, listed simply as "urgent." 


Amy straightened her white coat, adjusting the name tag pinned proudly on its breast pocket. Urgent cases were rare, usually reserved for abscesses and chipped incisors in need of immediate attention. Whatever was ailing Ms. Vance, it felt like it could change the rhythm of this otherwise predictable day.
