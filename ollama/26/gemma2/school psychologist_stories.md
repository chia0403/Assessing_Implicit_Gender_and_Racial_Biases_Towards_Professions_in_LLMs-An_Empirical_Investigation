The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s office.  A faint scent of lavender air freshener clung to the room, doing little to mask the underlying smell of stale coffee and nervous sweat.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, sighed as she leaned back in her creaky chair. Another day, another parade of troubled students funneled through her door. 

Today’s first appointment was Ethan Hayes, a lanky eleven-year-old with a history of anxiety so severe it manifested as physical tics – his eyes would dart around uncontrollably, his fingers constantly tapping and drumming against anything within reach.  Ethan had been referred by his teachers for “disruptive behavior” – which, Eleanor knew from years of experience, was usually just a symptom of something deeper, something he couldn't articulate, let alone control. 

The waiting room held its usual assortment of anxiety: a fidgeting mother clutching a teething toy, a teenage boy with headphones blasting heavy metal to drown out the world, and a young girl whose eyes darted between her tattered coloring book and the cracked glass door leading into Eleanor’s office. Each one carried their own story, their own silent plea for understanding. 

Eleanor rose from her chair, smoothing down her starched blouse, and took a deep breath.  It was time to start peeling back the layers, piece by fragile piece. She hoped today, she could help them all find a little bit of peace.
