The stale air of the Department of Corrections meeting room hung thick with anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust that danced in the oppressive silence. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, Probation Officer Level Three, tapped her pen against the worn oak table, watching the clock tick past 9:02 AM. She was ten minutes late, thanks to a particularly spirited traffic jam on Elm Street caused by a rogue flock of pigeons attempting a mass migration right into the path of rush hour. 

The meeting today wasn't unusual – a standard review for Michael 'Mikey' O'Malley, recently paroled after a stint in state prison for grand theft auto. The mundane nature of it was what gnawed at Eleanor.  This case felt different, heavier somehow. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, telling her this wouldn't be your typical probation meeting. She swallowed hard, adjusting the pearl necklace that had belonged to her grandmother – a reminder of duty and responsibility she carried with every case. 


**Setting:**

* **Time:** Early morning, just past 9:00 AM
* **Location:** A stuffy, outdated Department of Corrections meeting room in a small town, likely somewhere in the Midwest.  It's described as having dusty windows, worn oak furniture, and an oppressive silence punctuated only by the ticking clock. The overall atmosphere is one of drab routine and understated tension.
