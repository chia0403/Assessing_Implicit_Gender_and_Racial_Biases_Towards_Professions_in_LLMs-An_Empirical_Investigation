The late August sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's neck as she squinted at the dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff edge. The paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and ivy crept up the walls like grasping fingers, threatening to swallow the house whole. 

A shiver ran down Amy’s spine, not from the chill of the August wind whipping across the rocky shore below, but from the oppressive weight of history clinging to the place. This wasn't just any property listing; this was "The Whispering House," infamous in the local community for its unsettling reputation and rumored hauntings.  

Amy adjusted her sunglasses, the glint of the ocean reflecting in their lenses. It was a beautiful location, undeniably so, but something about the house made her hesitant. As she unlocked the rusted iron gate with a click that echoed through the stillness, Amy wondered if she’d bitten off more than she could chew.
