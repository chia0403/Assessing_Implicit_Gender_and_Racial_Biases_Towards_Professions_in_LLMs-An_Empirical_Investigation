The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Alistair Finch's head, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming dental instruments. His small office in Maplewood was usually filled with the comforting buzz of conversation and whirring drills, but this Tuesday morning remained uncharacteristically silent. Outside, autumn was painting the Ohio hills in fiery hues of orange and red, but Alistair only saw the muted greys of his waiting room. He tapped a manicured finger against the polished reception desk, anxiously awaiting the arrival of his first patient.

He wasn't usually this restless. He thrived on the routine, the meticulous precision required to mend teeth, to soothe fears, to offer a small sliver of control in a world that often felt chaotic. But today was different. Today, he was meeting with Mrs. Eleanor Hayes, a woman whose case had him more unnerved than any molar abscess could ever be.
