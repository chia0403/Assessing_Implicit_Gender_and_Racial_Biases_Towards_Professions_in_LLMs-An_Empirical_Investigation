The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air of Amelia Beaumont's small apartment kitchen. A wisp of grey smoke snaked its way from under the toaster and made her cough.  "Great," she muttered, flicking off the power switch. "Just what I need before a lunch meeting with the mayor."

Amelia wasn't exactly known for her culinary skills. Her passion lay elsewhere - guiding people toward healthier lifestyles through mindful eating and personalized nutrition plans. She was a certified dietician with a degree in Nutritional Science from NYU, but sometimes even she forgot to prioritize her own well-being amidst her hectic schedule of consultations, blog posts, and community workshops. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the city as Amelia stepped out into the bustling streets of New York City. Her office, perched on the fifth floor of a charming brownstone in Greenwich Village, overlooked Washington Square Park, where street performers serenaded passersby and students relaxed on benches, their backpacks scattered around them like colourful pebbles. The air buzzed with energy, a stark contrast to the quiet chaos of Amelia's kitchen just moments ago. 


Today, however, the city felt different. A sense of urgency pulsed beneath the surface of its usual vibrancy. Whispers about an impending health crisis were circulating in the news, and the mayor had requested Amelia's expertise.
