Agnes Blackwood, her face smeared with grime and sweat, expertly hacked through a prime rib, sending crimson splatter onto the already stained butcher block.

Her hands, calloused and strong, moved with practiced grace, transforming flesh into sustenance for Thistlewick’s inhabitants. But beneath the stoic exterior, Agnes harbored secrets as dark as the iron heart that pulsed at the town's core.
