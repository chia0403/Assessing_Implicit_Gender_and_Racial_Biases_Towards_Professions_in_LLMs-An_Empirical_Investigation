The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from Mrs. Hemmings' prized lilac bush, which bloomed stubbornly outside the kitchen window despite the late October chill. Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne hummed softly to herself as she dusted the antique grandfather clock in the foyer, its brass pendulum swinging rhythmically back and forth. 

The grand Victorian house was eerily silent save for Ellie’s gentle movements and the occasional clatter of a fallen teacup from Mrs. Hemmings' afternoon tea service.  Mrs. Hemmings, a woman who lived solely in her memories, often spent her days in the drawing-room, staring at faded photographs and sipping weak Earl Grey tea. Ellie, on the other hand, found solace in the quiet rhythm of her work – cleaning, polishing, organizing – the familiar tasks that kept the house humming with life even when its mistress seemed lost in a world beyond its walls. 


But today was different. A strange tension crackled in the air, heavier than usual. Ellie felt it as she straightened the velvet cushions on the antique chaise lounge, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck. It wasn't just the unsettling silence; there was an undercurrent of something else – anticipation, perhaps, or even fear. As Ellie wiped down the mahogany sideboard, her gaze fell upon a single crimson rose lying on the table, its petals unblemished and vibrant against the stark white linen tablecloth. 


It was out of place, this single bloom in the midst of autumn’s fading glory. And it wasn't Mrs. Hemmings' style. This house didn't welcome surprises.
