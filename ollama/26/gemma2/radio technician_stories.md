The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of saltwater, clinging to Amelia "Millie" Brighton's sweat-dampened overalls as she crouched on the rickety platform beneath the rusted Ferris wheel. Above her, the skeletal structure groaned under the weight of the relentless August wind whipping across Coney Island. Millie adjusted her headset microphone, its coiled cord snaking down from her ear and disappearing into the depths of her pockets, where it tangled with a collection of tools and spare parts. 

"This is The Wave," she announced into the crackling microphone, her voice barely audible above the roar of the ocean and the shrieks of delighted children riding the Cyclone rollercoaster in the distance. "A-Wave-C-E…  testing, testing… Come in, A-Wave-D, do you copy?"

Silence met her call. Millie sighed, a sound swallowed by the wind. Another dead transmission. It had been like this for weeks - the island's radio network, their lifeline to the mainland, plagued with interference, static, and the occasional eerie silence. Someone was messing with them, deliberately disrupting their signal.  Millie wasn't sure who or why, but she knew she had to find out before the whispers of a government cover-up turned into panicked screams.
