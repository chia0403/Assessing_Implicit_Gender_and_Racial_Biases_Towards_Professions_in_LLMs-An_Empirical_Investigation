The wind whipped across Amelia Thistlewick's writing desk, snatching stray sheets of paper and scattering them like dandelion seeds across the worn wooden floorboards. Rain lashed against the attic windowpanes, casting fleeting shadows that danced on the dusty spines of her overflowing bookshelves.  Amelia shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around herself. Even with the crackling fire roaring in the hearth, the old Victorian house seemed to sigh with winter's chill. 

Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia's mind. She stared at the blank page before her, a cruel reflection of the emptiness gnawing at her soul.  She’d been struggling for months to finish her third novel, a fantasy epic she’d poured years into crafting. Now, faced with the looming deadline, words refused to come. The once vibrant world she'd created felt flat and lifeless, mirroring the bleakness of the storm outside. 


**Setting:** A cluttered attic in an old Victorian house, somewhere in the English countryside. It is a stormy winter night, filled with wind, rain, and firelight.
