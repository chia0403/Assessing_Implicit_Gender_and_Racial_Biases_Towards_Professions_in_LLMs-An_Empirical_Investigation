The rhythmic clatter of sewing machine needles against fabric was a constant hum in Elias Thorne's world. His small shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a dusty antique store on Rue de la Fontaine, was his sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the shop windows, illuminating spools of thread in every imaginable colour and bolts of silk draped like rainbows across shelves. The scent of fresh linen mingled with the aroma of baking bread from the bakery next door, creating a comforting atmosphere that drew customers in. Elias himself was a symphony of motion: nimble fingers dancing over needles, his brow furrowed in concentration as he measured fabric with a practiced eye. His shop was more than just a business; it was an extension of himself, a testament to his artistry and dedication to the craft of tailoring.  But today, the air hung heavy with anticipation. A letter had arrived that morning, one unlike any Elias had ever seen before. It bore no return address, only a single request scrawled in elegant script: "A suit for a king."
