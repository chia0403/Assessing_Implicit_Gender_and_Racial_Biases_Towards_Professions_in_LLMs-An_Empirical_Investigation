The aroma of lavender hand sanitizer mingled with stale coffee and dusty textbooks in the back room of "Pill & Remedy," a small independent pharmacy nestled on a quiet corner street in Oakhaven, Maine. Amelia Beatrice Prescott, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, meticulously sorted through a box of expired cough syrup, her brow furrowed in concentration. The bell above the door tinkled, announcing another customer – a familiar sound that usually brought a wave of warmth and purpose to Amelia’s day. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine, a feeling amplified by the shadows cast by the late afternoon sun filtering through the dusty windowpanes.  

Amelia glanced at the clock: 4:57 pm. Just three minutes until closing time. She straightened her glasses, pushing them further up her nose, and with a sigh, prepared to greet whoever had dared interrupt her work.


Oakhaven, Maine, was a town where everyone knew their neighbor's name and gossip travelled faster than the wind. The streets were lined with quaint shops, each brimming with local charm, and the air held the scent of salt from the nearby ocean.  But beneath this idyllic surface, secrets whispered in the rustling leaves and glinted like hidden treasure in the depths of the harbor. Amelia knew Oakhaven’s stories well, both the joyous and the tragic, and she sensed a new one was about to unfold.
