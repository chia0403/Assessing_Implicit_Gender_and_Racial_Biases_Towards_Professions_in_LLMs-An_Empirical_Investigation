The scent of lavender shampoo and freshly sharpened shears hung heavy in the air, a comforting familiarity to Emilia "Em" Rosethorn. Her small shop, 'Rosethorn & Co.', nestled on the cobblestone corner of Elm and Willow Streets, pulsed with the low hum of conversation and clippers. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling marketplace, its vibrant stalls overflowing with exotic spices and hand-crafted trinkets. 

Em, her auburn braids pulled back in a neat bun, meticulously swept stray hairs from a client's silvering crown, her movements precise and practiced. She hummed along to the lively folk music drifting from a nearby tavern, her heart warmed by the familiar rhythm of another day spent transforming hair into artistry. 


But today, something felt different. The air buzzed with an unseen tension, a whisper of change on the wind that ruffled the vibrant banners strung across the marketplace.  As Em prepared to begin on her next client, a young woman cloaked in shadows entered the shop, bringing with her a chill that seemed to seep into the very foundations of Rosethorn & Co.
