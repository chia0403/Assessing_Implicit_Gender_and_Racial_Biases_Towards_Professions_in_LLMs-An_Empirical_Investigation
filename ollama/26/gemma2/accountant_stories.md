The air in Eleanor Ainsworth's tiny apartment smelled faintly of burnt toast and desperation. Numbers danced before her eyes, blurring into an incomprehensible mess on the worn kitchen table.  Eleanor, a woman whose normally impeccable bun seemed to have wilted with her spirits, chewed on her pen cap, staring at the mountain of invoices threatening to consume her workspace. 

It was always like this at the end of each month. A chaotic ballet of late payments, missing receipts, and frantic calls to irate clients. Eleanor's accounting firm, "Ainsworth & Associates," was a one-woman operation squeezed into the corner of a dilapidated brick building in downtown Scranton. It wasn't glamorous, but it was all she had after the recession swallowed her husbandâ€™s construction company whole. Now, Eleanor juggled his dwindling pension with her own meager income, struggling to keep afloat while battling the crushing weight of responsibility and regret.

Outside, the October wind howled through the canyons of steel and concrete, a symphony of urban desolation mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor's heart.  She just needed one client, one big deal, to turn things around. To silence the whispers of failure echoing in her mind. But tonight, all she felt was the bone-deep fatigue of a woman fighting a losing battle against the tide.
