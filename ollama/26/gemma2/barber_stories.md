The air in "Arthur's Clippers" was thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes dancing in the golden haze. Outside, the bustling streets of New Orleans pulsed with life, but within those worn wooden walls, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. Arthur Jean-Baptiste, his calloused hands expertly wielding a straight razor, focused on his client's closely cropped hair. A gentle hum vibrated from the old electric shaver perched precariously on the back counter, its rhythmic whir a comforting constant in this symphony of snips and shears.  

Arthur, a man weathered by years spent honing his craft, was more than just a barber. He was a confidante, a historian, and a silent observer of the city's beating heart. His chair had witnessed countless stories unfold: tales of triumph and despair, love found and lost, dreams chased and abandoned. In this haven of masculine routine, Arthur held court, dispensing advice as freely as he dispensed haircuts. Today, though, something felt different. The usual banter was absent, replaced by a palpable tension that hung heavy in the air, like the humidity just before a summer storm.
