The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Rosewater's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile waiting room.  She tapped her foot impatiently against the linoleum floor, the rhythm echoing faintly in the cavernous space. It was 8:57 am, and the clock on the wall seemed to be mocking her. Mr. Henderson, the Head of Acquisitions, had promised a meeting with Amy before 9:00 sharp, but as usual, he was late.  

Amy glanced at the handful of magazines strewn across the table - "Time," "Forbes," "Architectural Digest" â€“ none offering anything remotely interesting to her at this moment. Her fingers itched to pick up her phone and scroll through social media, but she knew better. Mr. Henderson would walk in any second, his perfectly-combed hair still immaculate despite a whirlwind morning of back-to-back meetings, and catch her slacking. 

The office was an uninspiring expanse of beige walls and grey carpeting, located on the 23rd floor of a nondescript skyscraper in downtown Chicago. The only splash of colour came from a large glass window overlooking the city, but even that view felt dull today, swallowed by the thick haze of early morning smog.  Amy sighed, wishing for something, anything, to break the monotony of this predictable morning.
