The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's back as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Dust, fine as powdered bone, danced in the air, catching the light and swirling around him like restless spirits. The quarry, nestled deep within the foothills of the Grey Peaks, hummed with a chorus of hammers striking stone, punctuated by grunts of effort and the occasional shout. Elias ignored them all, focusing on the rhythm of his own work. He carved not just for necessity, but for solace. Each precise blow of his chisel was a meditation, a way to quiet the anxieties that gnawed at him.

Today, however, even the familiar comfort of his craft couldn't fully soothe the unease that coiled in his gut. The contract he’d accepted from Lord Auberon was unlike any he'd taken before. It demanded not just skill, but something bordering on artistry: a massive gargoyle, intricately detailed, to adorn the entrance of the lord's newly built manor. And Elias had agreed, blinded by the promise of a fortune that would finally allow him to leave this dusty quarry and build his own life. 

But now, as he chipped away at the granite maw of the creature, a prickling sensation warned him that he was walking into something dangerous. He couldn't shake the feeling that Lord Auberon’s request held a hidden purpose, one darker than the shadows cast by the Grey Peaks themselves.
