The bell above the classroom door jangled merrily, announcing the arrival of Amelia Rose Cartwright's fourth graders. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Colorful alphabet banners hung from the ceiling, and student artwork – crayon masterpieces depicting fantastical creatures and lopsided portraits – adorned the walls.

Amelia, with her auburn braids piled atop her head and a smile as bright as the sunflowers in the vase on her desk, greeted each child by name. Her classroom wasn't just a space for learning; it was a haven built on kindness, curiosity, and boundless imagination. 


But today, a knot of unease tightened in Amelia's chest.  A letter had arrived that morning, addressed in unfamiliar handwriting, hinting at a secret hidden within the very walls of her beloved school. The words "forgotten memories" and "hidden truth" echoed ominously in her mind. As the chatter of her students filled the room, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary – and possibly unsettling – was about to unfold.
