Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Theodore "Teddy" Finch's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. Papers littered his desk, each one representing another claim denied, another broken promise. Teddy sighed, rubbing a weary hand across his greying temples. He was tired. Tired of the endless cycle of paperwork, the hollow smiles he plastered on for clients whose hopes he couldn't fulfill. Tired of being a cog in a machine that seemed designed to chew people up and spit them out.

His office, situated in a dreary strip mall on the edge of Elmwood, wasn't helping matters. The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic glow over dusty filing cabinets and a faded poster proclaiming "Life is Precious - Protect It!" with irony that stung Teddy's soul. He glanced at the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall â€“ 5:47 pm. Another day down, another mountain of misery climbed.

But today felt different. A prickle of unease danced on his skin, a feeling he couldn't quite place. It started with a phone call earlier that afternoon, a cryptic message from a woman who wouldn't give her name. She spoke of a "matter" requiring Teddy's particular expertise and promised details at precisely 6:00 pm sharp. Now, as the clock ticked closer to the appointed hour, Teddy couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another routine claim.
