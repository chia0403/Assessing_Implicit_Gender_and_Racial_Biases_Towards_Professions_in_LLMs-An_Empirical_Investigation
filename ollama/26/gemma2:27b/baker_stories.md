The aroma of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung thick in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind that whistled down Baker Street. Emilia Hawthorne, her flour-dusted apron as familiar as her own skin, surveyed her domain with a critical eye. The bakery window, frosted with delicate snowflakes, displayed an array of pastries begging to be devoured: glistening croissants, plump berry tarts, and loaves of sourdough bread that promised the perfect crusty crunch. But today, Emilia's focus was on something more ambitious – a gingerbread house fit for a king (or at least a very discerning child).
