The flickering neon sign outside cast stripes of sickly green across Eloise Beaumont’s face as she straightened her starched uniform. The "Grandview Hotel" blazed in bold letters above, promising luxury that hadn't seen an upgrade since the 80s. Eloise sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl back under her tightly pinned bun.

It was nearly midnight, and the Grandview lobby was deserted except for a lone businessman slumped over a newspaper by the fireplace. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the glittering skyline into a watercolor mess. Eloise tapped impatiently on the antique mahogany desk, its surface polished smooth by years of guest requests and complaints.

Tonight, however, promised to be anything but ordinary. A mysterious package had arrived earlier that day addressed to “The Keeper.” No sender, no return address, just a plain cardboard box emitting an unsettling hum. Eloise, the Grandview’s ever-curious concierge, found herself inexplicably drawn to it.

Little did she know, this seemingly innocuous package held the key to unlocking secrets buried deep within the hotel’s past, and it would thrust Eloise into a world far beyond the gilded cage of her everyday duties.
