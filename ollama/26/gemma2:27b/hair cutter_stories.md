The rusty clang of the bell above the door announced another customer, pulling Elara DeLuca from her daydream. She sighed, pushing aside the tangled mess of braids she'd been idly working on. The late afternoon sun streamed through the grimy windowpane, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of "Elara's Snips & Styles". Dust motes danced in the golden rays, illuminating a world weary with age and neglect. 

Outside, the clamor of the city simmered, a constant hum punctuated by the screech of brakes and the distant wail of sirens. But within these four walls, time seemed to stand still, held captive by the scent of stale hairspray and the muffled ticking of an ancient grandfather clock in the corner. Elara straightened her apron, its fabric thin and stained with years of dye mishaps, and pasted on a smile she hoped reached her tired eyes.  She needed this customer; rent was due, and her fridge held nothing but a wilting carrot and a jar of questionable pickles.

"Welcome to Elara's Snips & Styles," she called out, her voice laced with forced cheerfulness. "What can I do for you?"
