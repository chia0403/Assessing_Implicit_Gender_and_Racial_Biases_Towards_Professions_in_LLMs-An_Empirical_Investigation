Rain lashed against the greenhouse windows, mimicking the frantic beat of Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne’s heart. The annual Spring Fling Flower Show was tomorrow, and disaster had struck. Half her prize-winning orchids, the delicate Lady Slippers with their cascading petals the color of amethyst dusk, were wilting under a mysterious blight. A sickly yellow had crept up their stems, turning the vibrant blooms into drooping disappointments.

Eliza ran a trembling hand through her auburn braid, the scent of damp earth and crushed jasmine heavy in the air. The greenhouse, normally a haven of verdant life and fragrant peace, now felt oppressive. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mirroring Eliza’s despair. She couldn't let years of meticulous care and breeding be undone by this unseen enemy. 

The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second a hammer blow against her hopes.  Eliza had to find a solution, and fast. The fate of her orchids, and her reputation as one of the finest florists in the city, hung precariously in the balance.
