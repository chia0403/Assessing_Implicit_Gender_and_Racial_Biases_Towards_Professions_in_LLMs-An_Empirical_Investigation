The midday sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Callahan's back like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already sweat-soaked shirt into a second skin. He squinted at the shimmering asphalt stretching ahead, its heat waves distorting the distant view of the Arizona desert. Jazz adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson, hoping to catch a sliver of shade, and sighed. Another day, another stretch of endless highway.

Jazz had been working for the Arizona Department of Transportation for ten years now, patching potholes and repairing guardrails along the desolate stretches of Interstate 10. He'd seen more sunsets than he could count, each one burning into the horizon with a fiery intensity that mirrored his own simmering frustration.


He longed for something more, something beyond the monotonous hum of traffic and the endless cycle of repair and replacement. A dream, perhaps, whispered on the wind: a little ranch house nestled in the foothills, a field full of sunflowers turning their faces to the sun. 

Today, however, Jazz's thoughts were consumed by the strange glint he had spotted earlier that morning â€“ a flash of silver half-buried in the red dust near mile marker 237. It hadn't looked like anything familiar: a toolbox, maybe, or a piece of discarded machinery. But something about it nagged at him, a pull towards the unknown.  As his crew moved on down the highway, Jazz found himself lingering behind, drawn back to that mysterious glimmer in the dust.
