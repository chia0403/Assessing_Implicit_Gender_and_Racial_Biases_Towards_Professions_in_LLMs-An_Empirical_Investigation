The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Moreau's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a soggy mess. The air hung thick and heavy, punctuated by the insistent whine of cicadas and the distant clang of steel against steel from another part of the site. Eli wiped a grimy hand across his brow, leaving a smear of dust in its wake. He squinted up at the skeletal framework of the skyscraper rising before him, a monument to ambition and concrete that seemed to defy gravity itself.  

Eli wasn't one for lofty dreams. He liked the solidity of steel beams and the satisfying thud of a hammer driving nails home. But today, even the rhythm of his work felt off-kilter. A knot of unease tightened in his gut, fueled by a series of unsettling events: missing tools, strange symbols scrawled on the scaffolding, and whispered rumors amongst the other workers about an ancient curse tied to the land where they were building.

Eli dismissed it all as superstitious nonsense. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.  As he hoisted a heavy steel beam into position, the unsettling sense of foreboding intensified. A chill crept down his spine despite the sweltering heat, and for a fleeting moment, he swore he heard a low, guttural growl echoing from within the unfinished structure.
