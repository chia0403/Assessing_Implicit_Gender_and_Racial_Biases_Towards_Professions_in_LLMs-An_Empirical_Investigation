The air hung heavy with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A pale sliver of sun peeked through the dense canopy overhead, illuminating motes of dust dancing in Elias Blackwood's wake as he trudged deeper into the emerald embrace of the Redwood National Park. His worn leather boots crunched on a carpet of fallen cones, each step echoing the deep ache throbbing in his right knee, a souvenir from a particularly nasty fall last winter.

Elias ran calloused hands over his weathered face, squinting at the towering giants around him. Their trunks, scarred and ancient, seemed to whisper secrets of forgotten centuries. He wasn't afraid of the solitude, not anymore. In fact, it was in these hushed moments amongst the trees that Elias found a semblance of peace, a respite from the echoes of his past.

Today, however, the silence felt different. A prickling unease settled beneath his skin as he approached a clearing, the source unknown but undeniable. He paused, hand instinctively reaching for the axe strapped to his back, its familiar weight a small comfort.

Something wasn't right.
