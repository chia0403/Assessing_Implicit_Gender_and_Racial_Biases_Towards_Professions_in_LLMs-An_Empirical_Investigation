Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of the clinic, blurring the already dismal view of the industrial park. Amelia Rose Thornton sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before dissipating into the damp air. The rhythmic tapping on the glass was almost hypnotic, mirroring the steady thrumming ache in her own knee. It was a constant reminder – even after years – that she wasn't invincible.

Amelia ran a hand through her already messy auburn braid, her gaze sweeping across the sparsely decorated waiting room. A chipped porcelain planter held a lone, drooping geranium, and faded motivational posters clung to the walls like tired butterflies. The only pop of color came from a stack of brightly colored pamphlets on exercise and pain management, neatly arranged on the coffee table.

The doorbell chimed, a shrill sound that pierced the silence. Amelia straightened her posture, a practiced smile forming on her lips as she moved towards the door. Today's appointment was with a new patient, someone referred by Dr. Chen from the local hospital. A flicker of curiosity sparked within Amelia; every new case brought its own set of challenges and triumphs. 

She swung open the heavy oak door, ready to greet the unknown face behind it.  The rain, however, had other plans. The gust that followed carried with it not just a chill but also a figure, drenched and stumbling.
