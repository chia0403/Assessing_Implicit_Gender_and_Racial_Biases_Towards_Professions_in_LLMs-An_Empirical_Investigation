The scent of vanilla and almond clung to Elara Willowbrook like a second skin. It was a comforting aroma, one that whispered promises of sweetness and celebration even amidst the chaos swirling around her. Her usually pristine kitchen – a haven of buttercream swirls and fondant flowers – looked like a battlefield.

Sugar blossoms lay scattered on the counter, their delicate petals crushed under a rogue elbow. Piping bags slumped forlornly, their contents oozing onto the floor in sticky trails. Elara herself was a mess: flour dusting her apron, a smear of raspberry jam decorating her cheek, and a wild tangle of curls escaping from her braid.

The clock ticked ominously towards 10 pm. Three towering wedding cakes sat half-decorated on tiered stands, their buttercream frosting begging for the delicate touch of Elara's hand. But disaster had struck earlier that day – her delivery van had sputtered its last breath, leaving the cakes stranded and Elara scrambling to find a solution.
