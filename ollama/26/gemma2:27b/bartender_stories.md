Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Drunken Dragon, mirroring the storm brewing inside Silas Blackwood.  He slammed down another shot glass, the amber liquid sloshing precariously as he glared at the reflection staring back - weary eyes sunk deep in his face, shadowed by a rumpled fedora. The bar was mostly empty this Tuesday night; just a couple of regulars huddled over dusty chessboards, their faces illuminated by flickering neon signs advertising forgotten beer brands. Silas knew them both by name – Edgar, a retired accountant with a penchant for cryptic crosswords, and Mrs. O'Malley, who claimed she could predict the future through tea leaves but mostly spent her time gossiping about the local butcher.

The bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence.  Silas turned, expecting another lonely soul seeking refuge from the storm. But this wasn’t just any customer. The woman standing in the doorway was a vision – all crimson lipstick and cascading black curls, her emerald eyes searching the dimly lit space with an intensity that sent a shiver down Silas's spine. 

He knew, instinctively, that this night wouldn't be like any other.
