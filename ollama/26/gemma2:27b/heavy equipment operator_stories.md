The sun beat down on Jasper "Jas" Blackwood's shaved head, making the sweat trickle down his neck like a miniature waterfall. He squinted through the glare bouncing off the windshield of the behemoth CAT excavator he operated. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, swirling red dirt and tumbleweeds in their frenetic waltz. This was the Nevada desert, unforgiving and vast, stretching as far as the eye could see under an endless blue sky. 

Jas had been hired to clear a swathe of land for a new solar farm, a project he viewed with mixed emotions. On one hand, renewable energy was a good thing. But on the other, there was something undeniably melancholic about stripping away the natural world, replacing it with rows upon rows of metallic panels. Still, it was a job, and Jas needed the work. He gripped the controls, his calloused hands steady as he swung the excavator's massive arm towards another scraggly desert scrub.
