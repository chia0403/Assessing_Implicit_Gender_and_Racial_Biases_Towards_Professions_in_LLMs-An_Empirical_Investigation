The humid Charleston air clung to Eleanor "Ellie" Vance like a damp shawl as she unlocked the wrought iron gate leading to the property.  Spanish moss dripped from ancient live oaks, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown lawn. A peeling paint sign proclaimed it "Magnolia Manor," the name faintly echoing the grandeur that this once stately Victorian home must have possessed. Now, it stood forlorn and forgotten, windows boarded shut like vacant eyes. Ellie sighed. This was going to be a tough sell. 


She adjusted her straw hat and stepped onto the cracked stone path, her sensible shoes crunching on the gravel. She imagined the laughter of children echoing through the halls, the scent of magnolias filling the air, the soft glow of candlelight illuminating elaborate dinners. But all she saw were peeling paint, crumbling brickwork, and a sense of melancholic decay that permeated every inch of the neglected estate. Still, Ellie had a reputation for finding beauty in unexpected places. She was determined to breathe life back into this forgotten gem.
