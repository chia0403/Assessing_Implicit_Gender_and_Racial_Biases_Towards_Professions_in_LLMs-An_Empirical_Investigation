The air in Grimshaw's Butchery hung heavy with the scent of blood and smoke, a familiar comfort to Edgar Hawthorne, its proprietor for the last forty years. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating swirls of sawdust on the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the cobblestone street bustled with the clatter of carts and the shouts of hawkers, a symphony of everyday life in the bustling market town of Oakhaven. 

Edgar, his broad frame stooped slightly with age, expertly wielded a cleaver, severing a thick beef shank with practiced precision. The rhythmic thwack echoed through the shop, punctuated by the occasional clang of steel on bone as he worked.  His weathered face, framed by a shock of white hair and a bushy grey mustache, was etched with lines that spoke of countless sunrises spent tending to his craft.
