The air thrummed with an anxious energy that Eliza Cartwright, veteran pilot extraordinaire, could practically taste. The sky above the ramshackle airstrip in Dustbowl Gulch was the color of bruised plums, heavy with the threat of a sandstorm. She ran a gloved hand over the chipped paint on her beloved Cessna 172, affectionately dubbed "Rusty," muttering under her breath about the audacity of scheduling a cargo run in such weather.

Dustbowl Gulch, a forgotten outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the Great Azure Desert, wasn't exactly known for its hospitable climate.  The wind whipped around Eliza, carrying grit that stung her exposed skin and rattled the rusty struts of Rusty. She squinted at the horizon, where the towering sand dunes shimmered in the fading light, their jagged peaks already casting long shadows across the parched landscape. 

Eliza knew this flight was vital. The medical supplies she carried were desperately needed in Oasis Springs, a settlement struggling to survive amidst the encroaching desert. But with each gust of wind that threatened to rip Rusty from its moorings, doubt gnawed at her.
