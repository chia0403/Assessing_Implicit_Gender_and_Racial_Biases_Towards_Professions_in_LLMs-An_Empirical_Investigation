The sun, a fiery orb peeking over the horizon, cast long shadows across Elias Hawthorneâ€™s fields. Dew clung to the stalks of corn, glistening like scattered diamonds in the pre-dawn light. A rooster crowed from the barn, its sound sharp and insistent, echoing Elias' own weariness as he surveyed the day's work ahead. He ran a calloused hand over his weathered face, feeling the deep lines etched by years spent under the unforgiving sun.  This season had been harsh, plagued by drought and unpredictable storms that left him with fields struggling to yield their bounty.

Elias lived on the edge of Hopewell Valley, a sliver of fertile land nestled between rolling hills and the whispering pines of the Whisperwood Forest. Generations of Hawthornes had tilled this soil, their legacy etched into every furrow and hedgerow. But Elias felt the weight of that legacy heavily upon him. The valley was changing, encroaching development threatening to swallow up their small community.

He needed a good harvest. This year, more than any other.
