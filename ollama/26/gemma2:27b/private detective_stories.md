Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Clover" sign across the street. The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional mournful wail of a saxophone from somewhere deep in the bowels of the building.

Elias Blackwood, his trench coat dripping onto the threadbare rug, surveyed the scene before him with a jaded eye. He was perched on a stool at the back of Millie's Diner, nursing a lukewarm cup of joe and trying to ignore the insistent thrumming in his temple. The diner, once a beacon of hope and greasy spoon salvation, had seen better days.

His latest client, a nervous young woman named Beatrice Finch, had left him with a lead â€“ a faded photograph of a man with shifty eyes and a scar snaking down his jawline, said to frequent this establishment.  Elias was supposed to find him, but the diner's clientele seemed more interested in drowning their sorrows than sharing information.
