The flickering fluorescent lights of the all-night diner buzzed like agitated bees, casting a sickly yellow glow across Eleanor Cartwright's crumpled sketches. Coffee, cold and forgotten, sat beside her laptop, its screen reflecting the exhaustion in Eleanor's eyes. Outside, the neon cityscape of Seoul pulsed with life, a stark contrast to the emptiness she felt within.

Eleanor was known for her vibrant designs, her work splashed across billboards and magazine covers, pulsating with energy and color. But tonight, inspiration had deserted her. The deadline for the new K-pop group's album cover loomed, a daunting monster threatening to devour her dreams of success. Every line she drew, every typeface she considered, felt hollow and uninspired.

The familiar ache in her chest pulsed â€“ a constant reminder of the reason she'd left London behind. Seoul was supposed to be a fresh start, a chance to reignite her passion for design. Yet here she was, trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, battling the ghosts of past failures that whispered insidious doubts in her ear.
