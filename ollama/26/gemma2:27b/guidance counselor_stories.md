Rain lashed against the warped windowpane of Amelia Cartwright's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The faded floral wallpaper seemed to sag under the weight of teenage angst that permeated the room. Posters advertising college fairs and mental health resources plastered the walls, offering hollow platitudes in the face of Amelia's mounting despair.

Another student had just stormed out, slamming the door with enough force to rattle the chipped paint on the ceiling. This was the third meltdown this week, each one a testament to the crushing pressure these kids faced. Standardized tests, college applications, social media scrutiny - it felt like the world was conspiring against their fragile psyches. Amelia sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. She'd always wanted to help young people find their path, but lately, she felt more like a shepherd navigating them through a minefield of anxieties.
