The morning mist clung stubbornly to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tendrils swirling like forgotten dreams around Percival Thaddeus Finch's weathered boots. Percy, as everyone called him, squinted through the haze, his calloused fingers tightening on the handle of his trusty hedge trimmer. The manor, a sprawling Gothic monstrosity with gargoyles perched like watchful sentinels, loomed over him. Its stone walls, ancient and ivy-covered, seemed to whisper secrets lost to time. 

Today was no ordinary day. Lady Blackwood, the enigmatic mistress of the house, had summoned Percy for a peculiar task:  to trim the hedges into the shape of a dragon, a creature she claimed haunted her dreams.  Percy, a man who preferred the company of roses and rhododendrons to fantastical beasts, sighed. He knew better than to question Lady Blackwood's whims; they were as unpredictable as the weather in this part of Yorkshire.
