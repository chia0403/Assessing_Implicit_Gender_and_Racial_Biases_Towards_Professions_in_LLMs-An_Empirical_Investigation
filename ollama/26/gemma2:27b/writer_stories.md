Rain lashed against the attic windowpanes, mimicking the frantic rhythm pounding in Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne’s chest. Her fingers hovered over the typewriter keys, paralyzed by doubt. The manuscript lay before her, a testament to years of toil and countless sleepless nights – a sprawling historical romance set amidst the opulent courts of 18th-century Vienna. Yet, as she stared at the last sentence, an icy dread crept up her spine. Was it good enough? Would anyone care about the forbidden love between Lady Isolde and the enigmatic composer, Franz Josef?

The attic room, cramped and dimly lit by a single bare bulb, was Eloise's sanctuary. Stacks of dog-eared novels lined the walls, their spines whispering tales of faraway lands and forgotten romances. A worn velvet armchair sat nestled in a corner, its cushions imprinted with the shape of her body after countless hours spent poring over research notes and weaving narratives. But today, even the familiar comfort offered by her writing space couldn't quell the rising tide of anxiety. 


This manuscript represented everything to Eloise - her dreams, her aspirations, her very identity as a writer. Rejection felt like an abyss threatening to swallow her whole.
