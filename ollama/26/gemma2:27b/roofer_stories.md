The midday sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's neck, turning his already weathered skin a shade darker. He perched precariously on the edge of the slate roof, hammer dangling from one gloved hand, and squinted at the chimney in front of him.  It was a beastly thing, built more for aesthetics than practicality, with its elaborate floral carvings and twisting fluted design. Elias sighed. It would take hours to carefully remove the damaged tiles around it without sending the whole structure crumbling down.

The air hung heavy with the scent of hot tar and distant traffic. Below him, the sprawling city of Oakhaven buzzed with life – a symphony of car horns, sirens, and the distant laughter of children playing in a park. Elias preferred this view, high above the chaos. Up here, he could breathe.

He glanced at the weathered toolbox beside him, its chipped paint mirroring his own worn exterior. It had been a gift from his grandfather, a master roofer who'd taught Elias everything he knew. Today, Elias was tackling a job on one of Oakhaven's oldest mansions – a grand Victorian behemoth with intricate gables and a history whispered to be haunted. He wasn't easily spooked, but something about the heavy silence that hung over the house made the hairs on his arms prickle.
