Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. The stale scent of coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Alistair, a man whose sharp intellect was only matched by his sharper cheekbones, ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair. He stared out at the neon-drenched cityscape of New Alexandria, its vibrant energy feeling a million miles away from the gloom that had settled over him.

His latest case, the seemingly straightforward defense of a young woman accused of petty theft, had unravelled into something far more sinister. There were whispers of a powerful corporation, hidden motives, and evidence that refused to align with the narrative presented by the prosecution. Alistair, known for his unwavering pursuit of justice, found himself wading through a murky pool of secrets, each clue leading him further down a rabbit hole of deceit.

He took a deep breath, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him. This wasn't just about proving his client's innocence anymore; it was about exposing the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be.
