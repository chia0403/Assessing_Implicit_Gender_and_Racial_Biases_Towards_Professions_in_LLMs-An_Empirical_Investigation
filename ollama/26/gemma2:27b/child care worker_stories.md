Rain hammered against the corrugated roof of the Sunnyside Daycare, a rhythmic drumming that underscored Amelia Rose Cartwright's mounting frustration.  Five-year-old Liam was having a meltdown of epic proportions, his face contorted in a silent scream as he clutched a plastic firetruck and refused to let go. Toys were scattered across the floor like casualties of war.

Amelia sighed, her knees protesting as she lowered herself onto the brightly colored rug. Liam's wails intensified, echoing through the daycare’s normally cheerful space. Outside, the sky was bruised purple, mirroring the storm brewing within the little boy. Amelia knew this wasn't about the firetruck; it was about something deeper, a fear or anxiety Liam couldn't articulate.  

She reached out hesitantly, her hand hovering above Liam's clenched fist. Today felt like one of those days where Amelia’s patience, normally as boundless as the playground outside, was stretched thin. The rain had been relentless all morning, keeping the children cooped up inside and amplifying their usual energy.
