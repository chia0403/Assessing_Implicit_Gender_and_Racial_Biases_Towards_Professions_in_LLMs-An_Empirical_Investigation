Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop exploding into a miniature firework display on the cobblestones below. Eleanor Finchwick, her silver bun slightly askew from adjusting a precarious stack of ancient tomes, sighed contentedly. The rhythmic drumming of the rain was a symphony to her ears, a comforting counterpoint to the hushed whispers and rustling pages that filled the cavernous space.

The library, with its towering oak shelves reaching towards the vaulted ceiling, held centuries of knowledge within its walls. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from forgotten myths, painted the room in a mosaic of colour. The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and leather, a smell Eleanor found utterly intoxicating.  

Tonight, however, the usual serenity was punctuated by an unsettling disquiet. A chill wind seemed to snake through the stacks, stirring dust motes into ethereal dances. And there was a presence, unseen but keenly felt, lurking in the shadowy corners.
