Rain lashed against the frosted glass of Eleanor Cavendish's office window, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. The rhythmic clatter was punctuated by the insistent clang of the old typewriter, each keystroke echoing in the cavernous silence of the executive suite after hours. Eleanor sighed, her fingers pausing above the worn keys.  

She wasn't supposed to be here this late. But Mr. Hawthorne, the firm's notoriously demanding CEO, had left a pile of handwritten notes on his desk just before he stormed out for dinner, muttering something about a "critical acquisition" and "getting ahead of the game." Eleanor knew better than to leave those unattended.

So there she was, hunched over her desk in the dimly lit office, the smell of old paper and stale coffee hanging heavy in the air. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Eleanor herself.  This late-night typing session wasn't just about meeting Mr. Hawthorne's unreasonable demands; it was about escaping the suffocating routine of her life, a life defined by endless filing, scheduling appointments, and deciphering Mr. Hawthorne's notoriously cryptic handwriting.

But tonight felt different. Tonight, something in the air, perhaps the raw power of the storm, or the eerie silence of the empty office, stirred a long-dormant yearning within Eleanor â€“ a yearning for something more than just being a shadow behind a mahogany desk.
