The aroma of roasted garlic and thyme wafted through Eleanor Vance's tiny apartment kitchen, mixing with the sharp scent of lemon zest. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, meticulously chopped fresh basil, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the neon glow of Times Square pulsed against the rain-streaked window, painting fleeting streaks of color on her worn countertop. 

It was a Tuesday night, and Eleanor, a registered dietician with a passion for healthy, vibrant food, was about to host her first "Eat Well, Feel Good" cooking class.  She'd spent weeks planning the menu â€“ a light summer pasta salad bursting with seasonal vegetables, followed by grilled salmon with roasted asparagus and quinoa. 

Eleanor hoped her carefully curated recipes would inspire her guests, many of whom were struggling with chronic health issues exacerbated by poor dietary choices. She believed food could be medicine, a powerful tool for healing and rejuvenation. Tonight, she was determined to share that belief with the world, one delicious bite at a time.
