Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 737, blurring the cityscape below into an impressionistic smear of greys and yellows.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the cool air conditioning. The turbulence wasn't helping her already pounding headache. She smoothed down her navy blue uniform, willing her smile to stay plastered on as she navigated the aisle, refilling coffee cups and offering lukewarm pretzels. 

This wasn't the glamorous life Amy had envisioned when she first signed up for flight attendant training. Gone were the dreams of exotic destinations and charming passengers. Instead, she was stuck on a routine route between Chicago and New York, enduring delays, grumpy travelers, and the occasional spilled red wine.  But beneath the weariness, a spark of hope flickered. Tonight was different. Tonight, Amy had a layover in Reykjavik, Iceland â€“ her first taste of international travel. Maybe, just maybe, this trip would be the start of something new.
