The humid Florida air clung to Elizabeth "Eliza" Moreau like a second skin as she hurried through the sliding glass doors of Mercy General Hospital. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the sharp tang of disinfectant, a familiar comfort after a grueling 12-hour night shift in the cardiac unit. Her worn scrubs felt heavy, her ponytail threatened to unravel, and the persistent ache in her lower back reminded her that she was pushing forty – a fact she stubbornly refused to acknowledge.

Eliza loved being a nurse. The adrenaline rush of saving lives, the quiet moments of comfort with patients facing their mortality, the camaraderie with her fellow nurses - it all fueled her soul. But tonight, something felt off. A nagging unease tugged at her, a premonition that whispered of trouble brewing beneath the hospital's sterile façade. 

As she approached the nurses' station, Eliza noticed an unusual stillness in the usually bustling environment. The chatter had quieted, replaced by hushed whispers and worried glances. Something was definitely wrong.
