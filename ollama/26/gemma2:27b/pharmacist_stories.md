Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of "Apothecary Lane," blurring the neon sign that flickered intermittently above the entrance. The scent of lavender and chamomile, usually a comforting aroma, seemed strained tonight, fighting to mask the metallic tang of anxiety permeating the air. Eleanor Finch adjusted her spectacles, peering through the downpour at the lone figure huddled beneath a flickering streetlamp across the road. He was a young man, drenched and shivering, his face obscured by a hooded sweatshirt.

Eleanor sighed. It was well past closing time, but something about the boy's posture – hunched shoulders, hands clenched into fists – tugged at her heartstrings. She had a soft spot for strays, both human and animal. After all, she spent her days tending to the ailments of her community, dispensing remedies and offering a listening ear alongside the prescribed pills. 

Hesitantly, Eleanor unlocked the door, the bell above it tinkling a mournful welcome. "Come in out of the rain," she called, her voice echoing through the quiet shop.
