Rain hammered against the arched windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop an icy finger tapping impatiently on the leaded glass. Eleanor Finchworth, her grey bun threatening to unravel in the humid air, paused in her dusting, peering out at the storm swirling beyond the manicured lawns. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping the ancient oak trees into frenzied contortions. It was nights like these that Eleanor felt most acutely the isolation of her life within Blackwood's imposing walls. 

Blackwood Manor, with its dark gargoyles and shadowy turrets, seemed to brood in the storm's fury. Its inhabitants were as enigmatic as the house itself: the reclusive Lord Blackwood, rarely seen outside his study; and Miss Amelia, his ethereal niece, who flitted about the halls like a startled dove, her eyes perpetually veiled by sadness. Eleanor, with her years of dedicated service, knew their routines better than they did themselves, yet she remained an unseen presence, a ghost within the mansion's grand spaces. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eleanor's spine as she heard a sudden crash from the upper floors, followed by an eerie silence that seemed to amplify the storm's rage.  Blackwood Manor was holding its breath, and Eleanor, drawn by a nameless fear, knew she had to find out what lurked in the shadows above.
