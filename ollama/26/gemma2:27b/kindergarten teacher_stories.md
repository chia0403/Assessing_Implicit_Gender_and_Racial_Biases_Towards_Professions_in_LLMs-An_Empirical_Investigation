The aroma of crayons and construction paper hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eloise Cartwright's kindergarten classroom. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched window, casting playful patterns across the alphabet rug. Twenty tiny chairs were arranged in a semi-circle around Eloise, who was perched precariously on a stool, her arms outstretched like a majestic bird.  

“Spread your wings and fly!” she chirped, mimicking the flapping motion of her hands. The children giggled, their faces alight with innocent joy as they imitated her, their small voices creating a chorus of delighted squeaks. Outside, the wind rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground, its branches swaying like graceful arms.  

But beyond the playful façade of finger painting and story time, a knot of anxiety tightened in Eloise's stomach. Today was the day the school board would announce their decision regarding funding cuts – cuts that could potentially decimate her beloved kindergarten program.
