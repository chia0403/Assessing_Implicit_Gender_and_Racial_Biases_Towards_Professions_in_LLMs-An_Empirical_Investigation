The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in the sterile white room, casting an unflattering glow on Elara Sinclair's tired face. Outside the window, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly, baking the asphalt parking lot until it shimmered. Inside St. Jude's Medical Center, however, the air was perpetually cool, a welcome contrast to the desert heat.  Elara sighed, rubbing her aching shoulder blades. Another double shift. Three years she'd been working here as a phlebotomist, and while she loved the work – drawing blood, helping doctors diagnose illnesses, sometimes even saving lives – the monotony of it all was starting to wear on her. Today felt particularly bleak. The waiting room overflowed with anxious faces, each holding its own unspoken story. Elara could only imagine their worries, their fears.  

Suddenly, a nurse emerged from the back, waving a chart frantically. "Elara! We need you in room 212, stat!" She rushed off before Elara could even ask what was wrong. A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. 'Stat' usually meant trouble. Elara grabbed her cart and hurried towards Room 212, bracing herself for whatever awaited her behind the closed door.
