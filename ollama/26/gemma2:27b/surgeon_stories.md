Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the city lights below into a shimmering haze.  Inside, the OR was an island of sterile calm amidst the storm. The overhead lights hummed, casting a cold, white glare over the stainless steel instruments laid out with surgical precision. Dr. Evelyn Moreau, her brow furrowed in concentration, leaned over the operating table, her gloved hands moving with practiced grace as she sutured a delicate artery. 

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor filled the silence, each pulse a precious testament to life hanging in the balance.  Evelyn's focus was absolute, her mind a labyrinthine map of anatomy and physiology honed over years of grueling training. Tonight, though, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. Something felt different about this case, a sense of unseen danger lurking beneath the surface.
