The humid Savannah air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Elara Montgomery like a second skin. Sweat prickled at her hairline despite the flimsy cotton blouse she wore beneath her PA scrubs.  

Elara pushed open the heavy oak door of the clinic and was met with the familiar symphony of coughs, sniffles, and the rhythmic whir of the ceiling fan. The air inside was stifling, but carried a comforting scent of antiseptic and lavender hand soap – the smells of healing, she often thought. 

Today, however, the usual hum felt different. A palpable tension crackled in the waiting room. Nervous whispers followed her as she walked past patients hunched over magazines and children squirming impatiently on their mothers' laps. Even Ms. Henderson, the clinic receptionist, usually a bastion of calm with her perfectly coiffed hair and cheerful smile, seemed anxious, tapping her acrylic nails against the countertop. 

Elara paused by her station, glancing at the overflowing inbox. A red note pinned to the top read: "Urgent: Review Patient Charts – Possible Outbreak." Her stomach clenched. An outbreak in a community as close-knit as theirs could be devastating. She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and prepared to face whatever awaited her.
