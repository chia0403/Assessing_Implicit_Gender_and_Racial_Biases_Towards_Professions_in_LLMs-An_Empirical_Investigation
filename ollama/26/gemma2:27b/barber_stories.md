The scent of bay rum and sandalwood hung thick in the air, a comforting shroud against the damp chill that seeped in from the alley behind Reginald Fitzwilliam's barbershop. Outside, the cobbled streets of Victorian London were slick with rain, reflecting the gaslights in a shimmering dance of gold and grey.

Reginald, his silvering hair neatly parted and oiled, was meticulously cleaning his shears, the rhythmic rasp against the whetstone a familiar lullaby in the hushed shop. The ornate mirror, its gilded frame chipped in places but still grand, reflected a scene of quiet industry: combs arranged in neat rows, bottles of tonics and pomades glinting under the warm glow of a single gas lamp. 

The bell above the door tinkled, shattering the silence, and Reginald looked up, his face creasing into a welcoming smile. "Good evening, sir," he boomed, his voice rich and resonant. "What can I do for you?"  He eyed the newcomer â€“ a young man, drenched to the bone, clutching a battered top hat.

Something about the stranger's haunted eyes and the tremor in his gloved hand intrigued Reginald. This was no ordinary customer.
