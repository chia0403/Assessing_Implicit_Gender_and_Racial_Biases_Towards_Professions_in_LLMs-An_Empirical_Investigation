The air conditioning unit wheezed its last breath just as Beatrice "Bea" Kensington finished tallying up Mr. Henderson's deductions for charitable contributions. The stale air in her tiny office, crammed between a laundromat and a psychic reader, grew thick with the scent of desperation and ozone. 

Outside, the April sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering quicksand. Bea sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. This was the third AC unit to bite the dust this year.  She couldn't afford another replacement, not after the disastrous tax season she'd just endured. 

Her phone buzzed, jarring her back to reality. It was Mrs. Feldman, fretting about her estimated taxes. Bea took a deep breath and plastered on her best customer service smile. "Don't worry, Mrs. Feldman," she chirped into the receiver. "I'll make sure everything is sorted out." But inside, anxiety gnawed at her. Could she really afford to keep this business afloat?
