Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of The Crooked Paw Veterinary Clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow. Inside, Dr. Amelia Rosalind Finch, her auburn braid escaping its confines, hunched over a ginger kitten no bigger than her hand. Its emerald eyes were squeezed shut, tiny whimpers escaping its pink mouth.

Amelia gently probed the kitten's swollen abdomen, her brow furrowing with concern. The storm had brought in a flurry of injured strays, each adding to the already overflowing cages lining the walls of the clinic. Nestled in the heart of rural Oakhaven, Amelia's practice was a haven for abandoned and mistreated animals, a testament to her unwavering compassion and dedication.

The wind howled outside, mirroring the tempest raging within Amelia. The kitten's condition was dire, and she knew every precious second counted.
