Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging crookedly in the shopfront.  Inside, Eleanor Rose Hawthorne kneaded her thumbs into the taut muscles of Mr. Henderson's shoulder blade. He grunted appreciatively, his eyes closed tight against the insistent drumming on the glass.

Eleanor’s small studio, tucked away above a bustling Thai restaurant in the heart of Portland, Oregon, was a sanctuary from the storm raging outside. The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and bergamot oil, mingling with the soft strains of classical music drifting from the hidden speaker.  Despite the tranquil atmosphere Eleanor had carefully curated, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. She glanced nervously at the clock: 8:52 PM. 

Mr. Henderson was her last client of the night, and she desperately needed to get home. Tonight was Liam's birthday dinner, and she promised him her famous chocolate lava cake. Liam, with his ever-present grin and twinkling blue eyes, deserved a good celebration. Eleanor just hoped she wouldn’t be too late.
