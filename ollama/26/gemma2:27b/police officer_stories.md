Rain lashed against Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's trench coat, the sound a relentless counterpoint to the thumping bass echoing from the warehouse across the street. Neon light bled through the grime-streaked windows, casting an unsettling, flickering glow onto the wet asphalt. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and something else - metallic, sharp, like blood drying in the sun.

Izzy tightened her grip on her holstered Glock 19, her gaze fixed on the warehouse entrance. Two figures, their faces obscured by shadows, were hauling a large, canvas-covered object towards an idling van. Her gut churned with a familiar mix of apprehension and anticipation. This was it. The culmination of weeks spent tracking a ruthless art smuggling ring.

Tonight, she'd bring them down.
