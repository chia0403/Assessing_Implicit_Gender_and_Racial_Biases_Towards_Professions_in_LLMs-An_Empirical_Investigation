The humid Miami air clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz like a second skin as she adjusted the microphone headset. Sweat already beaded on her forehead despite the fact that the Zumba class hadn't even begun. Through the mirrored walls of the studio, she could see a sea of expectant faces - regulars clutching brightly colored water bottles, newcomers nervously adjusting their workout clothes. Esme took a deep breath, the scent of coconut sunscreen and floor cleaner filling her lungs. This was her domain, this chaotic symphony of Latin beats and frantic footwork. For an hour, at least, she would be the queen of rhythm, guiding these bodies through a sweaty, exhilarating journey.

But today, something felt different. A strange tightness coiled in Esme's stomach, making the familiar pre-class jitters feel almost ominous.  She scanned the faces again, searching for anything out of place. That's when she saw him - a man shrouded in shadows near the back, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. He wasn't moving, just watching intently, an unsettling stillness emanating from him. Esme forced a smile, telling herself it was just nerves, but the feeling persisted. Something about this stranger felt deeply wrong, like a discordant note in her carefully orchestrated world.
