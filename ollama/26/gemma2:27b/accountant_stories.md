The stale scent of recycled air hung heavy in Eleanor Finch's cubicle, mingling with the faint aroma of instant coffee from her forgotten mug. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Finch & Finch accounting firm, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist watercolor of grays and blacks. Outside, the world was awash in a November storm, but inside, Eleanor was drowning in a sea of receipts, invoices, and spreadsheets. 

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, each keystroke another tiny battle won against the encroaching deadline. The quarterly audit for Blackwood Industries loomed large, a mountain of paperwork threatening to bury her alive. She needed this promotion; it meant stability, a chance to finally escape the cramped confines of her cubicle and maybe even afford that tiny studio apartment overlooking Central Park she'd been dreaming of.
