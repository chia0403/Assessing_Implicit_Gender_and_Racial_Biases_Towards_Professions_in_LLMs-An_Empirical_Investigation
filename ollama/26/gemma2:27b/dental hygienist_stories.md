The insistent buzzing of the overhead fluorescent lights pulsed in time with Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's headache. A Monday morning symphony composed of whining drills, splashing water, and the low hum of anxiety emanating from patients perched precariously in her chair. Today was shaping up to be another grueling eight hours spent wielding tiny instruments in the cavernous maw of strangers. Beatrice sighed, adjusting the ergonomic loupe perched on her forehead. 

The air in Dr. Mallory's office perpetually smelled of mint and antiseptic, a combination that Beatrice found nauseating after years of exposure.  Sunlight streamed through the window onto the gleaming stainless steel countertop, highlighting the grime clinging to the edges – a testament to the relentless cycle of cleaning and contamination that defined her life. 

As she prepped the next patient's tray, Beatrice couldn't help but feel a pang of longing for something… more. Something beyond the endless barrage of plaque and tartar, beyond the sterile walls and the monotonous routine.  Something that ignited her soul instead of slowly extinguishing it.
