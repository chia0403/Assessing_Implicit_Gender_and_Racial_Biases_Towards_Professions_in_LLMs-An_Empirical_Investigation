Rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Elias Finch's office window, blurring the already dreary view of cobblestone streets slick with mud. A persistent drip echoed from the ceiling, landing squarely in the center of a ledger filled with meticulously recorded transactions for the apothecary next door. Elias sighed, tugging his woolen cap further down over his ears. 

He was used to the chill of November in London, but this storm felt particularly vindictive, mirroring the tempest brewing within him. For weeks, whispers had circulated about the impending closure of Finch & Sons Bookkeeping, a business his grandfather had founded nearly a century ago. Elias, with his meticulous nature and unwavering dedication to accuracy, had always believed he'd carry on the legacy. Now, it seemed, the ledger lines were closing in on him, too.
