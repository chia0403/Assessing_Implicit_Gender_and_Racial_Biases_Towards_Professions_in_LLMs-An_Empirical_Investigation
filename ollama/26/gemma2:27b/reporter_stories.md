Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously above Benny's Burgers.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood hunched over a lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring her mood. The diner was deserted except for a lone trucker snoring softly in a booth, his trucker hat pulled low over his eyes. Amelia tapped impatiently on her laptop keyboard, the only sound besides the insistent drumming of rain.

She'd been chasing this story for weeks - whispers of a strange phenomenon plaguing the abandoned Blackwood Manor on the outskirts of town. Locals spoke of eerie lights, disembodied voices, and objects moving on their own. Amelia, a reporter known for her insatiable curiosity and penchant for the unorthodox, was determined to uncover the truth behind the rumors. But so far, she'd encountered nothing but dead ends and skeptical glances from the townsfolk.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of anticipation ran down her spine as she reread the cryptic email she'd received earlier that day: "Meet me at midnight. Blackwood Manor gate."  No signature. Just those chilling words. Amelia knew it was a risk, venturing into the manor alone in the dead of night, but something told her this could be the break she needed.
