The salty tang of the sea air stung Evelyn's nostrils as she stepped off the ferry in Port Royal. The quaint fishing village had a charm that belied its history – a charming facade hiding secrets whispered on the creaky docks and echoed by the mournful cry of gulls. Evelyn, a registered nurse with her crisp blue scrubs tucked neatly beneath a canvas coat, felt out of place amongst the locals with weathered faces and sun-kissed skin.  She was here to replace a temporary nurse who'd left abruptly, leaving behind only a trail of unsettling reports from the local hospice - whispers of patients "passing on" under the most baffling circumstances. 

Evelyn adjusted her worn watch – the one her late grandmother had given her, etched with tiny silver anchors and the inscription “To sail life’s sea” – as she surveyed the quaint, sun-drenched cottages nestled into a landscape that felt both timeless and strangely unsettling.  The air held an undercurrent of mystery - a whisper of something lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to reveal itself. Evelyn was about to delve into the unknown, one patient at a time.
