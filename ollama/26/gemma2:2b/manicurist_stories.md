The air in Serenity Nails was thick with polish fumes and the low murmur of gossip.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty glass beads, painted rows of shimmering acrylics across Amelia "Emmy" Thorne's hands as she meticulously filed a woman's callus. The rhythmic rasp of her tools was drowned out by the insistent chatter of an older customer who sat in a plush chair beside the gleaming chrome nail polish dispenser.

Each stroke on the manicured fingernails felt like a tiny crack in her own carefully constructed bubble of calm. She was adrift in a sea of unfulfilled dreams, constantly drowning in the monotonous rhythm of her life.
