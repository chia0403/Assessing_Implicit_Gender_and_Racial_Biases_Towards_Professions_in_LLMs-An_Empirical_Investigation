The air in the small office hung thick with resignation, each exhale seeming to ripple across the room like an unspoken wave of despair. It was 3:15 pm, and Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood's last class was about to begin.  Her usually cheery, vibrant self now seemed a faded, washed-out echo of who she once was. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn carpet and overflowing files. Outside, the autumn leaves danced in the wind, a frenzied ballet against the gray backdrop of the day. Eleanor ran a hand through her hair, already feeling the familiar knot forming in her chest. 

Eleanor Blackwood, Ph.D., school psychologist for Willow Creek Elementary since its opening decades ago, had seen it all. Broken families, societal upheavals, childhood anxieties morphing into crippling fears – she was a silent observer of their struggles, their victories, and their inevitable falls from grace. But today, as she stared at the worn-out photographs on her desk – a picture of her younger self standing proudly with a beaming group of students in front of the school building that would later become their beloved playground, and another of her own wedding day, a time she'd chosen to keep hidden away in her box of memories –  she felt more lost than ever. The spark was gone.

The door creaked open, breaking the silence like a harsh slap.  She knew before he even stepped into the office that it was about to be a long afternoon.
