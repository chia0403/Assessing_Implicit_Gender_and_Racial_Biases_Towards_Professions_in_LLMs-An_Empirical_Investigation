The salty air whipped Amelia's long auburn hair across her face as she perched on the edge of the worn wooden pier. A million tiny waves crashed against the pilings, each splash sending a fleeting burst of cool water down her bare arm.  She inhaled deeply, the scent of brine mixing with the faint sweetness of lavender that clung to the clothes lining her massage table. This was Oceanside Haven, her sanctuary for weary souls and tangled nerves. 

Amelia, known simply as Amy by regulars and strangers alike, ran a small private practice, nestled in the heart of this seaside town. Her haven wasn't just on the pier, but rather within the gentle rhythm of waves lapping at the shore, the rhythmic whooshing of wind through the palms, and the quiet hum of her ancient massage table.  Today, she had three clients booked for afternoon, each with their own unique story: a stressed-out marketing executive yearning for relaxation; an overworked construction foreman battling chronic back pain; and a single mother juggling work and motherhood, seeking solace in the pressure points along her shoulders and neck. 


As the first rays of sun touched the water, Amy began her preparation. Her nimble fingers danced across the surface of her massage oil bottles, each one filled with carefully chosen herbs and essential oils, their scent promising calm and rejuvenation. The day was going to be a good one.
