## The Cagebird's Song

**Setting:** A sun-drenched Wednesday afternoon in a nondescript suburb of Seattle. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of pines and freshly cut grass. It was the kind of day where the silence seemed to press down, punctuated only by the distant chirping of birds.  This quietude didn't soothe Eleanor "Ellie" Carter, who stood at the edge of a gravel path leading into the woods.

She watched through her binoculars as a young woman, Nadia Hernandez, sat on a bench in the heart of the probation office’s assigned community center. A single red scarf draped loosely around her shoulders, it looked almost an afterthought against the stark white walls and fluorescent lighting. The girl was hunched over a worn leather journal, its pages filled with meticulous drawings and scribbled poems - far too poetic for someone on probation for shoplifting. 

Ellie’s gaze lingered, then softened. Nadia had been one of her first cases as a Probation Officer, thrown into the world of broken families and adolescent rebellion with more than a little apprehension. The girl was an enigma, constantly oscillating between defiance and vulnerability. 

"Nadia," Ellie called out gently. "I wanted to ask you about your journaling." She placed a worn briefcase on the table next to Nadia's bench. “It’s almost time for our session.”

Nadia looked up, her eyes filled with a mix of apprehension and surprise. A flicker of something deeper, too, like an unspoken fear or perhaps a fragile hope, flickered in their depths. 


**Main Character:** Eleanor "Ellie" Carter is a probation officer working in Seattle's overcrowded juvenile justice system.  She’s dedicated to rehabilitation but deeply conflicted by the cycle of poverty and trauma that seems to perpetuate criminal behavior amongst her clients. Ellie also harbors a secret - a past she tries to keep hidden, one where family obligations and personal demons collided like rogue waves.
