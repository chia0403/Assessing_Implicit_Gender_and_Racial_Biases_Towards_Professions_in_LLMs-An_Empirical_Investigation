The late afternoon sun dipped below the treeline, casting long shadows across the rugged landscape of Mendocino National Forest.  A chill wind whistled through the pines, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and pine needles. On top of Red Mountain Pass, nestled in a cozy cabin overlooking the forest expanse, sat Dr. Elias Thorne, his weathered face lit by the flickering flames of the fireplace. He was known as "Doc" to everyone who crossed paths with him - a quiet, unassuming man whose presence radiated a calm confidence and an unshakeable sense of duty.  Tonight, however, he felt anything but calm. A heavy knot of worry sat in his stomach as he looked at the stack of recent reports on his desk, each one depicting another tragic accident - an overturned RV, a fallen tree blocking a narrow trail, a car crash that left two young lives irrevocably changed. The emergency calls kept ringing, and every new tone felt like a hammer blow to his heart. He was weary, but he knew he couldn't stop. There were people depending on him, and Doc Thorne wouldnâ€™t let them down.
