The air hung thick with humidity and the heady scent of lilies in Florence's Petal & Bloom. She was surrounded by a cacophony of life - the chirping crickets outside, the gentle buzz of bees trapped between blooms, the staccato rhythm of her coworker, Marco, as he arranged roses with practiced precision.  Florence, however, felt like she was caught in a static moment, rooted to the spot beneath the cascading weight of orchids. Her name – Florence Aurora de la Cruz – felt heavy on her tongue. 

It had been three years since Marco's family-owned the flower shop next door and three years since she’d moved in after his grandfather left it to her.  He was as much a part of Petal & Bloom now as the scent of lilies, the floral tapestry that adorned its walls. His father had passed years ago, leaving him with an unwavering responsibility for the shop, yet a yearning to fill the void within. 

The shop windows were a silent testament to Florence's anxieties – each arrangement was a carefully curated expression of her own unspoken feelings. The vibrant pink roses, like the blush on Marco's cheeks, spoke of love and hope; while the stark black calla lilies whispered of grief and resilience.  But all this remained hidden beneath the facade of an ordinary florist, hiding the tempest within.
