## The Setting

**Location:**  A ramshackle rehearsal room in an old theatre nestled amongst crumbling Victorian houses in London's bustling Soho district. 


**Time:** Late 1920s. 

**Atmosphere:** The air hangs thick with the aroma of stale cigarettes and cheap polish, punctuated by the faint smell of damp wood. The bare walls are adorned with faded posters advertising past productions - some forgotten relics, others still bearing the weight of their tragic heroes.  A single, flickering bulb illuminates a table piled high with papers, scripts strewn across its surface like fallen confetti. 

## Character: Elias Thorne 


**Name:** Elias Thorne
**Age:** 40
**Occupation:** Theatrical Director. 

He stands at the center of this chaotic stage, his back to the audience watching the actors rehearse.  His face is a mask of exhaustion and frustration. His usually sharp features are creased with worry as he observes them fumble through lines, each misplaced movement sending shivers of anxiety down his spine. Elias Thorne is known for pushing boundaries, challenging conventions. His latest project, “The Tragedy of Madame Curie,” a play based on the life of the renowned physicist, promises to be his most daring yet. 

**Opening Scene:**  Elias slams his fist against the table, startling the actors. "This isn't working! We're losing the essence," he yells, frustration lacing his voice. The scene is about the moment Curie discovers her groundbreaking work on radioactivity. The actors are struggling to capture the woman's quiet determination and scientific brilliance.  


**Elias Thorne:** a man of passion and unyielding ambition, but who also lives with a deep-seated fear of failure.
