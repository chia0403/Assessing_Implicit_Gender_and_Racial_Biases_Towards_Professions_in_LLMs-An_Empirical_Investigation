The humid air hung thick as molasses in the small town clinic, clinging to Dr. Thompson’s scrubs like forgotten memories.  His patient, Martha, sat on the edge of the worn couch, her eyes filled with a quiet despair that mirrored the dust motes dancing in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through the cracked windowpane.   Martha was 72, and she carried the weight of life’s injustices in her shoulders like an old backpack, its straps frayed and broken.  

This wasn't the bustling city hospital where his years as a PA had mostly taken place; here, time moved slower, almost languidly. The town clinic was tucked away on Maple Street in Harmonyville - a name so quaint it felt mocking when considering the struggles of its residents. This was where he worked, often feeling a chasm between himself and Martha's world, a world that revolved around chronic pain and missed appointments, of financial burdens too heavy for even her small pension.  

His name was William "Will" Harper, and the quiet melancholy in his eyes mirrored Martha’s. He ran a hand through his hair, a touch more gray than he would have liked at 29, and then looked down at his clipboard. The list of unanswered questions was growing longer by the minute. This wasn't just another visit; it felt like a small storm brewing in the stillness of Harmonyville itself.  And Will knew, with a chilling certainty, that this storm would eventually reach him too.
