Rain hammered against the attic windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne's childhood home, mirroring the relentless drumming in her chest. Dust motes danced in the shafts of grey light that pierced through cracks in the boarded-up roof vents. Ellie stood before a crumbling porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly out from a cracked and faded dress.  She could almost hear the whispers of forgotten voices swirling around the dusty room, each one a ghost of a life lived and lost.

Ellie wasn't supposed to be here. Not after what happened, not after everything. She was a clinical psychologist, adept at dissecting human complexities in her office with sanitized white walls and sterile smiles, but now she felt raw, exposed, like the fragile doll itself.  The weight of her past pressed down on her, an oppressive silence punctuated only by the storm's fury outside. This abandoned attic held secrets that whispered and stirred the past into a living nightmare â€“ memories Ellie desperately tried to bury beneath the weight of her carefully constructed professional persona.
