## The Song of Sawdust and Dreams

The air in the workshop hung heavy with the scent of pine and sawdust. Not just from yesterday's project, but also from the years that had passed through every plank, every hinge, every nail hammered into the rough-hewn wood.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight spilling through the tall window, illuminating Elias Thorne's worn face as he leaned over his workbench. 

Elias, a man whose hands were gnarled and calloused like ancient oak, was known for crafting pieces so beautiful they seemed to sing. He wasn't just a carpenter; he was an artisan, weaving wood into stories that whispered of the lives built upon them - sturdy kitchens, cozy nooks in forgotten cottages, grand staircases leading to dreams untold. Tonight, though, Elias found his mind elsewhere.  He could feel the pulse of something different, a rhythm born not from wood but from a deeper longing â€“ the rhythm of love lost, of promises unmade, of a life he'd almost lived.  

The old clock on the wall chimed midnight. The sound, usually a comforting lullaby for Elias, seemed to echo with an unsettling weight tonight. He closed his eyes, picturing her face - luminous beneath the moonlit sky, with a smile that could melt a heart as stubborn as the finest oak.
