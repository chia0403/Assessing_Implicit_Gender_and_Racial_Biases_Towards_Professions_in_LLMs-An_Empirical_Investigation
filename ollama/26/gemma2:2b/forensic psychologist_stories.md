Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Thorne's office, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of light like a miniature supernova. The sterile white walls, usually so calming, now felt suffocatingly bright. Eve ran her fingers through her salt-and-pepper hair, frustration simmering beneath her usual calm facade.  Across from her, the victim’s family wept silently, their grief palpable in the air. 

The young man's face, frozen in a perpetual state of terror, stared back at her from the stark canvas of his autopsy report. "David Miller," it read, the name scrawled in bold letters like a challenge. David was not only the latest victim of the city’s escalating serial killer case - the “Raven,” as they called him - but he was also someone she knew. 

Eve had known David since childhood when her own family moved into their quiet cul-de-sac, his laughter echoing in the playground where Eve would spend hours chasing butterflies with a borrowed kite. Now, years later, the boy who once dreamt of becoming an astronaut, a future that seemed so limitless, was reduced to a mangled corpse, victims' families shattered by grief, and her own mind struggling with the weight of unanswered questions. 

The city had never felt more suffocating, every street corner echoing the unspoken fear that clung to them like dust on old photographs. Eve felt trapped, pulled between the icy logic of science and the warmth of a childhood memory she couldn't quite escape. In her hands lay not just David’s story, but the key to cracking open the case, unraveling the mystery of the Raven, and perhaps finding some semblance of peace for herself in the process.
