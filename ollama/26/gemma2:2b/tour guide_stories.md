## The Whispering Sands

The scorching desert wind whipped Amelia's hair around her face as she adjusted her wide-brimmed hat, its brim shielding her eyes from the relentless glare of the midday sun. A thin layer of dust coated everything - the weathered sandstone cliffs that rose like ancient giants in the distance, the faded turquoise caravan tents behind the dusty market square, even the familiar folds of Amelia's worn leather jacket. This was Al-Qamar, the Land of Seven Stars, and for the past decade she’d been its only storyteller, weaving tales of forgotten history and shimmering magic through the endless expanse. 

Today, her tour group - a motley crew of travelers from across the globe – were clustered at the foot of a towering rock formation known as "The Watcher." As Amelia began to narrate the legends that clung to this ancient place, a faint sound pierced the quietude: a low hum, almost like whispers carried on the wind. 

"Legend has it," Amelia murmured, her eyes gleaming with excitement, "that this very rock holds secrets older than time itself. Secrets whispered by the stars themselves."  She took a deep breath and began her tale.  "Now, who can tell me what they hear?"
