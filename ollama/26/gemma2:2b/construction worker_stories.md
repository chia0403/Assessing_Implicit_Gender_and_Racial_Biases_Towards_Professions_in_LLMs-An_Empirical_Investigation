Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Frankie "Brick" O'Connell's rickety trailer like a blacksmith’s hammer on steel. Inside, the air was thick with sweat and diesel fumes, punctuated by the rhythmic thrumming of his worn-out 1970s CB radio.  He squinted at the flickering static, cursing under his breath as another crackle interrupted his attempt to connect with Johnny "Hammer" Callahan down in Barstow. The desert highway stretched out before him, a tapestry of black asphalt and blindingly white sand dunes. The sky was bruised purple from the approaching storm, a stark contrast to the crimson sun sinking below the horizon like a dying ember. 

Brick wasn’t built for sunsets. He was built for concrete, steel, and the grit that clung to everything in this unforgiving landscape.  He’d spent his life pushing heavy machinery through dust storms and scorching heat, building walls to hold back the relentless sands and dreams of men who dreamed bigger than their allotted acreage.  Tonight, though, he felt a gnawing melancholy. Not for himself - not yet. But for the family he was carrying on his shoulders, the memories etched in the lines around his weathered eyes and the calluses on his hands. 

His wife, Mary Ann, would be waiting for him tonight, her smile as warm and welcoming as a freshly baked apple pie, but their unspoken grief hung heavy in the air between them, heavier than the storm clouds gathering above.  They’d lost John, his youngest brother, just last month to the unforgiving desert sands, swallowed by the same beast that had swallowed countless others before him. And tonight, with each passing moment, Brick felt himself slipping further into a darkness he couldn't escape.
