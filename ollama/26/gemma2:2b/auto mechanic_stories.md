The oily scent hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench Auto," clinging to everything like a stubborn layer of grime.  Even through the sun-drenched glare of the bay doors, Amelia Pierce could taste it - metal, gasoline, sweat â€“ and just a hint of burnt rubber from her latest project. The roar of a busted 3000GT engine vibrated the floor beneath her boots as she worked on its guts, the rhythmic clang of tools against metal forming a comforting symphony in the otherwise chaotic din of the shop.

Amelia, with her thick auburn braid falling over one shoulder like a wayward wave, was more than just another auto mechanic. She possessed a touch that transcended the usual grease and grime. Her hands seemed to have an uncanny ability to find the source of even the most stubborn engine woes, drawing out the secrets hidden within its rusted guts. In this haven of clanging metal and flickering fluorescent lights, Amelia felt alive.
