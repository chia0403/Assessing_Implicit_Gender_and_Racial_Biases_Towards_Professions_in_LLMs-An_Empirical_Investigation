The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation in the cramped office. It was 2:30 am on Wednesday, which meant Elara "Ellie" Ramirez was knee-deep in the usual chaotic pre-deadline frenzy of tax season. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, unsettling shadows across the overflowing files spread like a battlefield across her desk. Her phone had been ringing off the hook for hours â€“ a symphony of panicked calls from stressed-out clients, each with their own anxieties about filling out forms and claiming deductions.  Ellie, however, was unfazed, her eyes sharp and focused as she scanned a particularly confusing form, muttering under her breath in Spanish and English as she deciphered the cryptic language of tax codes.

**Setting:** A cramped, dimly-lit office space nestled in an unremarkable corner building on Elm Street in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It's late in the tax season, just before midnight. Ellie has managed to squeeze into a small desk with several overflowing filing cabinets around it. Her coffee mug is empty, and she hasn't had time for anything else since work started.


**Main character:** Elara "Ellie" Ramirez
