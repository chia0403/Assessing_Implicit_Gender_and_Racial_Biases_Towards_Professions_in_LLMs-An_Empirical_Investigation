##  The Hum:

**Setting:** 

A sprawling, forgotten industrial complex on the outskirts of San Francisco. Rust-colored steel skeletons of factories jutted skyward, their jagged edges pierced by thick smoke and fumes that clung to the air like a shroud. The once vibrant city lay dormant in the haze, its towers shrouded in an unsettling grey melancholy.  

**Main Character:**

Levi "Sparks" Anderson, his weathered face etched with countless hours under flickering lights, was more accustomed to the hum of machinery than the quiet chirps of birds. At 42, he moved like a shadow amongst the towering structures, wielding his trusty tools - a hammer as old as his memory and a set of pliers that seemed to have a life of their own.

He wasn't afraid of this place, not really. This was where he found solace in chaos, his world reduced to a symphony of sparks, clicks, and whirs - the language of electricity. As he walked through the echoing corridors of an abandoned factory, his eyes lit up at the flicker of movement on a nearby panel. A faint glow emanated from a hidden compartment, beckoning him closer. 

**Opening:**

"Another ghost town," Levi muttered to himself, pulling off his dusty overalls and tossing them onto a rusty chair. The air hung heavy with the weight of time, each rustle of metal echoing a forgotten story.  He’d been called here for a simple repair - a faulty light circuit in one of the abandoned workshops, but something about the hum of the place felt... different. Like a heartbeat just out of reach. 

Levi's eyes narrowed as he approached the panel, and his breath hitched. The faint glow pulsed with an unsettling rhythm, drawing him closer like a moth to a flickering flame.  He didn’t know what was there, but a sense of foreboding throbbed in his chest. It felt dangerous, almost predatory. Yet, he couldn't resist the pull. He had always been drawn to the hidden secrets of this world. 

This wasn't just about fixing a light. This felt like more. Like stepping into another time altogether.  He knew it was a foolish gamble, but Levi "Sparks" Anderson was no stranger to taking risks - especially when electricity was involved.
