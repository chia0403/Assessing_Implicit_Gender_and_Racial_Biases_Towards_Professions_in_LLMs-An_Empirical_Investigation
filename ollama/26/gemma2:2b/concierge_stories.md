The sprawling foyer of the Astoria Hotel shimmered under the soft glow of stained glass lamps, each piece an intricate mosaic of history.  A faint scent of old paper and freshly baked pastries clung to the air, a comforting familiarity for any weary traveler seeking refuge from the city's ceaseless buzz. Here, amongst the polished marble floors and velvet-draped armchairs, resided Edgar Worthington, the concierge with eyes as sharp as his tailored suits. 

Edgar's days were filled with whispered secrets and urgent inquiries. From arranging clandestine meetings in opulent suites to discreetly sourcing rare antiques for wealthy collectors, he was a silent conductor of Manhattan's hidden symphony.  Tonight, however, felt different. A storm raged outside, mirroring the churning tempest within Edgar himself. The arrival of Madame Delacroix – a Parisian artist known for her audacious creations and even more scandalous affairs – had thrown him off-balance. He'd witnessed her arrive, a whirlwind of crimson silk and defiant eyes, leaving an indelible impression on his already weary soul.  Edgar knew their meeting would be anything but ordinary.
