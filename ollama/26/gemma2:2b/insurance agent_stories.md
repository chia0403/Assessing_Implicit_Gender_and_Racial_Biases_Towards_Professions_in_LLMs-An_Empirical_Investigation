The humid air hung heavy in the San Francisco office, clinging to Arthur Sterling like a damp blanket. It had been an unusually sweltering summer in the city, a fact that seemed to be amplifying the already pervasive tension within his own mind. The phone on his desk buzzed, its insistent chirps adding another layer of discord to the usual cacophony of his life - car horns honking, distant sirens wailing, the rhythmic clanging of office machinery in the background.

The question gnawed at his soul like a persistent itch, demanding a response, begging for answers –  answers he didn't have yet.
