## Story Opening

**Setting:**  The sprawling estate known as Blackwood Manor, nestled within the misty moors of Yorkshire, England.  A storm raged outside, wind whipping through gnarled oak trees that clawed at the manor house like skeletal fingers. Inside, however, a quiet warmth emanated from the kitchen hearth.

**Main Character:**  Arthur Pendragon, a man weathered by years of sun and rain, whose hands were calloused but gentle, tended to the gardens he considered an extension of his soul. He was known to be a stoic figure, more comfortable amongst the rustling leaves and whispering wind than in any human gathering. 

**Opening Scene:**  Arthur stood on the dew-kissed lawn, surveying the manicured lawns and overflowing flower beds. A single raindrop clung precariously to his brow as he inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle a comforting balm against the encroaching storm's fury.  He was about to head back inside when a figure materialized from the swirling mist, a spectral woman draped in black silk that swirled like a mourning veil. Her face, obscured by an intricate mask, held an unnerving calm amidst the chaos of the storm.

"Arthur," she whispered, her voice echoing eerily through the air, "The manor house is calling."
