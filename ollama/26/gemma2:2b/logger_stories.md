## The Rusting Sawdust:

The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth.  It clung to Elias 'Old Iron' Hemlock like the very shadow of the towering redwoods heâ€™d carved his entire life from.  His hand, gnarled and callused from years spent wielding a saw as powerful as an axe, gripped the worn handle of his chainsaw.  He felt the familiar tug against his ribs, the pulse that echoed in time with each rotation of the chain.

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the redwood sky in hues of fire-orange and bruised purple, as Elias surveyed his domain. The North Fork Logging Company was a symphony of industry, fueled by grit and the ancient rhythm of the woods.  Yet today, it felt strangely subdued, the normally boisterous chatter of men replaced with an unsettling silence. 

Elias' gaze fell on the old mill, its wooden bones groaning under the weight of history. The steel gears that once roared to life seemed frozen in time. The dust motes danced in the fading light, swirling like phantoms around his worn boots.  He felt a tremor run through him, a feeling he couldn't quite name, as if something was shifting beneath the surface of this familiar world.
