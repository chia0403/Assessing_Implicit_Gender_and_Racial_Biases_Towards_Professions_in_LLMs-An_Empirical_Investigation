## Story Opening & Setting

**Character:**  Dr. Evelyn Thorne, a brilliant but perpetually skeptical astrophysicist specializing in black holes, with a thirst for understanding beyond the boundaries of known physics. 

**Setting:** The sprawling, dimly lit lab of the Institute for Extraterrestrial Research (IER) in remote Iceland. The crisp winter air outside is punctuated by the howling wind as snow falls silently against the laboratory's large, panoramic windows that offer a breathtaking view of the Northern Lights dancing across the endless sky. 

**Opening Paragraph:**  Dr. Evelyn Thorne stood hunched over her workbench, her brow furrowed with intense concentration. The flickering glow of the monitor displayed an intricate map of the recently discovered anomaly - a pulsating black hole at the heart of a distant galaxy that defied all known physics. Years of tireless research and countless sleepless nights had led to this moment: a breakthrough that could shatter everything they thought they knew about the universe, or lead to their downfall. The pressure was immense, yet Evelyn found solace in her unwavering pursuit of truth - a pursuit she believed would ultimately unveil the secrets of existence itself. 


**Optional additions:**
* **Conflict:**  The discovery has triggered an ethical dilemma: should this anomaly be explored and studied, knowing its potential for disrupting the very fabric of reality? 
* **Character's Dilemma:** Evelyn grapples with the allure of this unknown universe while also fearing what it might unleash. Does her thirst for knowledge outweigh the risks?
* **Internal Conflict:**   Evelyn may have past demons she struggles to overcome: a former colleague who died mysteriously in an experiment related to black holes, or a fear of the dark and the infinite unknown that fuels her ambition.
