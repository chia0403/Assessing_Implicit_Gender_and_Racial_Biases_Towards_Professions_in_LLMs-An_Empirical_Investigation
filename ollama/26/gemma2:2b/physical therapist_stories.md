The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the gym's old linoleum floor was Amelia Thorne's only solace. It matched the steady pulse drumming in her own chest, a rhythm so familiar it seemed to hum with the weight of the day's expectations.  As she moved through the room, carefully maneuvering a patient’s gait trainer and adjusting the weight settings on a resistance machine, a storm brewed outside. Amelia, however, was consumed by her patients – their struggles, their triumphs, and the subtle but significant shifts that marked progress. 

It was this quiet battleground of muscles, tendons, and nerves she thrived in. She was known as "Thorne" to most, an informal title earned through years of dedicated work. Amelia Thorne was a physical therapist who believed in more than just fixing broken bodies; she wanted to understand the human spirit behind every movement. 

The sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the room. Outside, the storm roared, mirroring the tension within her own soul – an unspoken unease about the new patient assigned to her this week.  His name was Thomas, and he had walked in carrying a weight too heavy for his frail frame, both literally and metaphorically.  His case, Amelia knew, threatened to push her beyond the boundaries of therapy she once believed so firmly defined.
