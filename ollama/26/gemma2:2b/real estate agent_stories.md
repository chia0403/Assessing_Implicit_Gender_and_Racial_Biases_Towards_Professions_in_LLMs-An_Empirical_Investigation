The salty wind whipped Amelia Bell's auburn hair across her face as she leaned heavily against the railing of the pier, its rusted chains groaning beneath her weight.  She squinted at the horizon, hoping to catch another glimpse of the shimmering silver that was supposedly an endless horizon of opportunity.  This wasn’t exactly the idyllic beach scene she imagined when selling million-dollar waterfront properties in Newport Beach. 

Amelia adjusted the bright pink baseball cap perched on her head, the one her Aunt Martha insisted she “had to embrace” as a symbol of her burgeoning "girl boss" persona. It was more about keeping her hair out of her face than anything else; the wind had been surprisingly fierce for this time of year. 

Her heart sank.  The sun was already dipping below the horizon, painting the ocean with streaks of orange and purple that seemed mockingly optimistic.  This wasn’t her first rodeo – selling real estate in Southern California was just another day at the office for Amelia. But today felt different. Today, she had a gut feeling that this new property, nestled on the edge of a quiet beach town in Malibu… well, something was off. A chill ran down her spine as a rogue wave crashed against the pier, sending a spray of seawater across her face.
