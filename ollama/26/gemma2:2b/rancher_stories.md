The wind whipped around Jebediah "Jeb" Stone's worn Stetson as he surveyed his cattle herd grazing on the parched Wyoming plains. The sun, sinking towards the horizon like a molten orange orb, cast long shadows across the dusty landscape. The air, heavy with the smell of sagebrush and desperation, felt thick enough to cut with a knife. Jeb ran a calloused hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, his eyes fixed on the struggling animals, each one burdened by an ever-increasing sense of worry.

Jeb had been raising cattle in these harsh mountains for over three decades. The land was as unforgiving as its namesake -  the Yellowstone Plateau.  Yet, he'd never known such profound loneliness as he felt today. His wife, Martha, had passed away two years ago, leaving him with the weight of their legacy on his shoulders and a heart riddled with grief.

The days were stretching into weeks, each one filled with the monotonous rhythm of feeding, tending to fences, and battling against the unforgiving elements. A harsh drought had gripped the region, turning once vibrant green pastures into skeletal wastelands.  The land was groaning under its own weight, and Jeb felt it too, his spirit heavy with the burden of losing control.
