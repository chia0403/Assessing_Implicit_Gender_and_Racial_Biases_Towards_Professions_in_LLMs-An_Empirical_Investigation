The air in Granite Cove was thick with dust and the tang of lime, as perpetually damp as a forgotten well. It clung to Elias Blackwoodâ€™s worn overalls like ivy, clinging to his weathered face too.  Granite Cove wasn't a place for fancy talk, only for men who knew their tools and wielded them with a quiet grace born from years spent in its unforgiving embrace. Today, however, Elias felt a tremor he couldn't quite explain, a sudden unease that ran deeper than the cold draft whistling through the open doorway of his workshop.

Elias was known for his work - his hands, strong as oak roots and calloused like the finest sandstone, could carve beauty from stone with such precision it seemed almost magical. His apprentices, wide-eyed and eager to learn, would marvel at how he'd turn rough blocks into towering sculptures, their eyes reflecting a youthful awe at the sheer power of creation. But today, Elias felt burdened by an unseen weight. His gaze fell upon the freshly carved lion that sat on his workbench, its mane a rippling wave of white stone. The creature seemed to mock him with its regal calm, its expression frozen in a silent scream.
