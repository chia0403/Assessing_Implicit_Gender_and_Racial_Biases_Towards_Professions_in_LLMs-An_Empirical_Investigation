## Setting: 

The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across Dr. Julian Thorne's cramped office in Asheville, North Carolina. A small stream murmurs nearby, its melody blending with the gentle hum of the ceiling fan as it tries to counteract the humid summer air. Outside, vibrant mountain wildflowers paint a tapestry against the green canvas of pine trees. 

## Story Opening:

Dr. Julian Thorne stared at the crumpled piece of paper clutched in his hand. The ink blurred, the lines blurring into an indistinguishable mess that echoed the turmoil within him.  "It's just paperwork," he muttered to himself, tapping the pen against his chipped office table. "How could it be so… complicated?" 

The letter was a formality, a request for records from a family of four facing eviction in their small mountain home. It had arrived that morning, accompanied by a wave of unease washing over him as he read it through the familiar anxieties of an aging, often-stressed chiropractor. But what troubled Julian more than the mere act of navigating this bureaucratic maze was the stark reality that his hands could hold nothing but a sterile pen and paper after years spent bending, adjusting, and caring for those who sought him out for relief from physical ailments.  

The irony wasn't lost on him. He himself was burdened by a growing ailment – the gnawing feeling of helplessness against the backdrop of seemingly unyielding social structures that forced families to their knees.
