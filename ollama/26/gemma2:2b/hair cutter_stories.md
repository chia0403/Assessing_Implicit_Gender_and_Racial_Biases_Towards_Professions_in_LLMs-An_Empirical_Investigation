## The Cutting Room 

The air hung thick with coconut oil and lavender as Elara "Ellie" Sanchez smoothed down her white apron, its crispness mirroring the pristine white walls of "The Shearling."  It was the kind of place that felt like it'd been plucked from a vintage travel brochure – an old-fashioned salon tucked away on a quiet street in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district. 

Ellie adjusted her thick, black glasses perched atop her nose and surveyed her handiwork: an overflowing station stocked with every kind of hair clip imaginable, jars of vibrant dyes, and a plethora of antique scissors. It was a far cry from the sleek minimalist salons she'd once worked in, but Ellie loved this place, its chaos and quiet charm just as much as she loved the unique stories that unfolded within her carefully crafted space.
