## Story Opening

The neon "Open" sign buzzed its cheerful tune above Amelia's head as she adjusted her glasses. It was almost 8 pm, a late hour for any kind of meal in New Harmony, Vermont - a town where the concept of "fast food" had been invented solely to confuse the sheep shearing contests. A slight drizzle pattered against the windowpane of "The Healthy Harvest," Amelia's beloved health food cafe. Inside, the aroma of freshly-brewed chai lingered alongside cinnamon rolls and roasted vegetables.  

Amelia, with her neatly braided hair and a perpetually concerned expression on her face, surveyed the scene: patrons hunched over steaming bowls of lentil soup, teenagers chatting boisterously over protein smoothies, and elderly couples exchanging quiet smiles as they shared a plate of homemade granola. 

It was this very haven of wholesome living that had drawn Amelia here five years ago - after her own chaotic childhood, filled with food fads and diet wars. She'd vowed to build a space where healthy eating wasn't just another "should" on a list of "things-to-do." It was about nourishment, community, and genuine human connection over the endless cycle of deprivation and indulgence.
