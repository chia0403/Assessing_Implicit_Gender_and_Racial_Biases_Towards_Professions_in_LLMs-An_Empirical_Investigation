The air hung thick with the scent of hairspray and lavender shampoo as Evelyn adjusted the silver clips on her client's bobbed hair.  Her nimble fingers danced across the strands, teasing them away from her forehead and securing them in place, while a silent melody played softly from the radio tucked behind the register. Outside, the rain hammered against the windows of "Hairitage Salon", turning the street into an unruly tapestry of gray water. 

Evelyn sighed, a weary rumble that went unnoticed by the woman across the sink, busy chattering away about her niece's upcoming wedding. Evelyn had been cutting hair for nearly twenty years, yet the routine never quite escaped its grip. Every cut, every color, every conversation was a thread in a tapestry woven with the mundane and the magical. 

Evelyn glanced at her reflection: a tired furrow etched on her brow under the silver streaks she'd dyed into her graying mane.  She ran a hand through it, smoothing down the unruly strands while remembering the promise she made to herself that day, when she was but a girl with dreams bigger than her small-town existence. "Evelyn Price," she muttered aloud, "Iâ€™ll have my own salon."
