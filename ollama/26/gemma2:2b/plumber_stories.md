The rain was coming down in sheets, each drop exploding like miniature fireworks on the warped metal roof of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's van. He sat hunched over his battered coffee mug, its contents already cold and forgotten. Outside, the world seemed to be screaming in defiance against the unrelenting torrent. Yet, within the warmth of his cramped, water-stained office inside the van, Barty was trapped in a different kind of storm: the internal tempest of frustration that only comes with an overflowing toilet tank, the wrong size wrench, and a customer who insists on paying in Monopoly money. 

Barty wiped his grimy hands on his apron and sighed, watching the rain etch grotesque patterns on his windshield. He was barely thirty years old, but already carrying the weight of decades more than he'd ever planned to.  The leaky faucet in Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s kitchen had started as a minor inconvenience, an annoyance that turned into a relentless battle against the forces of nature and, apparently, her rather stubborn pet goldfish. Now, a full week later, it seemed like his life was permanently stained with rust-colored water stains.
