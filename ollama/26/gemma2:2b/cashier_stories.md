Rain hammered against the diner's windows, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a flickering silhouette. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying grease and stale coffee, a scent that Amelia usually found comforting. However, tonight, even the familiar warmth felt oppressive.  She leaned heavily on the counter, her eyes tracing the chipped paint beneath the fluorescent lights as she waited for her shift to start. 

Her name was Amelia Rose Thorne, but most called her "Mel" – an easy nickname, fitting considering the perpetually tired and worn look of her usual face. After years of working at 'The Diner',  it had become etched with lines, a reflection not just of time but of countless late nights and early mornings spent behind the counter, serving coffee to hungry truckers, gossiping with lonely travelers, and witnessing the slow-burn drama unfold in the small town of Oakhaven. Tonight, however, she was drowning in something altogether different – an ocean of quiet unease that seemed to seep through every corner of the diner, from the sticky tables to the worn booths.
