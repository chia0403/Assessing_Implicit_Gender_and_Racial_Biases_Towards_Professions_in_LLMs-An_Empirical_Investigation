The whirring of the centrifuge filled the air, a symphony of white noise that echoed through the sterile white walls of Mercy General's lab.  Across from Evelyn "Ellie" Hawthorne’s station was a young man barely out of his teens, clutching the worn leather-bound diary in his hand. His pale face was etched with anxiety, eyes darting nervously between Ellie and the blood draw machine, a mechanical spider poised to suck life away. The smell of antiseptic, always potent but this time oddly overwhelming, hung heavy in the air. 

Ellie ran her fingers over the familiar curve of the glass vial she'd used countless times before. It was almost hypnotic, its smooth surface mirroring the anxieties swirling around her like the tiny specks of blood on the lab coat draped over her chair.  The quiet hum of the machines and the rhythmic tap of Ellie’s foot against the linoleum floor formed a constant rhythm in this silent room. Outside, the city bustled with life, but inside the lab's glass walls, time itself seemed to slow down.
