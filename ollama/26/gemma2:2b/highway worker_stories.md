The sun beat down on Dale "Dusty" Dalton's weathered face as he knelt by the cracked asphalt, patching up a leak that seemed determined to never stay dry. He squinted at the horizon, where the sky was already turning the burnt orange of an approaching sunset. Dust Devils danced across the plains, swirling like phantom phantoms against the fading light.  A sigh escaped his lips, mingling with the scent of gasoline and asphalt. "Just another day on the road," he muttered to himself, the phrase as familiar and worn as the canvas gloves covering his hands. 

The small town of Dust Hollow clung to a desolate stretch of Route 66 like a barnacle to a ship. The only other sounds besides the wind whistling through broken pipes on the highway were the rhythmic hum of Daleâ€™s truck and the distant, mournful call of an eagle circling overhead.  It was a place where time seemed to stop on its own terms and the past clung to the present like dust motes in a beam of light.
