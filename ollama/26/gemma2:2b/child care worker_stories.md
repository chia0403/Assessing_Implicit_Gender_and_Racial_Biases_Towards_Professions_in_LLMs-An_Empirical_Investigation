The morning light filtered through the blinds, casting long shadows across the worn playroom floor.  A gentle hum filled the air as Ms. Evelyn Thornhill prepared for another day at "Tiny Treasures" - a cozy daycare nestled in the heart of Maplewood. Today, however, a different kind of shadow lingered over the usual cheerful chaos. A small girl with pigtails and freckles, Lily Thompson, sat slumped against the colorful beanbag chair, her head buried in her knees. 

Evelyn gently coaxed Lily to talk, her warm smile a beacon of comfort in the otherwise somber atmosphere. "Lily-bear," she whispered, brushing away a tear on Lily's cheek, "tell me what's troubling your little heart."  The silence that followed was thick and heavy, broken only by the rhythmic creaking of the swing set outside. It was as though even the children's toys knew something was amiss, their usual playful chatter stifled, replaced with an ominous stillness.
