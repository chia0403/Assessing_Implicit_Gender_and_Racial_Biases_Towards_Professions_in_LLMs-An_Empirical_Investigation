## Setting: 

A desolate seaside town named Saltwind, where fog rolls in like sorrow and the salty air holds whispers of forgotten dreams. The year is 1948. The Great Depression has left its mark on every face here, etched deep with worry and resignation. Buildings stand hunched and grey against the relentless sea wind, their windows mirroring the hollowed eyes of the townsfolk. A single lighthouse flickers in the distance, a lonely beacon in the vast emptiness.

## Character: 

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne, a woman whose spirit was as strong as the oak trees that lined the town's only park, yet her smile had faded under the weight of the last few years. A sharp intellect and an even sharper wit, Ellie had always found solace in treating people â€“ not just physically but emotionally too. Now, trapped by obligations she felt were far greater than her own life, she was forced to see the town's suffering as her own burden. 


## Opening Scene:

The bell above the door of Hawthorne's Clinic chimed with a mournful echo. Ellie turned from the pile of medical records on her desk and surveyed the scene before her. The only other occupant was young Thomas, his head bowed under the weight of his own sorrows, his pale face reflecting the grey day outside. 

"Come in, son," Ellie greeted him softly, her voice a soothing balm amidst the town's storm-tossed quietude. "Let me see if I can make sense of this for you."
