The salty air whipped around Theodore "Teddy" Sterling's worn leather apron as he stood before his mirror, his eyes reflecting the hazy glow of the early morning sun that struggled to break through the thick fog rolling in off the coast. The shop, 'Sterling's Scissor & Suds,' was a haven for weary mariners and weathered sailors alike, each with stories carved into their faces and souls etched by long journeys. Teddy, perched on his stool behind the gleaming counter, felt the familiar ache of responsibility settle heavy upon him as he surveyed his canvas: the smooth, wide face of young Thomas, a new arrival with hands too rough for the delicate trim he'd requested, waiting patiently on the opposite end of the shop.

The year was 1882 and San Francisco, battered by the winds of change and whispers of revolution, clung to its history like a fading tapestry. The fog, a constant companion, whispered secrets of forgotten times as it swirled around Teddy's barbershop, where stories were traded in exchange for a quiet shave or a clean-shaven smirk.
