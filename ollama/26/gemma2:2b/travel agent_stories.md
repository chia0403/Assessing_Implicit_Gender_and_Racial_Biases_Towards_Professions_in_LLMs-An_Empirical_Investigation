The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of saltwater and melting coconut sunscreen. Amelia "Amy" Nightingale wiped away sweat from her forehead, squinting at the map sprawled across her desk in the sweltering office. The faded outline of the world had been meticulously scratched out multiple times. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam –  each destination a tempting but fleeting dream she’d been pushing back on for months. 

"I just need to find the right balance," Amy muttered to herself, pacing in front of the window.  She was an expert at crafting perfect trips - from secluded rainforest retreats to bustling city explorations. But even her meticulousness couldn't bridge the chasm between her wanderlust and her responsibilities as a travel agent. 
 
The setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange, pink, and purple – a vibrant reflection of the dreams simmering within Amy, yearning to be set free from the confines of the office. The air hummed with the sound of cicadas, their chorus a hypnotic counterpoint to the ticking clock on her wall.  Amy needed an adventure. An escape – or perhaps, just an all-out vacation.
