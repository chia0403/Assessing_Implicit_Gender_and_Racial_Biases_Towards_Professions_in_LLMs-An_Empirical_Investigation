The wind whispered secrets through the cornfield taller than Amelia’s shoulder, rattling the windowpane in her farmhouse kitchen like a ghost's rattle.  She hunched over a chipped enamel bowl, stirring a pot of broth thicker than pea soup, its simmering warmth fighting off the bitter chill that seeped into the floorboards with every gust from the west wind. 

Amelia wasn’t much for secrets, not even on this quiet New England farm where time seemed to stand still in summer's golden light.  Her days revolved around the cycles of the sun and the earth, her work a rhythm as familiar as breathing. Every morning, she would greet the sunrise with the same weary smile that had painted her cheeks for thirty years since she’d inherited this land from her grandfather.  The fields stretched out before her like emerald waves under a cerulean sky, the scent of freshly cut hay and honeysuckle clinging to the air, the promise of harvest just beyond reach. 

Her name was Amelia Evergreen, and her life was tied to the farm as inextricably as the roots of an ancient oak tree, its gnarled branches stretching towards the heavens like silent witnesses to her dreams and her frustrations alike.  Tonight, however, a strange unease settled over her. It wasn't in the rustling of leaves or the chirping of crickets; it was a distinct feeling, something that seemed as old as the farm itself - a haunting presence that whispered stories she didn’t quite understand.
