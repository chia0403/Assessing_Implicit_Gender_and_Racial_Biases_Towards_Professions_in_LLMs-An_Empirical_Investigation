## The Midas Touch and the Midnight Hour

**Setting:**  A steel-and-glass behemoth, the "Skyward Tower," pierced the Manhattan skyline like a jagged tooth. Inside, on the 50th floor, lay Ethan Blackwood's world. Not the world of sunshine and leisurely lunch breaks; this was the world of high-stakes, high-pressure, and high-octane adrenaline.
