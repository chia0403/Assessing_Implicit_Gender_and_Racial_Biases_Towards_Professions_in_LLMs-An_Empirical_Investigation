## The Grand Meridian Hotel

**Setting:**  The late 1920s, Chicago. A sleek Art Deco masterpiece, the Grand Meridian Hotel was the city's newest luxury landmark, boasting shimmering chrome, opulent ballrooms, and an air of whispered scandals. Its neon sign buzzed in the wind like a lonely eye, promising glamour and mystery to those who dared enter its walls.

**Main Character:**  Reuben "Rue" Sinclair was a man whose life mirrored the hotel's grandeur – tall, handsome with a smile that could disarm even the steely-eyed men of finance, Rue was everything about elegance until he wasn’t.  His bellhop uniform was pristine, his shoes polished to a mirror shine, but behind those sharp eyes lay a quiet storm of anxieties and unfulfilled dreams. 

**Opening:**  “Another one?” Reuben muttered under his breath as he wrestled a heavy suitcase out of the elevator car. The man in the suit, his tie loosened, mumbled something about an “urgent meeting” and a “quick transfer”.  It was all a blur to Rue - another day, another sea of faces, another attempt at blending into this city's shimmering, unforgiving tide. 
His gaze lingered on the polished mahogany door leading to Room 304. A woman stood in front of it, her face hidden in the shadows. Her hair cascaded like midnight silk down a dress the colour of burnt sienna, and her lips were full like ripe strawberries – a smile that seemed too knowing for Rue's comfort.  He took his cues from this silent invitation, a faint, lingering feeling tugging at him to step closer. This one felt different, something he couldn't quite decipher in the chaotic dance of Chicago nights. 

"Miss?" Reuben's voice was smooth as silk as he spoke, his eyes meeting hers for the briefest moment before she turned away.  "My apologies. Just checking." 


**End Scene:** Rue begins to feel a growing unease; this woman's aura felt both familiar and strange, like someone watching from behind a veil. He was drawn to her, compelled to know more about the secrets hidden within Room 304. What would she reveal?  How would his life be forever changed by one encounter in the Grand Meridian Hotel?
