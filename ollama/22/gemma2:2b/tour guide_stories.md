The early morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets like an ethereal shroud as Elara "El" Thorne adjusted her worn leather satchel. The sun was barely peeking over the rooftops of Prague, painting the sandstone buildings with a golden glow that shimmered off the Vltava River below.  Her heart beat in sync with the rhythmic clang of the city's ancient bell tower, announcing another dawn in this historic labyrinth. El had been a tour guide here for five years now, and the magic of the city always flowed through her veins like the Vltava itself.

"Alright, folks! Let's start our journey with a bang!" El called out to her group, a motley crew of twenty-something travellers from all corners of the globe.  She stood before a cluster of majestic buildings flanking Charles Bridge, their silhouette framed by the rising sun. "Welcome to Prague, where history whispers secrets on every corner."
