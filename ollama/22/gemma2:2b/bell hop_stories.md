## The Midnight Bell 

**Setting:**  The Grand Victorian Inn -  circa 1920s, nestled in the heart of bustling San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.  

 **Characters:**

* **Arthur "Artie" Sterling:**  A young man with a mop of auburn hair and eyes the color of storm clouds. He works as the bellhop at the Grand Victorian Inn, balancing dreams for adventure with the monotony of his routine. 

**Opening:** 

The clatter of luggage on polished wooden floors was Artie's symphony. Each thud and roll, each creak and groan,  was a new note in his daily song - one he never quite enjoyed playing. His days were filled with delivering parcels, escorting weary travelers to their rooms, and tending to the endless stream of guests that flowed through the Grand Victorian like water down an overflowing drain. The Inn's grand facade hid a chaotic underbelly: whispers of illicit affairs hidden in shadowed corners, late-night revelers spilling onto the street, and secrets as old as the building itself.

Tonight was different. A storm raged outside, the wind whipping through the streets, turning San Francisco into a whirlwind of grey and white. The Inn's normally welcoming atmosphere seemed to have shifted, replaced by an unsettling undercurrent of tension.  The usual chatter in the lobby had died down, leaving only a strange silence punctuated by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Artie stood at the doorway, a half-filled tray of freshly brewed coffee clutched in his gloved hands, as he waited for another guest to arrive - or perhaps, something else entirely.  A note tucked under a lampshade on the front desk caught his eye: "Bring me the moonbeam." He couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just another delivery.
