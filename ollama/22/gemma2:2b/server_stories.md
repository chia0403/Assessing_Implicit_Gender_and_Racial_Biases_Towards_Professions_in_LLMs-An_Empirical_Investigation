## The Golden Hour

The humid air hung thick like overripe fruit in the back alley behind "The Rusty Anchor," where Amelia "Amy" Thorne's usually vibrant spirit seemed to be dimming with every passing minute.  It was just before sunset, and the familiar sting of anticipation, mixed with the melancholy weight of her dwindling tips, settled heavy on her shoulders. The city of New Orleans hummed around her; street musicians played a sultry symphony of jazz and blues against the backdrop of boisterous laughter from nearby tables.  

Amy's usual table â€“ usually bustling with tourists looking to escape the sweltering humidity for a taste of genuine charm - was eerily silent. The boisterous chatter she had grown accustomed to now felt like a distant memory, replaced by a chilling stillness that seemed to amplify her anxieties. 

The neon sign above "The Rusty Anchor" buzzed softly in the night air, its glow casting long, distorted shadows on the peeling paint of the building's exterior.  She took another slow sip of iced tea, the bitterness lingering on her tongue like an unwelcome memory. This wasn't how she liked to end her shift.
