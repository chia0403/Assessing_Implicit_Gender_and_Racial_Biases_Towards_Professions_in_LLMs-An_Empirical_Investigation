The crisp autumn air bit at Emilia's cheeks as she walked through the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven. A thin film of condensation clung to her bakery window, swirling like tiny dancing spirits in the fading light.  Inside, the aroma of fresh bread and cinnamon hung heavy, coaxing customers in with promises of warmth and comfort. But for Emilia, tonight held the weight of something else entirely â€“ a sense of foreboding that settled like dust on her already worn apron. The old oak door creaked as she opened it, drawing an impatient sigh from the lone customer waiting inside, a grizzled man with eyes hardened by years. 

"Morning, Ezra," Emilia greeted him, hoping to shift the unease crawling under her skin. "Anything special you're after?"
