The midday sun beat down on Ethan "Sky" Riley's weathered face as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian home before him.  It wasnâ€™t the typical gig for Sky, but his dad had convinced him this project was worth a shot, an inheritance tied up in peeling paint and creaking floorboards that needed a whole new roof. The place looked like it belonged in a dusty portrait painting, with its intricately carved gingerbread trim and turrets reaching towards the sky.  

Sky sighed, pulling his battered hat down over his forehead. It was going to be a long summer. 
 
**Setting:** 

* **Location:** A small, bustling town nestled within a valley in the Appalachian Mountains.
* **Time:** Mid-Summer
* **Atmosphere:** Hot and humid, with a gentle breeze carrying the scent of pine needles and damp earth. The sound of cicadas buzzing fills the air, interrupted by the occasional chirp of a nearby bird.
