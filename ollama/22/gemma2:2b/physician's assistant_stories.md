The rusty clock on the wall chimed midnight, each clang reverberating through Evelyn "Evy" Thorne's tired bones. Rain lashed against the windows of her small apartment in Baltimore, blurring the city lights into smudged constellations. The aroma of damp wood and old books clung to the air, a familiar comfort after another long shift at Mercy Hospital. Tonight was particularly brutal - a double-shift for Evy meant she'd missed her daughter Lily’s birthday party. 

Evy leaned back in her worn armchair, the weight of a full day pressing down on her shoulders. She couldn’t help but glance out the window again. The storm seemed to mirror the chaos inside her: a relentless ache for Lily and the impossible balancing act between her demanding career and the love she yearned for. 
The hospital was bustling with activity as usual, its fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across the sterile walls. A flurry of nurses rushed past Evy, each carrying their own burdens on weary shoulders. She knew all too well that in this place, there wasn't a single soul untouched by the weight of humanity’s struggles. Yet, tonight, the storm felt different. The wind howled outside and inside her heart, a symphony of loneliness echoing with every passing hour.
