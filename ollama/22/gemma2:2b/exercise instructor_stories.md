The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Northwood's head as she surveyed the makeshift gym in the back room of the community center. The usual chaos of the after-school program was replaced with the steady rhythm of clinking weights and grunting exertion emanating from the small group of women huddled on mats scattered throughout the space.  Elara’s own heart pounded a matching beat to that of her pupils, a mix of nervous excitement and the familiar warmth that came with guiding others through their fitness journey. 

Her name was synonymous with "strength building," not just in the sense of physical prowess but also for the unyielding support she instilled in each client. Elara was known for pushing individuals beyond their perceived limits, always urging them to find a new "strength" within themselves – whether that meant conquering an upcoming race or simply learning to carry groceries without complaining about aches and pains.

Tonight's session focused on core strength. Elara knew that despite her focus on bodyweight exercises, many of the women struggled with the basics;  a simple plank could be a battleground for some, let alone the complex movements she planned to introduce.  She straightened a stray strand of hair escaping its bun and smiled reassuringly at her pupils as she adjusted the music playlist, the uplifting tempo already beginning to set the tone.
