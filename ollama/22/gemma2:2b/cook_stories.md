The steam from Agnes's latest batch of apple pie hung heavy in the air, swirling like ghosts around her as she set down the baking sheet on the worn wooden counter.  The scent of cinnamon and nutmeg clung to everything: to her apron, to the flour-dusted countertop, even to the very air itself, a fragrant promise of comfort in the heart of their tiny bakery nestled on the edge of the bustling New England town of Oakhaven. 

Agnes sighed. Another day, another stack of orders for wedding cakes and birthday pastries. It wasn't glamorous work, not by any stretch. But her family had run this bakery since before Agnes could remember, its cozy atmosphere a quiet beacon of warmth and tradition amidst the whirlwind of daily life. It was her lifeblood, even when the endless churn of dough and sugar made her feel like sheâ€™d been swallowed whole by flour-dust demons. 

Tonight, however, Agnes craved something more. Tonight, the air thrummed with a different kind of energy - the kind that hinted at change, of possibilities stretching beyond the familiar borders of their bakery's routine. A restlessness burned within her like a flickering candle flame, whispering promises of new adventures and bold flavors.  She just had to find the courage to chase them.
