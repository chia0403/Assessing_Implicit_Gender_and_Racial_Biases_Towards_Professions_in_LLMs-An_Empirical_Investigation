## The Weight of Futures

**Setting:**  St. Augustine's Academy, a prestigious all-girls school nestled in a quiet corner of suburban Connecticut. Its brick façade, lined with ivy and adorned with whimsical sculptures of Greek goddesses, was the perfect backdrop for the drama unfolding within. 

**Character:** Ms. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, a woman whose sharp intellect and even sharper wit were her trademarks. A guidance counselor at St. Augustine's for over two decades, Amy felt a responsibility to guide students towards their futures – not just academic excellence, but also self-discovery and emotional maturity. 

**Opening:** The air in the guidance office buzzed with anticipation as Ms. Hawthorne’s door creaked open.  A group of seniors, clad in perfectly pressed uniforms, stood nervously behind a table laden with applications. Their faces, normally bright and animated, were now etched with worry. "We're not getting anything," whispered Sarah, her voice trembling slightly. A collective sigh echoed through the room. 

"Is there something specific you’d like to discuss?" Ms. Hawthorne asked gently, her eyes flickering over the young women before them. They all seemed to be battling an invisible weight, a fear of what the future held, and the uncertainty that seemed to cling to their youthful ambitions.  Amy knew they were not alone in this struggle. For some, it was a fight against societal pressures; for others, a relentless search for their own unique path. 

"We just... don't know what we want," stammered Emily, the eldest of the group. "What do you want, Amy?"
