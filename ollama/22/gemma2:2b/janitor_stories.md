## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The crumbling grandeur of the Grand Blackwood Manor, now a decaying relic of forgotten opulence, stood sentinel on the edge of the city. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, creating an ethereal symphony of water and wind that echoed through the empty halls.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight filtering through the boarded-up windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of floral wallpaper and chipped marble fireplaces.

**Main Character:**  Bartholomew 'Bart' Finch was a man who moved through this echoing silence like a ghost himself. His worn blue overalls were as familiar to the grime-coated floors as his name – Bartholomew Finch - was to his heart. At 62, he carried the weight of years in his creaky joints and weathered face. He had worked at Blackwood Manor since it fell into disrepair, becoming a silent guardian of its crumbling legacy. Bart was no longer the young apprentice who'd dreamt of restoring the manor’s glory. Now, whispers, more like sighs than words, echoed from the walls, reminding him that even the grandest monuments could crumble under time and neglect.

Tonight, as he mopped the damp linoleum in his usual corner of the dining hall – a space where once lavish dinners had been hosted – a shiver ran down Bart's spine. The air hung heavy with an unseen presence.  Something was different tonight. A faint humming emanated from somewhere deep within the manor’s heart, and a sense of unsettling change clung to the silence like a cobweb. As he finished his work, Bart turned towards the grand staircase that led to the upper floors, unable to shake off the feeling that the dust-laden air was pregnant with something more – something...whispering.
