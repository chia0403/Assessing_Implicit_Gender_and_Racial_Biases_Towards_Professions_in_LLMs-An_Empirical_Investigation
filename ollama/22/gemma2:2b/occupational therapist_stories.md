Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the storm brewing inside Elara Thorne’s heart.  The waiting room was empty except for the lone chair where Mrs. Henderson sat hunched, fiddling with her worn rosary beads. Her son, Daniel, had been at the center of this tempestuous sea for three months now, struggling to reclaim his independence after a stroke had left him paralyzed on his left side. Elara, with her gentle hands and calming voice, was tasked with guiding him back to something resembling that life before the storm. 

Her office, tucked away in a quiet corner of the bustling city hospital, was bathed in the warm, diffused light of floor lamps.  A comforting blend of floral scents, lavender and chamomile, wafted through the air. A worn wooden bookcase lined one wall, overflowing with colorful therapeutic aids, each piece holding stories of triumph over adversity. Elara ran a finger across the weathered surface of a rubber ball, its smooth skin familiar under her touch. 
 
But today, even the usual comforting rituals felt hollow.  The weight of Mrs. Henderson's despair hung heavy in the air, thick and suffocating like the persistent drizzle outside. As she glanced at Daniel’s empty wheelchair resting in the corner, a pang of frustration shot through her. How could she possibly help him navigate this labyrinth of recovery when the journey itself seemed to break his spirit?
