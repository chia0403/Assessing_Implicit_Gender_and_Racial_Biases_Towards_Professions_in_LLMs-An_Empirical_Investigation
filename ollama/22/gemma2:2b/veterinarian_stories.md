The early morning mist clung to the redwood trees like a hesitant lover's embrace.  Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne sat on her porch swing, sipping black coffee with its bitter edge mirroring her own mood. The air, crisp and smelling of damp earth, held an uncharacteristic stillness that felt almost unnerving in this usually vibrant forest town nestled against the jagged spine of Mount Shasta. It was a town where time seemed to move at a slower pace, even during a crisis like this one.  

Amy's weathered hands tightened around her mug as she watched the sun rise behind the towering redwoods, painting them in shades of fiery orange and soft pink. This wasn't supposed to be her week off. She was due for surgery on Tuesday, her first post-retirement gig, but a phone call from Mayor Thompson last night had changed everything. A rogue animal attack in the park—a young wolf, perhaps feral but clearly distressed—had left one person seriously injured and another, just barely a child, traumatized beyond measure.  

A wave of anxiety washed over Amy. Her hands were itching to get back into her lab coat, the familiar scent of disinfectant and antiseptic a comfort she hadn't realized she missed.
