The salty tang of brine filled Dr. Amelia "Amy" Evans' nostrils as she surveyed the bustling seafood market stretching before her. Sunlight dripped like melted gold through the awning overhead, illuminating a kaleidoscope of colors: ruby red prawns glistening beside emerald green mussels; vibrant orange scallops juxtaposed against pale pink crab meat. It was a sensory overload that Amy, with years of experience in nutrition counseling and the ability to see the nutritional landscape in all its messy beauty, appreciated deeply. 

She adjusted her glasses and surveyed the scene through her usual lens: not just as an observer but as a student of life's most complex dance - food and health. Today was particularly special.  She had been invited to consult on a new high-end seafood restaurant, "The Catch," owned by a renowned chef with the Midas touch. The menu promised innovative culinary experiences inspired by the local bounty â€“ an ambitious endeavor that Amy believed could revolutionize the way people approached healthy eating.
