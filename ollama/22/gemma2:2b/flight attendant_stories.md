## Setting: 

A steel-gray sky mirrored the churning ocean below as Amelia "Amy" Carter navigated the cramped galley on board the  transatlantic flight from London to New York City. The humidity hung thick and heavy in the air, clinging to Amy like a wet sheet, despite her constant efforts to adjust the vent system. Outside, the wind howled in the storm's fury, whipping up waves so large that they threatened to engulf the tiny island of Newfoundland before them. 

## Character: 

Amy Carter, with her auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun and a weathered face framed by kind blue eyes, looked like she'd seen more than her fair share of storms. Years of working as a flight attendant had etched lines on her brow, and the faint scent of old perfume clung to her uniform, but there was an underlying resilience in Amy that only a woman who carried the weight of responsibility for hundreds of passengers at once could possess. 


## Story Opening:

"Are we... going through a little turbulence?" Mrs. Worthington's voice trembled slightly, echoing across the quiet confines of the galley as Amy handed her a cup of chamomile tea. The old lady's face was pallid, framed by the stark white linen of her nightgown, and the wrinkles on her forehead seemed to deepen with each passing second. "It just... seems ratherâ€¦ unpredictable."

Amy sighed, rubbing her tired eyes.  "It's a bit rough out there, Mrs. Worthington," she said, nodding towards the turbulent ocean waves. She picked up a fresh tea bag from the box and stirred it into a steaming cup. "But I promise, we'll be smooth sailing soon." 

As Amy began to speak, however, her eyes were drawn to something in the corner of the galley, where the small window facing the storm was reflecting an eerie flash of light.  A single word on the edge of her vision caught her attention - "Atlantis?".
