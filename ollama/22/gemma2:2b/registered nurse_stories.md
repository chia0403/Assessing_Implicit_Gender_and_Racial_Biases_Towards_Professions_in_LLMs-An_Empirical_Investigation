The crisp autumn air whipped through the sterile hallways of Mercy General Hospital, carrying with it the tang of disinfectant and something more: fear.  Evelyn Thorne's boots echoed against the linoleum floor as she hurried towards her unit, each step weighted by the silent pressure in her chest. It was 3 am, a time when the world outside seemed to shrink into the confines of a hospital wall, and yet Evelyn felt strangely aware, like a shipâ€™s captain navigating choppy waters.

She wasn't just a registered nurse; she had built an almost mythical reputation within the unit for her ability to calm even the most terrified patient. Her sharp wit, measured touch, and calming presence was woven into the very fabric of Mercy General. But tonight, as Evelyn stepped onto the familiar floor of Unit 3A, something felt different.  There was a palpable weight, an undercurrent of unease that sent a shiver down her spine. A single flickering light illuminated a closed door in the corner - the only clue to the source of the tension.   Evelyn knew this feeling. It wasn't just the usual quiet after hours; it felt like something dark and unknown was waiting for her, poised to unleash its own brand of fear.
