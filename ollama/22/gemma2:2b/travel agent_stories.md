The neon "Fly Away Tours" sign buzzed faintly above Esmeralda "Esme" Hawthorne's head, its fluorescent glow casting dancing shadows across her worn leather office chair. A sea of brochures – each more exotic than the last, promising sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains – lay scattered on her desk, mirroring the restlessness bubbling inside Esme. 

She wasn't meant for this life. Her father, a man who dreamt of distant lands and loved to talk about them like they were his own children, had left her with a legacy – "Fly Away Tours" –  and a heavy sense of duty she didn't feel a spark of enthusiasm for. The world outside was calling, beckoning Esme with promises of adventure and excitement that felt so far away from the mundane routine she had woven around herself.

Esme sighed, running a hand through her auburn hair. Outside, the sun dipped behind the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a breathtaking spectacle but one that offered no solace to the turmoil churning within. The wind whipped at the open window, carrying with it the scent of salt air and the faint hum of distant traffic, a symphony of life she couldn't quite grasp.  She wished for something more than just brochures and phone calls; she longed to experience the very magic she offered others in her travel packages.
