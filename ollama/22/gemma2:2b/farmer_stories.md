## Setting: The Dustbowl

**Opening:**

The wind, a relentless, hungry beast, whipped across Willow Creek Farm, carrying with it an unsettling silence that made Ethan's teeth ache. He stood on his porch, a weathered silhouette against the fading light of dusk, watching the tumbleweeds roll like ghosts over the parched earth. The red dust that clung to everything, even his worn boots, seemed to shimmer in the dying sun, each particle reflecting a different shade of despair. 

Ethan Carter was a farmer, born and raised on this land, weathered by years of sun, wind, and drought. But lately, he felt as if he'd been swallowed whole by the dustbowl itself. His once-vibrant farm, with its lush fields now dotted with skeletal trees and cracked earth, was mirroring his own shrinking hope. 

He ran a calloused hand through his thinning hair, the rasping sound like a mournful song against the howling wind. The old homestead sat silent, each creak of the barn echoing the growing loneliness that had settled deep within him. He wasn't just facing an ecological disaster; he was staring into the abyss of his own despair.
