Rain lashed against the windowpanes of  **Elias Thorne's** cozy workshop, blurring the streetlights into hazy streaks of yellow and green. The aroma of ozone mingled with sawdust and the faint tang of pine from his latest project: a vintage radio he was attempting to restore for an elderly neighbor. He ran a calloused thumb over the intricate brass knobs on the machine, its once-proud form now battered and faded by years of use. Elias wasn’t just an electrician; he saw beauty in the hidden circuits, the way a single wire could unravel a symphony of sound. 

Outside, thunder rumbled like an angry god, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. He had been struggling to make ends meet since his last union contract expired, and the new regulations for independent electricians were turning everything upside down.  His small family, including his wife, Amelia, and their two young children, were counting on him. 

He looked at the radio's cracked screen, a tangible reminder of his own anxieties. The storm was just beginning to intensify, its fury echoing Elias's mounting frustration. This town wasn’t built for freelancers like him. It was meant for the old-timers, the union men who had carved out their own little world within the gridlock. He needed to get a grip and find his path again, or he risked losing everything he worked so hard to build.
