## Setting: 

A sun-drenched California beach town, complete with weathered wooden boardwalk, brightly painted ice cream shops, and a constant, rhythmic hum of ocean waves lapping against the shore. It's July, the air thick with humidity and the scent of sunscreen and salty brine. The beach is bustling with families enjoying their summer break: children shrieking with laughter as they chase seagulls; older couples sipping iced tea under parasols; and lone surfers catching fleeting moments of calm before the waves start to roll in.

## Character: 

**Amelia "Amy" Grant**, a young therapist known for her warm smile and unwavering determination, has come to work at the beach-side clinic after a string of disappointments back in the city.  She’s tired of the concrete jungle, its frantic pace, and its relentless demands on people’s time and energy. Here, amidst the natural rhythms of the ocean and the gentle breeze that rustles through the palm trees, Amy feels like she can finally breathe again. 

## Story Opening: 

"Morning, Amy," a cheerful voice called out as the door swung open.  It was Mrs. Olson, her patient's mother, holding a worn beach umbrella adorned with seashells and a smiling face of sand dollar. "Ready for another round with the little one?"  Amy smiled back, her eyes twinkling behind her glasses.

"Always," she replied, gently adjusting her worn white sneakers as she stepped into the clinic's brightly lit space, its walls adorned with calming beach scenes. The air was thick with the promise of new beginnings and fresh perspectives.
