## The Shadow of Vesuvius

**Setting:**  A cobbled alleyway in Naples, Italy, 1920s. Rain pours down on the city, the grey skies mirroring the despair swirling inside Elena Rossi's chest.  The smell of fish and coal hangs heavy in the air, a mixture that conjures memories of her grandmother's famous seafood pasta, now sadly lost to the city's relentless hunger for change. 

**Main character:** Elena Rossi, a sharp-tongued journalist with fire in her eyes and more ambition than sense. She’s barely scraping by, living a life lived on borrowed time and a worn copy of Zola's novels for comfort. The city she loves is crumbling around her,  its beauty poisoned by the same rot that has plagued its people - poverty, desperation, and a gnawing fear of the future.

Elena adjusts her battered fedora, the rain soaking through the thin fabric of her coat. A discarded newspaper falls at her feet, a picture splashed across it: "The Great Exodus." Naples' youngest are leaving, drawn to the promise of jobs in America. The exodus is accelerating, and with each departure, Elena feels the city she calls home bleeding out its lifeblood - a symphony of grief, fear, and unfulfilled dreams. 

She pulls her notebook from beneath her coat, the familiar weight grounding her. Tonight, she's chasing whispers of a forgotten history, one that connects the exodus to a long-dormant legend about Vesuvius' fiery wrath. It’s a tale whispered in hushed tones, a story Elena believes holds the key to understanding this city's present despair and perhaps even its future.  


**Prompting questions:**

* What makes Elena so driven?
* How does she feel about the exodus? 
* Why is the legend of Vesuvius so important to her?
* Where exactly in Naples is Elena trying to find the truth, and what obstacles will she face?
