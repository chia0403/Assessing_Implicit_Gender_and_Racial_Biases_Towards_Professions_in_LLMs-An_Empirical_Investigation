The worn leather couch creaked beneath Dr. Eleanor Thorne's weight as she sat, waiting for her next patient to arrive. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the city skyline into an impressionist watercolor of grey and black. The scent of pine needles from the air freshener she religiously used wafted through the tiny office, a stark contrast to the overwhelming aroma of despair that usually clung to the clients she saw here in this forgotten corner of New York City's vibrant East Village. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses and glanced at the clock: 7:32 PM. The hour was creeping closer to when many of her fellow therapists would be heading home, closing down their practices for the evening. But Eleanor wasn't like them. This caseload demanded more than just a simple close. She had promised a friend - someone she secretly admired and whose journey through loss she'd been privy to since before they even met – that she would dedicate herself fully to this one case, and now, with each passing minute, the weight of her commitment felt heavier than ever.  

The door creaked open, momentarily interrupting the quiet hum of the storm outside. A young man, his face shadowed and drawn, stepped into the office. He was everything Eleanor hadn't expected; hesitant, shy, but carrying a certain raw intensity in his gaze. The man’s name was David Thompson, and he had come seeking something far beyond the comfort of talking with someone about his grief. He came seeking solace. And that meant, for Eleanor, facing her own vulnerabilities.
