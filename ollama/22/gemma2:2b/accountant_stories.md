The air in the office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  A faint hum punctuated by the relentless whirring of his calculator filled the silence as Bertram "Bernie" Fitzwilliam meticulously entered numbers into his laptop. Bernie's fingers danced across the keys, their movements a familiar ballet in the otherwise sterile confines of Fitzwilliam & Co., an accounting firm that seemed to have aged alongside the worn-out carpet and dust motes dancing in the sunbeams.

The once towering skyscrapers were now sleek, self-sustaining biodomes that clung to the cityscape like giant, breathing organisms.  But within those buildings, the same grim routine continued - paperwork, deadlines, and a growing sense of futility as the world seemed increasingly out of touch with reality.

He'd long been resigned to his fate, a cog in a machine that churned out taxes and balance sheets, a silent witness to the economic turmoil that threatened to engulf his society.  Yet, tonight, something stirred within him. A spark of defiance against the monotonous drone of routine. The weight of responsibility felt heavier than usual, as if it was all he had left before falling into the abyss.
