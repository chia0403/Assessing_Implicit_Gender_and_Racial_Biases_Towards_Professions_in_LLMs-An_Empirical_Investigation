## The Shifting Walls 

**Setting:**  The city of Aethelwind sits at the edge of the whispering woods, its once-proud stone walls now marred by centuries of decay and overgrown ivy. The air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and lingering smoke from wood-burning hearths – a comforting aroma in contrast to the encroaching gloom that settles on the city’s edges. 

**Main Character:**  Bartholomew "Bart" Thorne is no more than a shadow amongst the towering guardsmen of Aethelwind's inner circle. At twenty years old, his lean frame and wiry build belie the strength he carries in his weathered hands and the stoicism etched into his face. Every movement, every sigh seems weighted by the heavy chain mail that clings to him like an unwelcome guest. He's the least-favored guard, relegated to duty on the outer wall instead of the glittering inner sanctums where power resides.  

**Story Opening:**
The wind howled a mournful song through the crumbling city walls as Bart surveyed his post. His eyes, hardened by years of watching the shadows lengthen and darkness creep across the world outside Aethelwind's stone heart, settled on a patch of overgrown ivy clinging to the wall’s mortar. The ivy seemed to pulsate with a life force he knew well – a slow pulse that echoed in his own weary bones.  His gaze fell upon a single, withered leaf caught between two jagged stones. It was a beacon, starkly contrasting against the black stone and the chilling breeze. He felt it – a pull, an inexplicable tug towards something hidden behind the ivy's embrace. The walls were whispering, too, their ancient secrets leaking through the cracks in the stone like the tears of forgotten generations. 


He knew he should be guarding his post, watching for any sign of trouble that might breach the city's meager defenses. But Bart felt an undeniable pull towards the leaf. This wasn’t just a duty, this was something deeper, something ancient and unsettling.  The leaves rustled in the wind, as if they were whispering secrets only he could hear. 

"What are you hiding, little leaf?" he whispered, his voice echoing in the stillness of the night.
