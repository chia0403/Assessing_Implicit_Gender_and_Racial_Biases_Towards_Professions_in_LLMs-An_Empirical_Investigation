The wind whipped dust across Silas Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his sprawling ranch.  Sun dipped low over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of burnt orange and fiery red – hues that matched the stubborn fire crackling in his gut. For years, this land had been his lifeblood, his soul-nest egg, his legacy. But lately, even the familiar comfort of his weathered leather boots sinking into the dusty earth felt foreign. The drought had choked the valley, turning fertile fields into dust bowls, and the livestock, once a source of pride, were slowly dwindling to skin and bone. 

Silas ran a calloused hand through his thick, salt-and-pepper hair, a lifetime of grit etched onto his face.  His gaze lingered on the old windmill that had stood witness to generations of sunrises and sunsets, its rusted gears groaning with each passing day – a sound both mournful and familiar. This was Black Ridge Ranch, a place woven into the fabric of his being, but even Silas couldn’t deny the encroaching sense of defeat as he stared at the drying riverbed that once flowed like silver lifeblood through his land.  His heart ached for the promise he'd made to his grandfather – to preserve this legacy, no matter what.
