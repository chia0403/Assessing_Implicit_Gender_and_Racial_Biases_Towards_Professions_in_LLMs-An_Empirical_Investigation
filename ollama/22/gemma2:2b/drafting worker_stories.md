The rain was coming down sideways, each drop exploding in a tiny geyser against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's cramped office. The building shuddered with each gust of wind that rattled the old brick walls around him. He peered out at the torrent, the gray clouds reflecting off the wet asphalt below like a bruise on the city. 

Elias ran his calloused fingers over the worn leather cover of his drafting kit, its familiar weight grounding him amidst the chaos outside. A decade in this cramped office had carved lines deep into the surface of his once-smooth hands and brought an inherent weariness to his eyes. He was used to battling the elements – both literal and metaphorical – in the harsh world of urban construction. 

He was Elias Thorne, draftsman extraordinaire, a man who built bridges and tunnels with pencil strokes, dreams that took root in concrete and steel. His days were spent meticulously crafting blueprints for the city’s ever-growing infrastructure, filling his head with the symphony of gears and pipes, the hum of machinery in an industrial orchestra. Even as the storm raged on, Elias' mind was already sketching out new designs, envisioning the intricate dance of steel and concrete that would shape the future.
