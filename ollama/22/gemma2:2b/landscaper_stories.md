The morning mist clung to the towering oaks, turning their gnarled limbs into shadowy sentinels in the early light.  A low rumble of thunder echoed across the valley, promising a storm that would churn and crash over the rolling hills of Mendocino County like a restless spirit. It wasn't rain that bothered Ethan Thorne, though. No, it was the suffocating quiet. This kind of stillness felt heavier than the weight of the raindrops themselves.

Ethan ran his calloused hand across the freshly-mowed grass in front of Mrs. Olsen's Victorian house, a symphony of green and brown against the backdrop of the grey sky. His worn leather boots crunched on the gravel path leading to the front porch. The wind whipped through the overgrown ferns, their leaves whispering secrets only he could hear - secrets of forgotten memories, unspoken anxieties. 

Ethan was a man of earth and nature, his hands calloused from years spent coaxing life out of the soil. He brought order to chaos with a brushstroke of green and a gentle tap of the spade. But today, even his usual serenity seemed to be draining away like the last bit of morning dew on a spiderweb.  He couldn't shake off a feeling of dread that hung heavy in the air, heavier than the storm clouds brewing above.
