The rumble of the bulldozer's engine vibrated through Elias Thorne's boots like a low-frequency tremor.  The desert dust kicked up by his progress was gritty on his face as he maneuvered the behemoth towards the heart of the abandoned mine shaft.  It had been three years since Elias had taken this job, three years since the accident that took his wife, and now, three years into a life consumed by the silence and solitude of the Nevada desert.

Elias was known for his rough hands and even rougier temper, but they'd never gotten him to slow down.  He could see the ghost of his wife in every swing of the bulldozer's blade, in the way he navigated those treacherous slopes that swallowed all light and sound alike. "She would be proud of me," he thought, pushing through a sudden wave of grief. 

The air hung heavy with the smell of ozone and dust, a constant reminder of his task: to clear the debris and secure the mine for demolition.  Elias's gaze fell upon the rickety scaffolding that clung precariously to the side of the mine shaft, its wooden planks weathered and stained by time and years of neglect. He felt the familiar sting of unease, the same way he felt when looking into his wifeâ€™s eyes; a deep ache in his chest.  

It was like a scar on his soul, an endless reminder of what could have been.  His job was more than demolition - it was about clearing the ground, about reclaiming a space that now held nothing but memories and ghosts.
