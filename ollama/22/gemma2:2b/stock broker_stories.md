The city stretched before Alistair Thorne like a greedy beast, its skyscrapers clawing at the heavens while the air throbbed with the ceaseless hum of ambition. New York City in 2047 was a symphony of data and neon; a million transactions occurring every second, each one feeding the insatiable maw of the market. Alistair stood on the precipice of his world – the glass-walled office overlooking Wall Street, his reflection staring back at him with steely eyes. The fluorescent lights reflected off his meticulously pressed suit, a stark white against the dark backdrop of the city. 

Alistair Thorne, the rising star in the world of stockbrokerage, was known for his uncanny ability to predict market shifts before they even happened – a talent honed by years of tireless research and an insatiable curiosity about human behaviour. His current client, a reclusive tech billionaire named Silas Ravenwood, entrusted him with managing a portfolio that could shift entire industries.  

Tonight, however, Alistair found himself staring at the stock ticker screen in his office, his usual calm façade crumbling under the weight of an unsettling premonition. The numbers danced on the screen, their rhythm erratic and unnervingly off-beat. Something wasn't right. He glanced at the time – midnight. It was Ravenwood’s birthday, a day Alistair had marked as “The Day.”
