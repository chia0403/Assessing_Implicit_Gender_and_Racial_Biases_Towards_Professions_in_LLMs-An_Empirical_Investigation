##  Blood & Bone

**Setting:** The sterile steel walls of Dr. Peterson's office hummed with the quiet efficiency of an unseen machine. A single fluorescent bulb cast harsh light on the waiting area, where the air smelled faintly of antiseptic and anxiety. The only sounds were the rhythmic clicking of a timer attached to the armrests and the occasional muffled coughing from inside the office. 

**Main Character:**  Eliza "Lilah" Thorne, a woman who had never truly embraced the nickname her mother gave her. Lilah's quiet demeanor and sharp eyes hid a steely resolve that served her well in her high-pressure job as a phlebotomist at the prestigious San Rafael Clinic. It was where she found solace amidst the chaos of drawing blood for diagnostics, where she could meticulously weave her way through veins like an artist navigating delicate canvases. 

**Opening:** Lilah stared out the small window overlooking the bustling city street below. The endless stream of human movement felt both comforting and unsettling. Her gaze lingered on a young woman with fiery red hair standing at the bus stop across the street, clutching a tattered backpack that looked almost as old as her own worn leather gloves.  She had been waiting for an hour, the fluorescent light casting unnatural shadows over her face. Lilah's heart throbbed in her chest; this was more than just a routine blood draw. It felt...personal. Something about the woman's desperation and defiance was pulling at Lilah like a phantom hand on a cold, wet surface.
