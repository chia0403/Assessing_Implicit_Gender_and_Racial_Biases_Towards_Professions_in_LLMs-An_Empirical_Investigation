## Setting: The Rust Belt 

The sun was sinking below the horizon, painting the Ohio sky in hues of bruised orange and fading pink.  A biting wind whipped off the steel plants along the highway, carrying with it the scent of rust and decaying dreams. It whistled through the skeletal structures of abandoned factories, their windows like vacant eyes staring out into the dying light. 

Miles away from bustling city life, on Route 42, stood a single streetlight flickering against the encroaching shadows.  It cast long, distorted shapes of the workers' lunchboxes and overturned dump trucks scattered across its concrete apron. A lone figure stood amidst this rust-coloured landscape – **Elias “Ellie” Thompson**, a man with calloused hands and weathered features etched by years under the harsh sun and endless work on the asphalt ribbon.  His worn denim jacket was pulled tight against the cold, his steel-toed boots crunched on loose gravel as he lit a cigarette, smoke swirling around him like a ghost from another life. 

Tonight, Ellie wasn't just patching potholes or battling rogue traffic cones. Tonight, something felt different in the air, an uneasy tension that clung to the twilight, twisting around his bones like a hungry spiderweb.  Something was coming.
