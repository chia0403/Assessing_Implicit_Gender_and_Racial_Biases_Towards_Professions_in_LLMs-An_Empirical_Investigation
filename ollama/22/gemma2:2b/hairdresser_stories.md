The rain lashed against the windowpanes like angry fists, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the cool glass. Inside "Scissors & Silk," the air hung heavy with the perfume of lavender and hairspray, an incongruous blend that somehow felt comforting amidst the storm's fury.  This was not the usual atmosphere for Beatrice Thorne. Usually, her salon hummed with life - a symphony of laughter, gossip, and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors on hair. Today, however, only the steady rhythm of the wind and the distant rumble of thunder broke the quiet air. 

Beatrice, her auburn curls tied back in a loose bun that framed her freckled face, surveyed the empty chairs with a sigh. Her usual clientele had opted for indoor activities - movies, board games, or staying under heavy blankets, leaving only an unsettling silence and the lone television playing reruns of 'Murder She Wrote' on mute.
