The late afternoon sun was bleeding across the horizon, turning the sky into streaks of burnt orange and bruised purple over the sprawling Victorian estate known as Ashworth Manor. Arthur Blackwood, his hands roughened by years of tending to the overgrown gardens of this decaying grandeur, sighed, pulling out a withered rose from its thorny embrace. It had been his father's favourite, but now it felt like another weight on his soul as he let it fall to the ground. 

Ashworth Manor had once been a monument to wealth and elegance, with its manicured lawns and sprawling gardens a symbol of prosperity. Now, years after the Blackwood family line died out, only whispers of past grandeur remained â€“ a faded portrait of a stern-faced woman, peeling wallpaper in the ballroom, and an old gramophone that coughed every time it was switched on. 

Arthur's days were filled with the quiet humdrum of maintaining what he hoped wouldn't be forgotten. He worked alongside his own dwindling dreams and memories, tending to the rose garden where his father had once whispered secrets to the wind, hoping to one day restore this magnificent estate to its former glory. But as dusk settled over Ashworth Manor, Arthur knew that even the gentlest of winds would soon blow away any hope he held onto.
