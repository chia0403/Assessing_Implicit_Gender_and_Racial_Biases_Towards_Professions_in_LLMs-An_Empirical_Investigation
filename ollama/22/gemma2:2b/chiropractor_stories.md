## Setting the Stage

The air hung heavy with humidity and the scent of pine needles as Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne adjusted her worn leather glasses.  Her clinic, nestled amidst the redwood giants in the heart of Redwood National Park, hummed with its usual morning energy: the rustling of pages through well-worn textbooks, the rhythmic whirring of a portable x-ray machine, and the soft murmurings of patients in various states of undress (including one who was decidedly *not* enjoying his spanking new massage table).  Amy loved this place; she’d grown up near the park, learning to appreciate its solace and raw beauty even as a restless child.

## The Story Begins

“Alright, Mr. Henderson,” Amy said, gently prodding a particularly stubborn knot in her patient's shoulder. “I promise you this won’t be too long.” 

Mr. Henderson, however, was not convinced. His weathered face contorted into a frown as he clutched his arm, muttering something about a "bad dream," the pain flaring again with every twist of Amy's fingers.  Amy knew there was more to it than that, but even her keen eyes couldn’t quite decipher the true source of Mr. Henderson's discomfort – this constant tension felt like a shadow, swirling beneath his calm exterior. 

“Is there anyone else, perhaps a friend, who could be here?” Amy asked, sensing something off about the man's demeanor. 


This was just another morning in Amy's life, but something about Mr. Henderson’s situation felt different. Something called to her, urging her to delve deeper and uncover what lay hidden beneath the surface of his quiet despair.
