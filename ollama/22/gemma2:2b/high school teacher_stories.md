The humid air clung to Ms. Eleanor Nightingale like a second skin as she surveyed her classroom. A kaleidoscope of mismatched colours swirled in the sunlight streaming through the worn-out window: neon green posters emblazoned with motivational quotes, faded fabric bunting depicting the "Declaration of Independence," and a battered globe propped precariously against a rickety shelf.  

Ms. Nightingale's gaze settled on her usual corner where she placed her overflowing desk – its surface adorned with student work from the previous year: a chaotic collage of history essays, science fair projects, even an abstract painting that resembled a melting popsicle – and sighed. The air here, in room 203 at West High School, always felt like a time capsule. It was both comforting and suffocating - each corner holding the ghosts of students past, their dreams, anxieties, and triumphs etched into every inch of this space. 

But today, something felt different. Today, Ms. Nightingale's usual calm was replaced with a knot of unease. She adjusted her glasses as she looked at the clock – 8:00 AM – when the first bell should ring for school.  The silence was deafening, and it wasn’t just because the bell was late.
