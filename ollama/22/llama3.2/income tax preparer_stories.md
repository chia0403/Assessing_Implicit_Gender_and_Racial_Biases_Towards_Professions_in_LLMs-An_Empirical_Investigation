Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the streets of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, Emily Anne Wilson settled into her worn leather armchair, surrounded by stacks of dusty tax returns and the faint scent of stale coffee. It was the eve of April 15th, Tax Day, and Emily's small office, nestled in a cramped strip mall off Vine Street, was already buzzing with last-minute clients.

Emily, a certified public accountant with over ten years of experience, had built her reputation as the go-to tax preparer for the working-class families of Cincinnati. She took pride in her work, meticulously crafting each return to ensure maximum refunds and minimizing errors. But tonight, amidst the chaos of preparing for another chaotic Tax Day, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease lingered in the back of her mind, like a faint hum from an old calculator left on.

As she sifted through the stack of returns, her gaze landed on a particular file, one that had been lingering at the bottom for weeks. The name "Jackson Reed" was scribbled in red ink across the top, a reminder of a mysterious client who had deposited his return earlier that week, along with a cryptic note requesting Emily's attention.

Emily rubbed her tired eyes and let out a deep sigh. She knew she should focus on preparing for tomorrow's rush, but her curiosity about Jackson Reed's file kept drawing her back. Little did she know, this chance encounter would set off a chain of events that would change the course of her life forever.
