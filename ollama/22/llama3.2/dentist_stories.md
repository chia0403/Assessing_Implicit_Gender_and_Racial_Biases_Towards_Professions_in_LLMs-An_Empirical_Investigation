Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the old wooden pier, her eyes scanning the mist-shrouded waters of Lake Michigan as the sun set behind her. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves from the nearby forest. She breathed it in deeply, feeling a sense of peace wash over her as she gazed out at the lake's tranquil surface.

As a dentist in a small coastal town like Willow Creek, Emilia had grown accustomed to the rhythms of the seasons. But tonight felt different - perhaps it was the way the stars seemed to twinkle in harmony with the waves, or the soft hum of the pier's creaking wooden planks beneath her feet. Whatever the reason, Emilia felt a restlessness stirring within her, like a whisper that something was about to change.

Just then, her phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the spell. Emilia pulled it out and checked the screen - a text from her best friend, Rachel, with a single word: "Tonight."
