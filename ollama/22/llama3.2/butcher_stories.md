Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Ashwood like a damp blanket, shrouding its narrow streets and rustic buildings in a damp, grey veil. In the heart of this sleepy community, on Elm Street, stood "Hammer & Bone" - a butcher shop run by none other than Emrys Thaddeus Wychwood III. The sign above the door creaked in the gentle breeze, bearing the proud family crest: a hammer and anvil surrounded by crossed bones.

Emrys, or Emy as he was known to his friends and acquaintances, had inherited Hammer & Bone from his father, who had taken it over from his own father before him. For generations, the Wychwoods had been Ashwood's premier meat merchants, supplying the town with the finest cuts of beef, pork, and lamb, as well as an assortment of exotic meats to cater to the more adventurous palates.

As the sun began to rise, casting a pale light over the shop, Emrys stirred from his slumber. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, revealing a pair of deep-set brown orbs that sparkled with a quiet intensity. A faint scar above his left eyebrow, shaped like a crescent moon, seemed to deepen in color as he yawned, revealing a small gap between his teeth.

Emrys swung his legs over the side of the bed and planted his feet firmly on the ground, feeling the familiar creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath him. He stretched, arching his back and extending his arms overhead, before settling into a slow, deliberate routine that had been etched into his muscles like a well-worn groove. The task ahead would be long and grueling, but Emrys was already lost in thought, weighing the possibilities of the day's transactions and mentally allocating inventory for the week to come.

And yet, as he began to prepare for another day at Hammer & Bone, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a subtle unease that lingered just beneath the surface of his senses, like the faint scent of smoke on a summer breeze.
