Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The neon lights of the city cast a gaudy glow over the rundown streets of New Haven, Illinois, as Jack Patrick "Hawk" Hawkins made his way through the crowded sidewalks on a chilly autumn evening. A skilled electrician with over a decade of experience, Hawk had seen it all - from the bright lights of downtown to the dimly lit alleys of the city's underbelly.

As he walked, the hum of his truck's engine and the soft crackle of his toolbox provided a familiar comfort in the midst of chaos. He was on his way to meet up with his old buddy, Mike "Mac" McAllister, at Mac's Auto Repair shop on 5th Street. The two had grown up together, working side by side on countless jobs and sharing stories of their adventures.

Tonight was no exception. Hawk had just received a call from an old flame, Rachel Lee, asking for his help with a mysterious electrical issue at her family's antique shop on Main Street. Something about the store's ancient wiring had gone haywire, causing equipment to malfunction and even sparking small fires. Rachel's voice was laced with worry as she begged Hawk to come take a look - and maybe, just maybe, uncover the source of the problem before things got out of hand.

Hawk's gut told him this one was different. Something about the way Rachel spoke, her words laced with a quiet desperation, had piqued his interest. He pushed open the door to Mac's shop, a bell above it ringing out as he stepped inside. The familiar scent of grease and gasoline enveloped him, and Hawk knew he was exactly where he belonged.

But little did he know, this job would be anything but routine...
