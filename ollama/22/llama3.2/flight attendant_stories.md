Here's a potential story opening and setting for a thriller or mystery novel:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, casting a golden glow over the crowded airport, Aurora Maeve Flynn began her pre-flight preparations. She sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee, her eyes scanning the rows of identical seats in the aircraft's cabin as she mentally checked off each task: stow the snacks, secure the life jackets, and ensure the oxygen masks were securely fastened.

Aurora, or Rory to those who knew her well, was a seasoned flight attendant with years of experience under her belt. She had seen it all - from screaming babies on long-haul flights to frantic passengers in emergency situations. But despite her tough exterior, Rory had a secret: she was haunted by nightmares that seemed all too real.

As she finished her final checks, the plane's intercom crackled to life, and the voice of the captain echoed through the cabin. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We will be taking off in just 15 minutes. Please make sure your seatbelts are securely fastened and all electronic devices are in airplane mode."

Rory smiled tightly as she made her way down the aisle, greeting each passenger with a warm smile and a friendly demeanor that belied the storm brewing inside her mind.

As she reached the rear of the plane, Rory noticed something odd: a small piece of paper tucked into the seat pocket in front of her. She pulled it out, her heart skipping a beat as she saw a single sentence scrawled on its surface: "You're not who you think you are."
