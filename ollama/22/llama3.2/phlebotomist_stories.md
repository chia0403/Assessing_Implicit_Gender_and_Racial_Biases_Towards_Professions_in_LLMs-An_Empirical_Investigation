Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the bustling city of New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets of the downtown area. In a small medical office nestled between a vintage clothing store and a 24-hour diner, Phlebotomy Specialist Emily Joy Reynolds was prepping for another long night of drawing blood.

As she scrubbed her hands with hand sanitizer and donned her favorite pair of worn-out scrubs, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It had been three days since the mysterious illness had started spreading through the office, and so far, none of the medical staff had been able to pinpoint the cause or identify any victims.

Despite the growing concern, Emily was determined to do her part in helping to contain the outbreak. She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the long night ahead, as she began to review her patient list for the evening shift. Her eyes scanned the rows of computer screens and medical charts, taking note of the patients who needed blood work done, including Mrs. Jenkins, a 75-year-old diabetic who required a routine blood test every week.

As Emily donned her gloves and made her way to the first patient's room, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The air in the office seemed heavy with an unspoken tension, and she found herself glancing over her shoulder, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows.

Little did Emily know, this ordinary night would soon turn into a fight for survival...
