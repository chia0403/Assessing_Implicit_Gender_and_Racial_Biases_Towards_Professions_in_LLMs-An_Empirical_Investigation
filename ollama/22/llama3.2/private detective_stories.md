Here's a potential story opening and setting for your consideration:

**Setting:** The rain-soaked streets of New Haven, a city shrouded in mist and mystery. New Haven was once a thriving industrial hub, but after decades of decline, it now struggled to find its place in the modern world. The city's faded grandeur still lingered in its architecture, from the crumbling warehouses of the waterfront to the ornate Gothic spires of the historic district.

**Main Character:** Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a private detective with a reputation for being one of the best - and most elusive - in town. Lexi was a 35-year-old former NYPD homicide detective who had grown disillusioned with the bureaucracy and politics that seemed to hold back real justice. She struck out on her own, opening up a small but respected private investigation agency on the outskirts of the city.

Lexi's office was a cramped, smoke-filled room above a rundown diner on 5th Street. The sign above the door read "Thompson Investigations" in faded letters, and the phone rang only occasionally - usually with cases that required her unique blend of street smarts and old-school detective work.

It was on one such rainy evening, as Lexi pored over a stack of unsent invoices and half-empty coffee cups, that her phone rang for the first time all day. The voice on the other end was hesitant and worried, speaking in hushed tones about a mysterious disappearance in the city's upscale Bellvue neighborhood.

"I need you to find my sister," the caller said finally, before hanging up without another word.

Lexi's eyes narrowed as she scribbled down a single sentence in her notebook: "Case number one - start at the Bellvue address."
