Here's a possible story opening:

Dr. Everley Anne Wellesley stood at the edge of the stormy rooftop, the city lights twinkling like diamonds scattered across the dark canvas below. The wind whipped her long, curly brown hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the sea of faces below, their tiny figures like ants scurrying about on the concrete jungle floor.

As a clinical psychologist with a specialization in trauma and anxiety disorders, Everley had spent years studying the intricacies of the human mind. But tonight, she found herself facing her own demons, standing on this rooftop high above the New York City streets, the sounds of car horns and laughter muffled by the howling wind.

It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But Everley had no such luxury. She had just received a cryptic phone call from an old patient, one who had disappeared years ago without explanation. The message was simple: "They're still watching."
