Here's a potential story opening and setting for a thriller novel:

It was a chilly winter evening in Los Angeles, and film director Julian Rykhard stood alone on the deserted rooftop of his production company, gazing out at the glittering lights of Hollywood Boulevard below. The fog rolled in from the Pacific, shrouding the city in an impenetrable veil of mist and mystery. Julian's gaze was fixed on the iconic Chinese Theatre, where his latest film, "The Shadow Player," had premiered to a critical and commercial success just a week ago.

As he puffed on his cigar, the chill of the night air mingled with the bitter taste of regret that had been gnawing at him for months. The film's premiere had been a whirlwind of champagne toasts and congratulatory handshakes, but beneath the surface, Julian had known that something was off. The reviews were mixed, the studio executives were breathing down his neck, and the real question on everyone's mind was: what was behind the eerie, unsettling tone that had crept into the film like a cold wind?

Julian's thoughts were interrupted by the soft glow of his phone, which had been buzzing with texts from his production team. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through the messages, his eyes scanning the screens for any sign of what was coming next. And then, one message caught his eye: "Meet me at the lot at midnight. Come alone."
