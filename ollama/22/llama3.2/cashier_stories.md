Here's a potential story opening:

---

The fluorescent lights above the checkout counter cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor of the 24-hour convenience store where Ember Rose Thompson worked her shift. It was a typical Tuesday evening in late August, with the sun having dipped below the horizon hours ago and the only sound being the soft hum of the refrigerators in the back and the occasional beep of the cash register.

Ember, or Em as she was known to regulars, stood behind the counter, her eyes fixed on the endless stream of receipts and crumpled up snack wrappers that threatened to overflow from the small trash can beside her. She had been working at the store for three years now, and despite the monotony of the job, there was something about the late-night quiet that felt almost like home.

As she tallied up the day's sales, Em's mind wandered back to the mysterious package that had arrived in the mail just that morning - a plain brown envelope with no return address, containing only a single sheet of paper with a cryptic message scrawled on it: "Meet me at 2 AM. Come alone."
