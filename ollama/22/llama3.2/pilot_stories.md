Here's a potential story opening:

The small, weathered airport was shrouded in a thick layer of mist, its runway stretching out like a skeletal finger into the grey dawn. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell that was both familiar and comforting to Captain Evelyn Mae Wilson, a veteran pilot with thousands of hours of experience under her belt.

Evelyn, or Evie as she liked to be called, stood on the tarmac, her eyes fixed on the worn sign creaking in the gentle breeze: "Red Rock Airport - 25 miles from civilization". She had flown into this airport countless times before, but something about today's arrival felt different. Maybe it was the sense of unease that settled in the pit of her stomach like a stone, or maybe it was the feeling that she was being watched by unseen eyes.

As she gazed out at the mist-shrouded landscape, Evelyn's thoughts turned to the reason she'd come to Red Rock: a mysterious letter from an old friend, requesting her help with a matter of great importance. The letter had been cryptic, but one thing was certain - Evelyn's curiosity was piqued, and she was determined to uncover the truth.

With a deep breath, Evelyn shouldered her bag and began to walk towards the airport terminal, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of life. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her farther from safety than she'd ever been before.
