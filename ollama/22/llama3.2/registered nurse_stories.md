Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small coastal town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling hospital where Emily J. Wilson, RN, was finishing her shift as a critical care nurse. The salty sea air mingled with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee, a familiar smell that Emily knew all too well.

Emily had lived in Ravenswood her entire life, returning to her hometown after completing nursing school at the local community college. She had chosen this small hospital for its close-knit staff and the sense of camaraderie among the nurses, which made coming home every night feel like coming home again.

As Emily made her way to the staff room to clock out and collect her things, she couldn't help but wonder what secrets Sarah's story might hold. Little did she know, this chance encounter would set off a chain of events that would change everything about her life...
