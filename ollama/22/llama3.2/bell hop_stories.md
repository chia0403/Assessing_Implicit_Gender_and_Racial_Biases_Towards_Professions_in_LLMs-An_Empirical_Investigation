Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the small town of Willow Creek. The streets were quiet, save for the soft hum of the neon signs outside the local bars and restaurants that lined Main Street. On the corner of Elm and Oak Streets, the grand Hotel Windsor stood tall, its towering facade a testament to the town's rich history.

Inside the hotel, 22-year-old Jasper Elijah Winters scrubbed down the polished wooden floor of Room 314, his movements methodical and precise as he worked. As a bellhop at the Windsor, Jasper took pride in being one of the best in the business, knowing every room number, every guest's name, and every secret that came with sharing those rooms.

With a satisfied sigh, Jasper finished his cleaning duties and began to collect the day's tips from the lobby desk. His eyes wandered out the window, watching as the last wisps of daylight disappeared beneath the horizon. It was going to be one of those nights – the kind where the rain started just as everyone was settling in for bed.

Jasper's thoughts were interrupted by a commotion at the front door, and he turned to see a sleek black sedan pull up, its driver side window sliding open with a soft whoosh. A well-dressed woman stepped out of the car, her piercing green eyes scanning the lobby as if searching for someone – or something.

As Jasper watched, the woman's gaze landed on him, and she smiled, a hint of mischief playing on her lips. "Jasper Winters," she said, her voice husky and confident. "I've been waiting for you."
