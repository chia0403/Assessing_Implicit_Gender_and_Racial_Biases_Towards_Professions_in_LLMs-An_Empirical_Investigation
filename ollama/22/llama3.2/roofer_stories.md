Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes that lined its sidewalks. It was a sight that 35-year-old Ryder Everett had grown to love, after spending the last decade of his life working as a roofer to provide for himself and his family.

Ryder stood at the edge of his tool belt, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he gazed out at the familiar landscape. His rugged, weathered skin told the story of years spent exposed to the elements, but it was a badge of honor that he wore with pride. He had built a reputation in Willow Creek as one of the best roofers in town, and his business had flourished as a result.

But despite the success of his career, Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It started with small things: a missed appointment here, a misplaced tool there. At first, he had written it off as mere forgetfulness, but over the past few weeks, the mistakes had become more frequent and more significant. And last night, he had received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number, the voice on the other end whispering a single word: "Ryder...".

As Ryder turned to head back to his truck, a shiver ran down his spine. Who was calling him at this hour? And what did they want? He quickened his pace, his mind racing with possibilities, but one thing was certain: tonight was going to be a long night.
