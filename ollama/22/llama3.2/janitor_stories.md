Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fluorescent lights above the water cooler flickered to life, casting an eerie glow over the drab, beige walls of the office building. It was 4:47 AM on a typical Tuesday morning at Smithson & Co., a mid-sized marketing firm that employed dozens of staff members from various departments.

Among them was Harold Everett Thompson, aka "Hank" to his colleagues - a janitor who had spent over a decade keeping the office spick and span, despite being overlooked by his bosses. Hank took pride in his work, ensuring that every surface was spotless, every trash can was emptied, and every printer roll was replaced on schedule.

As he wheeled his cart through the darkened hallways, the only sound being the soft hum of the overhead lights, Hank couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the usual Monday morning blues - the coffee machine was malfunctioning again, and someone had left their lunch in the break room fridge overnight.

But as he approached the executive offices on the top floor, a shiver ran down his spine. The usually immaculate reception area looked...disorderly. Papers were scattered across the desk, chairs were pushed back from their usual positions, and the usually spotless floor was littered with discarded coffee cups and crumpled up notes.

Hank's curiosity got the better of him. He stopped in front of the office door, his cart wheels slowing to a stop as he peered inside. What could be causing all this chaos at such an early hour? And why did it feel like something was watching him from the shadows?
