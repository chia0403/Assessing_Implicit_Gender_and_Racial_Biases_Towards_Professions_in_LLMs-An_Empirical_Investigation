Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the streets of New Orleans like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy shroud over the city. In the heart of the French Quarter, where jazz drifted from the bars and restaurants like a sultry melody, attorney Emilia Elise LaFleur stood outside her office building, staring out at the stormy night.

She was a woman in her mid-thirties, with piercing green eyes and curly brown hair that seemed to spring to life even on the dullest of days. Her sharp jawline and pointed chin gave her an air of quiet confidence, but it was a confidence born of hard-won experience and a deep-seated determination to fight for those who had been left behind.

As she lit a cigarette and took a long drag, Emilia's thoughts turned to the case that had brought her back to New Orleans in the first place: the disappearance of 19-year-old Sophie Dumont, a young woman with a promising future and a family torn apart by grief. It was a case that had sparked something within Emilia - a sense of justice she couldn't ignore, and a hunger for answers that drove her to dig deeper into the city's darkest corners.

With a flicker of determination, Emilia slipped on her trench coat and stepped back into the rain-soaked night, ready to face whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows.
