The air in the cramped radio room crackled with static, mirroring the tension building inside Elara Vance.  She squinted at the oscilloscope, its green line dancing erratically, refusing to settle into a steady rhythm. Outside, the howling wind of the Alaskan winter gnawed at the rickety wooden shack that housed the lone radio beacon in this desolate stretch of wilderness.

Elara wiped a bead of sweat from her brow despite the frigid air. It was past midnight, and the storm had been raging for hours, cutting off all other communication with the outside world. The only lifeline they had was this aging transmitter, and it seemed determined to betray them at the worst possible moment. 

She knew what was riding on her success - or failure.  The team of geologists surveying a remote glacier needed supplies, and their last distress call had been faint and garbled before being swallowed by the storm. Elara wasn't just fixing a radio; she was holding their fate in her hands.
