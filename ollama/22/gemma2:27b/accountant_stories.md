Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew Finchley's fifth-floor office, each drop an insistent drumbeat against the symphony of city noise below.  Bart, as his colleagues affectionately (or perhaps not so affectionately) called him, hunched over a spreadsheet, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and anxiety. 

It was tax season, that annual purgatory for accountants where sleep became a distant memory and every waking moment was consumed by numbers, receipts, and the desperate pleas of clients who'd somehow misplaced their W-2s. Bart, however, wasn't fazed.  He thrived in this chaos, finding solace in the order he could impose on the messy financial lives of others. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along his spine as he reviewed the figures for one particular client: The Hawthorne Trust. Their account was unusually complex, riddled with offshore transactions and shell corporations that seemed to vanish like smoke in the wind.  Bart knew he should simply flag it for further scrutiny, but a gnawing curiosity, an itch he couldn't quite scratch, compelled him to delve deeper.
