The first rays of dawn painted the sky in strokes of rose and gold, highlighting the dew-kissed cobwebs strung between the ancient oaks lining the Elmwood Estate. Elias Blackwood, his weathered face creased into a familiar morning frown, trudged towards the greenhouse, his boots sinking slightly into the damp earth.

Elias had been groundskeeper at Elmwood for over forty years, ever since he was a young lad with calloused hands and dreams of becoming a botanist. Life, however, had other plans. Now, his dreams were buried beneath layers of fallen leaves and forgotten ambitions, replaced by the monotonous routine of tending to the sprawling gardens.

But today felt different. A shiver ran down Elias's spine as he approached the greenhouse, an unsettling premonition twisting in his gut. The air hung heavy with a strange silence, broken only by the rustle of wind through the willow branches. As he pushed open the creaking glass door, a chill colder than the morning breeze swept over him, raising goosebumps on his arms. Something wasn't right.
