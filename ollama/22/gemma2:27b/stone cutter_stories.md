The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's back as he chipped away at a block of Carrara marble, his hammer ringing out against the unforgiving stone. Dust rose in a fine cloud around him, catching the sunlight and shimmering like fallen snow. The air itself seemed thick with the scent of stone – that sharp, mineral tang that Silas had come to associate with home.

His workshop was nestled on the edge of the village of Stonemouth, a ramshackle collection of buildings carved from the very cliffs that loomed behind it. The waves crashed against the shore below, their rhythmic roar mingling with the clang of Silas' hammer and the occasional cries of gulls overhead. It was a sound he knew as well as his own heartbeat, a constant reminder of both his heritage and his calling. 

Silas was not just any stone cutter. He was a Blackwood, descended from generations who had carved beauty and permanence out of the unforgiving rock of the cliffs. Their legacy ran deep in Stonemouth, etched into the very fabric of the village – from the graceful arches of the market square to the intricate carvings adorning the tombstones in the ancient graveyard.
