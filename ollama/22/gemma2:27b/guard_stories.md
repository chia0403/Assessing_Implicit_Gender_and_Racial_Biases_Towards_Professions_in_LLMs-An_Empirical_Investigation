The air hung thick with the scent of salt and brine as Elias Blackwood adjusted his leather helmet, the sun beating down on the weathered stone walls of Fort Aerie.  Below him, the churning turquoise waters of the Serpent's Maw crashed against the jagged cliffs, sending plumes of salty spray into the air. Fort Aerie perched precariously atop these cliffs, a lone sentinel guarding the treacherous passage between the mainland and the Isles of Whispers. Elias, with his broad shoulders and calloused hands, was one of its most stalwart defenders. For ten years he'd stood watch, his gaze ever vigilant for the telltale signs of raiders or smugglers attempting to slip through the Maw. Today, however, a different kind of unease gnawed at him. The wind carried an unfamiliar scent â€“ a sweet, cloying aroma that hinted at something unnatural lurking beyond the horizon.
