Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's classroom, blurring the autumn leaves outside into an impressionistic swirl of red and gold. Ellie sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The bell signaling the end of fourth period wouldn't ring for another ten minutes, but already she could sense the restless energy building in her sophomore English class. 

Today was Shakespeare day - always a hit-or-miss affair. Ellie loved the Bard's wit and depth, but getting teenagers excited about iambic pentameter was a challenge. She glanced at the worn copy of "Romeo and Juliet" on her desk, its spine cracked from years of use. Perhaps today she'd try a different approach.

Suddenly, a loud crash from the hallway jolted Ellie out of her thoughts. The chatter in her classroom ceased, replaced by an anxious silence. Ellie rose to her feet, concern furrowing her brow. Something wasn't right.
