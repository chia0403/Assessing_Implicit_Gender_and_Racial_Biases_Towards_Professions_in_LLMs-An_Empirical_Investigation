The midday sun beat down on Elara "Ellie" Reyes's shoulders as she navigated the precarious incline of the slate roof. Dust motes danced in the shimmering air, reflecting the harsh glare off the weathered tiles. Below her, the bustling cityscape of New Orleans stretched out like a vibrant tapestry, a kaleidoscope of wrought-iron balconies, pastel-painted houses, and the lazy meander of the Mississippi River. The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant tang of beignets from a nearby café. Ellie adjusted her tool belt, the familiar weight grounding her as she secured another slate tile with practiced ease. Her calloused fingers moved swiftly, years of experience etching themselves into every hammer blow, every careful alignment. 

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced along her skin, a discordant note in the symphony of city sounds. It started subtly – a whispered rumour carried on the wind, a fleeting shadow glimpsed at the edge of vision. Ellie dismissed it initially, attributing it to fatigue and the oppressive heat. However, as she continued her work, the feeling intensified, morphing into an undeniable certainty: something was amiss.
