The velvet curtains hung heavy, absorbing the nervous hum that vibrated through the Grand Majestic Theatre.  A spotlight lanced across the dusty stage, catching motes of dust swirling in its beam.  Eleanor Vance, her silver hair pulled back tight in a bun, paced backstage, the rhythm of her heels on the worn wooden floor echoing the frantic beat of her heart. Tonight was opening night for "The Tempest," Eleanor's ambitious reimagining of Shakespeare's classic. She'd poured her soul into this production, pushing boundaries with a set design that mimicked a storm-ravaged island and casting unknown actors who she felt possessed the raw talent to truly embody their roles. 

But now, with the audience poised beyond the curtain, doubt gnawed at Eleanor's confidence.  Would they understand her vision? Would the unconventional staging work? The weight of expectation pressed down on her. She glanced at the clock - it was time. Taking a deep breath, she straightened her black dress and murmured a silent prayer to the theatre gods. 

"Places, everyone!" she called out, her voice ringing with newfound resolve. "Let the storm begin."
