Rain lashed against the windowpane of Beatrice Evelyn Hawthorne's cozy office, blurring the bustling London street below into an Impressionist painting. The scent of Earl Grey tea mingled with the earthy aroma of roasted beetroot and cumin wafting from her lunch – a vibrant salad she’d lovingly prepared that morning. Beatrice, ever the picture of health in her linen dress and sensible shoes, surveyed the scene with a satisfied sigh. As a renowned nutritionist, her days were filled with guiding people towards a healthier relationship with food. Yet, today felt different. A sense of unease tugged at her, a feeling she couldn't quite place.

Just as she was about to dig into her salad, her phone buzzed. It was an email from a new client, requesting a consultation at the earliest possible convenience. The subject line read simply: "Desperate."
