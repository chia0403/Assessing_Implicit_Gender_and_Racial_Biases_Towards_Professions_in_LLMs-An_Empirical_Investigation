The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Professor Evelyn Beaumont’s office, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the fragile barrier between her and the storm raging outside.  Thunder growled low in the distance, mimicking the unease that churned within her stomach. Her cluttered desk, usually a battlefield of papers and forgotten coffee mugs, was tonight dominated by a single artifact: a small, intricately carved wooden box, no larger than her hand. It emanated an unsettling warmth, a faint pulsing glow emanating from beneath its lid, which she'd been inexplicably drawn to pry open all afternoon.

Evelyn Beaumont’s study, tucked away in the shadowy eaves of St. Sybil’s College, was a haven for forgotten lore and dusty tomes. Stacks of ancient manuscripts threatened to topple over, their pages whispering forgotten secrets in languages she alone could decipher. The scent of beeswax and old parchment hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed her. Tonight, however, it did little to quell the rising tide of apprehension.  The box pulsed again, its warmth intensifying, beckoning her closer.

Evelyn hesitated. Years of academic rigor had taught her caution. Yet, something about this object, unearthed from a long-forgotten tomb deep within the Egyptian desert, felt different. It called to her with an urgency she couldn't ignore. Her fingers trembled as they reached for the lid, poised on the precipice of unlocking a mystery that could rewrite history – or perhaps doom them all.
