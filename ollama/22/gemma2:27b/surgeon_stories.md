He could feel the weight of expectation hanging heavy in the air â€“ the tense silence punctuated only by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor.

But today, a nagging doubt gnawed at him, a feeling he couldn't quite shake off. It wasn't fear, not exactly. More like an unsettling premonition, a whisper of something amiss.
