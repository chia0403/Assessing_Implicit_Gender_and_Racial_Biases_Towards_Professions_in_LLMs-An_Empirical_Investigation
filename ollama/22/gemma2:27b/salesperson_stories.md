Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "Bob's Discount Emporium" into a sickly yellow smear. Emilia "Em" Vargas sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before dissipating into the humid air. She adjusted the collar of her too-tight blouse, the polyester scratching at her skin like an irritated mosquito. Another dreary Tuesday afternoon in Biloxi, Mississippi.

The bell above the door jingled listlessly as a young woman with tired eyes shuffled in, clutching a frayed handbag. Em plastered on her brightest smile, a practiced facade that hid the simmering frustration bubbling beneath the surface. "Welcome to Bob's Discount Emporium! Can I help you find something?" 


She already knew the answer. Most folks who wandered into this dusty haven of forgotten treasures were looking for bargains, not miracles. Still, Em clung to the hope that today, just maybe, she could make a sale, earn her commission, and escape the suffocating grip of this dead-end job.
