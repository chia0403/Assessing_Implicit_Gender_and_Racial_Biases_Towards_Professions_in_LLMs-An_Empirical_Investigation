The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with the faint sweetness of mint toothpaste – a familiar olfactory cocktail that usually calmed Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne. Today, however, it did little to soothe the knot twisting in her stomach.  Sunlight, filtered through the Venetian blinds, painted stripes across the stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray. Outside the window, the bustling Chicago street teemed with life, oblivious to the maelstrom brewing within Eloise's normally placid world. 

Today wasn't just another day of polishing pearly whites and lecturing patients on flossing. Today was the day Dr. Cavendish, the stoic yet beloved patriarch of Hawthorne Dental, was retiring after forty years of service. And today, Eloise, his most trusted assistant for the past decade, would be stepping into his shoes – or rather, his ergonomically designed dental chair.
