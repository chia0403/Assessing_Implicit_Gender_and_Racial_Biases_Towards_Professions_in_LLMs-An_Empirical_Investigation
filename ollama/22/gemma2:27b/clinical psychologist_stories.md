The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across Dr. Evelyn Albright's tired face. "Open 24 Hours," it proclaimed in bold, electric letters, mocking her current state of insomnia-induced delirium. She pushed open the heavy glass door of the diner, the bell above jingling a discordant welcome. The aroma of stale coffee and frying grease hung thick in the air, a far cry from the lavender scented candles that usually graced her minimalist office.

Evelyn had been staring at the ceiling for hours, wrestling with a particularly complex case. A young woman named Amelia, plagued by vivid nightmares and crippling anxiety, refused to divulge the root cause of her distress. Evelyn felt an unsettling sense of urgency - Amelia's fear was palpable, a tangible entity that seemed to seep through the walls of their sessions.


Driven by a desperate need for clarity, Evelyn had found herself drawn to the all-night diner across the street from her apartment building. Maybe a greasy burger and a bottomless cup of coffee would jumpstart her stagnant thoughts. Or maybe, just maybe, she'd find an unexpected muse in the late-night denizens of this greasy spoon.
