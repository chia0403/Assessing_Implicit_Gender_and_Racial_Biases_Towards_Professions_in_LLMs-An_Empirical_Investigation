Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Sterling & Thorne Detective Agency, blurring the neon sign outside into a hazy, electric smear. Inside, Penelope Everleigh meticulously straightened a stack of case files, each one whispering tales of infidelity, missing persons, and stolen jewels. The aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of damp wool from Penelope's threadbare coat.

The late afternoon sun struggled to pierce the gloom, casting long shadows across the cluttered office. Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating faded photographs pinned to a corkboard â€“ a reminder of past cases solved and lives touched. Penelope glanced at the vintage clock ticking relentlessly on the wall. 4:47 pm.  Mr. Sterling was due back any minute from his latest stakeout, and she knew he'd expect his usual steaming mug of Earl Grey tea waiting for him.

Suddenly, a thunderous clap echoed through the room, followed by the jarring clang of the office door slamming open. Penelope jumped, her heart hammering against her ribs. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, rain dripping from their trench coat and fedora, obscuring their face in shadow.  Penelope felt a prickle of unease as they strode towards her desk, the floorboards groaning under their weight.
