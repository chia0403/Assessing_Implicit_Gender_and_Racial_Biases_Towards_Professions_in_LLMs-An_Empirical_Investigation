Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into streaks of purple and orange. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Vance gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white as bone. The siren's wail cut through the storm, a desperate plea echoing Ellie's own anxieties. 

They were headed towards a reported multi-vehicle pileup on the I-95, details sparse but grim. Ellie had been an EMT for five years, and she knew that "multi-vehicle" often translated to carnage. Her stomach churned with a familiar cocktail of adrenaline and dread.  

She glanced at her partner, Marco Diaz, who sat calmly beside her, reviewing patient charts on his tablet. Marco was a rock, unflappable even in the most chaotic situations. Ellie envied his serenity. She wished she could bottle it up and take a swig whenever the weight of responsibility threatened to crush her. 

As they neared the accident scene, the flashing red and blue lights of emergency vehicles painted the rain-slicked asphalt with an eerie glow. The sight that greeted them upon arrival was worse than Ellie had imagined. Twisted metal, shattered glass, and the haunting stillness of crumpled bodies stretched across the highway. This wasn't just a pileup; it was a massacre.
