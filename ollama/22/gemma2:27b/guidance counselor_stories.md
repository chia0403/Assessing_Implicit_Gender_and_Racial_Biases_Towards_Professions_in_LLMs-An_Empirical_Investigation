The stale air in Ms. Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright's office hung heavy with the scent of desperation and cheap cologne. Bea, her auburn hair escaping its bun like rebellious vines, sighed as she watched Jeremy fidget across from her. Seventeen going on thirty-seven, Jeremy was a walking contradiction – swaggering confidence masking deep insecurities, his designer sneakers scuffing against the worn linoleum floor.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the barred windows of Northwood High's guidance counselor office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the fading light. Outside, the cacophony of the school day was winding down – distant lockers slamming, muffled laughter echoing from the football field. But within these four walls, Bea felt trapped in a perpetual storm of teenage angst. 


Jeremy cleared his throat, breaking the silence. "So, uh, Ms. Cartwright," he started, his voice cracking slightly. "About college..."

Bea leaned forward, her sharp blue eyes meeting Jeremy's uncertain gaze. Northwood High was known for its lackluster academic performance, and Jeremy was no exception. This conversation, Bea knew, wouldn't be easy.
