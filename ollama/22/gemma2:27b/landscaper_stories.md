The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn bougainvillea vine, coaxing it to climb the trellis instead of choking out its more delicate neighbors. Eli loved this part of the job - coaxing life from the desert soil, transforming barren landscapes into vibrant oases. But today, even the scent of citrus blossoms couldn't mask the acrid tang of unease that lingered in the air.

He was working on Mrs. Hawthorne's sprawling estate, nestled at the foot of the McDowell Mountains.  She was a reclusive woman with eyes as sharp as desert hawks and a reputation for being just as unforgiving. Her meticulously manicured gardens were Eli's responsibility, each bloom and blade of grass subject to her exacting scrutiny.

Today, though, something felt different. The usual symphony of birdsong seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the distant hum of cicadas. As Eli paused, wiping his brow with a calloused hand, he noticed a glint of metal reflecting in the sun. It was partially hidden beneath a tangle of rosemary bushes near the edge of the property. Curiosity gnawed at him, but something about the scene – the unnatural stillness, the glint of metal – sent a shiver down his spine.
