Rain hammered against the frosted glass of Alistair Finch's office window, mimicking the insistent drumming in his skull. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a heady cocktail he'd grown intimately familiar with over the years. 

His desk, a scarred mahogany behemoth groaning under the weight of files and half-empty whiskey bottles, reflected the city outside: grimy, unforgiving, perpetually shrouded in shadows. Alistair himself mirrored the city’s mood – ruggedly handsome in a world-weary kind of way, his grey eyes reflecting the constant struggle against darkness that defined his life as a private detective in the rain-soaked alleyways of 1940s Chicago.


The door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a woman wrapped in a crimson coat. Her face was obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, casting her features into shadow. Alistair straightened in his chair, the muscles in his jaw tightening as he watched her approach.

"Mr. Finch?" Her voice was low and husky, laced with a hint of something dangerous. "I believe you can help me."
