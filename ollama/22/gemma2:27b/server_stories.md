The sticky heat of the July afternoon pressed down on Amelia "Amy" Cartwright like an invisible hand. Beads of sweat gathered at her hairline, threatening to drip onto the crisp white tablecloth she was meticulously folding.  

The diner, "Betty's Bite," buzzed with the usual lunchtime cacophony: sizzling bacon, the clatter of forks against plates, and the murmured conversations of regulars catching up on gossip. Amy navigated the cramped space with practiced ease, her worn-out sneakers squeaking softly against the linoleum floor. Outside, the sun beat down mercilessly on Main Street, turning the asphalt shimmering and hazy.

Suddenly, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. A figure emerged from the blinding light, casting a long shadow across the checkered floor. Amy straightened, her hand instinctively reaching for her notepad, ready to greet the stranger who had just stepped into her world.
