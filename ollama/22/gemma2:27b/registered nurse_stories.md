The relentless clang of the overhead trolley echoed through the sterile white halls of Mercy General Hospital, slicing through Amelia Rose Hawthorne's already frayed nerves.  Sweat prickled beneath her pale blue scrubs as she hurried towards Room 207, the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor growing louder with each step. Tonight felt different. Heavier. The air itself seemed to crackle with an unspoken tension, a premonition that Amelia couldn't quite shake.

She pushed open the door, her eyes immediately drawn to the figure slumped in the hospital bed – Mr. Henderson, his face pale and drawn, tubes snaking from his frail body like metallic vines. The monitor beeped erratically, its shrill cry mirroring the anxiety clenching at Amelia's chest.  She knew this man, knew his wife who always brought him fresh-baked cookies and her infectious smile that brightened even the dreariest ward. Now, only a grim silence hung in the air, broken only by the rasp of Mr. Henderson's labored breaths. 

Amelia swallowed hard, forcing down the wave of dread threatening to engulf her. This was her job. She had sworn an oath – to heal, to comfort, to fight for every life entrusted to her care.  Tonight, she would face that challenge head-on, even if it meant battling demons both within and without.
