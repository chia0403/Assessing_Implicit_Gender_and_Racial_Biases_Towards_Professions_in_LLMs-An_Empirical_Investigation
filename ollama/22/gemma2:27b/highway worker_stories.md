The Nevada sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's shoulders like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his brow and stung his eyes, but he dared not wipe it away. Not with the rumble of the asphalt grinder echoing in his ears, threatening to swallow up any stray movement. Eli squinted at the shimmering ribbon of highway stretching before him, the endless desert landscape blurring into a hazy mirage beyond.

He gripped the shovel tighter, its familiar weight a comfort against the relentless heat.  This stretch of Highway 95 had been their nemesis for weeks, a stubborn beast refusing to yield to the asphalt grinder's teeth. The ground beneath it was riddled with ancient caliche, a hardened layer of calcium carbonate that turned into concrete when dry.

Eli glanced at his crewmates battling the relentless sun and unforgiving earth. Old man Johnson, a grizzled veteran with more callouses than wrinkles, grunted as he wrestled a chunk of stubborn rock. Young Carlos, fresh out of high school, wiped sweat from his forehead with a bandanna that read "Highway to Heaven." Eli couldn't help but smile wryly; the irony wasn't lost on him.


This stretch of highway was anything but heavenly.
