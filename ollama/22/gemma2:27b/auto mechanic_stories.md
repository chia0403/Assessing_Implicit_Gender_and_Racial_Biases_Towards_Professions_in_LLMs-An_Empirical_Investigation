The air hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and gasoline, a familiar perfume to Elias “Eli” Finch.  Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows of Finch’s Fix-It, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the chrome bumpers of half-dismantled cars scattered across the garage floor. Eli wiped grease-stained hands on his faded overalls, squinting at the engine block before him. It was a classic '67 Mustang, its once vibrant blue paint now dulled with rust and neglect.

This wasn't just any job for Eli; it belonged to Mrs. Evelyn Davies, the town librarian and owner of the only bookstore within fifty miles. She’d entrusted him with her late husband's prized possession, a car filled with memories she couldn't bear to part with.  Eli knew he had to make it sing again.
