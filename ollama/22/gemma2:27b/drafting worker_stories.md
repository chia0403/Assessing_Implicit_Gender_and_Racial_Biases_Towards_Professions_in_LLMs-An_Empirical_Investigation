The whirring of the mechanical pencils in the drafting room was like a lullaby Elias Finch had come to both cherish and loathe. It was a constant hum that filled the air, punctuated by the sharp snap of rulers and the rustle of tracing paper. Elias, hunched over his board, traced delicate lines with his own mechanical pencil, his brow furrowed in concentration as he translated the architect's vision into precise blueprints.

Outside, the Chicago wind howled, whipping snow against the frosted windows of the firm's office building. It was December 1947, and a bitter chill had settled over the city. But inside the drafting room, the air was warm and tinged with the faint scent of ink and graphite. Elias, lost in his work, barely noticed the storm raging beyond the glass. His world was confined to the lines on his paper, the measured angles and precise dimensions that held the promise of bringing a building into being.
