The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Rose Thornton's window, mimicking the relentless pounding in her chest. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionistic watercolor, a fitting reflection of the chaos swirling within her own mind.  

Her office, nestled on the 12th floor overlooking Chicago's bustling Magnificent Mile, was usually a sanctuary of calm. Today, however, the plush armchair where she usually listened to her patients' woes felt like a cage. The scent of lavender oil, normally soothing, seemed cloying, amplifying the anxiety that tightened its grip around Amelia's throat. 

A manila envelope sat on her desk, unopened. It contained the results of a test, a test Amelia had dreaded taking for years. A test that could potentially shatter her carefully constructed world. She stared at it, willing herself to tear it open, to face the truth hidden within its folds. But fear, cold and paralyzing, held her captive.
