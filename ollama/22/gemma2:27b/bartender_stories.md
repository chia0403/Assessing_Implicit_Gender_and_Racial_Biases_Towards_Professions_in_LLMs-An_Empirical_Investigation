Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Tap, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an Impressionist smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the sour tang of spilled beer.  Elias Finch adjusted his bowtie, the silver glinting dully under the dim fluorescent lights. He was a man carved from the bar itself - weathered, sturdy, with eyes that held the weariness of countless late nights and forgotten dreams. 

Elias surveyed his domain: two weary businessmen drowning their sorrows in whiskey sours, a solitary woman nursing a glass of red wine while staring out into the storm, and a gaggle of college students huddled around a pool table, their laughter punctuated by the clatter of balls.  It was a Tuesday night, and The Rusty Tap was pulsating with its usual rhythm of quiet desperation and fleeting camaraderie.
