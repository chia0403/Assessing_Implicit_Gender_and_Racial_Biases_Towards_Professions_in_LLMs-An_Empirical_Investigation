The humid air hung thick in the tiny salon, smelling faintly of acetone and jasmine.  

Esmeralda "Esme" Rivera tapped her acrylic-painted nails impatiently against the chipped Formica countertop, her eyes flitting between the flickering neon sign outside ("Nails by Esme - Walk-ins Welcome!") and the empty waiting chairs. Tuesday afternoons were always slow, a lull before the Wednesday evening rush of women prepping for their weekend outings. 

Esme sighed, her reflection in the dusty mirror behind the counter staring back with a tired, but determined gaze. She'd poured her heart and savings into this place, hoping to build something beautiful, something hers. But lately, the chipped paint and creaky floorboards seemed to mock her ambition. Still, she refused to give up. Esme was known for her artistry, her ability to transform ordinary nails into tiny canvases of color and design. She just needed the right client to walk through that door â€“ someone who would see the magic hidden beneath the surface.
