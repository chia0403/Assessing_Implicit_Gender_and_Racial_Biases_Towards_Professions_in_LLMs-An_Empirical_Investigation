Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Winthrop's vintage Volvo, blurring the already-faded grandeur of the Victorian mansion looming before her. The wrought iron gates, once an impressive symbol of wealth, hung precariously from one rusted hinge, groaning like a mournful ghost in the wind.  Eleanor sighed, tugging at the collar of her crisp white blouse. This was going to be a tough sell.

The address: 17 Blackwood Manor Lane, perched atop Widow's Hill, notorious for its unsettling history and even more unsettling current state. Eleanor knew she shouldn't have taken this listing â€“ it reeked of bad karma and whispered promises of things best left undisturbed. Yet, the commission was too tempting to resist, especially in a market as stagnant as hers. 


As Eleanor climbed out of her car, a shiver danced down her spine, and not just from the cold rain.  The house seemed to watch her with vacant eyes, its crumbling facade shrouded in shadows that stretched and twisted like grasping claws.  Taking a deep breath, she grabbed her briefcase and approached the front door, hoping she wouldn't regret this decision before the day was done.
