Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-colored water.  The air hung heavy with the smell of mildew and ozone, punctuated by the sharp tang of burnt copper. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch crouched beneath a flickering fluorescent light, his forehead furrowed in concentration as he traced the frayed wires snaking across the dusty floor.

This wasn't exactly the glamorous gig Bart had envisioned when he'd signed up for electrician school. He'd dreamed of rewiring gleaming skyscrapers, installing state-of-the-art lighting systems in luxury homes. Instead, he found himself in this decaying industrial wasteland, troubleshooting a power surge that threatened to fry the antique machinery housed within.  The owner, a wizened old inventor named Professor Hemlock, swore it was no ordinary surge â€“ something sinister lurked within the wiring, something he couldn't explain.
