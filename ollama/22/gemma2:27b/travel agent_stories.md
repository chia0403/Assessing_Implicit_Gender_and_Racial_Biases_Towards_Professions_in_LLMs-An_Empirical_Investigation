Esmeralda, with her auburn hair perpetually escaping its braid and eyes that shimmered with a restless yearning for distant shores, was facing her biggest professional challenge yet.

Esmeralda stared out at the grey drizzle, wondering if her dream of sharing the world's wonders was destined to evaporate along with the vanishing rain puddles.
