The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and desperation. ElizaBeth "Ellie" Beaumont surveyed her creation with a critical eye, her brow furrowing beneath a dusting of powdered sugar. A three-tiered monstrosity loomed before her, its buttercream frosting lopsided, the fondant roses wilting like forgotten dreams. The groom's name, meticulously piped in swirling script, was starting to bleed into the delicate floral pattern.

Ellie was supposed to be the Cake Queen, the go-to gal for edible masterpieces that left guests speechless and Instagram feeds overflowing with envy. But today, she felt more like a cake jester, her skills failing her at the most crucial moment. 

It was Mrs. Hathaway's wedding, a lavish affair being held in the grand ballroom of the Grandview Hotel, overlooking the glittering expanse of Lake Serenity. Ellie knew this cake was supposed to be the centrepiece, the sugar-spun testament to true love. But right now, it resembled something more akin to a sugared disaster zone.
