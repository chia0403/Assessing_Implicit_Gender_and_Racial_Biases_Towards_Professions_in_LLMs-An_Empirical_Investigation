Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic beat of Amelia Blackwood's heart. She sat hunched over her typewriter, fingers hovering above the keys, paralyzed by a sudden, crippling doubt.

The cramped attic room was dimly lit by a single bare bulb dangling from the ceiling, casting long shadows that danced across stacks of dusty manuscripts and forgotten childhood trinkets. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and aged paper, a familiar comfort Amelia usually found conducive to her writing. But tonight, inspiration had abandoned her, replaced by a gnawing fear. 

Her latest novel, "The Whispering Walls," was due to her agent in two weeks, but she felt utterly lost. The words wouldn't come, the characters refusing to cooperate.  Amelia stared at the blank page, the cursor blinking like a mocking eye, daring her to fill it with something, anything.

Was this it? Was she finally done? Had the well of imagination dried up, leaving her stranded in a desolate landscape of creative bankruptcy?
