The scent of overcooked popcorn and stale gym socks hung heavy in the air of Northwood High's gymnasium.  Eleanor Finch, Ed.D., adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses and grimaced. This was not how she envisioned spending her Friday afternoon. Yet, here she was, perched on a folding chair amongst a sea of restless teenagers, preparing to lead an "Active Listening" workshop for the school's troubled athletes.

Northwood High sat nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, its red brick facade a familiar sight to generations of students.  But beneath its charming exterior lay a current of unease. The recent string of disciplinary issues amongst the football team had prompted the principal to call in Dr. Finch for a "proactive intervention." Eleanor, a woman whose empathy ran deep and whose patience was legendary, hoped she could make a difference. But as she surveyed the room full of sullen faces, she couldn't help but wonder if this workshop was truly the answer.
