Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Now," blurring the already dim streetlights into shimmering orbs. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously folded a lavender-scented towel, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic patter of rain usually soothed her, but tonight it felt oppressive, mirroring the tightness in her own chest. A new client was scheduled to arrive any minute, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling of unease. It wasn't uncommon for clients to be nervous before a massage, but this one had requested a specific treatment - "deep tissue release" - with a heavy emphasis on her shoulders and neck.  Eleanor specialized in gentle touch and stress relief, not muscle manipulation. 

She glanced at the clock ticking on the wall. 7:58 p.m. Two minutes until her appointment. Taking a deep breath, Eleanor steeled herself. She was a professional, after all. Her hands were trained to ease tension, not create it.  But as the door creaked open and a tall figure silhouetted against the storm stepped inside, Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine. Something about this client - the way he held himself, the intensity in his gaze even from a distance - sent a ripple of apprehension through her.
