The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and cinnamon as Eliza Beaumont kneaded the dough, her strong arms working in rhythmic unison. Dawn had barely broken, painting the sky in hues of lavender and peach, but Eliza's day was already in full swing. The little bakery nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Prague hummed with quiet activity. 

Eliza, her auburn hair escaping its braid and dusting her freckled cheeks with flour, glanced at the clock ticking away above the ancient oven.  6:15 am. Soon the aroma wafting from her open doorway would draw the neighborhood regulars - the butcher with his gruff smile, Mrs. Novak and her mischievous dachshund, even the stern librarian who always ordered a single poppyseed strudel, eaten with a delicate fork and an air of scholarly contemplation.

It wasn't just the premonition tingling at the back of her neck; it was the strange note tucked beneath her doormat last night, bearing only a cryptic message: "The secret ingredient is hidden in plain sight."
