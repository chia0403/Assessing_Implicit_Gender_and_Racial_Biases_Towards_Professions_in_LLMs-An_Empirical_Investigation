Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Eleanor Blackwood’s office, blurring the lights of the city below into an Impressionist smear. The scent of old paper and leather mingled with the damp chill seeping through the ancient stone walls of the building, creating a uniquely melancholic atmosphere.

A stack of case files towered beside her, each representing a life in turmoil, a web of legal complexities that demanded her attention. But tonight, Eleanor’s mind was far from contracts and courtrooms.  She was wrestling with a different kind of case, one that had no precedent in law books – the disappearance of her brother, Samuel.
