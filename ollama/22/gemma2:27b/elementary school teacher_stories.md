Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's third-grade classroom, blurring the vibrant crayon drawings of autumn leaves plastered across the glass. The usual afternoon buzz of excited chatter was replaced by a low hum of anticipation. Tomorrow was Halloween, and the air crackled with the nervous energy of sugar-fueled dreams and spooky costumes.

Eloise, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their bun and a smudge of glitter paint on her cheek from helping a student earlier, surveyed her classroom with a smile. She loved this time of year – the creativity, the excitement, the shared sense of wonder that seemed to permeate every corner. But beneath her cheery facade, a knot of unease tightened in Eloise's stomach. This Halloween felt different. An unsettling chill lingered in the air, one she couldn’t quite explain.
