The whirring drill was like a lullaby to Dr. Evelyn Blackwood, its high-pitched whine a familiar symphony in the sterile sanctuary of her office. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air above the pristine white enamel chair.  

Evelyn peered into Amelia Johnson's open mouth, her brow furrowed in concentration as she navigated the labyrinthine network of molars and incisors. The scent of mint toothpaste mingled with a faint metallic tang – the unmistakable aroma of dentistry. Outside, the bustling streets of London hummed with life, oblivious to the intricate ballet unfolding within the confines of Evelyn's practice.

But today, something felt different. A sense of unease prickled at the edges of Evelyn’s awareness. It wasn't Amelia's nervous fidgeting or the slight tremor in her hand that held the dental mirror; it was a subtle shift in the air, an intangible premonition that whispered of something amiss.

Perhaps it was the unusually insistent buzzing from the intercom, interrupting their session with a jarring urgency. Or maybe it was the chillingly vacant expression Amelia wore despite her attempts at forced smiles. Whatever it was, Evelyn couldn't shake off the feeling that this appointment was merely the prelude to something far more unsettling.
