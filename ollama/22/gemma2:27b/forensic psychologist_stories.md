Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the steel table and two chairs facing each other. Across from her sat Elias Thorne, a man whose haunted eyes and trembling hands spoke volumes before he uttered a single word.  

Eleanor, with her sharp intellect and uncanny ability to peel back the layers of the human psyche, had been called in to assess Elias's sanity after a series of disturbing events. The quaint seaside town of Havenwood, usually known for its tranquil beaches and charming lighthouse, was reeling from the discovery of three ritualistic murders, each victim bearing an intricate symbol carved onto their chests.

The evidence pointed towards Elias, a recluse who lived on the outskirts of town in a crumbling Victorian manor surrounded by gnarled oak trees. But Eleanor, staring into Elias's tormented gaze, couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this case than met the eye.  Was he a calculating killer, driven by madness, or a pawn in a larger, more sinister game? The answer, she knew, lay buried somewhere within the labyrinthine corridors of his mind.
