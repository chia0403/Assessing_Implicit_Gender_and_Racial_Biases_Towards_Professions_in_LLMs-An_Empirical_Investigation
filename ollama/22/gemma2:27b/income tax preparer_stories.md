Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Agnes Clementine Peabody's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Taxes Done Right" sign outside. The incessant drumming mirrored the anxiety thrumming in her chest. April 15th loomed just three days away, and the mountain of tax returns on her desk seemed to grow taller with each passing hour. Agnes, a woman built like a sturdy oak tree with auburn hair perpetually escaping its bun, sighed and rubbed her tired eyes. She wasn't cut out for this last-minute rush.  She preferred the quiet satisfaction of meticulously sifting through receipts and forms in the calm months before the deadline. But this year, life had thrown her curveballs - a broken leg, followed by a deluge of new clients thanks to a glowing recommendation from a satisfied elderly couple. 

Now, surrounded by coffee mugs stained with yesterday's caffeine fix and stacks of crumpled W-2s threatening to topple over, Agnes wondered if she'd ever see the light of day again.
