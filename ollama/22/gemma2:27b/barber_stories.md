The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' barbershop was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, punctuated by the sharp snip-snip of his scissors. Outside, the midday sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves. Bart, however, remained oblivious, lost in the intricacies of crafting a perfect pompadour.

His shop, "Bart's Blades," was a haven from the bustle of the city.  Wood paneling lined the walls, adorned with framed photos of local celebrities - politicians, athletes, and even a few faded movie stars - all sporting Bart's signature haircuts. A worn leather barber chair groaned under the weight of Mr. Henderson, a retired schoolteacher who always ordered his hair "short on the sides, long on top, just like I had it in '62."

Bart paused, wiping away a stray hair from Mr. Henderson's forehead with a practiced flick of his wrist. He glanced out the window, noticing a figure slouching towards the shop, their face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. A shiver ran down Bart's spine. This wasn't a regular Elm Street face.

Something about that figure whispered trouble.
