The salty tang of the sea air whipped Amelia Cartwright's auburn braid against her cheek as she surveyed the crumbling facade of the Grand Blackwood Hotel. Perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the wild Atlantic, it was a monument to faded grandeur – once a playground for the wealthy and influential, now a hollow shell haunted by whispers of its past.

Amelia had come to the remote Cornish village of St. Ives drawn by the hotel's melancholy beauty and the challenge of restoring it to its former glory. She specialized in breathing new life into forgotten structures, finding poetry in their weathered bones. This project, however, felt different – imbued with a certain weight, an unspoken history that tugged at her intuition.  

As she sketched the intricate details of the wrought-iron balcony, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The wind rustled through the overgrown gardens, carrying with it the faint echo of laughter and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead. Was it just the solitude playing tricks on her mind, or was there something more to this place?
