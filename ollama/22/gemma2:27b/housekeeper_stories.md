The worn brass key rattled in Esmeralda "Esme" Finch's palm, its familiar weight grounding her as she stepped through the arched doorway. The air inside Blackwood Manor hung heavy with the scent of beeswax and dust, a comforting aroma Esme had come to associate with quiet solitude and forgotten stories.  Sunlight filtered weakly through the grime-coated windows, painting the cavernous hall in shades of grey. Cobwebs draped like ghostly curtains from the ornate chandelier, its crystals dulled with age. This was her domain, at least for the hours she spent here scrubbing floors, polishing silver, and breathing life back into the faded grandeur.

But today felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the stillness, a subtle shift in the manor's usual melancholy.  Esme paused, her gaze drawn to a single, crimson rose lying on the mahogany table by the grand staircase â€“ a splash of vibrant colour in the monochrome world of Blackwood Manor.
