Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the vibrant mural depicting overflowing baskets of fruits and vegetables outside. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, peering over the rim at the young woman seated opposite her.

Amelia's office was a haven of calm amidst the storm raging outside. Sunlight streamed through the skylight, illuminating shelves crammed with cookbooks and jars filled with vibrantly coloured grains and legumes. The air smelled faintly of cinnamon and ginger from a diffuser tucked away in the corner. 

Amelia had dedicated her life to helping people find joy in healthy eating. As a registered dietician, she believed food was not just fuel, but a powerful tool for healing and happiness. But today, Amelia faced a challenge unlike any other. The young woman, Sarah, sat hunched over, her eyes downcast. She clutched a crumpled tissue in her hand, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.
