The air hung thick and humid in the corrugated iron shed, smelling faintly of disinfectant and something wilder – musk, fur, feathers. Eleanor Finch tugged her worn bandana tighter against the sweat beading on her brow as she reached into a cage, her calloused fingers gently coaxing a startled sparrow back onto its perch.  The bird chirped nervously, wings trembling, its tiny heart hammering against Eleanor's palm.

Eleanor worked at The Haven, a ramshackle rescue center nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont. Surrounded by fields bursting with wildflowers and ancient oak trees, it seemed an unlikely place for a sanctuary filled with creatures as diverse as orphaned raccoons, injured owls, and even the occasional rogue alligator snapping turtle – all rescued from misfortune or neglect. 

Eleanor loved each creature under her care fiercely.  She saw their vulnerability, understood their fear, and dedicated herself to mending broken wings, soothing fractured bones, and nursing them back to health.
