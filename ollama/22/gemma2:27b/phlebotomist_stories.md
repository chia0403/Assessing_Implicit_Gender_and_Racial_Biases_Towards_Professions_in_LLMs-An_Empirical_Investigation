Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon sign outside that proclaimed "Sunshine Urgent Care" in garishly optimistic hues.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant and the muted sighs of weary patients. Eloise Cartwright, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, expertly maneuvered the needle into the crook of an elderly man's arm.

"Just a little pinch, Mr. Henderson," she murmured, her voice soothing despite the growing ache in her own wrist.  She glanced at the clock: 9:47 pm. Another hour and a half, then home to a microwaved dinner and the endless cycle of reruns on cable TV. Eloise wasn't unhappy exactly – drawing blood was all she knew, all she'd ever done since graduating phlebotomy school two years ago – but a gnawing sense of restlessness had begun to take root within her. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable shift in the air, like the moment before a storm breaks. As Eloise taped Mr. Henderson's arm and handed him a cotton ball, she couldn't shake the feeling that tonight wouldn't be ordinary. And then, the door to the waiting room flew open with a bang, ushering in a figure drenched and breathless, eyes wide with fear.
