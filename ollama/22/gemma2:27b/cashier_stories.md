The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Ramirez's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of discounted groceries. The air smelled faintly of bleach and day-old produce, a familiar scent that clung to her like a second skin after six hours on the clock. Esmeralda sighed, idly tapping a chipped nail against the worn countertop. Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the asphalt parking lot, turning it into a shimmering mirage. It was Tuesday afternoon, the slowest time of the week at "Bargain Bonanza," and Esmeralda longed for anything to break the monotony – even a screaming toddler demanding candy. 

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer. Esmeralda straightened her nametag and plastered on a smile, her heart sinking when she saw who it was. A tall man in a worn leather jacket, his face hidden by the shadow of a fedora, sauntered towards her register.  He had been a regular fixture at Bargain Bonanza for weeks, always purchasing a single can of peaches with cash, never making eye contact. Today, however, something felt different. As he reached the counter, Esmeralda noticed a glint in his hand – a glint that looked suspiciously like the edge of a blade.
