Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The stale scent of coffee mingled with the acrid tang of cheap tobacco, remnants of her late-night partner's chain-smoking habit. Outside, the neon glow of the Rialto Theater flickered intermittently, casting grotesque shadows on the rain-slicked alleyway below.

This was Little Italy, a neighborhood steeped in tradition and shadowed by secrets. A place where loyalty ran deeper than blood, and whispers carried more weight than shouts. Tonight, those whispers promised trouble â€“ a brutal murder that had Izzy staring into the abyss of her own past. The victim? Vincenzo Moretti, a man whose name echoed through Izzy's childhood like a haunting lullaby.
