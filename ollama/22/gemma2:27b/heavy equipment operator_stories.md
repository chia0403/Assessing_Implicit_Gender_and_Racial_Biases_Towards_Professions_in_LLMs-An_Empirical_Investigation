The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Garrison's neck as he maneuvered the massive Caterpillar excavator across the scorched earth. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the futility of trying to contain the relentless Nevada desert heat. Bart squinted through the grime-streaked windshield, his calloused hand steady on the controls. Around him, the landscape was a tapestry of browns and oranges, punctuated by the skeletal remains of long-dead Joshua trees.

The air thrummed with the roar of the excavator's engine, a familiar lullaby to Bart's ears. He loved the raw power of the machine, the way it responded to his slightest touch. For him, operating heavy equipment wasn't just a job; it was an art form, a dance between man and machine.

Today's task: clearing land for a new solar farm. A necessary evil, Bart thought, though he couldn't shake the feeling of unease as he uprooted ancient sagebrush and leveled centuries-old washes. Progress, they called it. He wondered if the desert cared much for their progress.
