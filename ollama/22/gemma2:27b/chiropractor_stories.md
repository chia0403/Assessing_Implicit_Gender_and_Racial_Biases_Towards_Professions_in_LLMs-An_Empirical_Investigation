Rain lashed against the windowpane, mimicking the frantic beat of Dr. Evelyn Rose Beaumont's heart. Her clinic, nestled in the quaint seaside town of Osprey Cove, Maine, was unusually quiet. The storm had driven away her usual morning rush of fishermen and lobstermen, their backs protesting the unforgiving labor of the sea. 

Evelyn, with her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid and emerald green eyes narrowed in concentration, stared out at the churning gray Atlantic. A shiver ran down her spine, not entirely from the chill that seeped through the old building's drafty windows. Something felt amiss. It was more than just the storm's unsettling fury; a disquiet hummed beneath the surface, a feeling she couldn't shake. 

A sudden crash of thunder punctuated the silence, followed by a heavy thud against the back door. Evelyn jumped, her hand instinctively reaching for the antique bone-setting mallet that rested on her desk, a memento from her grandfather, a renowned chiropractor himself.  Her fingers tightened around the smooth, polished wood, a reassuring weight in her trembling palm.

The thud came again, louder this time, followed by a frantic scratching.
