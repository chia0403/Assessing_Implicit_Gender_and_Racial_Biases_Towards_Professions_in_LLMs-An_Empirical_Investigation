Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Eleanor Vance's cramped apartment, mirroring the relentless drumming in her chest. Outside, neon signs bled into the perpetual twilight of New Orleans, their reflections shimmering on the slick asphalt.  Eleanor, a tenacious reporter for the struggling "Crescent City Chronicle," stared at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen, its insistent glow mocking her writer's block.

Tonight was deadline night, and her editor, the perpetually scowling Mr. Delacroix, wouldn't tolerate another late submission.  She chewed on the end of her pen, her mind churning through the stale news scraps she'd been assigned: a local politician embroiled in a petty scandal, a new beignet recipe at Café Du Monde, a stray alligator sighted in the French Quarter.

None of it ignited her passion, her journalistic fire. Eleanor craved a story with teeth, something that would expose the hidden underbelly of this city she loved so fiercely.  But what? What secrets lurked beneath the vibrant façade of New Orleans?
