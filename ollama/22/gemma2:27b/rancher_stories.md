The wind whipped across the high plains, biting at Thaddeus "Tad" Callahan's weathered face as he surveyed his land. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling columns of ochre against the endless blue sky. The sun beat down mercilessly, baking the dry earth and turning Tad's calloused hands rougher still. His ranch, the Broken Spur, stretched out before him like a patchwork quilt of golden grasslands and scrubby brush. Generations of Callaghans had wrestled this land into submission, coaxing life from its stubborn soil. But lately, the fight felt harder than ever.

A persistent drought had gripped the region for months, turning once-lush pastures into brittle tinderboxes. The cattle were growing thin, their ribs visible beneath their hides, and Tad's heart ached with every mournful moo. He needed rain, desperately. Without it, his legacy, the hard-won inheritance of his forefathers, would wither away like dust in the wind.
