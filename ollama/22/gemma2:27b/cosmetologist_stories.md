The humid air hung thick in the salon, heavy with the scent of hairspray and bleach. A disco ball cast fractured rainbows across the worn linoleum floor, reflecting off the rows of mirrors lining the walls.  Each mirror held its own tableau: a woman fretting over split ends, a teenager impatiently scrolling through TikTok, a man nervously awaiting his first ever perm. But Amelia Rose Cartwright, her nametag pinned proudly to the front of her crisp white uniform, saw none of them.

Her gaze was fixed on the reflection staring back at her - tired hazel eyes framed by messy auburn curls escaping their usual bun. Today wasn't just another Tuesday at "Shear Bliss" salon. Today was Amelia's tenth anniversary in this very chair, the same one her grandmother, Rose Cartwright, had sat in before passing down the salon to Amelia's mother. And today, a letter arrived that threatened to change everything.
