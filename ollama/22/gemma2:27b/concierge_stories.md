The insistent chime of the intercom jolted Esmeralda Dubois from her reverie. Outside, the Parisian dusk was painting the sky in shades of amethyst and rose gold, but inside the Hôtel de Medici, the air hummed with the quiet anticipation of an evening's unfolding. Esmeralda smoothed down her crisp black dress uniform, its silver buttons glinting under the chandeliers, and tapped a manicured finger on the polished mahogany console.

"Bonjour, Monsieur Dupont?" she inquired, her voice lilting with the perfect blend of professionalism and warmth that had earned her a reputation as the most sought-after concierge in all of Paris.

The muffled response crackled through the speaker. "Esmeralda? It's me, Jean-Luc. I have...a situation."

A prickle of curiosity ran down Esmeralda's spine. Jean-Luc Dubois, a renowned art collector and frequent guest at the Hôtel de Medici, rarely called on her for anything other than theatre tickets or restaurant reservations. The urgency in his voice hinted at something far more intriguing.
