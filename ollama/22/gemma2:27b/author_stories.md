Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Elara Blackwood's chest. Her study, nestled under the eaves of her rambling Victorian home in coastal Maine, was crammed with stacks of manuscript pages, each one a testament to her writer's block. The scent of old paper and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. Outside, the Atlantic roared its disapproval, mirroring Elara's own frustrated growl. For weeks, she'd been wrestling with her latest novel, a gothic thriller set in this very house, but the words refused to flow. The characters felt flat, the plot meandered, and inspiration had vanished like the summer sun.

Elara, a woman of sharp wit and even sharper cheekbones, ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls, letting out a sigh that fogged the dusty windowpane. She needed a spark, something to ignite her imagination and propel her story forward. Maybe a walk along the windswept beach would clear her head. Or perhaps a stiff drink?
