The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and desperation as Jeremiah "Jeb" Tucker pulled his rig into the desolate truck stop just outside Amarillo, Texas. The neon sign flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across the cracked asphalt. Dust devils danced in the twilight, kicking up grit that coated Jeb's grizzled face. He sighed, a weary sound lost in the mournful wail of a distant train whistle. This wasn't the life Jeb had envisioned for himself, hauling freight across a lonely landscape under a merciless sun. But bills needed paying and dreams, it seemed, were easily crushed beneath the weight of reality. 


Jeb climbed out of his cab, his joints protesting with a symphony of pops and cracks. He stretched, feeling the ache in his back and the persistent throb behind his right eye. The world felt blurry, bleached by the relentless Texan sun. He needed sleep, but sleep was a luxury he rarely afforded himself. Deadlines loomed, miles needed covering, and the road called with an insistent siren song. Jeb knew better than to answer it without first refueling, both for his truck and himself. With a grunt, he headed towards the flickering beacon of the diner, its greasy promises of coffee and pie calling out like a lonely lighthouse in the storm.
