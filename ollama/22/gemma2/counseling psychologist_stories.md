The scent of rain clung to the air, mingling with the sterile aroma of antiseptic and faintly burnt coffee that permeated Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Thorne's office. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the neon-streaked cityscape into an impressionistic painting. Outside, sirens wailed, a melancholic counterpoint to the gentle jazz playing softly in the background.

Evelyn sat perched on the edge of her leather armchair, her gaze fixed on the empty chair across from her. It was always this way before a session – a quiet anticipation that thrummed beneath her skin, a mixture of curiosity and empathy for the person who would soon step into her world and lay bare their soul. 


She took a sip of her lukewarm tea, trying to quell the nervous flutter in her stomach. Today’s client was new, his name a mystery until he arrived.  She had no expectations, only the hope that she could offer him the same solace and understanding she had so often given others struggling with their inner demons. 


The chime of the door announcing a visitor shattered the quiet stillness, pulling Evelyn from her thoughts. She rose gracefully from her chair, a reassuring smile blooming on her lips. It was time.
