The asphalt ribbon unfurled before him like a weathered serpent, stretching into the heart of Nevada under a relentless July sun. Cletus Bartholomew “Claw” McCallister squinted through his dusty windshield, the glare reflecting off the chrome bumper of his rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Rustbucket." The engine rumbled beneath him, a familiar lullaby that had accompanied Claw on countless journeys across this desolate landscape. 

He was hauling a load of silicon wafers from Phoenix to Silicon Valley, a delivery as monotonous as it was vital. This wasn't the glamorous life people imagined when they thought of truckers; no open-road ballads or daring escapes, just endless stretches of highway and the ever-present hum of the engine. But Claw wouldn’t have it any other way. 

He was a man of simple pleasures: strong coffee, greasy diner food, and the quiet companionship of his battered CB radio. He found solace in the solitude, in the rhythm of the road, in the knowledge that he was an essential cog in the vast machine that kept America running.  


This story takes place along Route 93 in Nevada, known for its desolate beauty and stark landscapes.
