The sterile air of Dr. Amelia Claire Brighton's office hummed with the low thrum of the electric drill. Outside, the late October sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Beacon Hill, Boston. Inside, however, it was perpetually bathed in the warm glow of ceiling-mounted lamps and the gentle blue light filtering from the monitor displaying Amelia’s patient's x-rays.

The whirring ceased, replaced by a muffled sigh from the chair beside her. "That wasn't so bad," Mrs. Henderson mumbled, clutching a handful of gauze to her cheek.

Amelia smiled reassuringly, “Just one more cavity filled and you’ll be good as new. We might need to discuss your brushing technique though, dear.”

She leaned back, eyes scanning the x-ray screen once more. Something wasn't quite right. A faint shadow lurked near the root of Mrs. Henderson's molar, a shape that didn't belong there. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine. This wasn’t just another filling. 


This was something else entirely.
