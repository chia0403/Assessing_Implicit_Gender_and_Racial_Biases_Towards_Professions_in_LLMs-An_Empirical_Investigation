The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay in Saltwind Harbor. Grime-caked buildings clambered towards the perpetually overcast sky, their wooden skeletons groaning under the weight of centuries. Rain lashed against Sergeant Alaric Thorne's weather-beaten cloak as he patrolled the docks.  A constant symphony of creaking timbers, splashing waves, and shouting merchants filled his ears. He gripped the hilt of his sword tighter, ever vigilant for trouble in this chaotic, lawless place. 


Alaric’s keen blue eyes scanned the shadows where thieves lurked, their faces hidden by hooded cloaks.  He knew each cobbled path, every crumbling wall, every whisper carried on the wind. This was his domain, Saltwind Harbor, and he would defend it with his life. A sudden gust of wind snatched a piece of parchment from the hand of a sailor, sending it swirling down towards the muck-filled gutters. Alaric watched it go, knowing that its contents could hold secrets – secrets best left undisturbed in this storm-ravaged city.  


He straightened his shoulders, steeling himself for another night on patrol. He was Sergeant Alaric Thorne, protector of Saltwind Harbor, and he wouldn't falter even when the darkness threatened to engulf them all.
