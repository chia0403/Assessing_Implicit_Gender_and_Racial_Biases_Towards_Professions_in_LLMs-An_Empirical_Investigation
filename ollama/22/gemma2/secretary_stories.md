The incessant clacking of Amelia Thistlewick's typewriter filled the otherwise silent office. Outside, the London fog hung heavy, muffling even the usual rumble of double-decker buses.  Amelia, her fingers flying across the keys with practiced ease, was composing the monthly report for Mr. Bartholomew Finchley, a solicitor whose clientele ranged from struggling artists to eccentric millionaires.  He had a penchant for dramatic pronouncements and long, meandering emails that Amelia distilled into concise bullet points. 

Her own life, however, lacked such grand narratives. It consisted of endless stacks of paperwork, answering ringing phones with a cheery "Finchley & Son," and the occasional delivery of lukewarm tea from the dreary cafeteria downstairs.  Amelia dreamed of adventure, of escaping the confines of this beige-walled purgatory and venturing into the unknown.
