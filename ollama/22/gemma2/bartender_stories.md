The air in The Rusty Keg hung thick with the scent of stale beer, regret, and burnt caramel from the cinnamon whiskey shots that Amelia "Amy" Rosewell was currently concocting. Outside, the neon glow of the city bled into the perpetual twilight of the perpetually overcast Seattle sky. A lonely taxi honked impatiently as it pulled away from the curb.

Inside, a smattering of regulars nursed their drinks at the bar. Old Man Hemmings, a retired fisherman with a beard like tangled fishing line, muttered to himself about salmon prices. Brenda, a freelance journalist with eyes that held too much wisdom for her age, scribbled furiously in a notebook, occasionally glancing up with a frown at the television flickering behind the bar, broadcasting a news segment about yet another unexplained disappearance. 

Amy leaned against the polished mahogany of the counter, wiping down a glass with practiced ease. She knew every inch of The Rusty Keg like the back of her hand, every chipped tile, every faded photograph on the wall, every story etched into its worn-down wood. And tonight, she had a feeling something new was about to be added to that tapestry.
