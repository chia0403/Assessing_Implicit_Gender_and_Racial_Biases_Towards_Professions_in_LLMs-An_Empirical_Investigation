The incessant wail of the ambulance siren sliced through Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes' focus as she meticulously reviewed patient files in the dimly lit hallway outside Dr. Singh's office. The rhythmic hum of the hospital was always present, but tonight it felt amplified, tinged with an edge of urgency that prickled her skin. She glanced at the clock – 1:47 am. Not exactly primetime for emergency admissions.

Ellie, a petite woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid, rubbed her tired eyes. This was just another Tuesday night at Mercy General. The sprawling urban hospital, a labyrinth of steel and white walls, was Ellie's second home. She’d spent the last five years navigating its bustling corridors, patching up broken bones, soothing worried parents, and offering a reassuring presence to those facing life-altering diagnoses.

Tonight, however, something felt different. The air hung heavy with anticipation, the usual buzz replaced by a hushed tension that had everyone on edge. Ellie took a deep breath, her mind already sifting through possible scenarios as she heard Dr. Singh's hurried footsteps approaching. 


"Ellie," he said, his voice grave. "We've got a Code Blue in Trauma One. Multiple gunshot wounds, young male."

Ellie’s heart skipped a beat. This wasn’t just another Tuesday night anymore.
