The sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Quinn's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning her already tanned skin the color of well-worn leather. Sweat dripped from her brow, stinging her eyes as she navigated the precarious path across the slanted roof.  She was perched precariously on a ladder, hammering in shingles one by one, each movement precise and practiced. The rhythm of the hammer against metal, punctuated by the occasional shout from below, filled the air like a lullaby of labor. 

Below her, the bustling city of Savannah unfurled like a patchwork quilt, its vibrant colors muted by the midday haze. Spanish moss draped from ancient oaks, whispering secrets in the humid breeze. The scent of salt hung heavy in the air, a reminder of the nearby ocean that was both a source of solace and danger to this coastal city. Amy, however, wasn't thinking about the beauty or the perils; she was focused on the task at hand â€“ finishing this roof before the impending thunderstorm rolled in.
