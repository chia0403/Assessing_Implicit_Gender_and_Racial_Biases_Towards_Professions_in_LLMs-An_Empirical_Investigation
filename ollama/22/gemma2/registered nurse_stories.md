The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's head, casting a sterile white glow over the cluttered nurses' station. It was 3:00 AM in the cardiac ward of St. Jude's Hospital, and Ellie was nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee, her eyes glued to the EKG monitor displaying a deceptively rhythmic heartbeat. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic drumbeat of anxiety echoing through her chest.  

Ellie ran a hand through her short, dark hair, pushing it away from her tired eyes. It had been a long shift, punctuated by a string of emergencies that tested even her seasoned composure. But tonight felt different, heavier somehow. The air crackled with a sense of impending chaos, and Ellie couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to break.
