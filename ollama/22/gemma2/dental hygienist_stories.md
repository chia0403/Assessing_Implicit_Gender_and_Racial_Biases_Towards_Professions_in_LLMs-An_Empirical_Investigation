The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of gleaming dental chairs. Each one held the potential for agony or relief, depending on the patient's disposition and the contents of their morning breakfast. Eleanor, however, found a certain rhythm in the predictable chaos. Years as a dental hygienist at Dr. Thompson's practice had taught her to anticipate the whines of anxious children, the nervous chatter of first-timers, and the gruff monosyllables of Mr. Henderson, whose dentures seemed perpetually on the verge of rebellion.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down Eleanor's spine as she wiped down the stainless steel counter, a feeling like being watched. She glanced around the almost empty waiting room, noting the chipped paint and the faded floral wallpaper that desperately needed a refresh. Then her gaze landed on a new face: a young woman sitting in the corner, obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat and a thick, woolen scarf. Her eyes, visible beneath the brim, held an unnervingly intense focus, glued to Eleanor as if she were studying her anatomy. 

Eleanor’s usual calm wavered. Perhaps it was just the lingering effect of yesterday's horror movie marathon, or maybe it was the woman's air of unsettling stillness. Either way, a shiver danced down Eleanor's spine. This wasn't just another patient; this felt…different.
