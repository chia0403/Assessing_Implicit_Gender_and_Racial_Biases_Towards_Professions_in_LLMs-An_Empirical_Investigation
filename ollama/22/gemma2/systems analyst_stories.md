The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head as she hunched over her monitor. Her fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating through lines of code like a seasoned sailor charting an unfamiliar sea.  Amelia, or Amy to those who dared to be casual with her, was a systems analyst for GlobalTech, a behemoth corporation whose tentacles reached into every corner of the digital world.

Her office, cubicle 317B, was a monument to efficiency. Monitors blinked like sentient eyes, each displaying a different facet of the ever-shifting data stream that made up GlobalTech's lifeblood.  A tangle of wires snaked across her desk, connecting her keyboard, mouse, and various peripherals to the network – an extension of herself in the digital realm.

Tonight, however, something was different. A tremor ran through the code, a glitch she’d never encountered before. It wasn't a simple error; it felt deliberate, like a hand reaching out from the darkness, seeking to unravel the carefully woven fabric of GlobalTech's systems.


The setting: 
A cramped cubicle in a bustling corporate office within the sprawling GlobalTech headquarters. The atmosphere is one of sterile efficiency, punctuated by the hum of computers and the rhythmic clatter of keyboards.  It's late at night, most employees gone, leaving Amy alone with her monitors and the growing unease in her gut.
