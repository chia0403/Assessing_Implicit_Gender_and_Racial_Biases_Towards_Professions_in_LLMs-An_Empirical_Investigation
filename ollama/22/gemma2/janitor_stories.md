The pungent scent of lemon disinfectant clung to Bartholomew “Barty” Finch like a second skin. He pushed his worn mop across the polished floor of the grand auditorium, watching the dust motes dance in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the stained-glass windows. His footsteps echoed in the vast emptiness, broken only by the distant hum of the ventilation system and the occasional clink of errant cutlery from a forgotten catering tray in the corner. 

The Royal Theatre was a monument to forgotten grandeur. Once a hubbub of whispered gossip, applause, and the scent of velvet curtains, it now stood largely silent, a victim of dwindling audiences and ever-increasing production costs. Barty had seen its best days, witnessed sold-out shows and standing ovations, all from his vantage point as custodian of this fading gem. He knew every creak of its wooden floorboards, every faded inscription on the ornate walls, every secret nook and cranny that held whispers of bygone performances. 

He paused, wiping a damp patch on the stage floor where an ambitious young actress had tripped during a rehearsal for "Romeo and Juliet" just last week. The girl’s bright pink tights were still visible under the worn wooden planks, a tiny remnant of her broken dream. Barty sighed. Tonight, the theatre would be empty again, a tomb of memories and unfulfilled potential.
