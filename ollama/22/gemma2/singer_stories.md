The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and anticipation. The Blue Moon Saloon was crammed, every inch of space occupied by bodies swaying to the bluesy rhythm spilling from the stage. Neon signs flickered, casting an oily sheen across the faces in the crowd, illuminating wrinkles etched by years of laughter and sorrow, dreams chased and broken.  

Amelia Grace Blackwood, her name a whisper on the lips of half the regulars, stood backstage, her heart pounding against her ribs like a captive bird. Tonight was different. This wasn't just another dive bar gig for Amelia. Tonight, she had her shot. A scout from Big Sky Records was in the audience, his presence a rumour buzzing through the crowd like a trapped hornet.  He could be the key to unlocking the future she craved - a future where her voice didn't belong to this smoky room, but echoed across stadiums and radio waves. But Amelia knew that even if he didn't see her, wouldn’t hear her, wouldn’t feel her soul pouring out with every note, this night wouldn’t be for nothing. Because the Blue Moon Saloon was more than just a stage; it was her sanctuary, her haven. And tonight, she would sing her heart out, regardless of the consequences.
