The pungent scent of graphite and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of the Blueprint Basin, a sprawling complex of drafting tables stretching as far as Elias Finch’s tired eyes could see.  

Elias was hunched over his table, a symphony of whirring gears and clicking levers accompanying the frantic scratching of his pencil against parchment. The floor beneath him vibrated with the rhythmic clang of machinery from the Forge District just beyond the Basin's imposing walls. Outside, the sun beat down on the smog-choked city of Aethelburg, a constant reminder that even in this labyrinth of order and precision, chaos reigned supreme.

Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, was tasked with finalizing the blueprints for Lord Alaric’s latest flying chariot – a beastly contraption rumored to be capable of reaching unprecedented speeds. He had been working on it for weeks, meticulously sketching every rivet, gear, and wing strut, fueled by lukewarm coffee and a simmering resentment towards his demanding patron.  

Suddenly, a sharp rap on his table jolted him from his focus. A messenger boy, panting and sweaty, thrust a crumpled piece of paper into his hands. 

“From Lord Alaric himself, Master Finch,” he gasped, before disappearing back into the teeming masses of the Basin.


Elias unfolded the note with trembling fingers.  His heart skipped a beat as he read the single, chilling sentence scrawled across it: “Come to me at once. Your work is inadequate.”
