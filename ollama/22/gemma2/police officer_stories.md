The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and decay in the forgotten corner of Galveston's Pleasure Pier.  Waves crashed against weathered pilings, sending plumes of seawater spraying into the twilight. 

Amelia Rose "Amy" Cartwright knelt beside the body, her breath fogging in the cool night air. The flickering blue light from the patrol car cast long, distorted shadows across the mangled remains of what was once a Ferris wheel gondola.  The victim, a young woman barely out of her teens, lay sprawled on the rusted metal platform, her vibrant purple hair a stark contrast to the bleakness surrounding her. A silver locket glinted in the dim light, half-buried in the sand. Amy reached for it, her gloved fingers carefully retrieving the tiny, heart-shaped pendant. It felt warm, almost unnaturally so, even through the leather.  

A shiver ran down Amy's spine, unrelated to the chill of the sea breeze. This wasn't a simple accident. This was something else entirely. 


The setting is a dilapidated section of Galveston's Pleasure Pier at dusk, long after the amusement park has closed for the day. The air is thick with the smell of salt and rot, and the remnants of a once vibrant attraction now lie in disrepair. The mood is somber and eerie, heightened by the presence of a murder victim and the feeling that something sinister lurks beneath the surface.
