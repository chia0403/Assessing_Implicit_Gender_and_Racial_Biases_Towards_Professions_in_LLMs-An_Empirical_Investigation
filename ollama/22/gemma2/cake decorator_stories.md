The air hung heavy with the scent of buttercream and sugar, a cloying sweetness that clung to Amelia Beatrice Finch like a second skin. She stood before her latest creation: a towering three-tiered masterpiece adorned with delicate sugar orchids and spun sugar butterflies. It was for a high society wedding, the kind that made headlines and demanded perfection. 

Amelia’s small shop, “Finch's Flourishes,” nestled on a cobbled side street in Charleston, South Carolina, was usually bustling with customers and the clatter of whisks. But today, it felt eerily quiet. The city itself seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the approaching storm – a tempestuous hurricane dubbed "Eleanor" that threatened to tear through the historic streets like a vengeful spirit. 


The clock ticked past midday, casting long shadows across Amelia's workbench. She ran a gloved hand over the smooth icing, her heart thrumming with a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. Eleanor was due any moment, and the wedding cake – the centerpiece of this lavish affair – had to be delivered before the city descended into chaos.
