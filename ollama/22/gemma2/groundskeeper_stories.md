The dew clung to Amelia Thistlewood's boots like tiny diamonds as she surveyed her domain. Dawn was just breaking over Meadowbrook Manor, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns and fragrant rose bushes. The air was crisp with autumn's approach, carrying whispers of fallen leaves and wood smoke. Amelia, her weathered hands clasped behind her back, inhaled deeply. This wasn't just a job; it was her sanctuary. She knew every inch of these grounds, from the ancient oak with its gnarled branches to the hidden patch of wildflowers tucked away near the greenhouse.

Meadowbrook Manor itself loomed in the background, a stately Victorian mansion shrouded in mist. Its faded grandeur hinted at forgotten stories and whispered secrets. Amelia had heard them all growing up - tales of lavish parties, scandalous romances, and one tragic disappearance that still haunted the town's history. 


Today, however, was just another day for Amelia Thistlewood, groundskeeper extraordinaire, as she began her rounds with a familiar sense of purpose.
