The humid Florida air clung to Elias Thornhill like a second skin as he crouched beneath the porch swing, flashlight beam dancing over exposed wiring.  Sweat stung his eyes, but he pushed on, tracing the faulty circuit with practiced fingers. The old house groaned around him, its bones creaking in protest against the relentless summer heat. Palm fronds swayed rhythmically outside, casting flickering shadows across the peeling paint of the porch floorboards. 

Elias Thornhill, a man as comfortable with his tools as others were with their shoes, had been called out to fix Mrs. Clementine's power problem. She was a fixture in this sleepy coastal town, known for her pecan pie and her fiercely independent spirit.  Her house, a rambling Victorian perched on stilts overlooking the Gulf, felt as weathered and worn as she did, yet there was an undeniable charm to its faded grandeur.

As Elias tightened the last wire, a low rumble shook the porch floor. He looked up, expecting a passing truck, but saw nothing. Just the swaying palms and the endless blue expanse of the sea.  But something in his gut told him this wasn't just another Florida storm rolling in.
