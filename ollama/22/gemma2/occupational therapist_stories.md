The scent of antiseptic and lavender clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  It was the familiar aroma of her domain: Bright Horizons Rehabilitation Center. Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the brightly colored gym mats scattered on the polished floor. 

Amelia pushed open the heavy oak door to the therapy room, its worn surface a testament to countless hands reaching for healing.  She smiled at Mrs. Peterson, a ninety-year-old woman with eyes as bright as sapphires despite her frailty, who sat patiently in her wheelchair, a puzzle book abandoned on her lap. 

"Good morning, Mrs. Peterson," Amelia said, her voice warm and reassuring. "Ready for some arm exercises?"


The setting: A spacious therapy room within Bright Horizons Rehabilitation Center, bathed in sunlight with a mix of modern equipment and comforting furniture. The air is filled with the sterile scent of antiseptic mixed with calming lavender.
