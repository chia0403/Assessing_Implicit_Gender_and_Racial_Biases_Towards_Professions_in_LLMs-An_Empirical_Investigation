The air in Amelia Rose Blackwood's studio hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a comforting aroma that had become as familiar to her as her own heartbeat. Sunlight streamed through the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, the bustling city of Prague throbbed with life â€“ a cacophony of honking trams, chattering crowds, and distant accordion music. But inside Amelia's studio, perched precariously on a rickety stool, time seemed to stand still.

Her canvas stretched before her, a blank white expanse waiting for her touch. She held a brush dipped in cerulean blue, poised above the surface like a conductor about to unleash a symphony of color.  But tonight, Amelia felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Her latest exhibition was just weeks away, and she hadn't yet captured the essence of Prague that haunted her dreams.
