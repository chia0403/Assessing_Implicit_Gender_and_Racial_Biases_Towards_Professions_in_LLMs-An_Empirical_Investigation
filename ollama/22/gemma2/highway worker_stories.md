The asphalt shimmered under the relentless July sun, radiating heat like a giant, cracked oven door. Sweat beaded on Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling's forehead, tracing invisible paths through the dust that perpetually clung to his face. He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a fresh smear across his cheek.  The highway stretched before him, an endless ribbon of black weaving its way through the desolate Arizona landscape. Cacti, their spines glistening like shards of glass, stood guard along the roadside, offering little shade from the unforgiving sun. Bart squinted at the horizon, where the air shimmered with heat, blurring the line between earth and sky.  The rhythmic hum of the jackhammer was his only companion, a monotonous soundtrack to his solitary existence. He felt the vibrations through the soles of his boots, deep into his bones. Today, like every day, Bart Sterling was tasked with patching the scars left by countless trucks and cars that had roared past this stretch of Route 66, each one leaving behind a little piece of its soul in the form of asphalt dust and tire tracks.
