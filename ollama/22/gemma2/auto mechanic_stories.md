The grease under Amelia "Amy" Petrova's fingernails was practically part of her DNA at this point. It wouldn't come off with soap alone, only a day spent elbow-deep in motor oil seemed to dilute it enough. She stood, wiping a stray bead of sweat from her brow, the air thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt rubber. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered expanse of Petrova's Auto Repair, a ramshackle building nestled on the outskirts of Pine Ridge, Montana. Rusted tools hung haphazardly from pegboards, engine parts lay scattered like discarded bones, and an oily rag dangled precariously from the ceiling fan. Despite its disheveled appearance, the place hummed with activity. A chorus of coughs and sputters emanated from the bay where Amy was currently wrestling a carburetor, her face illuminated by the harsh glare of a fluorescent lightbulb that flickered intermittently. 


The last call of the day had just come in - a broken-down pickup truck, stranded on the dusty outskirts of town.  Amy sighed, knowing she'd be here till late. But it was just another Tuesday night for Amelia Petrova, queen of the greasy spoon and champion of the clunker.
