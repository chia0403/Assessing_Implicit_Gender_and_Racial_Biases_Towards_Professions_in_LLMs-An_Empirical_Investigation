The mahogany desk gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of Eleanor Penelope Vanceâ€™s office. Rain lashed against the panoramic window behind her, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of neon streaks and swirling grey.  Eleanor, CEO of Vance Industries, wasn't fazed by the storm raging outside. Her world was a whirlwind of spreadsheets, board meetings, and quarterly reports, storms far more turbulent than any weather event. 

Her gaze flicked across the polished surface of her desk, stopping on a framed photograph of a young girl with bright, mischievous eyes. Eleanor traced the outline of the face with a fingertip, a flicker of something akin to longing crossing her features before she swiftly pushed it aside. Business was a ruthless mistress, demanding absolute focus and leaving little room for sentimentality.  She reached for the phone, ready to tackle another day in the cutthroat world she'd built from scratch.
