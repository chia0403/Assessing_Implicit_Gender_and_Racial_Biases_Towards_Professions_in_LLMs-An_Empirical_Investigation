The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Penelope Thompson's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, wrestling with the complexities of Schedule C for her third client of the morning â€“ a struggling bakery owner whose pastries were as delicious as his bookkeeping was disastrous. 

Outside the window, snow swirled and settled on the pavement in thick white clumps. It was January in rural Wisconsin, and Bea's office, tucked away in a corner of the old town square, was about the only place that buzzed with activity besides the local coffee shop. The scent of burnt coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma for this time of year.  Bea sighed, rubbing her temples as she tried to untangle the bakery owner's tangled mess of receipts. This wasn't just about numbers; it was about people's dreams, their livelihoods hanging precariously on the success of their small businesses. And Bea, with a stack of tax forms taller than herself and a weary smile, felt the weight of that responsibility settle on her shoulders like an extra winter coat.
