The musty scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, as comforting to Elara Seraphina Blackwood as her grandmother’s lavender perfume had been when she was a child. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the Grandchester Library, casting long shadows on the towering shelves that lined the walls like silent sentinels.  Elara ran a gloved finger along the spines of ancient texts, their titles whispering secrets in forgotten tongues. 

Her workday began at dawn, before the hustle and bustle of the city woke up, before the sunlight spilled into the library’s quiet sanctuary, transforming dust motes into dancing embers. She was responsible for more than just maintaining order amongst the millions of books; she was the guardian of stories, the keeper of history, the confidante of whispered dreams. 


This morning, however, a different kind of story unfolded. A tattered leather-bound book lay open on her desk, its pages filled with spidery handwriting and cryptic symbols – a book that hadn't been touched in decades, forgotten amongst the countless others. It was calling to her, beckoning her into a world beyond the familiar comfort of the library walls.
