The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Eloise Blackwood, casting a sickly yellow glow over her meticulously organized spreadsheets. Each cell held an answer, a piece of the puzzle that formed the financial tapestry of "The Rusty Sprocket," a greasy spoon diner on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, population 3,487.  

Beatrice wasn't exactly sure how she’d ended up here, crunching numbers for a place where the coffee was lukewarm and the clientele consisted mostly of truck drivers and retired farmers. She'd envisioned herself as an intrepid financial analyst, climbing the corporate ladder in some sleek Manhattan skyscraper. 

Instead, she was trapped in Harmony Creek, her dreams buried beneath a mountain of receipts and overdue invoices. The only excitement Beatrice experienced came from deciphering Mr. Henderson’s illegible handwriting on his expense reports. He claimed to buy "farm supplies," but the recurring entries for "dancing lessons" and "fancy cheese" made Beatrice wonder if his accounting skills were as shaky as his penmanship.  

Outside, the wind whipped through the skeletal branches of a lone oak tree, rattling against the diner's windows like restless bones. Beatrice shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around herself. It was going to be a long night.
