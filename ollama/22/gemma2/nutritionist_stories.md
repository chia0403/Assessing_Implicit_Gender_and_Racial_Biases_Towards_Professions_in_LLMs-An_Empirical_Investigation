The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender hand soap from Evelyn Amelia Blackwood's attempts to salvage the breakfast situation. Evelyn, for all her knowledge about balanced diets and mindful eating, was notoriously bad at cooking anything that didn't involve a blender or pre-packaged ingredients. 

Her small apartment, nestled in the vibrant but perpetually chaotic heart of London's Camden Town, was usually a haven of calm - bookshelves overflowing with nutrition textbooks, calming plants trailing from window sills, and bowls filled with colorful fruit strategically placed around the living room. Today, however, it felt like a battlefield: burnt toast crumbs littered the counter, a pot of wilting spinach sat forgotten on the stove, and a dog-eared copy of "The Complete Guide to Detoxifying Your Body" lay open beside a half-eaten bowl of granola. 

Evelyn sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the microwave window - tired eyes framed by unruly auburn curls, skin marred with the beginnings of a pimple (stress eating, she knew), and the usual faint scent of bergamot essential oil clinging to her clothes. She was running late for her appointment with Mr. Henderson, a high-powered lawyer notorious for his sugar addiction and penchant for fast food. 

Evelyn needed to get a handle on this situation before she even thought about facing another demanding client.
