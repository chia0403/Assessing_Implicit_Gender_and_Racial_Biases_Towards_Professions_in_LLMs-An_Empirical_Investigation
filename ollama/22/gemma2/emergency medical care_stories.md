The wail of sirens sliced through the humid Miami night, a familiar symphony to Emilia "Em" Reyes. Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the neon-lit skyline into an impressionistic mess. Em gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white, her focus fixed on the road ahead. This wasn't just another run; this was code blue, a heart attack at the swanky Azure Ocean Club, the kind of place where champagne flowed freely and problems were solved with credit cards, not compressions.

Em glanced at her partner, Javier "Jay" Rodriguez, his face illuminated by the flickering red lights reflecting off his dark skin. He was calmly checking their equipment, a practiced calm that Em both admired and envied. She'd been an EMT for five years, but her stomach still twisted with every code blue, every frantic call, every life hanging in the balance. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. The air crackled with a tension beyond the usual pressure of a serious emergency. Em couldn't shake the feeling that this call was going to be more than just another night on the job. This time, Miami wasn't just playing its usual role in the drama; it felt like the stage itself was about to shift.
