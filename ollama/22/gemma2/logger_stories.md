The biting wind clawed at Elijah Thorneâ€™s face as he leaned precariously against the towering Douglas fir, its bark rough beneath his gloved hand. Mist swirled around the base of the ancient tree, muffling the sounds of the forest floor and casting long, skeletal shadows that danced in the weak morning light. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, punctuated by the sharp tang of pine needles.  

Elijah adjusted his heavy chain saw strapped across his chest, its dull rumble a familiar comfort in the hushed stillness. He glanced at the massive trunk before him, its gnarled limbs reaching skyward like arthritic fingers. This one, he knew, would be a good haul. Enough to bring in a decent sum, enough to keep the roof over his head and food on the table for another month. 

The Oregon coast was unforgiving, both beautiful and brutal. Elijah had known no other life, born into the logging industry like generations before him. The forest was his home, its rhythm ingrained in his bones. But lately, that rhythm felt off-key. The whispers of change were growing louder, the air thick with a tension he couldn't ignore. A sense of impending doom hung over him, as heavy and suffocating as the morning fog.
