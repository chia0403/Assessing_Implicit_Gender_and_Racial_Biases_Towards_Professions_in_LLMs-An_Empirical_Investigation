The rain hammered against the stained glass windows of Eleanor Vance's office, each drop like a miniature hammer blow against the fragile panes.  Eleanor herself wasn't fazed by the storm raging outside; she was far more concerned with the tempest brewing in her client's eyes.  He sat opposite her, a gaunt figure hunched over his hands on the mahogany desk, knuckles white. 

Eleanor Vance, Associate at the prestigious firm of Blackwood and Stone, had faced down juries, corporate giants, and even the occasional crazed litigant before, but this one felt different. There was an unsettling desperation in his silence, a veiled fear that seemed to radiate from him like heat. He was young, barely out of law school himself, yet he looked older than his years, burdened by something she couldn't quite decipher. 

Her office, perched high above the bustling streets of Chicago, usually felt like a sanctuary â€“ a haven of polished wood and leather, filled with the comforting scent of old books and legal tomes. But today, the storm outside had seeped into her usually tranquil space, casting long, distorted shadows on the walls and amplifying the tension in the room.  

Eleanor leaned forward, her face softened by concern. "Mr. Davies," she began, her voice a calm anchor amidst the rising tide of anxiety, "tell me what's happening."
