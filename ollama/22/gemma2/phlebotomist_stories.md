The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Celeste, casting a sterile glow over the blood draw station. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was home.  

Amy expertly palmed the butterfly needle, her gaze flitting between the requisition slip and the man across from her. He looked nervous, his knuckles white as he gripped a worn paperback. A small tremor ran through his arm with every beat of his pulse, making Amy’s job that much harder. She knew this well – drawing blood wasn't always easy, but it rarely involved shaking hands and sweaty foreheads. Especially not at St. Jude's Children's Hospital on a Friday afternoon.

She plastered a reassuring smile on her face, "Don't worry, Mr. Thompson. It'll be over in a flash."  A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, mirroring the nervous dampness spreading across her own palm. The familiar scent of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint sweetness of vanilla from the hand sanitizer. This wasn't just another blood draw – this was St. Jude's, a place where hope lived alongside fear, laughter battled against pain, and even seasoned phlebotomists like Amy found themselves humbled by the stories etched on every patient's face. 


This was where Amy Celeste made a difference, one vial of blood at a time.
