Crimson streaks bled across the sky, announcing another scorching Arizona sunset. Millie adjusted the brim of her sun-bleached Stetson, its worn leather familiar against her hand. The vast expanse of her family ranch, sprawling like a patchwork quilt of brown and green across the dusty landscape, stretched before her.

The whispers started a few weeks ago, hushed conversations about strange lights in the sky and eerie animal behavior. Millie dismissed them as tired ranch hands letting their imaginations run wild.  But lately, even she couldn't ignore the creeping fear that something was changing, something unnatural, out there in the vastness of her world.
