The bell above the door jingled its familiar welcome as Amelia Beatrice Butterfield adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter. A shaft of afternoon sun sliced through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes dancing in the air. The scent of rosemary shampoo and stale coffee hung heavy, a comforting blend unique to "Amelia's Ambitions," the bustling little salon nestled on Maple Street.  

It was always busiest on Thursdays, the day Amelia carved out for her “senior citizen special.” She’d seen these faces every week for years – Mrs. Henderson with her fiery red curls tamed into a respectable bouffant, Mr. Peterson meticulously trimming his white whiskers, and old Miss Agatha, who insisted on having her hair styled in the same beehive she sported back in her flapper days. 

Today, though, Amelia sensed something different. A flicker of nervousness danced in the eyes of the man standing hesitantly in the doorway. He was tall, with a mop of dark hair that looked like it hadn't seen a comb in weeks.  A faded tattoo peeked out from beneath his rolled-up sleeve, and a nervous tremor ran through him as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other.


Amelia smiled warmly, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Welcome, dear! What can I do for you?" she asked, her voice a soothing melody that calmed even the most anxious soul.
