The scent of iron and rosemary hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything like morning mist.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of "McGregor's Meats," illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. Bartholomew McGregor, his brow furrowed with concentration as he sliced through a slab of prime rib, barely noticed the sun. His focus was solely on the task at hand: achieving the perfect, evenly-thin slice for Mrs. Peabody's Sunday roast.  Bartholomew, a man built like an oak tree with hands calloused from years of wielding cleavers and boning knives, had been running his family's butcher shop in the heart of Edinburgh for over twenty years. He took pride in his craft, treating each cut of meat as if it were a work of art, deserving of respect and careful handling. The rhythm of the cleaver against bone, the hushed murmur of conversation between him and Mrs. Peabody, and the quiet hum of the refrigerator formed a familiar symphony that Bartholomew knew by heart. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he noticed a shadow fall across the shop floor, obscuring the sunlight filtering through the window. He turned slowly, the glint of the cleaver catching the light, ready to face whatever disruption threatened his well-ordered day.
