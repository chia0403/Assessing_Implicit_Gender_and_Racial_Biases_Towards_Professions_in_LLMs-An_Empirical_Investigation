The sun bled crimson across the dusty plains, casting long shadows that stretched like grasping fingers from the weathered fence posts lining Elias Thornewood's field. A wind, dry as bone and smelling faintly of sagebrush, whipped through the ripening wheat, sending a shiver down Eliasâ€™ spine despite the sweltering heat.  He stood on the porch of his farmhouse, its faded wood siding cracked and sun-bleached, the paint peeling like scabs from years of neglect. His calloused hands rested on the worn handle of his grandfather's old axe, its head dull but still formidable. He squinted at the horizon, watching the dust devils dance in the fading light, a familiar rhythm to the ever-changing landscape of his life. Elias Thornewood, weathered and resolute, was a man bound to this land, just as surely as the wheat stalks were tethered to the soil by their roots.  


**Setting:** The story takes place on a small, remote farm in the American West, during the late 19th century. The landscape is stark and unforgiving, characterized by wide-open plains, dusty trails, and the relentless sun. Life for Elias and his fellow farmers is a constant struggle against drought, pests, and economic hardship.
