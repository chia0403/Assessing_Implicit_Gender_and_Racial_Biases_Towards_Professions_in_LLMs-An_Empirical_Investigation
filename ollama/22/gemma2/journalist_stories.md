The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Bucket" cast its sickly green glow across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat as she pushed through the door. The scent of stale beer and desperation clung to the air like a shroud. This dive bar in the forgotten corner of New Orleans was hardly where she expected to find her lead on the missing musician, but sometimes the truth hid in the most unlikely places. Amelia, a seasoned journalist known for her tenacity and nose for trouble, had been following the trail of Julian "Jazz" Dubois for weeks. He'd vanished without a trace, leaving behind only whispers of a dangerous secret and an unfinished masterpiece. The bar was dim and smoky, populated by shadowy figures nursing their drinks at sticky tables. A lone piano sat in the corner, its keys gathering dust. Amelia ordered a whiskey neat, her eyes scanning the room. The bartender, a man with weary eyes and a handlebar mustache, slid her a chipped glass filled with amber liquid. 

"Looking for something specific?" he rasped, his voice like gravel on asphalt.

Amelia took a sip of her whiskey, letting the heat spread through her. "Maybe," she said, her voice low but steady. "I'm looking for stories."
