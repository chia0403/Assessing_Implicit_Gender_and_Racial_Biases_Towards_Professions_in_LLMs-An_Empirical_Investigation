The bell above the door to "Scissor Sisters" jingled merrily as Amelia Thistlewood bustled out from behind the basin, water still dripping from her freshly-washed blonde curls. The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh's Old Town, was bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sun streaming through the dusty windowpanes. 

Amelia straightened a stray strand of hair escaping her bun and smoothed her apron, her eyes scanning the sparsely populated salon. Only one customer remained - Mrs. MacAllister, a formidable woman with a bouffant as rigid as her stare, meticulously applying lipstick while Amelia prepped for the next appointment. The day had been slow, a far cry from the usual flurry of activity that filled "Scissor Sisters" during Edinburgh Fringe Festival season.

But, as Amelia knew all too well, the calm before the storm was just a temporary respite. In a few days, the city would explode with energy and tourists, and her salon would become a whirlwind of frantic hair-dos and last-minute touch-ups. She took a deep breath, savoring the quiet lull for now, before the chaos inevitably descended.
