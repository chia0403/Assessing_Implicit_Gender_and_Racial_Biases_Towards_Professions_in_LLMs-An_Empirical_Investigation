The humid Delhi air clung to Elias Chandrasekhar like a second skin as he maneuvered through the bustling Chandni Chowk market. Sunlight glinted off the brass bangles piled high on makeshift stalls, while the aroma of spices and frying pakoras hung heavy in the air.  Elias, with his worn leather apron slung over his shoulders and a needle poking out of his cheek, was an island of calm amidst the chaos. He expertly weaved through the throngs of people, his keen eyes scanning for threads of silk, beads shimmering under the sun, and perhaps, a new challenge for his nimble fingers.  He ran Elias’ Emporium, a modest but beloved shop nestled in a quiet corner of the market, where whispers of exquisite craftsmanship and bespoke tailoring echoed with every rustle of fabric. 

Today, however, Elias wasn't searching for supplies. He was on a personal mission, driven by an urgent message delivered just before dawn. A client, shrouded in secrecy, awaited him at his shop – with a request unlike any he'd ever received before.
