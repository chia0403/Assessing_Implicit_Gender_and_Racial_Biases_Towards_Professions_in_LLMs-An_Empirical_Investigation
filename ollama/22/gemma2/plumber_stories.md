The rain hammered on the roof of Harold Finnegan's rusty pickup truck like angry fists, mirroring the pounding in his own head. He hadn't slept much since Mrs. Peterson's call last night - a burst pipe in her Victorian bathroom, threatening to turn her prized Persian rug into a soggy mess and potentially flood the whole house if not addressed quickly. Harold shifted uncomfortably, his gut churning with the usual pre-work anxiety. This wasn't just any plumbing job; it was a delicate operation, one requiring precision and finesse, two things Harold was constantly battling against within himself.

He pulled into Mrs. Peterson's meticulously manicured driveway, its slick cobblestone glistening under the streetlights. The house itself loomed in front of him, a sprawling behemoth of dark wood and ornate detailing, whispering tales of wealth and history.  Harold knew the Peterson family had been pillars of this small town for generations, their names etched onto buildings and plaques throughout the community. He took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. A burst pipe wasn't going to take down Harold Finnegan, not today. 


The rhythmic drumming of rain continued as Harold climbed out of his truck, his tools clanking in rhythm with the storm. This was just another day at work for him, another chance to prove himself, to quiet the doubts that whispered in his ear like a persistent leak. He adjusted his tool belt and marched towards the front door, ready to face whatever plumbing disaster awaited him.
