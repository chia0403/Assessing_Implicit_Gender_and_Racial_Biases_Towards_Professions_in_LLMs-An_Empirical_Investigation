The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head like a chorus of disgruntled wasps. It was 8:45 AM on a Tuesday, and the waiting room of Dr. Bartholomew Pruitt's office felt as alive as a mausoleum. A lone potted fern languished in the corner, its fronds drooping with the weight of boredom. Amelia sighed, adjusting her glasses and glancing at the digital clock for the tenth time.

The morning had begun like all others â€“ answering the phone with a chipper "Dr. Pruitt's office," despite the fact that Dr. Pruitt himself was prone to grumpy silences longer than most patients' appointments. She filed paperwork, sorted magazines by expiration date (a task she found oddly satisfying), and dreamed of escaping the beige monotony for a life filled with adventure.  

But then, just as her eyelids began to droop from sheer tedium, the door swung open with a bang. 


A woman, clad in a vibrant red coat that seemed to defy the sterile white walls, strode into the waiting room. Her face was hidden behind a pair of oversized sunglasses, but her energy crackled like static electricity. 

Amelia's pulse quickened. This wasn't just another patient. Something about this woman felt...different.
