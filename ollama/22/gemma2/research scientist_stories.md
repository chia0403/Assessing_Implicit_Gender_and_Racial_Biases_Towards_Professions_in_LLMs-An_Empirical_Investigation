The lab, normally bathed in the cool blue light of holographic displays and glowing reagent tanks, was now a chaotic tableau of sparks, scattered wires, and overturned beakers. 

Emilia's heart hammered against her ribs, not from fear, but from exhilaration. She'd been chasing this breakthrough for years, ever since she'd stumbled upon the anomalous energy readings emanating from deep within the earth. The potential was staggering: a limitless source of clean power that could reshape the world.
