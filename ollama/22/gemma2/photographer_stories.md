The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. Her weathered canvas shoes crunched on the gravel path leading down to the shore, her gaze fixed on the horizon where the sky bled into the churning grey sea. Waves crashed against the rocky cliffs, their white foam mimicking the froth of Ameliaâ€™s own churning stomach. It was here, on this windswept coast of Cornwall, that she hoped to find solace, inspiration, and perhaps even closure.

This was her sanctuary, a place where the crashing waves could drown out the whispers of doubt and perhaps, just perhaps, wash away the remnants of her past.
