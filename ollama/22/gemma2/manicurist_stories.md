The neon sign outside “Tips & Toes” buzzed with a tired luminescence, casting an anemic pink glow across the cracked pavement. Inside, Penelope “Penny” Rose adjusted her mirrored visor, catching a glimpse of the swirling galaxy painted on her fingertips. Her usual Saturday night rush hadn’t materialized, leaving the air thick with the scent of lavender hand cream and impending disappointment. 

The clinking of glasses from the bar next door mingled with the rhythmic hum of the electric nail file, a soundtrack to Penny's quiet evening. She idly polished a set of acrylic tips, imagining the intricate floral designs that would bloom on them come Monday morning. But tonight, there were no demanding brides, no stressed-out executives, just the relentless tick of the clock and the echoing emptiness of an almost deserted salon. 


Penny sighed, her breath clouding the air. Maybe she should call it a night. Then the bell above the door jingled, breaking the silence like a shard of glass.  A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, their face hidden by the shadows. A prickle of curiosity danced down Penny’s spine. It wasn't every day someone stumbled into her little salon on a Saturday night.
