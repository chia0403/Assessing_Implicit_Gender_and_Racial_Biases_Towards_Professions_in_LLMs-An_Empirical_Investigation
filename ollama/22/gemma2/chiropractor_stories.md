The scent of eucalyptus and peppermint hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of antiseptic. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of crickets punctuated the summer night, a soothing soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Rose's late-night work. 

Her small chiropractic clinic, nestled on the edge of sleepy Maple Creek, was bathed in the warm glow of the porch light that spilled onto her worn wooden sign: "Rose Chiropractic - Healing Hands, Happy Lives." Ellie ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, pushing back a stray strand from her forehead. She adjusted her glasses and glanced at the clock on the wall: 10:45 pm. Just one more patient, then she could finally call it a night. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her last patient for the evening. A tall figure, shrouded in shadow, stepped into the warm light of the waiting room. Ellie couldn't quite make out his features, but he seemed weary and hunched, carrying himself with a heavy weight on his shoulders. 


"Welcome," she greeted him warmly, rising from her desk. "I'm Dr. Rose."

He looked up then, his face illuminated by the porch light. His eyes were tired, but there was a flicker of hope in them that warmed Ellie's heart. This, she knew, was why she did what she did - to bring relief, not just physical, but also emotional.


"Hello, Dr. Rose," he said, his voice rough with fatigue. "I'm Ethan Miller."
