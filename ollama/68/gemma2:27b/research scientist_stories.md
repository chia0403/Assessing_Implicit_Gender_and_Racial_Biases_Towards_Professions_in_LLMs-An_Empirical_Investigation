Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the lab, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cavernous space. Dr. Eleanor Vance shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. The ancient heating system wheezed like a dying dragon, spitting out lukewarm gusts that barely reached her workbench cluttered with petri dishes and bubbling flasks.  

Outside, the storm raged on over the desolate Scottish moorland. Lightning illuminated the skeletal silhouettes of heather-covered hills, momentarily transforming the landscape into an eerie tableau. Eleanor glanced at the clock – 2:37 am. Exhaustion tugged at her eyelids, but she couldn't afford to sleep. Not now.

Tonight was crucial. After years of tireless research and countless failed experiments, Eleanor believed she was finally on the verge of a breakthrough. Her work, focused on harnessing the regenerative properties of ancient peat moss, could revolutionize medicine, offering a potential cure for debilitating diseases. But first, she needed to isolate the key compound hidden within the murky brown extract bubbling in her flask.

A sharp crackle from the speakers jolted her upright. The lab's security system had detected movement outside. Eleanor's heart hammered in her chest. Trespassers were rare on this isolated research outpost, but tonight, something felt different – a prickling unease she couldn't shake off.
