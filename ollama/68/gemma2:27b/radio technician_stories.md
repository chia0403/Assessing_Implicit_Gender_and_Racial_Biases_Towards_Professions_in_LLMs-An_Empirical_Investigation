The air hung thick with humidity, buzzing with the relentless drone of cicadas. Rain threatened on the horizon, casting an ominous gray pallor over the already dilapidated town of Rustwater.  Elias Finch adjusted his spectacles, squinting at the tangled mess of wires spilling out from the rusted radio chassis. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, leaving a greasy trail in its wake.

He was Rustwater's only hope for communication with the outside world, a responsibility he carried with a quiet stoicism born from years spent tinkering in the dusty confines of his workshop.

The town meeting was in two hours, and Elias knew they were counting on him to deliver news - good or bad - about the supply convoy from the Capital.
