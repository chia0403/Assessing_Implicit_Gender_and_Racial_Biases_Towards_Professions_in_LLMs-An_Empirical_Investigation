Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the tempting display of croissants and éclairs into an impressionistic smear. Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, tugging her cardigan tighter around her. The aroma of sugar and yeast did little to lift her spirits. It was supposed to be a celebratory lunch, marking her first year as the head dietician at St. Michael's Hospital. Instead, it felt like another Wednesday afternoon, punctuated by the insistent drip-drip-drip of the leaky faucet in her cramped office. 


St. Michael's was a sprawling Victorian hospital tucked away on a quiet street, its red brick facade weathered and worn like an old friend. Amelia loved the history etched into its walls, but she couldn't help feeling trapped within its beige corridors and fluorescent-lit waiting rooms. Her job, while fulfilling in its own way, felt increasingly isolating. She longed for something more – a challenge, an adventure, perhaps even a touch of romance. 

Little did Amelia know, fate had a few surprises up its sleeve, all intertwined with the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the bakery across the street.
