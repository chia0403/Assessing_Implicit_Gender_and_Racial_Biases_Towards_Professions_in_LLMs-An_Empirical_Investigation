Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempestuous emotions swirling within her own chest. The cozy space, usually imbued with the scent of lavender and chamomile tea, felt sterile tonight. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionist painting, a fitting reflection of Eleanor's muddled thoughts. A heavy file lay open on her desk â€“ "Ethan Hayes," the name scrawled in bold black letters. Ethan, a promising young artist, had walked into her office three weeks ago, his eyes haunted by a past he refused to discuss.

Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to center herself. Her job was to help people like Ethan navigate the treacherous terrain of their own minds, but tonight, she felt adrift herself. The weight of his unspoken pain pressed down on her, threatening to drown her in a sea of empathy.
