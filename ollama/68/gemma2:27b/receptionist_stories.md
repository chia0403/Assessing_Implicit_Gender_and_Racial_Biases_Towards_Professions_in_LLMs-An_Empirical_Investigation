The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn floral carpet in the reception area. Penelope Thistlewick sighed, adjusting her spectacles and straightening a stack of outdated brochures on the coffee table. It was Tuesday, 3:17 PM, and the waiting room was blissfully empty. Tuesdays were usually slow – a lull before the storm of Wednesday's walk-in appointments and frantic phone calls.

Penelope, with her neatly coiffed grey bun and sensible cardigan, was the very image of calm efficiency. For fifteen years she had been the face of Dr. Bartholomew Finch’s practice, greeting patients with a warm smile and unwavering politeness, no matter how rude or impatient they might be. But today, a strange unease lingered beneath Penelope's placid exterior. It wasn't the usual Tuesday doldrums; this was something different, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck that whispered of impending change.
