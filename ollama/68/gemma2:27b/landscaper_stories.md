The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a sodden mess. He squinted at the sprawling lawn before him, its emerald expanse marred by patches of stubborn brown and the creeping tendrils of crabgrass. This wasn't just any lawn; it belonged to Mrs. Blackwood, renowned socialite and owner of the grandest manor in Oakhaven. Elias knew every inch of this manicured property, having tended to its gardens for over a decade. Yet today, the task felt monumental, each blade of grass a reminder of his own weariness. 

The rhythmic whirring of his lawnmower provided a temporary solace, a steady beat against the backdrop of chirping birds and the distant hum of traffic. But beneath that monotonous sound, Elias wrestled with a growing unease. Something felt amiss in the tranquil facade of Oakhaven Manor, a dissonance he couldn't quite pinpoint. It began with Mrs. Blackwood's curt phone calls, devoid of her usual warmth. Then came the hushed whispers among the staff, their worried glances following him like shadows. And now, as Elias surveyed the seemingly pristine garden, he noticed an anomaly: a single, scarlet rose, blooming defiantly amidst the meticulously pruned lavender bushes.
