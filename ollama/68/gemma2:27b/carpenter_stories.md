The sawdust danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the dusty windows of Elias Finnigan's workshop. Outside, the bustling market square of Oakhaven thrummed with the shouts of vendors and the clatter of hooves on cobblestones. But inside, it was a world of quiet concentration. Elias, his face grimy but eyes keen, ran a calloused hand over the smooth curve of a newly carved oak leg.

His workshop, tucked away down a narrow alley, smelled of pine sap, wood polish, and the faint sweetness of beeswax. Tools hung on the walls in meticulous order: planes gleaming like silver swords, chisels waiting patiently in their leather sheaths, saws whispering promises of clean cuts. Elias's workbench, scarred and sturdy as an old oak itself, bore testament to years of dedicated craftsmanship. He was a man who spoke little, but his hands, strong and sure, communicated volumes. 

Today, however, a knot of worry tightened in Elias's chest. A commission lay unfinished on the bench: a magnificent four-poster bed for Lord Hawthorne, due to be delivered by the end of the week. The intricately carved headboard, depicting intertwined vines and mythical creatures, was nearly complete. But something felt amiss. A sense of unease, as tangible as the wood he worked with, gnawed at him.
