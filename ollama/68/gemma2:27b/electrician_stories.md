Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop drumming a frantic tattoo that echoed through Elara Blackwood's bones. The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and hot solder, a familiar cocktail that usually soothed her but tonight felt oppressive.  She tightened her grip on the multimeter, its cold metal a welcome contrast to the heat radiating from the tangled mess of wires before her.

The old Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff edge loomed large in Elara's mind. Its flickering lights – or lack thereof – had been the source of whispered complaints for weeks now, and she'd finally caved under the pressure of Mrs. Hawthorne's insistent phone calls. A century-old house with a reputation for being haunted didn't exactly scream "fun weekend job" to Elara, but the hefty sum Mrs. Hawthorne was willing to pay for a solution was hard to ignore.

Especially when her own rent was due next week.
