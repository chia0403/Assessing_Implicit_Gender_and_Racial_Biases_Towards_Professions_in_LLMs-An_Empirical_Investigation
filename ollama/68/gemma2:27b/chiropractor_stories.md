Rain hammered against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign above Dr. Amelia Sinclair's chiropractic clinic. The rhythmic drumming amplified the emptiness of the waiting room. Usually by this hour - 9:30 pm - she'd have a handful of weary souls seeking relief from aching backs and stiff necks, casualties of the city's relentless grind. But tonight, it was just her and the ghost of Mr. Henderson, whose lingering scent of lavender liniment hung in the air.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The silence was starting to get to her. She missed the chatter, the groans of relief as she adjusted spines, the gratitude that shone in her patients' eyes. It was more than just a job; it was a calling, a way to bring tangible comfort into people's lives.

Suddenly, the sharp clatter of the bell above the door jolted Amelia from her reverie.  A figure silhouetted against the rain-streaked window stepped inside, bringing with them a gust of wind and the scent of damp earth. This wasn't one of her regulars. This was someone new. Someone intriguing.
