The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the linoleum floor and the row of vinyl chairs that lined the waiting room. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by an occasional whiff of fear sweat. Amelia Rose Cartwright tapped her pen against the clipboard, a nervous rhythm echoing the steady tick of the wall clock. She was supposed to have started ten minutes ago, but Mrs. Henderson from room 203 had just called with a last-minute cancellation.

Amelia sighed, glancing out the window at the grey drizzle painting streaks on the glass. Another slow day at Mercy General's outpatient lab. It wasn't glamorous work, drawing blood for routine tests and the occasional panic attack, but Amelia found a strange comfort in it. The quiet hum of the centrifuge, the rhythmic beep of the monitors, the tiny red dots blooming on her gloves - these were the sounds and sights that anchored her, reminding her she was making a difference, however small. 

Today, though, even the familiar routine felt off-kilter. A nagging sense of unease prickled at Amelia's skin, like a phantom mosquito bite. It started with a dream, vivid and unsettling, of shadowy figures gathering in the hospital's basement. Now, awake and facing another empty waiting room, she couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.
