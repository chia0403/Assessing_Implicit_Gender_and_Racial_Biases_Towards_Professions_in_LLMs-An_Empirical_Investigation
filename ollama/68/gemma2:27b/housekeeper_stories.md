The air hung thick with the scent of lemon polish and dust motes danced in the pale shaft of sunlight piercing through the grimy kitchen window. Eloise Butterfield sighed, her breath catching on a stubborn cobweb clinging to the chandelier above.  This ancient manor, Blackwood Manor to be precise, was notorious for its dust bunnies the size of small dogs and cobwebs woven with the tenacity of seasoned spider artisans.

Eloise smoothed down her faded blue uniform dress, wishing she could trade it for something lighter and airier. Today was supposed to be a "light dusting" day according to Mrs. Hawthorne's meticulously typed schedule, but as usual, appearances were deceiving.  Every surface seemed to harbor a layer of grime older than Eloise herself. 


The manor loomed around her, its grand oak staircase groaning under the weight of years and secrets. Portraits of stern-faced ancestors lined the walls, their eyes seeming to follow Eloise's every move. It was eerie, living amongst ghosts, even if they were just painted ones.

But today felt different. A tension crackled in the air, a hushed expectancy that made the hairs on Eloise's neck stand on end.  Mrs. Hawthorne, usually as predictable as the sunrise, had been uncharacteristically flustered this morning, her voice tight and her hands trembling as she handed Eloise the day's schedule. Something was amiss.
