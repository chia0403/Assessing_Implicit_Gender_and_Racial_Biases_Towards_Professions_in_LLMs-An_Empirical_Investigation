Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's makeshift clinic, each gust sounding like a skeletal hand clawing at the corrugated iron roof. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of antiseptic and something else, something metallic and unsettling that Elias couldn't quite place. His lantern cast long, wavering shadows across the faces of his patients â€“ weary miners coughing up coal dust, a young mother clutching a feverish child, an old man whose eyes held the hollow despair of a life lived too hard.

Elias adjusted his spectacles, the lenses fogging momentarily in the humid air. He was tired, bone-tired, after days spent tending to the wounded and sick who streamed into this ramshackle outpost nestled deep within the Serpent's Tooth Mountains. This isolated mining town, Grimstone, had been struck by a strange malady, something that twisted limbs, clouded minds, and drained the very life force from its victims.
