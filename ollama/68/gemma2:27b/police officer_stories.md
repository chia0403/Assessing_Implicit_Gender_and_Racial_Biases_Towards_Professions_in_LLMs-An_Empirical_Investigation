Rain lashed against the cracked windshield, blurring the neon glow of The Rusty Lantern into an indistinct smear. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz gritted her teeth, willing the wipers to work faster. It was nights like this, when the city felt damp and unforgiving, that Izzy questioned her career choice. Being a detective in New Haven wasn't glamorous; it was a constant grind of broken promises, dead ends, and the lingering scent of despair.

Tonight's case, however, had an intriguing edge to it. A message scrawled on a dusty window: "They know." Three words, seemingly innocuous, but enough to send chills down Izzy's spine. Who were "they"? What did they know? And why The Rusty Lantern, a dimly lit dive bar known more for its questionable clientele than anything else?  Izzy sighed, pulled the patrol car into the near-empty parking lot, and stepped out into the deluge. 

The Rusty Lantern loomed before her, its neon sign flickering like a dying ember. A symphony of clattering bottles and raucous laughter emanated from within, a stark contrast to the desolate alleyway beside it. Izzy took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever secrets this rain-soaked night held.
