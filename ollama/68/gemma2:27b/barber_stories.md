The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma that had permeated Bartholomew “Bart” Fitzwilliam’s life for as long as he could remember. His barbershop, nestled on a quiet cobblestone street in Edinburgh's historic Old Town, was a sanctuary from the bustle beyond its faded green door. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the worn leather chairs. 

Bart, his greying hair neatly combed back and a hint of shaving cream clinging to his weathered cheek, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. The antique barber's pole outside needed repainting, and the chipped porcelain sink begged for replacement. But even in its faded glory, the barbershop held a timeless charm, a testament to generations of Fitzwilliams who had wielded straight razors and clippers within its walls.

Today, however, Bart wasn't focused on chipped sinks or fading paint. A new customer, a man shrouded in mystery and whispers, was due any minute. The man's name was Alistair Blackwood, and rumour had it he possessed secrets darker than the cobblestone streets outside. Bart nervously adjusted his bowtie, wondering what fate, and this enigmatic Mr. Blackwood, held for him.
