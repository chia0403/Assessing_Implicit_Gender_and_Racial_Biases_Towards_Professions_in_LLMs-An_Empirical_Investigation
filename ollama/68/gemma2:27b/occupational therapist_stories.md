Rain lashed against the windows of "Seahaven Therapies," blurring the usually vibrant seaside vista into an impressionistic watercolour. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth tapped her pen impatiently against the clipboard, her gaze fixed on the clock ticking relentlessly above the door. It was 3:47pm - three minutes late.

Eleanor wasn't one for punctuality being stretched. As a seasoned occupational therapist, she understood the importance of schedules and routine, especially for her clientele who often struggled with both. Today's client, Mrs. Margaret Finchley, was recovering from a stroke that had significantly impacted her right side mobility and fine motor skills. Eleanor had meticulously planned a series of exercises designed to help Margaret regain some independence.  

Every minute counted in the rehabilitation process, and Eleanor knew Mrs. Finchley would be eager to make progress. Yet, here she sat, wrestling with an unexpected surge of anxiety. It wasn't just the lateness; something felt off, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck that whispered unease. 

The bell above the door jingled, interrupting Eleanor's thoughts.  She looked up, her heart sinking as a figure entered, soaked to the bone and clutching a dripping umbrella. It wasn't Mrs. Finchley. A tall, gaunt man with piercing blue eyes stood awkwardly in the doorway, his face etched with worry.

"Eleanor Ainsworth?" he rasped, his voice strained. "I need your help."
