Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mirroring the storm raging inside Dr. Eleanor Vance. The air hung thick with tension, punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of her pen against the metal table. Across from her sat Julian Thorne, a man whose vacant eyes and carefully controlled demeanor belied the horrors he was accused of perpetrating. 

Eleanor, a forensic psychologist with the NYPD, had spent years delving into the darkest corners of the human psyche, but this case was proving particularly challenging. Julian, charged with the brutal murders of three young women, displayed an unnerving calm that bordered on sociopathy. He denied any involvement, claiming to have no memory of the events surrounding the killings.

Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze unwavering. "Julian," she began, her voice soft but firm, "we know you were at the scene of each crime. Your fingerprints are there. We also have eyewitness accounts placing you near the victims."  She paused, studying his reaction. "But you say you don't remember anything. Can you help me understand that?"

The interrogation room was bare, illuminated by a single harsh fluorescent light that cast long shadows across the wall. A two-way mirror reflected Eleanor's image back at her, a reminder of the unseen observers scrutinizing her every move. The pressure was immense. Cracking this case could bring closure to grieving families and potentially prevent future tragedies. But if Julian Thorne truly had no memory, Eleanor knew she faced an uphill battle, one that might lead her down a rabbit hole of psychological complexities she wasn't sure she was prepared for.
