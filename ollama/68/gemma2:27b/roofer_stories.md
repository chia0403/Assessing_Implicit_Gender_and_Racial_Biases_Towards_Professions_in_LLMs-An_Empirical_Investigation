The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Finch's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled another slate tile into place. The terracotta rooftops of Prague stretched out before him like an undulating ocean, shimmering under the July heat. Eli loved the city – its winding cobblestone streets, its baroque architecture, the scent of roasted chestnuts and trdelník wafting from street vendors below. But today, his appreciation for Prague was overshadowed by a throbbing headache and the sheer weight of the ancient roof he was repairing.

The building itself, a once-grand townhouse now divided into cramped apartments, leaned precariously against its neighbour. Eli suspected the foundations were shifting again, a common problem in this part of the Old Town. He'd been called in to fix a leak in Mrs. Novak's attic flat, but it soon became clear that the entire roof needed attention.

Eli glanced down at the street below, watching children chase pigeons through the square. A wave of longing washed over him. Down there, life seemed carefree, uncomplicated. Up here, perched on this precarious rooftop, he felt a million miles away from everything.
