The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and benzoin, a peculiar combination that always seemed to follow Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a phantom perfume. Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of Hawthorne Apothecary, blurring the vibrant depictions of flora and fauna into an impressionistic watercolour. Outside, the cobblestone street gleamed under the flickering gaslights, deserted save for a stray dog huddled beneath a dripping awning.

Amelia sighed, her reflection staring back from the polished mahogany counter. Dark circles shadowed her sapphire blue eyes, testament to the long hours she'd spent meticulously grinding herbs and compounding potions. Being the only pharmacist in Oakhaven had its drawbacks; the solitude was often crushing, broken only by the occasional clatter of jars or the hushed murmur of a customer seeking solace in her remedies. Tonight, however, even the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock seemed to amplify the silence.

A sudden clang from the back room startled Amelia. She cautiously pushed aside the heavy velvet curtain separating the shop from her private work space. The faint scent of burnt rosemary hung in the air, and a cloud of grey smoke billowed from behind a stack of ancient tomes.
