Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Sterling & Sons accounting firm, blurring the cityscape into a watercolour mess of greys and yellows. Penelope Ainsworth shivered, tugging her cardigan tighter around herself as she adjusted the stack of invoices on her desk. The old radiator wheezed ineffectually in the corner, barely making a dent in the damp chill that permeated the office. 

Penelope sighed, glancing at the clock ticking relentlessly towards five o'clock. Mr. Sterling was due back any minute from his afternoon meeting, and she knew there would be a mountain of dictations waiting for her.  She idly wondered what it would be like to work in one of those gleaming skyscrapers across the street, filled with bright young things on their way up the corporate ladder. Instead, Penelope was stuck here, shuffling papers and fielding calls for a man who seemed to exist solely on coffee and bad temper.

But today was different. Today, Penelope had found something unusual tucked away amongst the invoices: a single, yellowed envelope addressed simply "To whom it may concern." It felt heavy in her hand, like it contained a secret waiting to be uncovered.
