Rain lashed against the grime-coated windows of the drafting room, blurring the city lights beyond into an impressionistic watercolour. The steady thrum of the old ventilation system, wheezing like a chain smoker with emphysema, competed with the rhythmic tapping of Elias Finch's mechanical pencil against his drawing board.  Elias, a man whose age was perpetually somewhere between thirty and forty thanks to the perpetual dimness of the drafting room, squinted at the intricate blueprints spread before him. 

The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and graphite, punctuated by the occasional whiff of ozone from the sputtering photocopier in the corner. Stacks of rolled-up blueprints leaned precariously against the walls, forming a silent testament to years of forgotten projects and unrealized dreams. Elias sighed, rubbing his weary eyes. He was staring down the barrel of another all-nighter. This latest commission â€“ designing a retractable roof for the new opera house - was proving more challenging than anticipated.
