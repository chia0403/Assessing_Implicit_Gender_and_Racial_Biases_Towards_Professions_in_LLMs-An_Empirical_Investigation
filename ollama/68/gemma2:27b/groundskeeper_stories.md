Arthur Pendlebury adjusted his worn canvas hat, shielding his eyes from the nascent light as he surveyed the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor. Dew clung to emerald blades like scattered diamonds, reflecting the burgeoning sun. A symphony of birdsong filled the air, punctuated by the distant clanging of a milkman's delivery. This was Arthur's domain, his sanctuary. For twenty years, he had tended these grounds with meticulous care, coaxing life from the earth and sculpting nature into breathtaking artistry.

Today, however, a tremor of unease ran through him. The manor, usually shrouded in an air of quiet dignity, seemed to hum with unspoken tension. A strange stillness hung over the rose garden, where normally fragrant blooms lay heavy and silent. Even the playful squirrels that scampered amongst the ancient oak trees were conspicuously absent. Something was amiss, Arthur could feel it in his bones.
