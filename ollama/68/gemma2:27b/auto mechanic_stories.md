The rusty groan of the garage door echoed through the cavernous space, announcing the arrival of dawn.  Dust motes danced in the pale light that streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating the haphazard collection of tools and half-dismantled engines scattered across Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's workbench. Outside, the Arizona sun was already beginning its relentless climb towards noon, promising another scorcher. Amy wiped a smudge of grease from her forehead with the back of her calloused hand, the scent of gasoline and motor oil clinging to her like a second skin. This wasn't some fancy dealership showroom – it was Rodriguez Auto Repair, a ramshackle haven for forgotten clunkers and their heartbroken owners, nestled on the outskirts of dusty Tucumcari, New Mexico. 


Today was shaping up to be another long one. The phone hadn't stopped ringing since she'd flipped the "Open" sign. A rancher with a sputtering pickup, a single mom whose minivan wouldn't start, and Mr. Henderson from down the street, whose vintage Chevy needed its usual tune-up. Amy sighed – she loved her work, the feeling of bringing these mechanical beasts back to life, but sometimes she yearned for something more, a spark of excitement beyond the familiar rhythm of wrenches and pistons. Little did she know, that spark was about to arrive in the form of a beat-up '67 Mustang, coughing its way into her driveway.
