The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beaumont's head as she sifted through another stack of college applications.  Rain lashed against the windows of her cramped office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. It was mid-May, and seniors were scrambling, deadlines looming like thunderclouds. Eloise, with her neatly coiffed auburn hair and perpetually worried frown lines etched around her kind blue eyes, felt the weight of their futures pressing down on her.

Her office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Northwood High, was a testament to years of accumulated hope and anxiety. Inspirational posters vied for space with college brochures, motivational quotes clashed with scribbled notes, and the faint scent of stale coffee hung heavy in the air. Outside, the manicured lawns of the prestigious suburban school shimmered under a veil of rain, but within these walls, Eloise felt the raw urgency of dreams deferred and futures uncertain.
