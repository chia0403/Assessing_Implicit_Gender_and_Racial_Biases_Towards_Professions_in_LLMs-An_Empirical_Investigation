The scent of aging paper and leather clung to Emilia Cartwright like a second skin.  She inhaled it deeply as she straightened a row of tattered cookbooks, their spines cracked and faded from years of eager hands flipping through them. Sunlight slanted through the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. It was a sanctuary, this place, a hushed haven of knowledge tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street. 

Emilia loved the rhythm of her days: the steady click of keys as she catalogued new arrivals, the murmur of voices from the reading room, the occasional gasp of delight when someone stumbled upon a long-forgotten treasure amongst the shelves. Today, however, was different. A letter lay unopened on her desk, addressed in elegant cursive, promising something both intriguing and unsettling. The sender: a mysterious benefactor named Silas Blackwood.
