The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and simmering garlic. In the heart of Little Italy, nestled between a bustling bakery and an antique bookstore overflowing with leather-bound tomes, stood Zia's Kitchen. It was here that Alessandro Rossi, with his flour-dusted apron and twinkling eyes, reigned supreme. The kitchen was his domain – a symphony of sizzling pans, rhythmic chopping, and the comforting gurgle of simmering tomato sauce.

Alessandro hummed along to the crackling radio, his hands moving with practiced grace as he kneaded dough for fresh focaccia. He loved this time of day, the quiet before the evening rush. It allowed him to savor the familiar rhythm of preparation, the anticipation building like a crescendo in his chest. Tonight was special – Zia Emilia's 80th birthday, and Alessandro had planned a feast fit for a queen.  

But as the sun dipped low, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street, a chilling gust rattled the windowpane, carrying with it a whisper of unease. The radio sputtered and died, plunging the kitchen into an unsettling silence. Alessandro paused, his dough forgotten in his hand, a shiver crawling up his spine. Something wasn't right.
