The air hung thick with humidity, even at this hour.  Cicadas buzzed their incessant song from the overgrown bougainvillea that clawed its way up the crumbling facade of the old hotel. Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz adjusted her panama hat, pushing back a stray curl escaping her bun. The scent of salt and mildew permeated everything, a stark reminder that Hurricane Maria had ripped through this once-thriving coastal town just two years ago. Now, peeling paint and boarded windows stared out from the deserted buildings lining Calle Esperanza – Hope Street, ironically enough. Esme shifted her weight, her notebook clutched tightly in one hand, her pen poised expectantly over the page.  This story had to be good, not just for her career but for San Juan itself. The town needed a win, a reason to believe that life could bloom again amidst the ruins.

She was here to interview Esperanza Rivera, a woman who claimed to have seen something extraordinary in the storm's aftermath – something that defied logic and promised to rewrite history. Esme wasn’t sure she believed it, but hope, like bougainvillea, clung stubbornly even in the harshest conditions.
