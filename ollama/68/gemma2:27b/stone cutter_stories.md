The morning mist clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin as he trudged up the steep path towards his workshop. Dawn was barely breaking over the craggy peaks that ringed the village of Stonemill, casting long shadows across the dew-laden fields. The air hummed with the chirping of unseen birds and the distant bleating of sheep.

Elias’s workshop, carved into the side of a moss-covered cliff face, was a sanctuary from the harsh realities of life in Stonemill. Inside, the smell of damp stone mingled with the sweet scent of beeswax polish used to treat his tools. Sunlight streamed through a narrow window, illuminating the intricate patterns he'd painstakingly carved onto a block of white marble.

He ran a calloused hand over the cool surface, tracing the delicate curves of a rose in bloom. This piece was for Lady Elara, the Baroness's daughter – a commission that promised to bring him much-needed coin. But Elias yearned for more than just commissions. He dreamt of carving stories into stone, epics and legends whispered by the wind itself.
