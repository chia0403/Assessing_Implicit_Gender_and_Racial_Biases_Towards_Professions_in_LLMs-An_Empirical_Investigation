Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Harold Fitzwilliam's workshop, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. The air hung thick with the smell of rusting pipes and lukewarm coffee. Harold, a stocky man with hands calloused from years of wrestling stubborn fixtures, squinted at the blueprint spread across his workbench.

The job was a doozy - rerouting the entire plumbing system for the old Victorian mansion on Elm Street. The owner, a flamboyant art collector named Mr. Beaumont, insisted on having antique copper pipes installed throughout, adding an extra layer of complexity to an already challenging project. 

Harold sighed, pushing his greasy hair back from his forehead. He loved a good challenge, but he couldn't help feeling that this job might be biting off more than he could chew. Still, Mr. Beaumont was paying handsomely, and Harold wasn't one to turn down honest work, no matter how eccentric the client.
