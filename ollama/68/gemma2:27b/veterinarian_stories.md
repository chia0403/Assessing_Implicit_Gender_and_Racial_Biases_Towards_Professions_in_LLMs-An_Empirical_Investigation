Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic, blurring the sleepy mountain town into an impressionistic watercolor. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Inside, Dr. Amelia Blackwood meticulously stitched a tear in the ear of a floppy-eared Basset Hound named Winston, humming softly to herself. Her movements were precise and practiced, her brow furrowed in concentration even as Winston snuffled contentedly at her side.

Amelia had always felt most at home surrounded by animals. Their honesty, their unwavering love – it was a balm for the soul. But lately, a disquiet had settled over her. The quiet of the mountains, once so soothing, now seemed to amplify a growing unease. Strange occurrences were plaguing Willow Creek: livestock behaving erratically, unnatural tracks appearing in the forest, whispers of shadow figures flitting through the trees at night. 

And then there was Winston's owner, old Mrs. Hawthorne, who swore her dog had been communicating with her – warning her about something dark and dangerous lurking in the woods. Amelia initially dismissed it as a lonely woman seeking companionship from her canine companion. But the fear in Mrs. Hawthorne's eyes, the tremor in her voice, made Amelia question everything she thought she knew.  

The rain continued to fall, its insistent rhythm a drumbeat against the silence of the clinic. As Amelia finished stitching Winston’s ear and gently stroked his head, a new sound pierced through the drumming: a sharp, piercing shriek echoing from the heart of the forest.
