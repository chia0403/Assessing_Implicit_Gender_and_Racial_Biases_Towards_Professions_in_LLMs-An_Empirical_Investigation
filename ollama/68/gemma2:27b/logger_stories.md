The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood.  His worn leather boots crunched on the forest floor, the sound muffled by a thick layer of fallen leaves. Sunlight, filtered through the towering Douglas firs, dappled the path ahead. A symphony of bird calls filled the air, punctuated by the occasional rasping caw of a crow. 

Elias, his face weathered and tanned from years spent under the sun, paused to survey the scene.  Giant trees, some wider than any man could reach around, stood sentinel over the ancient forest. He ran a calloused hand over the rough bark of a nearby fir, feeling the deep grooves etched by time and weather. This was his domain, his sanctuary. For generations, his family had carved a living from these woods, felling trees with respect and ensuring the forest's continued life. Today, Elias would be felling a Douglas fir, its massive trunk destined to become beams for a new lodge in the valley below.
