Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's classroom, blurring the vibrant finger-painted sunflowers that adorned the glass. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the tiny, cluttered space, momentarily silencing the excited chatter of her five-year-old charges.

Little Liam was already attempting to build a fort out of the brightly colored cushions scattered around the reading nook, while Maya, ever the budding socialite, had organized a tea party at her miniature table, complete with plastic dinosaurs as guests.


Amelia knew she needed to act fast. Twenty restless kindergartners and a cancelled field trip were a recipe for disaster.  But what could she possibly do on a rainy day like this?
