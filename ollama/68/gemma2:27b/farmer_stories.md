The wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of rain-soaked earth and freshly cut hay. Silas squinted towards the horizon, where bruised purple clouds were gathering like a bruise on the sky. He knew what those clouds meant: trouble. A storm was brewing, one that threatened to undo all the hard work he'd put into his cornfield over the past few months.

Silas Blackwood wasn't a man easily fazed. He'd been tending this land for fifty years, weathering droughts and floods, blizzards and scorching summers. But this storm felt different. It carried an ominous weight, a sense of impending doom that settled deep in his bones. He tugged at the brim of his worn Stetson hat, shielding his eyes from the stinging wind, and surveyed his land. Rows upon rows of emerald green corn stalks stretched before him, their tassels waving desperately in the approaching gale. 

He needed to act fast. The storm was closing in, and every minute counted.
