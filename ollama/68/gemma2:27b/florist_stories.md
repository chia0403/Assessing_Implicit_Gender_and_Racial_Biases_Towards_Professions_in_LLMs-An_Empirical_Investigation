The bell above the shop door chimed a cheerful greeting, jarring Elara Finch from her reverie. She'd been lost in thought, delicately pruning the drooping head of a pale pink rose, imagining its future glory as part of a bridal bouquet. The scent of lilies and gardenias hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp soil from the overflowing buckets at her feet. Elara ran her fingers over the velvety petals of a crimson carnation, their color vibrant against the muted green backdrop of ferns and eucalyptus leaves.

Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating the dusty jars and vintage vases lining the shelves. Her shop, "Finch & Bloom," nestled on a quiet cobbled street in the heart of Edinburgh, was her sanctuary. The clatter of trams outside faded into background noise as Elara focused on her craft, her hands moving with practiced grace. Today, however, the usual calm was disrupted by a figure who stood hesitantly at the entrance, their silhouette obscured by the afternoon sun.

Elara straightened, a welcoming smile already blooming on her face. "Good afternoon," she called out, setting down her shears. "What can I do for you?"
