The neon sign outside flickered, casting an unsteady glow on the rain-slicked alleyway. It read "The Rusty Mug" in faded pink and turquoise letters, its cheerfulness at odds with the gritty reality of the establishment it advertised. Inside, Balthazar “Baz” Thorne surveyed his domain: a dimly lit bar with chipped Formica countertops and mismatched stools. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and unfulfilled dreams. Baz himself wasn't much to look at - lean and weathered with a face etched by years of late nights and hard living. But behind those weary blue eyes lay a keen intelligence, honed by countless hours spent listening to the confessions and sorrows of his clientele.  Tonight, the usual crowd was sparse: a lone gambler nursing a whiskey in the corner, a couple arguing quietly over cheap wine, and a woman with haunted eyes staring into her empty glass. Baz sighed, wiping down the bar with a rag that had seen better days. He knew this night wouldn't be anything special. Just another shift in the endless cycle of pouring drinks and absorbing pain. But then, the bell above the door jingled, and a stranger walked in, bringing with him a gust of cold air and the promise of something unexpected.
