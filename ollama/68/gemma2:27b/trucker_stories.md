The neon sign of the Rusty Rig diner buzzed with an insistent hum, casting sickly yellow light onto the rain-slicked asphalt. Reginald "Reg" Thornton sighed, his breath fogging the window of his Kenworth T680. He hadn't planned on stopping in Harmony Creek, Nevada, a dusty pitstop clinging to the edge of the Mojave Desert, but the relentless downpour and a flashing engine light had conspired against him.

The diner itself was a relic from a bygone era - chrome accents dulled with rust, vinyl booths cracked and faded, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and fried onions.  Reg tugged his trucker cap further down, shielding his tired eyes from the harsh fluorescent lighting as he pushed open the heavy glass door. 

The bell above jingled a mournful tune. A few truckers sat slumped over mugs of coffee, their faces etched with weariness mirroring Reg's own. Behind the counter, a woman with hair the color of spun silver and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand desert nights looked up from polishing a chipped mug. 


"You look like you could use somethin' warm," she said, her voice raspy but kind. "Coffee? Pie?"

Reg hesitated, then nodded. “Coffee would be great.”  He couldn’t resist the pull of the pecan pie glistening under a heat lamp. This stop was already throwing off his schedule, might as well make the best of it.
