The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic green glow on Amelia Blackwood's tired face. It read "Benny's Bar & Grill" in faded cursive, promising greasy comfort food and lukewarm beer â€“ not exactly what Amelia needed after 14 hours wrestling with her client's tax returns. But the alternative was her cramped apartment overlooking a perpetually honking street, and the lure of anonymity in Benny's dimly lit booths was strong.

Amelia pushed through the swinging doors, the scent of stale fries and spilled beer assaulting her senses. The bar was predictably crowded for a Friday night, a motley crew of regulars hunched over drinks, their faces illuminated by flickering screens showing a forgotten baseball game.  She found an empty stool at the end of the counter, away from the boisterous laughter and drunken singing emanating from the backroom karaoke session. 

As she slumped onto the worn vinyl seat, Amelia sighed. Numbers were her lifeblood, her comfort zone. Yet, tonight, even the neatly ordered columns of a spreadsheet couldn't soothe the gnawing unease in her gut. Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and it had been whispering at the edge of her consciousness for weeks now.
