Outside, the clamor of New Orleans' French Quarter – jazz horns, the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages, and the excited chatter of tourists – bled through the thin walls of "Eloise's Enchanted Nails." But inside, it was a sanctuary of quiet concentration, punctuated only by the rhythmic rasp of Eloise’s file.
