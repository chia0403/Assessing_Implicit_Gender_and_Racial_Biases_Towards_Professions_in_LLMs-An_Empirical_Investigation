Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Winthrop's office, mirroring the storm brewing in her gut. The "For Sale" sign planted on the manicured lawn outside was barely visible through the torrent. This wasn't how she envisioned her first solo listing as an independent realtor going.  She'd poured her heart and soul into renovating this charming Victorian cottage, convinced it would be a quick sell. But weeks had passed, and the only interested parties were pigeons seeking refuge from the deluge.

Amelia stared at the faded floral wallpaper in her office – inherited from the previous owner of the building – and sighed. The scent of lavender disinfectant, though meant to evoke a sense of calm, did little to soothe her anxieties.  She needed this sale. She needed it to prove she could make it on her own, to silence the whispers of doubt that clung to her like the dampness in the air.
