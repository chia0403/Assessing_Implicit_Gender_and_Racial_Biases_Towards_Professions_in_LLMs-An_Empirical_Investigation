Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon cityscape into a watercolor mess. Sirens wailed, their mournful song swallowed by the downpour. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her auburn braid plastered to her forehead with sweat, fought to secure an IV line in the arm of a young man clutching his chest. 

His breaths were shallow, panicked gasps that rasped through the oxygen mask Ellie had clamped over his face.  The air inside the ambulance crackled with tension – the smell of antiseptic mingled with fear and adrenaline. Ellie, her hazel eyes focused on the task at hand, muttered a silent prayer as she finally felt the needle find its mark. 


This was Chicago in November, the city draped in a chilly fog that seeped into everything. Ellie knew the dangers of this weather – hypothermia, car accidents, increased heart attacks. Tonight was no different. The call had come just minutes ago - a possible cardiac arrest at a dingy bar on Halsted Street. Ellie and her partner, Mark, a gruff but dependable veteran EMT, were racing against time.

Ellie glanced up, catching Mark's concerned gaze in the rearview mirror. His lips formed a silent question: "How's he doing?"  She forced a reassuring smile, knowing that every second counted. "Holding on," she mouthed back. 


The sirens screamed, urging them forward into the heart of the storm.
