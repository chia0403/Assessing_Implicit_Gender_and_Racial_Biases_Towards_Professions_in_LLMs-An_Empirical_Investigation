The humid air hung thick in Lavender Lane Salon, clinging to Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's skin like a second shirt. The ceiling fan whirred overhead, valiantly trying to stir the stillness, but succeeding only in pushing around hot air. Esme tugged at her collar, her braid already starting to loosen from the sweat gathering on her scalp. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the street, baking the sidewalk into shimmering waves.  It was another scorcher in Havenwood, a sleepy Southern town where time seemed to move at the pace of molasses in January.

Esme peered into the mirror, scrutinizing her reflection. The vibrant turquoise streak she'd added to her dark hair last week had faded slightly, mirroring the weariness creeping into her own eyes. Three haircuts and two color treatments later, she was starting to feel the strain. But Havenwood was a town where everyone knew everyone, and gossip traveled faster than a hurricane. 

Today, Mrs. Clementine Hawthorne was due for her weekly "touch-up." Esme braced herself. Mrs. Hawthorne wasn't known for her patience or her subtlety when it came to critiquing Esme's work.
