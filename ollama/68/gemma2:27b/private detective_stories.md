Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Thorne's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap tobacco, punctuated by the occasional cough from Alistair himself. He was hunched over a worn-out photograph, its edges softened by years of handling. A woman stared back at him – auburn hair cascading down her shoulders, emerald eyes holding a hint of mischief.  

"Evelyn Thorne," Alistair murmured, tracing her name with a calloused finger. "Missing since '47. Case gone cold." 


He sighed, the photograph slipping from his grasp and landing face down on his cluttered desk. Evelyn was more than just a case; she was the ghost that haunted him, a reminder of a past he couldn't escape. Alistair Thorne wasn't just any private detective – he was her nephew, the last blood relative who still clung to the hope of finding her. 

The insistent buzz of his rotary phone ripped through the melancholic silence. Alistair picked it up, the voice on the other end sharp and clipped, "Mr. Thorne? This is Miss Penelope Albright. I need your help."

Alistair's gut twisted. A new case meant pushing Evelyn further into the recesses of his mind, but he couldn't turn away. He was a detective, after all. It was what he did.

"Tell me everything," he said, already reaching for his battered fedora.
