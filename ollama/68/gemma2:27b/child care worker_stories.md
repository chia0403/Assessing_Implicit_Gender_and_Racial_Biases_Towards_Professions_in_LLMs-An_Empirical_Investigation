Rain lashed against the windows of Sunnyside Daycare, blurring the cheerful yellow paint into an impressionist smear. Inside, Emilia "Em" Rodriguez wrestled with a tangled mess of crayons, trying to coax them back into their box before three-year-old Leo launched himself at her in a fit of frustrated tears.

The daycare was usually a riot of joyful noise – giggles echoing off the brightly coloured walls, the rhythmic thump of tiny feet on the worn carpet. But today, a heavy silence had settled over the room, punctuated only by the insistent drumming of rain and Leo's mournful sobs. Em sighed, knowing that the impending storm meant parents would be delayed, leaving her with a room full of restless children long past their nap time. 

She glanced at the clock – already ten minutes past their scheduled pick-up. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  Em loved her job, loved seeing the world through the innocent eyes of the children she cared for. But today, with the storm raging outside and the children growing increasingly irritable, she felt a wave of exhaustion wash over her.
