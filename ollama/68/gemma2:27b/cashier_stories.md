The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Ainsworth's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. She tapped her fingernail against the worn countertop, counting down the seconds until her shift ended. Ten. Nine. Eight… Another customer shuffled up to her register, their face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. Eloise plastered on her practiced smile, "Good evening, how can I help you?"

The air in the dingy convenience store, nestled between a boarded-up laundromat and a pawn shop with peeling paint, hung thick and stale. Outside, the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign struggled to penetrate the greasy film that clung to the window. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond.

Eloise knew this scene well. It was her life: endless nights punctuated by weary customers and the monotonous beep of the cash register. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced on the back of her neck as the figure in the hat slowly reached into their bag. Eloise’s smile faltered. The air grew heavy with anticipation.
