Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Finch's third-grade classroom, mimicking the frantic drumming her fingers did on her desk. Outside, the usually vibrant autumn leaves were swirling in a frenzy of orange and brown, whipped into a dizzying vortex by the wind. Inside, the room was a haven of organized chaos: crayon drawings pinned to bulletin boards, alphabet charts hanging crookedly, and a jumble of half-finished projects scattered across tables.  Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting to the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall. It was dismissal time, but with the storm raging outside, she knew most parents wouldn't dare venture out. She glanced at the anxious faces of her students, their eyes wide and reflecting the storm's fury.

"Alright everyone," Eleanor announced, forcing a cheerful smile. "Looks like we're having an unexpected sleepover party! Don't worry, I have plenty of games and stories to keep us entertained."
