Rain lashed against the rusted tin roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez's weary bones. The power flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the threadbare waiting room. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the already saturated earth into a frenzy. It was nights like these that Ellie questioned her sanity for choosing to practice medicine in this remote corner of Appalachia.

She sighed, rubbing tired eyes as she surveyed the waiting room. Three patients huddled together on mismatched chairs, their faces etched with worry and discomfort. A young mother clutched a feverish child close, his cough echoing through the small space. An elderly man sat hunched over, clutching his stomach with a grimace. Ellie knew they were all counting on her, the only healthcare provider for miles around. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for another long night.  

The clinic door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and rain along with a tall, gaunt figure cloaked in shadows. Ellie's heart skipped a beat. This wasn't one of her usual patients.
