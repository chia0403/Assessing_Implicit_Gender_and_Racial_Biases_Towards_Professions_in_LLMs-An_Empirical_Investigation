Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Eloise Ainsworth's studio apartment, mimicking the torrent of anxiety churning in her stomach. The deadline for the Hawthorne Manor redesign loomed, an imposing grey cloud threatening to eclipse the sunshine she desperately craved. Eloise, with her fiery red hair and emerald green eyes that could spot a misplaced throw pillow from across a room, was known for transforming spaces into havens. But Hawthorne Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion steeped in decades of neglect and whispers of a tragic past, felt different.

Every creak of the ancient floorboards, every flickering shadow cast by the rain-streaked windows seemed to whisper warnings.  Eloise sighed, pushing aside her sketches for a moment to gaze out at the stormy city skyline. Could she really breathe life back into this decaying beauty, or was she destined to become another casualty of Hawthorne Manor's haunting legacy?
