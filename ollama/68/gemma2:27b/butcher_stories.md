The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and spice, a familiar aroma that clung to Thaddeus Bartholomew Buckle like a second skin. His shop, "Buckle's Best," stood proudly on Bleakers Lane, its crimson awning faded but still vibrant against the perpetually grey backdrop of Grimsborough. The cobblestone street outside was slick with morning mist, reflecting the dim glow of gaslights struggling to pierce the gloom. Thaddeus, a man built like an ox with forearms thicker than most men's thighs, expertly cleaved a side of beef, the rhythmic thud of his butcher's knife echoing through the quiet shop.

Today was market day, and the anticipation hung thick in the air. Thaddeus, despite his gruff exterior and penchant for bloody aprons, took pride in providing the finest cuts to Grimsborough's denizens. He knew their preferences like he knew the lines on his own calloused hands – Mrs. Featherstone craved her lamb chops trimmed just so, while Mr. Higgins swore by Buckle's famous blood sausage.

But today felt different. A tremor of unease ran through Thaddeus as he sharpened his cleaver, a feeling amplified by the arrival of an unfamiliar figure outside his shop window. Tall and cloaked in shadow, the stranger stood motionless, their gaze fixed on Thaddeus with unnerving intensity. The butcher paused, his hand hovering over the gleaming blade, a sudden chill settling over him despite the warmth emanating from the roaring hearth at the back of his shop. Something about this visitor felt…wrong.
