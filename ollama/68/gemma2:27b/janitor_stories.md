The flickering fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous tune above Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins as he pushed his mop across the grimy linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and disinfectant, a peculiar aroma unique to the Grand Majestic Theater.  

Bart had been the night janitor here for fifteen years. He knew every creak of the aging wooden seats, every dust bunny nestled in the velvet curtains, every stain on the once-gleaming red carpet. The theater, a relic of a bygone era, was fading fast, its grandeur dimmed by chipped paint and flickering spotlights. But to Bart, it remained a sanctuary, a place where he could lose himself amidst the ghosts of laughter and applause. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine as he mopped the stage, the lone spotlight casting long, skeletal shadows across the empty seats. The silence was broken only by the faint hum of the ventilation system and the distant rumble of a passing bus. It was then Bart noticed it - a single, crimson rose lying abandoned on the center stage.
