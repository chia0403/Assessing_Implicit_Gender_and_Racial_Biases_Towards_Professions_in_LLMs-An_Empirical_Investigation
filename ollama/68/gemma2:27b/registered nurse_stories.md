Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm raging inside Evelyn Rose Carmichael. Three years she'd been on this night shift, three years of witnessing life's fragility through bleary eyes and numb fingers. Tonight, though, the weight felt unbearable. The acrid smell of disinfectant couldn't mask the metallic tang of fear clinging to the air in Room 207, where a young boy lay pale and motionless, his chest barely rising with each shallow breath. Evelyn adjusted the IV drip, her practiced movements betraying the tremor in her heart. She glanced at the chart clipped to the footboard â€“ Liam O'Connell, eight years old, leukemia.  He was supposed to be getting better. He was supposed to be home playing with his dog by now, not fighting for every breath in a sterile white room. 

Evelyn took a deep, steadying breath. She couldn't afford to break down now. Liam needed her. He needed someone to hold onto hope when he himself couldn't. As she brushed a stray strand of hair from Liam's forehead, she whispered a silent prayer, begging for a miracle.

The storm outside raged on, oblivious to the battle being fought within those hospital walls.
