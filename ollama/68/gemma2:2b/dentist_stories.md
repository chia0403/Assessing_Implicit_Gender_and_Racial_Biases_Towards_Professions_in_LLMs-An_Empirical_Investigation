The worn leather chair groaned under Dr. Alistair Finch's bulk as he adjusted the patient's head with practiced ease. The familiar scent of antiseptic and nervous sweat hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the quiet hum of machinery. Outside, London bustled about, oblivious to the hushed drama unfolding within the walls of the practice:  a symphony of tiny instruments clashing against molars, a steady drip-drip of water from a leaking faucet in the corner, and Mrs. Higgins' incessant sniffling as she recounted her grandson's 'terrible toothache'.

Dr. Finch, his eyes shielded by thick frames that looked like they had seen too many decades pass, ran his hand through his unruly brown hair.  His mind wasn't focused on the chipped enamel in front of him, but rather on a letter he received earlier that day - a summons to a conference in Paris. A chance to present his groundbreaking research on biocompatible fillings, a breakthrough he'd dedicated years to. His heart was a tight knot of ambition and dread. He wasn't sure if this new hope for dentistry or the looming anxiety of his private life would take precedence.
