## Opening

The aroma of pine needles and damp earth clung to everything in Dr. Amelia Croft's small office. Sunlight filtered through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing on her antique desk piled high with patient files and a stack of worn anatomy books. Outside, the wind howled like a restless wolf, rattling the old glass panes of the building. 

It was just past dusk, casting long shadows across the cluttered waiting room filled with soft blankets, cushions, and magazines with articles titled 'Relaxing Stretches for Aching Muscles'. Amelia sighed, her hands unconsciously tracing the worn leather of her stethoscope.  It wasn't easy being a chiropractor in a quiet mountain town. While she loved her work, there was something about the stillness, the lack of frantic energy, that left her feeling hollowed out like an empty egg shell.

She glanced over at the clock â€“ 6:15 pm. Her first patient, Mrs. O'Malley, was due any minute now.

**Name:** Dr. Amelia Croft
**Setting:** A small, secluded mountain town nestled in the heart of Washington state.  Known for its stunning scenery and peaceful atmosphere.
