## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A quaint seaside town in Maine called Oakhaven. Known for its picturesque harbor and lobster shack culture, the town holds onto its quiet rhythm year-round. But this July, a sense of unease hangs heavier than salt spray on the breeze. 

**Character:** Ms. Eleanor Thorne, 32, with auburn curls escaping from her bun and eyes that hold both warmth and weary wisdom. A second-grade teacher at Oakhaven Elementary for the past five years, she’s known as a beacon of calm in the storm of early childhood chaos. But lately, even Ms. Thorne feels the walls of Oakhaven whispering secrets. 

**Opening:**  The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and freshly baked blueberry muffins as Ms. Thorne surveyed her classroom. Her second-grade charges were buzzing like a colony of bumblebees in their summer excitement. The playground's usual chaos had been replaced by the quiet, controlled frenzy of pre-summer learning activities. 

"Okay, class," Ms. Thorne announced with a smile, adjusting her glasses that perched precariously on her nose. "Now for our reading corner…and who can tell me why this little book is called 'The Whispering Walls?'"  Ms. Thorne’s fingers tapped on the worn cover of the familiar children's book she had cherished since childhood. The words "whispering walls" were etched into its faded fabric, a constant reminder of her grandmother's whispered bedtime stories, woven with tales of mystery and magic. 

But this time, the story felt different. A faint chill settled over the room as if the very walls themselves held their breath.  Ms. Thorne looked at her students – some eyes wide with wonder, others nervously staring beyond the window where shadows danced in the afternoon light. And then a voice, soft yet unsettling, echoed from somewhere behind them - *whispering...*
