The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth as Elias "Hawkeye" Jackson lugged another felled log through the dense undergrowth.  Sunlight filtered weakly through the towering pines, dappling the forest floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. It was early summer, a time when the woods breathed life into themselves again after months of slumbering stillness, yet Hawkeye felt nothing but an overwhelming weariness settle into his bones. Every log he felled chipped away at his dwindling will to continue.

Hawkeye’s father had taught him the ways of the forest like it was etched into his very being: how to read the subtle shifts in the wind that signaled an approaching storm, where to find the hidden springs for a quick drink on a scorching day, and how to choose the right tree to fell with a single, clean strike.  But now, at 37 years old, Hawkeye felt like a withered branch caught by the relentless force of time's grip. The once-vibrant green fire in his eyes had begun to fade, replaced by the dull weariness of countless days spent under the unforgiving sun. He missed his father’s stories of the woods and their mythical creatures that lived within its depths, but they were just echoes now, fading with each passing year. 


He looked up, a sense of longing washing over him as he saw the last rays of sunlight paint the sky a fiery orange and red before giving way to a deep twilight.  His gaze lingered on the setting sun for a moment too long; in his mind’s eye, he could almost picture his father standing beside him, guiding him with words like gentle whispers through a stormy wind.
