The air in The Evermore Agency was thick with an unsettling blend of floral polish and old paper. It clung to Evelyn Thorne's coat like dust motes, settling on her shoulders as she straightened her trademark smile at the ringing phone. 

Evelyn wasn’t sure what it was about The Evermore Agency – or perhaps more specifically, its clientele - that kept her perpetually perched on this precarious edge of sanity. She greeted clients with an affability that bordered on the uncanny, while their inquiries into missing heirlooms, long-lost love letters, and cursed paintings were as peculiar as they were demanding. 

The agency's location, a rambling Victorian mansion tucked away in the middle of a bustling city suburb, was equally baffling.  Its stained glass windows, once vibrant with color, now held the melancholy tint of forgotten dreams. A faded tapestry depicting a fantastical cityscape hung precariously above Evelyn's desk, its once-vivid colours muted by time and neglect. The very air seemed to hum with an unspoken tension, making it feel like she was waiting for the next peculiar summons to emerge from the depths of this old, unsettling building.

Her days were filled with strange and fascinating inquiries, each one more perplexing than the last. Yet, she never quite felt out of place in this peculiar world of whispers and shadows, bound by the unspoken promise of the next unexpected tale that would unravel before her.
