The rain hammered against the attic windowpane like a thousand tiny fists pounding on wood. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne huddled deeper into her worn armchair, its faded floral pattern offering little comfort against the chill seeping in from the eaves. Outside, thunder boomed and lightning flickered across the sky, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the single ray of moonlight that pierced through a crack in the boarded-up window. 

Amy was lost in another world.  She had been for days now, consumed by her latest story - a gothic thriller she believed to be truly gripping.  Her protagonist, Elias Thorne, a brooding and tortured novelist hiding away in an ancient manor house after witnessing a crime that shook him to his very core.  He'd been plagued with haunting nightmares of the incident – each dream more vivid than the last.

The old typewriter clattered under Amy's fingers as she tapped out another sentence, a shiver running down her spine despite the heat from the kerosene lamp illuminating her desk. The story wasn’t just fictional. It was mirroring what had happened to her own life years ago, when she and her brother had discovered a dark secret in their grandfather's attic - a secret that had irrevocably changed everything they knew about family and lineage. 

The weight of this knowledge pressed on her like a physical burden. The storm outside mirrored the tempest brewing within her, each flash of lightning a reminder of the unresolved past. This time, she was determined to unravel the truth – no matter the cost.
