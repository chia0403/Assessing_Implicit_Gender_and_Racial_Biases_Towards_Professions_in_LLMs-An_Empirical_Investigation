## Opening 

Rain lashed against the cockpit windows of the vintage B-17 bomber, each drop echoing like a tiny gunshot in the vast silence that lay between Ethan "Eagle" Avery and his navigator, Captain Sarah “Whisp” Whitworth.  The engine coughed to life, sputtering like an old man's wheeze as it finally wrestled with the frigid night air. Above them, the moon hung a ghostly sliver against the bruised, charcoal sky of the Montana plains, barely illuminating the swirling dust devils that danced across the barren landscape. 

Ethan ran his calloused hand over the weathered leather of the control yoke, feeling its worn grooves beneath his fingertips. The plane felt heavy and sluggish, burdened by years of service and the weight of secrets it had carried in its belly. Its once-proud nose was now patched with scavenged aluminum plates, a testament to their many harrowing flights. 

"Thirty minutes until daylight, Captain," Whisp's voice crackled over the intercom, her calm tone jarring against the storm outside. "Radio silence for now. ETA: New Orleans in five hours."
