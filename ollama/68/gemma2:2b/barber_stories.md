The midday sun slanted through the stained-glass windowpanes, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the bustling streets of New Orleans. Dust motes danced in the beams like trapped starships, their silent journey interrupted only by the rhythmic whir of old man Emile's clippers.  Emile "Three-Fingers" LaFleur, a man whose hands had earned an iconic moniker as much for their swiftness as they were for their calloused roughness, surveyed his reflection in the mirror behind him. The years, like fine sand trickling through his fingers, had etched lines on his face, but his eyes, deep-set and blue with the wisdom of a thousand conversations over hot coffee and razor blades, still held that familiar spark.

The door creaked open, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Delacroix's youngest daughter, Marie. Her braids bounced like playful springs as she hurried in, a vibrant splash of colour against the faded red walls of Emile's humble barbershop. The scent of lavender soap and chamomile lingered in the air, a comforting aroma that masked the city's grit.

"Emile," Marie said, her voice barely audible above the hum of conversation from the street outside. "Papa... he won't leave."
