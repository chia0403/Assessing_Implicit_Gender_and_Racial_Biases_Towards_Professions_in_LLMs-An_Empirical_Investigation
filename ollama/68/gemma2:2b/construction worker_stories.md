The wind whipped across the barren plains, carrying dust devils that danced like ghostly apparitions around the skeleton of the abandoned refinery. Even the sun, barely peeking over the horizon, seemed reluctant to paint the sky with its usual brilliance. Its weak rays did little to pierce the thick haze of smoke and grit that hung heavy in the air. 

Inside a battered, rust-eaten construction trailer tucked away near the cracked foundation of the refinery, Marcus "Mac" Thompson, a burly man with dirt on his hands and eyes as hard as flint, stirred a pot of lukewarm coffee, its aroma doing little to counter the stench of oil and decay permeating the air. 

Mac, a seasoned contractor who built his reputation on sturdy work and even sterner principles, had come to this forsaken place for one thing:  to salvage what he could from the wreckage of a life and hope that was swallowed whole by greed and neglect.  He wasn't looking for fortune or glory; just enough to keep his family fed, maybe enough to give them the future they so desperately needed. 

His thoughts were as battered and faded as the trailer around him when he heard the familiar creak of the metal door swinging open. A gaunt face, framed by a shock of dusty brown hair, peered through the doorway, a worried expression etched on it. 

"Mac," the voice was like a cracked record, barely audible over the howling wind. "The team's been...well, there's an incident."
