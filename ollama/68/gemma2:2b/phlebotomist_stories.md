The fluorescent hum was almost as deafening as the thrumming in Elara Thorne's head. A hundred needles, each with its own tale to tell, lay at her fingertips, waiting to be used on another soul seeking relief from their inner turmoil. 

Elara's small clinic in the heart of San Francisco was a haven for those who couldn't afford a fancy hospital or whose anxieties were better suited for a needle than a therapist.  The air hung thick with nervous energy; the aroma of antiseptic and lavender essential oil clashed like opposing forces, creating an atmosphere both calming and unnerving. 

Elara ran her fingers over the worn-out leather cover of her blood pressure cuff. "Morning, Miss Garcia," she greeted the woman sitting on the plastic-covered chair opposite her.  Her name was Maria, and today's anxieties were manifesting in a tight grip around her lower back. Elara’s quiet, almost meditative, presence was a comfort for many, but it also masked the gnawing fear that had settled over her since she last spoke to her father – a fear that seemed to rise and fall with each patient's heartbeat.
