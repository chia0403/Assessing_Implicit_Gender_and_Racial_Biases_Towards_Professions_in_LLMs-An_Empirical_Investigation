Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy West Hospital, mirroring the tumult in Amelia Pierce's stomach. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear as she navigated the chaos of the emergency room.  Her stethoscope felt clammy in her grip, its weight echoing the heaviness in her chest.  It was another night like this; a sea of worried faces and urgent pleas for relief, all swirling around her like a hurricane in human form.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A quiet desperation hung over the room. Amelia's patient, Mr. Carter - a weathered old man known for his gruff demeanor but hidden kindness - was now a silent tableau on the gurney, his breathing shallow and erratic. His eyes, normally sparkling with mirth, were clouded with a deep-seated fear that chilled Amelia to the bone.  Her hands trembled as she checked his vitals; her mind racing, trying to make sense of the inexplicable surge in Mr. Carter's heart rate, followed by an alarming drop in blood pressure. It felt like someone had flipped the switch on their life, leaving it in a dark, unsettling void. 

Amelia's heart hammered against her ribs. She was Amelia Pierce, RN, a nurse who saw the best and worst of humanity every day, but tonight, even she was losing ground to the encroaching night terrors plaguing her patient.
