The humid July air hung heavy over Sunset Boulevard, pressing against Amelia “Amy” Dubois like a wet blanket as she weaved through the tables at "The Sunset Grill."  She had been serving there for three years now, her smile becoming more familiar than any of the faces lined up around the grill. Amy was used to the way the heat hung on a summer night in Los Angeles, but tonight felt different. The usual buzz of lunchtime chatter and phone calls from regulars seemed muted by an underlying tension. 

The sky above the patio, usually ablaze with hues of orange and pink as the sun dipped below the hills, looked washed out - a pale, sickly yellow that matched the unease settling over everyone at Sunset Grill.  It was one of those nights where even the seasoned waiters felt like they were walking on water.
