The humid air clung to Dr. Elara Thorne like a second skin as she sat on the worn wooden steps outside the clinic. The afternoon sun was a molten eye in the sky, its rays reflecting off the chipped paint of the building's facade and turning the surrounding neighborhood into an endless parade of muted colors. It wasn't exactly Miami Beach by any stretch, but it was home to her. 

Elara adjusted the worn leather strap of her bag, the familiar weight a comfort in this sea of uncertainty. Today was her first day back in the city after months spent at a remote research institute, researching PTSD and its effects on families during natural disasters. It had been a necessary retreat for her own personal demons - a long-held grief that threatened to engulf her every waking moment.  But now, as she watched a group of children laughing on the sidewalk below, she felt adrift. 

Was this really it? This small office with its frayed rug and faded floral wallpaper, where years of unresolved childhood trauma lay buried under piles of pamphlets and forgotten journals? It was a far cry from the high-rise clinic in Washington DC, but somehow, that's all Elara had ever known.  She was a clinical psychologist, a healer, a survivor. And yet, here she stood, on the brink of facing her own demons head-on, with only a worn leather chair and a flickering fluorescent bulb for company.
