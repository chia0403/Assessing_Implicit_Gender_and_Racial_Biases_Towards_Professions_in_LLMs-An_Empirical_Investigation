The humid Texas air clung to Elias Caldwell like a second skin, heavy and thick as molasses. He wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving streaks of sweat on his already worn-out shirt. The midday sun beat down mercilessly on his crew, turning the asphalt ribbon they were patching into a shimmering sea of heat that distorted the horizon.  They'd been working for hours, a rhythmic symphony of grinding metal and the rasping whine of air compressors, punctuated by the occasional curse from Jeb, their foreman. 

Their small team of highway workers, part of the Texas Department of Transportation, were stationed on mile marker 274. Just another dot in the sprawling network of highways that crisscrossed the state. The vastness of the landscape stretched before them:  nothing but endless fields of golden wheat, a scattering of scrub oak, and the occasional distant glimpse of blue sky peppered by puffy clouds.

Elias felt his muscles tighten, fatigue settling into his bones. He glanced across at Jeb, who was meticulously applying tar to the newly patched lane with an unwavering focus that Elias found oddly mesmerizing.  A silent understanding passed between them, a shared rhythm born from their years of toil under the Texas sun.
