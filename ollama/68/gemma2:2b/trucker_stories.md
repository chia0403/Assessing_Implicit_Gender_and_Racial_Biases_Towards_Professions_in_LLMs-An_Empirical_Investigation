The desert wind whipped through the cab of Jake "Ironhand" McArthur's rig, rattling the metal skeleton like a caged rattlesnake. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt miles away, mimicking the chaotic storm brewing within him. His eyes were narrowed against the harsh glare of the midday sun as he navigated the desolate stretch of I-40, his mind a maelstrom of thoughts that mirrored the sand dunes stretching endlessly in every direction.  His rig, "The Iron Maiden," was as worn and scarred as its namesake; the paint chipped like rusted enamel, the dented grille a testament to countless miles driven under unforgiving skies. 

He was heading for Albuquerque, his heart heavy with the weight of a secret that felt heavier than the fuel tanks in the truck's belly. The usual hum of his engine was drowned out by an internal tremor - one fueled by guilt and apprehension. He knew what he had to do, but the thought sent shivers down his spine. This was not just a delivery; it was a reckoning.
