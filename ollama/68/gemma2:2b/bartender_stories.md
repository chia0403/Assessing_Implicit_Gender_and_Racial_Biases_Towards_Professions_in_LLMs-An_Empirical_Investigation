The amber glow of the Rusty Lantern illuminated the chipped porcelain counter, each beading droplet casting an erratic dance of light across Esmeralda's worn leather apron. She was used to shadows, to the hushed murmurings of regulars and the creak of the wooden floorboards under weary feet. Tonight, though, the silence felt heavier, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of rain against the cobblestones outside. 

Esmeralda "Esme" Bellweather, a woman whose age was as easily forgotten as her smile, surveyed the bar.  Her fingers traced the worn wood, tracing the delicate whorls and grooves that whispered stories of countless nights and even more untold dreams. Tonight's clientele was sparse, only the occasional figure stumbling in from the relentless storm. A solitary man with a fedora pulled low sat in the corner booth, his face obscured by the shadows. He wasn’t exactly new to this alley – years ago, he'd come here after leaving her father's bar; their families had been at odds for years, and he hadn’t dared return until now. 
 
A bitter taste lingered in Esme's mouth as she poured him a glass of amber liquor, its warmth momentarily eclipsing the chill that gripped her bones and the melancholy that seeped through every corner of the bar. He looked up, his gaze meeting hers for a fleeting moment before he turned back to the window, his eyes reflecting the tumultuous sky in an unsettling, haunting way. Tonight, the storm wasn’t just about the weather; it was brewing within the walls of the Rusty Lantern itself.
