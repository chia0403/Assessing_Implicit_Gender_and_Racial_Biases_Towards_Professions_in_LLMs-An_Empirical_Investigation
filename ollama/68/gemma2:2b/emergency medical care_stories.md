## Opening

Rain lashed against the windshield like angry needles, blurring the already fading light of dusk into an impressionistic watercolour wash of greys and purples. Inside the ambulance, Dr. Amelia Hayes fought to keep her focus on the vitals in front of her – a young woman, barely 20, with her face painted a canvas of pain and fear. Her labored breaths echoed against the sterile walls as the storm raged outside, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia's gut. It was the third call this night, another tragic accident in the city's underbelly, and the weight of it all threatened to pull her under.  

Amelia had dreamed of this job – a beacon of hope amidst chaos, a lifeline for those caught in life's rapids. But tonight, she found herself battling a different kind of storm: one that stirred within her, fuelled by exhaustion, grief, and an undeniable sense of helplessness. Every night, the sirens grew louder, mirroring the encroaching darkness of this city, and the endless cycle of loss, pain, and despair felt like a slow-burning ember threatening to consume them all.  

**Setting:** A bustling, yet gritty metropolis nestled on the edge of a sprawling coastline. 


**Character:** Dr. Amelia Hayes, a young Emergency Medical Care specialist.
