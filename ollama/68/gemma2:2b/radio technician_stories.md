Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the old shack, each drop sounding like a tiny drumbeat against the silence inside.  The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and ozone from the humming power supplies that fueled Elara's makeshift workshop.  She crouched over a battered circuit board, grease staining her fingertips as she worked, her brow furrowed in concentration. Around her, stacks of salvaged radio equipment towered like rusted sentinels, each piece an echo of forgotten voices and silent transmissions. 

Elara, whose last name held the weight of generations of tinkering with broken things, was known throughout the town as "Echo." Her workshop wasn't a place for those seeking solace or community – it was a sanctuary for her own solitary brilliance.  But tonight, there was something different in the air, an urgent energy that crackled beneath the storm's fury. The line to her makeshift antenna had gone dead after hours of silent transmission. It was then, amidst the rain and static, that she heard a signal – faint but undeniable – a whisper of life on another frequency. 

The question wasn't if there was a new message hidden within the static, but who dared to send it?  Elara knew that somewhere in this world, someone needed her help.
