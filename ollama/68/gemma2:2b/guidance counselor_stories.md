Rain lashed against the windows of Northwood High School, each drop exploding into miniature fireworks in the flickering fluorescent light above.  Inside, Ms. Eleanor Thorne, her graying hair tucked neatly under a tweed cap, sat hunched over a mountain of paper files, her brow creased with worry. The air was thick with teenage angst and the aroma of stale coffee, both familiar scents to Eleanor after thirty years at Northwood. 

"What's that?" A voice whispered from behind her.  

Eleanor jumped, nearly spilling her lukewarm tea. "Oh, just Jake," she answered, turning to see a lanky boy no older than sixteen, his wide eyes filled with mischief and an almost unsettling amount of curiosity. He always seemed to find her in the darkest corners of Northwood - or perhaps he was just particularly observant. 

"Just checking if you needed help, Ms. Thorne," Jake said with a shy grin. "The guidance department's getting bombarded by letters."

Eleanor sighed. It wasn't just the usual storm of applications and student anxieties that had her head throbbing â€“ it was the new student transfer program, designed to foster a more inclusive Northwood experience. But instead of bringing students together, the chaos seemed to be driving them apart.
