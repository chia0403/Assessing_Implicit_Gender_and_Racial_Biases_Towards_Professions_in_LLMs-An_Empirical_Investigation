The rain hammered against the ornate windows of Judge Amelia Thorne's chambers, each drop sounding like a tiny fist striking the glass. Amelia ran a tired hand over her face, feeling the rough texture of the silk handkerchief that always accompanied her daily routine – not a trace of humor remained in this grim morning. The heavy scent of incense, normally a comforting balm, was today suffocatingly thick and cloying, adding to the oppressive atmosphere of the once-vibrant court. 

Outside, the storm raged. But inside, the silence was just as unnerving.  Her gaze fell on the sealed file on her desk – a case so personal it had been handed to her directly by the Chief Justice. It felt heavier than the weight of any verdict she'd ever delivered. For Amelia Thorne, who had dedicated her life to upholding justice, this case held a chilling truth she wasn't sure how to reconcile.
