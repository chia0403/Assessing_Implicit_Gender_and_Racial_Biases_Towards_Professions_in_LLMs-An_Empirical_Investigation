## The Whispering Classroom

**Setting:** A worn but beloved English classroom in the bustling confines of Willow Creek High School.  Sunlight struggles to pierce through the decades-old stained glass window depicting a romantic scene from Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet', casting a kaleidoscope of light and shadow across the room. Bookshelves, overflowing with leather-bound classics and dusty poetry tomes, line the walls like sentinels of time. 

**Character:**  **Ms. Eleanor Thorne**, 45 years old, her silver streaks woven into the tapestry of her deep auburn hair, stands at the head of the classroom, a testament to countless late nights grading papers and early mornings spent prepping lessons. The bell rings, signaling another day's start, but Ms. Thorne finds herself staring not at the eager faces of her students, but at a faint, haunting whisper emanating from the ancient oak desk in the corner.


**Story Opening:** 

"Good morning, class," Ms. Thorne greets them with a smile, the words echoing through the silent room like a hesitant breath before the storm. "Let's begin today's lesson with our literary heroes." She pauses, her eyes flitting across the faces of her students - the usual blend of teenage rebellion and innocent curiosity - but then they seem to fade from view as if she were staring into an unfathomable chasm. "Did anyone ever hear anything so... eerie? Or maybe just strange?" 

A nervous silence falls over the room, a palpable tension hanging in the air like smoke curling off a dying fire. Ms. Thorne takes a deep breath, trying to regain control of her own burgeoning unease, before continuing.  "We'll be discussing the haunting prose of Edgar Allan Poe today," she says with a slight tremor in her voice, "and I assure you, there will be no 'Tell-Tale Heart' lurking within these walls."

The class remains silent.  Even Ms. Thorne's usual quick wit seems dimmed by an unseen force. Her gaze lingers on the oak desk in the corner, where the whispering had begun - a faint, almost inaudible murmur that seemed to hold within it a secret as old as the building itself.
