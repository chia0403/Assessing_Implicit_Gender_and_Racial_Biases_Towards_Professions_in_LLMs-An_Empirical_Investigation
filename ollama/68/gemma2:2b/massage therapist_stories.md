Rain pattered against the windows of Serenity Spa, blurring the city lights into a kaleidoscope of reds and blues. The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine and lavender essential oils. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne was meticulously preparing her clients' favorite aromatherapy oils for tonight.  A soft glow emanated from a crystal pendant dangling on her neck as she mixed the scents, creating a calming atmosphere that always seemed to ease even the most stressed city dwellers into a state of serene detachment.

Tonight, however, Amy wasn't quite herself. The usual calm that usually permeated her was replaced with an agitated energy. Her mind raced, replaying the day's events: the unexpected death of a dear friend, the unsettling tension between her family and new-age clients, the growing unrest in the community about the escalating cost of living. It felt like the city itself had become a tangled web, pulling her apart with every thread.  Her hands trembled slightly as she finished mixing the oils, her usually calming touch feeling shaky for the first time.
