Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Studio, blurring the neon sign that read "Sweat & Soul" into an abstract swirl of colors. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of citrus and sweat as 53-year-old Amelia Sinclair led her morning yoga class through a series of deep stretches. Her voice, usually warm and reassuring, was tinged with melancholy.  This wasn't the usual Monday morning routine – this week, the studio felt different, heavy with an undercurrent of unease. A wave of tension had settled over town after the mayor announced the closure of their community pool due to "safety concerns." 

Amelia, a yoga instructor for over two decades, was deeply invested in the town's wellbeing. She’d seen countless lives transformed through her classes, each body finding strength and resilience on the mat. Now, she had a feeling - a gut instinct that whispered of something far deeper than just a local tragedy. 

The rhythmic chanting of "Om" echoed against the worn wooden floorboards as Amelia's eyes focused on the worried faces in front of her. One face, however, was particularly jarring: young Sarah Miller, barely out of her teens, sat stiffly on the floor, her gaze fixed on the swirling rain outside.  Sarah, a new student and always bubbly, seemed lost in the deluge.
