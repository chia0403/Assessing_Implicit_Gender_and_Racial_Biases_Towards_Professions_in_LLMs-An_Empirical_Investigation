The moon hung like a bruised plum in the sky, casting the cobbled streets of New Albion in an eerie silver glow. Rain splattered down on Elara's worn leather armor as she patrolled the outer edge of the city gates. A seasoned guard for the past five years, Elara’s weary eyes were fixed on the swirling shadows that played like phantoms across the wet stone.  Her heart, though hardened against it, still felt a pang of apprehension at the thought of what lurked within the labyrinthine city walls. 

New Albion was notorious for its hidden depths – an intricate network of tunnels and chambers where whispered rumors spoke of forgotten gods and ancient secrets. These whispers were often accompanied by unsettling visions, ones that Elara believed belonged to her own troubled past.  Tonight, a particularly chilling vision haunted her:  a shadowy figure in the flickering light of a nearby lantern, its face obscured but beckoning her closer, its voice a whisper that echoed with an unspoken promise.
