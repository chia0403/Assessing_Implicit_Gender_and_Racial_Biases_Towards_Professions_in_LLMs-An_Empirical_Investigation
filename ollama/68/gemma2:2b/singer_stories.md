The humid air clung to Serena Blackwood like an unwelcome guest. It was the kind of August night in New Orleans that felt heavier than its usual weight – the scent of jasmine mingling with the smoky tang of beignets from the street vendor’s cart. The flickering neon lights of the Bourbon Street bars cast a kaleidoscope of color onto the wet pavement, but Serena barely noticed.  Tonight, her world was the cramped dressing room of a dive bar called “The Crooked Cat”, its walls covered in faded posters of forgotten musicians.

Serena, her blonde hair pulled back into a tight bun, stared at her reflection in the dusty mirror, the harsh light making the blue of her eyes seem to bleed. The familiar ache pulsed behind her left eye, a constant reminder of last week’s performance – a sold-out show where she had faltered, the spotlight burning too brightly for her stage fright. Tonight, though, was different.  Tonight, she was ready to face the city's ghosts and let her soul sing. 


**Setting:** A rundown dive bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. The atmosphere is smoky, with jazz music playing softly.

**Character:** Serena Blackwood, a young singer struggling to make it big in the world of music.
