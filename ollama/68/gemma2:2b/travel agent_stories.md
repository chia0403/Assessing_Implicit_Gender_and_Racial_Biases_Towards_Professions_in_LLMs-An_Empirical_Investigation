The salty air whipped Amelia's hair across her face as she stood at the helm of her small yacht, "Starlight Serenade."

Her little office, tucked away in a quaint corner of the harbour town of Positano, felt miles away. 

Amelia was known for her uncanny ability to weave together the most intricate travel plans, transporting clients to distant shores and back again. Her heart, however, yearned for something more than just another perfectly planned itinerary. She'd spent years crafting these journeys, each a piece of art in itself, yet a longing for an adventure that was hers alone gnawed at her soul.  As the gentle rocking of the boat lulled her into quiet contemplation, she realized there was more to life than just meticulously charting other peopleâ€™s itineraries. After all, what about a journey truly her own?

Tonight, she was adrift not only on the sea but also in the vast ocean of possibility that lay before her, hoping to find the right path through it all.
