Rain hammered against the skylight above Alaric Blackwood's drafting table, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist watercolor.  His fingers, slick with ink from his latest architectural vision, traced the intricate curves of a futuristic skyscraper that would redefine urban living.

He felt this project would be his magnum opus, a testament to the boundless possibilities of human innovation. However, the endless nights were starting to take their toll.

Project Zenith had become more than just an architectural challenge; it held a deeper meaning, blurring the line between reality and ambition.  A strange unease crept into Alaric's mind as he looked at the intricate model of his design. Was this what true purpose felt like? Or was it a trap leading him down a lonely path?
