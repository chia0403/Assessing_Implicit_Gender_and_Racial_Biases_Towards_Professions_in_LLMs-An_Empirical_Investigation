The air in Eleanor Beaumont's office felt heavy enough to weigh down on her chest.  She sat at her mahogany desk, the worn leather of the chair creaking beneath her. Outside, rain pattered against the high-volume windows, blurring the already gloomy sky into a watercolor canvas of gray and purple. The storm had been brewing for hours, mirroring the unease churning in Eleanor's stomach. It wouldn't be the first time she'd been caught in a bureaucratic downpour, but this one felt different. 

Eleanor was used to the staid routines of Mrs. Sinclairâ€™s world: meticulously ordered invoices, cryptic legal documents, and an ever-present aura of repressed power that seemed to cling to Mrs. Sinclair like a phantom limb.  But today, the usual calm had been shattered. The storm wasn't just outside; it was inside, a cacophony of hushed whispers and hurried footsteps echoing down the hallway. For the first time in her three years with Mrs. Sinclair, Eleanor felt truly out of her depth.
