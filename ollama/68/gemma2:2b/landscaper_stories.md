The morning mist clung to Silas Finch's worn leather boots as he surveyed his work site. A sprawling Victorian estate on the edge of town, with ivy-choked walls and topiary hedges that seemed to whisper secrets in the wind, lay before him.  Silas hummed a little tune, a melody from his childhood, as he pushed his wheelbarrow loaded with fresh gravel towards the flower beds. The air was heavy with dew drops on blades of grass, the only sound besides the gentle rustle of leaves the distant chirp of birds and the rhythmic thump of Silas's own feet against the concrete path. He took a deep breath, inhaling the earthy smell of freshly turned soil, a scent as comforting as a warm hearth on a cold night, and smiled.
