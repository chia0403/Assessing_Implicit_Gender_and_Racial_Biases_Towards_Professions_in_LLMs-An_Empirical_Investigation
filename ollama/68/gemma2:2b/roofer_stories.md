The wind whipped at **Reginald "Reg" Featherstone's** worn baseball cap as he scaled the steep incline of Mrs. Hemlock's chimney.  Dust motes danced in the fading light filtering through the stained-glass windows that adorned her Victorian home, the colors vibrant against the backdrop of a storm-ridden sky.  Down on Maple Street, the wind howled like an angry banshee, tearing at the wooden shingles on houses whose roofs had seen better days.

Reg was used to the elements; his world consisted of scaffolding and tarps, a symphony of hammering and creaking as he worked. But something about this job felt different. Mrs. Hemlock, an old woman who'd lived alone in that grand but decaying house since the 1920s, had been plagued by strange occurrences recently.  Her missing cat, Mr. Whiskers; the whispering sounds emanating from the cellar; and then, last night – the window shattered into a million pieces, leaving behind only a ghostly chill.

Reg's gaze shifted to the chipped paint on the chimney’s brick face, then back up towards the storm-tossed sky.  He tightened his grip on his ladder and took a deep breath. Something wasn’t right, not just in the air, but in the house itself. He had years of experience repairing roofs, but this felt like stepping onto an unknown terrain, where every creak of the wind might be another whispered secret from the past.
