The air in the cramped office felt thick with tension, even thicker than the stale coffee brewing in the corner machine.  Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, barely five foot four with sharp eyes hidden behind round spectacles, ran a hand through her unruly brown curls as she reviewed the file for the last time. The 5 pm deadline loomed like a storm cloud over the courthouse window – another week, another mountain of paperwork threatening to collapse under its own weight.

The year was 2047. Los Angeles' skyline had transformed from smog-filled concrete canyons into shimmering bioluminescent towers, but even in this futuristic city, some things remained stubbornly stuck in the analog: lawyers, contracts, and deadlines.  Amy’s world revolved around these archaic elements - and yet, she yearned for something more. 

Tonight, though, her dreams were as far away as those towering structures – a symphony orchestra, conducted by a woman whose name was whispered with reverence across the city. She hadn't had the courage to even book an audition, let alone face the pressure of live performance. But tonight, she swore, the walls would fall away and Amy Hawthorne would finally take her first bow.
