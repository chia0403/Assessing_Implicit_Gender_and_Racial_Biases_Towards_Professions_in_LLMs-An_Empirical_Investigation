The salt spray kissed Dr. Amelia "Amy" Finch's face as she steered her beat-up pickup truck through the labyrinthine streets of  Port Haven, Maine. It was early morning, the sky still a bruised purple from the storm that had passed through the night. The air hung thick with the scent of seaweed and fish guts – not exactly an aroma most would enjoy, but for Amy, it was familiar, almost comforting. She'd grown up here on the rocky shores, her childhood filled with trips to the shore in her father’s old lobster boat. 

Amy sighed, running a hand through her auburn hair. It wasn't exactly the tranquil life she'd dreamed of when she'd first decided to become a vet - especially not after receiving that "unexpected inheritance" from her Aunt Beatrice two years ago. Her aunt had left her an old, rambling house on a bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic, and with it came a hefty responsibility: running the Port Haven Animal Clinic. 

The clinic was more of a ramshackle shack than a proper medical facility - one where stray cats sometimes slept in the corner of the examination room and the water heater frequently threatened to explode.  But Amy had a vision for it, one that she hoped to build brick by rusty bone. The storm brought with it a new case: a young seal pup with an infected leg found washed up on the beach, its once playful flippers dragging sadly in the surf.
