## The Setting:

The bustling heart of New Orleans was radiating an almost tangible summer heat. Cicada's song filled the air, thick with humidity and the sweet scent of magnolia blossoms. A humid breeze ruffled the fronds of the live oaks lining Jackson Square, their leaves whispering secrets on the wind. Above it all, the vibrant green roof of the building housing "Nourish & Flourish" was shaded by the imposing St. Louis Cathedral, its bell tower a stark beacon against the afternoon sky.

## The Character:

**Evelyn Dubois**, M.S., RDN, LDN.  Her neatly braided auburn hair was always pulled back from her face, framing her intense blue eyes as she navigated the chaos of the clinic with an unwavering calm. She wasn't afraid of a little grease on her hands or the occasional spill of kale smoothie; that was the life of a dietician in New Orleans - it was about more than just formulas and charts; it was about creating a symphony of flavors for the soul, one meal at a time.

## Story Opening:

Evelyn ran a hand through her hair, sighing as she watched the endless stream of people flow past her clinic's open door. Some were jovial, others grim-faced, all with their own weight of concerns swirling around them like the humid air itself.  Today felt especially heavy, the kind that hung thick and oppressive in the sweltering July air.  It was a Friday - meaning it was also market day.  The aroma of jambalaya and beignets wafted from the nearby street vendors, teasing Evelyn's sense of smell like a phantom lover whispering promises she could barely comprehend. 

As Evelyn started her day, an unexpected client walked in: a young woman with eyes filled with more fear than hope.  "I need help," she whispered, clutching a worn purse to her chest. "My husband... he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes.  And I'm losing him." The weight of the room seemed to crush Evelyn even as she extended a warm smile.
