The salty tang of the ocean clung to Dr. Amelia Nightingale's throat as she surveyed the makeshift clinic on the wind-swept crag.  A storm had ripped through the small coastal village of Port Haven earlier that day, leaving behind a trail of debris and despair. The once cheerful waterfront was now littered with mangled boats and washed up fishing nets. Amelia, known for her calm demeanor and sharp intellect even under pressure, felt the weight of it all settling on her shoulders like a dense fog. 

She adjusted the worn straw hat perched atop her auburn hair, its brim shielding her eyes from the relentless wind that whipped across the rugged coastline.  Her gaze swept over the huddled figures in the makeshift medical bay – locals with bruised ribs and faces etched with fear. Some carried their young children, their small arms clinging to theirs as they walked. Amelia’s eyes settled on a young boy, no more than five years old, his face streaked with tears and his tiny hand clutched tightly to his mother's arm. He looked at her with an intensity that mirrored the storm's fury - a silent plea for help in the midst of chaos.
