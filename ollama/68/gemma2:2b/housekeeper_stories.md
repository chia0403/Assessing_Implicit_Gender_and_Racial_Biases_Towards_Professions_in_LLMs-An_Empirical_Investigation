The scent of lavender oil hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia like a second skin. She smoothed her apron, its fabric rough against her palms, as she navigated the sprawling oak-paneled rooms of Blackwood Manor.  Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the dusty carpets and faded velvet drapes. The manor was old, every creak and groan whispering tales of generations past, and Amelia, for all her years, still felt a strange sense of belonging in this sprawling monument to history. 

Her name was Amelia Gracemore, but everyone just called her "Amy."  The title came with unspoken weight – an inherited responsibility borne on the shoulders of women who tended to these forgotten places. Her grandmother had been the first housekeeper for Blackwood Manor and Amy’s own mother before her had carried the mantle into the present. 

But this place felt different today, heavy like a shroud draped over the walls.  A storm was brewing outside, its fury growing with each gust of wind that rattled the grand windows. And in the heart of the manor's dusty silence, Amy couldn’t help but feel an unsettling undercurrent of something…wrong.
