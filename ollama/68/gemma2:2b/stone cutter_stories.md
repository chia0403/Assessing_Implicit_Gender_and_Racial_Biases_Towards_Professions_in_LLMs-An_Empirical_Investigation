## The Chiseling Moon

**Opening:**  The air hung thick with the scent of granite and dust, clinging to Elias's worn beard as he gazed out at the moon-drenched workshop. It was an old shop, its walls slicked with grime from years of toil, but within its confines, a symphony of sound - the rasp of chisels against stone, the rhythmic clangs of hammer on steel, and the low murmur of Elias's own breathing – created a comforting rhythm to his work. Tonight, however, a different kind of silence permeated the air. The usual symphony had been replaced by an unnerving stillness, broken only by the wind whistling past the open windows, its icy touch sending shivers down Elias’s spine. 

**Setting:** 
Elias lived in a small village nestled at the foot of a colossal granite mountain range, known as the Spine of Aethel. The mountain itself was a force of nature, weathered into peaks that scraped the heavens and valleys that swallowed whole villages.  The town of Alora, where Elias resided, existed within the shadow of these mountains, its inhabitants dependent on the mountain's bounty for survival.

**Main Character:** Elias Thorne - A man weathered by years spent in the unforgiving embrace of the stone. His hands were scarred with calluses, his face lined with the harsh demands of his trade. He was a master stone cutter, known throughout the region for his meticulous craftsmanship and quiet demeanor.
