The fluorescent lights hummed a constant, white-noise lullaby over Amelia Croft's head as she scrubbed away at Mrs. Peterson's molar with her tiny, metal instrument. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale toothpaste, usually a comforting blend to Amelia, but today it felt suffocating. It wasnâ€™t just the usual humdrum of her Wednesday morning routine. This case, Mrs. Peterson's history of anxiety brought forth a palpable sense of unease that lingered in the sterile atmosphere like forgotten blood on a dentist's glove. 

**Setting:** A small, cramped clinic nestled between a used bookstore and a flower shop in an unassuming neighborhood. The walls were lined with framed dental posters depicting overly-smiling teeth, their faces forever frozen in a state of perfect hygiene.

**Main Character:** Amelia Croft
