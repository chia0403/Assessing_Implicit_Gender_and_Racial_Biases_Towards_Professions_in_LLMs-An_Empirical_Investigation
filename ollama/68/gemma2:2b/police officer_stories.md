Rain lashed against the window of Officer Liam O'Connell's patrol car, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic watercolor on his windshield. The air was thick with both the humidity of summer evening and the tension that clung to the alleyway behind him like cobwebs. He pulled out a cigarette lighter from his pocket, the metal cool against his palm as he flicked it open.  The smoke curled up towards the sky like a phantom reaching for a forgotten promise. Liam exhaled, a plume of gray swirling with the rain. Tonight, the city felt more alive than usual, pulsating with both its beauty and its ugliness – a symphony of sirens, laughter from street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present hum of unseen troubles.  This was just another night on the beat for Liam O'Connell, but tonight, something felt different. Something was brewing under the surface of the city's rhythm, and he could feel it tighten in his gut.  He adjusted his collar, a familiar weight settling on his shoulders as he pulled out his notepad.
