Rain lashed against the gothic windows of the Victorian house, each drop hammering out a mournful rhythm on the glass. Inside, Amelia Blackwood, her face illuminated by the harsh glare of her laptop screen, hunched over a pile of rewrites.  She was no stranger to late nights and caffeine-fueled bursts of creativity; editing at night was just another Tuesday for the woman with a penchant for the dark and mysterious. Tonight, however, she found herself struggling with an especially thorny story: "The Shadow of Veridian," the final chapter in a series that had been her passion project for years. The protagonist, Edward Thorne – a brooding, unrepentant thief – was supposed to deliver justice but seemed more like a lost puppy than a raging force.

Amelia rubbed her temples, frustration etching lines on her face even as she meticulously polished words into shape. "Veridian," the city's notorious underworld queenpin, had been shrouded in secrecy for decades, and Amelia longed to peel back her identity and uncover the truth behind Thorne's actions, but he was a puzzle she just couldn't solve.

The rain continued its relentless assault on the windows, blurring the already dim streetlight beyond. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten stories – a perfect reflection of Amelia’s own creative storm brewing within her. She yearned to make Veridian real, to give Thorne the punch he needed, but she couldn't find the right angle.  And as the silence stretched on, a single thought echoed in her mind: **"Where was the fire?"**
