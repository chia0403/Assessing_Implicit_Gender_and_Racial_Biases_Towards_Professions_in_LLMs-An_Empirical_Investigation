Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel about a theatrical director:

The lights had long since dimmed in the grand, art deco theater, leaving only a faint glow emanating from the flickering emergency exit signs. The air was thick with the scent of old carpet and stale popcorn, a familiar aroma that Emma Taylor, Artistic Director of the prestigious Bellwether Theater Company, knew all too well. She stood at the edge of the empty stage, her eyes scanning the space as if searching for something - or someone.

It had been ten years since Emma took the reins of the theater company, which had once been a struggling regional repertory house. Under her direction, Bellwether had transformed into a thriving cultural institution, known for its bold productions and innovative collaborations. But tonight was different. Tonight, the theater was quiet, the usual hum of activity replaced by an unsettling stillness.

As Emma's gaze swept across the stage, it settled on the vacant seat in the front row, reserved for her mentor and dear friend, Lucien Montague. It had been three months since Lucien's sudden passing, leaving Emma reeling with grief and a sense of purposeless abandonment. The silence seemed to vibrate through every molecule of air, as if waiting for something - or someone - to break the stillness.

The lights outside began to fade, plunging the theater into an even deeper darkness, and Emma felt the familiar pang of unease that had been growing in her chest all day. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of being watched, but it only seemed to intensify as she turned back to face the empty stage.

And then, just as she was about to call out for someone - anyone - to come and fill the silence with sound, Emma heard it: a faint whisper in her ear, a soft voice that sent shivers down her spine. "Emma... is that you?"

The words hung in the air like a challenge, leaving Emma's heart racing with anticipation and fear. Who was speaking? And what did they want from her?
