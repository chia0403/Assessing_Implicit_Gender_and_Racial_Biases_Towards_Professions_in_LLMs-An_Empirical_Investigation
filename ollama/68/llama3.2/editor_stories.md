Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the streets of New York City like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy pallor over the towering skyscrapers and bustling sidewalks. It was a typical autumn evening in Manhattan, with the sounds of honking horns, chattering pedestrians, and wailing sirens creating a cacophony of noise that seemed to reverberate deep within the chest.

As the senior editor at a small publishing house, Lexi had spent countless hours pouring over manuscripts, slashing sentences, and wrestling with wayward commas.

The dim fluorescent lights above her desk cast an unforgiving glare on her pale skin, accentuating the dark circles under her eyes and the fine lines etched into her forehead from years of sleepless nights.

She knew exactly what made a story tick, and she was determined to uncover the hidden truths within the words on her screen.

As she typed the final revisions onto her manuscript, Lexi's thoughts turned to the looming deadline for the latest issue of "The Literary Review", the quarterly publication that had launched her career as an editor. The pressure was mounting, with submissions pouring in from aspiring writers and publishers clamoring for space. But Lexi was undaunted, fueled by a fierce passion for storytelling and a determination to uncover the best voices in literature.

Little did she know, however, that this latest manuscript would hold secrets that would challenge everything she thought she knew about herself, her work, and the very fabric of reality itself...
