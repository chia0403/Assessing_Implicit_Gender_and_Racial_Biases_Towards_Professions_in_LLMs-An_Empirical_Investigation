Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a pale orange glow over the crumbling pavement and rusting machinery that lined the side of Highway 66. Axel Julian "Jules" Morales adjusted his worn denim jacket and surveyed the makeshift campsite he'd set up alongside the highway, a sprawling tangle of tarps, sleeping bags, and fuel cans that served as his home away from home.

As a highway worker for the state of Arizona, Jules had grown accustomed to the rhythms of the open road. For years, he'd traversed the desert landscape in his trusty Ford F-150, fixing potholes, trimming vegetation, and collecting data on road conditions that helped inform decisions about infrastructure upgrades and maintenance schedules. The work was grueling, but it paid well, and Jules had developed a deep affection for the isolated beauty of the American Southwest.

Tonight, however, Jules's routine was disrupted by an unsettling sense of unease. It started with a peculiar dream he'd had just as he drifted off to sleep: a vision of his beloved truck, emblazoned with a "Road Maintenance" logo on the side panel, careening out of control down a steep incline, pursued by a dark shape that seemed to be gaining ground.

As Jules sat up in bed, a sense of trepidation settled over him like a shroud. He rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the lingering vividness of the dream, but it refused to dissipate. What had triggered this strange and unsettling sequence? And what did it portend for his life on the open road?

Little did Jules know that tonight would prove to be just the beginning of a very long and very uncertain journey...
