Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Portland glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Emilia Victoria Winters stepped out of her office building, her stethoscope looped around her neck like a worn leather cord. The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the faces of passersby. It was 8:45 PM on a drizzly autumn evening in late October, and Emilia was already running behind schedule.

She pulled out her phone to check the time and glance at her notes for the evening's appointments. As she scrolled through the list of patients and procedures, her mind began to wander back to the peculiar patient who had been scheduled for 6 PM that day - a young woman with a cryptic smile and an air of secrecy about her. Emilia had been a dentist for over a decade, but there was something about this appointment that felt off, like she was missing a crucial piece of information.

With a sigh, Emilia tucked her phone away and set off towards the waiting room, ready to face whatever the night held.

How's that? Would you like me to continue with the story or make any changes?
