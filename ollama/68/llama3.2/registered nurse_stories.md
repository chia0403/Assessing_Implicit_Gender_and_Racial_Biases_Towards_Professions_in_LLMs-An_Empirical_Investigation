Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Title: "The Night Shift"

Opening Sentence:
As she scrubbed in for her shift at the 3 AM night shift at Mercy Hospital, Registered Nurse Emily Elizabeth Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was going to be different - not just because of the latest flu outbreak sweeping through the city, but also because of the mysterious letter she'd received earlier that morning.

Setting:
Mercy Hospital was a bustling urban medical center located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The hospital's Emergency Department was notorious for its fast-paced and chaotic environment, where nurses like Emily had to think on their feet and make split-second decisions to save lives. The night shift, which Emily worked from 11 PM to 7 AM, was always the most challenging - the patient load was heavier, and the staff was more exhausted.

As Emily made her way to the ER, she navigated through the hospital's labyrinthine corridors, passing by rows of worn linens and discarded medical equipment. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over everything, making it feel like a dystopian dream world. She clocked in with a sigh, exchanging pleasantries with her colleagues as they went about their morning routines.

Little did Emily know, tonight's night shift would be the one that changed everything...
