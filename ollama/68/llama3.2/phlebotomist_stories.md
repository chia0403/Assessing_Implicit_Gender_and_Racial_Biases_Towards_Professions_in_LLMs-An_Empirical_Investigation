Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the hospital's hematology lab, where Phoebe Everley Waters, a skilled and meticulous phlebotomist, scrubbed in for her shift. She had worked at St. Michael's Hospital for five years, earning a reputation as one of the most efficient and patient-friendly phlebotomists on staff. As she tied off the final suture on her arm, Phoebe felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her – another day, another batch of blood draws complete.

As she began to prep for the morning's first patients, the soft hum of the lab equipment and the occasional beep of an alert were interrupted by the rustling of papers in the doorway. Dr. Rachel Kim, the lab's director, stepped into the room, her eyes scanning the rows of machines and the sea of needles and tubes strewn about the countertops.

"Phoebe, I need to speak with you," Dr. Kim said, her voice low and serious. "We've had a strange report come in from one of our patients – a young woman who claims she's been experiencing some... unusual side effects after getting her blood drawn."

Phoebe raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite herself. She loved nothing more than a good medical mystery, and the thought of something unusual coming out of the lab was like catnip to her.

"What kind of side effects?" Phoebe asked, already moving towards the patient's chart on the clipboard holder.

Dr. Kim hesitated for a moment before answering, "The woman claims that after getting her blood drawn, she began experiencing vivid hallucinations and... strange visions."

Phoebe's eyes widened slightly, her mind racing with possibilities. This was going to be an interesting day.
