Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a relentless curtain, shrouding the towering skyscrapers of New Haven in a misty veil. Inside the cramped, dimly lit apartment of Elianore "Eli" Thompson, 25-year-old computer programmer hunched over his desk, fingers flying across the keyboard as he worked to meet an impossible deadline.

The soft hum of his old Dell laptop and the glow of the screen illuminated the small, cluttered space, casting a pale light on rows of dusty textbooks, tangled wires, and scattered notes. Eli's dark hair was mussed, and his bright blue eyes seemed to burn with an intensity that bordered on obsession as he wrestled with the code.

The faint scent of last night's Chinese takeout wafted through the air, mingling with the acrid tang of stale coffee and the hint of fresh rain. Outside, the sounds of the city – car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens – receded into the background as Eli lost himself in the digital world he had created.

It was 2 AM on a Tuesday, and the rest of the world outside his apartment door seemed to be moving at a different pace. But for Eli, time itself was irrelevant. The only clock that mattered was the one ticking away on his laptop screen, counting down to the moment when his latest project would finally be complete.

And then, just as he thought he had conquered the last bug, everything went black.
