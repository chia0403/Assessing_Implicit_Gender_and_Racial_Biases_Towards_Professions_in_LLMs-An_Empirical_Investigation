Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Emilia was a talented cosmetologist with a passion for creating customized looks that brought out the unique sparkle in each person who sat in her chair. With years of experience under her belt, she had earned a loyal following among the town's residents, from young brides-to-be to busy professionals looking for a quick pick-me-up.

She had just finished a particularly satisfying appointment with a client who was celebrating her engagement â€“ now all she could think about was heading home to spend some quality time with her own boyfriend, Jack, and their adorable pup, Luna.
