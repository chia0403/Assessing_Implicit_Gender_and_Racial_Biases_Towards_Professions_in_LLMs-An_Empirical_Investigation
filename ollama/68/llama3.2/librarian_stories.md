As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets of Ashwood, Emilia Rose Blackwood closed the heavy wooden door to the Ashwood Public Library, her eyes scanning the rows of books that stretched out before her like sentinels. The soft creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath her feet echoed through the stillness as she moved towards the circulation desk, her fingers trailing over the familiar spines of the classics on display.

The library's walls seemed to hum with a soft, golden light, a reminder of the countless hours Emilia had spent within these hallowed halls, surrounded by the musty scent of old books and the whispered secrets of the past. As a librarian, Emilia took pride in being the guardian of this treasured repository of knowledge, carefully curating the shelves to ensure that every reader who walked through its doors found something to spark their imagination.

But tonight was different. Tonight, as she locked up the library and stepped out into the cool evening air, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been building in her chest all day, like a faint hum that grew louder with every passing minute. She couldn't quite put her finger on it - perhaps it was the strange phone call she'd received earlier that afternoon, or the peculiar look from one of the regular patrons - but something told her that tonight would be more than just another quiet evening in the library.

As she took a deep breath and began to make her way home, Emilia's eyes scanned the shadows cast by the street lamps, wondering what secrets the night might hold.
