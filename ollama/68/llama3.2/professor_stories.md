Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Sofia Rodriguez gazed out the rain-soaked window of her office, watching as the droplets slid down the pane like tears on a grief-stricken face. The grey sky seemed to mirror her own mood, one that had been perpetually clouded since the departure of her partner, Dr. Julian Styles, who had passed away six months ago in a tragic accident while conducting research abroad.

As a professor of medieval history at the University of California, Berkeley, Emilia's life was a far cry from the romantic escapades she had shared with Julian. Her days were filled with grading papers, teaching courses on the Norman Conquest and the Crusades, and tending to her own research on the intersection of literature and politics in medieval Europe.

The university's Gothic Revival architecture seemed to loom over her, its stone walls bearing witness to centuries of knowledge and learning. But as Emilia stood there, lost in thought, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing – a sense of purpose, perhaps, or a connection to the world beyond her narrow academic bubble.

The phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, shrill and insistent. She picked it up, hoping against hope that it might be Julian's voice on the other end, but all she heard was the recorded message of her department head, reminding her of an upcoming conference on digital humanities and urging her to submit a paper by the deadline.

Emilia sighed, feeling the weight of her responsibilities bearing down upon her. She knew she couldn't let Julian's passing define her – not when there were still so many stories to tell, so many ideas to explore. But as she hung up the phone, she couldn't help but wonder: what would Julian have wanted her to do next?
