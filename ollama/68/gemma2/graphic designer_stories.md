The flickering neon sign outside "Thirsty Thursdays" cast its lurid glow across Amelia Beatrice Hayes' meticulously crafted portfolio, momentarily obscuring the crisp lines of her recent brochure designs.  Amelia sighed, tugging at a loose thread on her vintage denim jacket. She hated networking events. The air buzzed with forced laughter and the cloying scent of cheap perfume, all while everyone desperately tried to make a connection that would lead to "something bigger." 

For Amelia, something bigger meant escaping this cramped, dimly lit bar in Downtown Portland and finding a client who appreciated her unique style - a blend of retro-futurism and minimalist elegance.  It wasn't just about landing the work; it was about showcasing her vision, proving that graphic design could be more than just logos and flyers. It could be art. 

Amelia took a sip of her lukewarm beer, hoping for inspiration amidst the cacophony. Across the room, a businessman in a pristine suit held court, surrounded by admirers. Amelia scoffed. That's not what she wanted. She craved authenticity, connection, and maybe even a little bit of rebellion against the corporate machine that seemed to devour creativity like an insatiable beast.


**Setting:** A crowded, dimly lit bar called "Thirsty Thursdays" in Downtown Portland, Oregon.
