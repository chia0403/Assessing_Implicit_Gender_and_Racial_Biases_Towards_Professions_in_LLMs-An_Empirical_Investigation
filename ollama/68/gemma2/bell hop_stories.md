The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and stale cigarette smoke, a familiar perfume in the Grand Magnolia Hotel. It clung to Theodore 'Teddy' Bartholomew like a second skin, seeping into his faded uniform and whispering stories of forgotten romances and fleeting dreams.  He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, the polished brass buttons on his jacket glinting under the dim glow of the hallway lamps. The elevator doors hissed open, releasing a gust of humid air and a woman in a scarlet dress that seemed to pulsate with an energy all its own. Teddy plastered on his practiced smile, ready for another night navigating the labyrinthine corridors of the Grand Magnolia and its inhabitants.
