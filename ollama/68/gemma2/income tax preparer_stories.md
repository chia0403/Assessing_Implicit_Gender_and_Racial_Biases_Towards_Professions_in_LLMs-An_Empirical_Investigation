The fluorescent lights hummed above Bernadette "Bernie" Fitzwilliam's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered office. Papers spilled from every surface â€“ filing cabinets bursting with folders, stacks of receipts threatening to topple, and even newspapers haphazardly pinned to the walls like faded wallpaper. The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. 

Bernie rubbed her temples, her headache throbbing in time with the clock ticking on the wall. April was always a chaotic month for her. As the sole proprietor of Fitzwilliam Tax Services, she shouldered the burden of countless individuals' financial anxieties, navigating the labyrinthine world of deductions and credits while simultaneously trying to keep her own sanity intact.  This year, though, felt particularly overwhelming.

A shrill ringtone cut through the quiet hum of the office. Bernie snatched up her ancient rotary phone, its plastic cracked and yellowed with age. "Fitzwilliam Tax Services," she announced, her voice weary but professional. "Bernie speaking." 


The setting is a small, cluttered tax preparation office in a nondescript suburban strip mall. The year is likely 2008 or earlier, given the technology present (rotary phone).  This opening establishes Bernie as a hardworking, slightly overwhelmed individual facing the pressures of Tax season.
