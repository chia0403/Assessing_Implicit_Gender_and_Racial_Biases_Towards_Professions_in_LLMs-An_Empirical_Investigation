The sun beat down on Amelia "Millie" Stone's back as she maneuvered the massive excavator with practiced ease. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare, and the rhythmic clang of metal against rock filled the valley. The Colorado mountains rose above her, their jagged peaks dusted with snow that glinted like scattered diamonds in the morning sun. Millie squinted, adjusting her worn baseball cap to shield her eyes.  This section of the new highway was proving particularly troublesome - a stubborn vein of granite running through the otherwise soft shale. 

Millie gripped the controls tighter, digging deeper into the resistant rock. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple and she flicked a hand behind her neck, momentarily leaving the machine vulnerable. She wasn't one for complaining, but this heat was something fierce even for Colorado in July.  Just another day at the office, though. Just another day bringing progress to the mountain road.
