The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's neck as she navigated the crowded flea market. It was a sweltering July day in New Orleans, humidity clinging to her like a second skin. She tugged at her crisp white blouse, wishing for a moment that she had opted for something more breathable, but appearances mattered when you were trying to sell insurance policies, even at a flea market.  

Amy, an independent agent specializing in renter's and home ownerâ€™s insurance, was known for her tenacity and charming Southern drawl. She thrived on the hustle, finding joy in navigating complex policies and making sure people understood their coverage. Today, though, she was struggling. The usual throng of eager bargain hunters seemed less interested in life insurance than in haggling over antique teacups and rusty bicycles. 


The smell of beignets wafting from a nearby stall did little to lift her spirits. Amy sighed, wondering if she'd made a mistake choosing this particular weekend for her outreach.
