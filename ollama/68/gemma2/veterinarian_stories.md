The humid Georgia air clung to Dr. Elara Beaumont like a second skin as she pushed open the creaky door to her clinic. The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden rays. A familiar scent of disinfectant and animal musk filled her nostrils, a comforting aroma that had become synonymous with home. 

Outside, cicadas thrummed their incessant song, a soundtrack to the sleepy town of Oakhaven. Inside, Dr. Beaumont surveyed her domain: a waiting room adorned with faded floral wallpaper, overflowing with dog-eared magazines; an examination table draped in a threadbare green sheet; and shelves stacked high with dusty veterinary textbooks.  

It was quiet, too quiet for a Friday afternoon, the lull before the weekend storm of worried pet owners.  Elara glanced at the clock, its hands pointing to 3:45 pm. Perhaps she'd have time for a cup of tea before the phone began to ring. But then, the sound of frantic barking echoed from the back room, followed by Mrs. Henderson's panicked voice, "Dr. Beaumont!  Jasper, he's not…."

Elara’s heart lurched. Whatever was wrong with Jasper, it was serious.
