The flickering lamplight cast long, dancing shadows across the mosaic floor, each tile shimmering with faded gold and emerald. The air hung thick with the scent of incense and stale sweat, a familiar aroma in the Grand Hall of Castle Alora.  Anya Valerius, her armor clanking softly with every measured step, scanned the crowded chamber. Her hand rested on the hilt of her sword, ever vigilant despite the festive atmosphere. A bard strummed a lively tune, weaving tales of valiant knights and mythical beasts, while nobles in silks and velvets laughed and gossiped over goblets filled with ruby-red wine. 

But Anya's gaze remained sharp, trained on the throng.  Her duty was to protect Lord Alaric, the castle's lord, a responsibility she took very seriously. Tonight, however, an unease gnawed at her. The air buzzed with an unspoken tension, a whisper of danger lurking beneath the gaiety. 


Anya shifted, her gaze lingering on a shadowed corner where a cloaked figure stood, hidden from the lamplight.  Their face was obscured by the hood, their features lost in darkness. Anya felt a prickle of apprehension â€“ they seemed out of place amongst the revelers. Her heart hammered against her ribs, urging her to investigate. This night was supposed to be a celebration, but something told Anya that the true story had yet to unfold.
