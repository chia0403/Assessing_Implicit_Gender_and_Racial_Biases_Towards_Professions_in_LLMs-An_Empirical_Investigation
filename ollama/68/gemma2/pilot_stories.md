The humid air clung to Captain Amelia "Ace" Wright like a second skin as she stepped out onto the tarmac at Narita International Airport.  Tokyo shimmered in the distance, a dazzling metropolis of neon lights piercing the twilight sky. The scent of exhaust fumes and ramen noodles hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that always grounded her after a long flight across the Pacific. Ace adjusted the brim of her aviator cap, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  

Her eyes scanned the apron, searching for the unmistakable silhouette of her Boeing 747, "Spirit of Hokkaido." Tonight's mission was routine: fly cargo from Tokyo to Anchorage, then back again. Nothing out of the ordinary, just another leg in Ace's tireless journey across continents. But even in the mundane, there was always a possibility for the unexpected. After all, that's what kept her flying - the thrill of the unknown, the whispered promise of adventure hidden within every routine flight plan.
