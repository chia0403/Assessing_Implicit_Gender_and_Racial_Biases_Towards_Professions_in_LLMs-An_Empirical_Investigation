The siren screamed, its wail slicing through the quiet pre-dawn air like a jagged shard of glass. 

Amelia "Amy" Grace Davies gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white, her gaze fixed on the swirling red and blue lights in her rearview mirror.  Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat accompanying the insistent rhythm of the siren. Another call. Another chance to make a difference. Another reminder that time was always a merciless enemy.

The streets were deserted, shrouded in an eerie mist that clung to the asphalt like a ghostly veil. The city, usually a symphony of noise and chaos, lay silent, holding its breath for the arrival of the ambulance. 

Amy pulled into the emergency room bay with practiced ease, her movements honed by years of experience. This was her domain, this chaotic ballet of flashing lights, whispered prayers, and the constant, insistent pulse of life. She stepped out of the ambulance, her eyes scanning the faces of the waiting staff.  The usual grim efficiency had taken over; there was no time for pleasantries, only the urgency of saving a life.


The cold air nipped at Amy's face as she approached the stretcher, the groan of metal wheels echoing in the stillness. The victim lay pale and still, their chest barely rising with each shallow breath.
