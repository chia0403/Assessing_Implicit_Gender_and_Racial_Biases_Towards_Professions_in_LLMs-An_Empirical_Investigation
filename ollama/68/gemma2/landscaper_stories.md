The sun beat down on Elias Thornwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn juniper bush. It seemed determined to resist his pruning shears, its branches twisting and contorting in defiance. Elias grunted, the exertion pulling at his already aching muscles.  

He surveyed the scene: Mrs. Hemmings' sprawling Victorian home, nestled amidst a sea of manicured lawns and vibrant flower beds, was a testament to both wealth and meticulous care. Yet, beneath its polished facade, there were whispers of something darker. Elias had felt it from the moment he stepped onto the property that morning â€“ an undercurrent of tension, a subtle unease that permeated the air like the scent of lilies after rain.


He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The heat was oppressive, but the true discomfort stemmed from the shadows lurking in the corners of Mrs. Hemmings' garden. Shadows that seemed to watch him, whisper secrets on the wind, and promise something unsettlingly unknown.
