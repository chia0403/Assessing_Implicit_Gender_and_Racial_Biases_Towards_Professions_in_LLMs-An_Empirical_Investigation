The flickering neon sign of the 'Dusty Quill' cast an oily rainbow across Amelia Grace Blackwood's trench coat as she pushed through the swinging door. Inside, the air was thick with stale cigarette smoke and the murmur of hushed conversations. A lone jazz pianist pounded out a melancholic melody in the corner, his music weaving between the clinking glasses and the clatter of dominoes on worn wooden tables. 

Amelia, her notebook tucked firmly under one arm and her fedora pulled low over her brow, scanned the dimly lit room. Her eyes landed on a man hunched over a drink at the bar, his back to her, a fedora casting a shadow over his face. This was Jack 'Whiskey' Malone, a notorious fixer with connections that ran deeper than anyone dared to imagine. And he held the key to Amelia's story, a story that could expose a conspiracy threatening to engulf the city of New Orleans in darkness.
