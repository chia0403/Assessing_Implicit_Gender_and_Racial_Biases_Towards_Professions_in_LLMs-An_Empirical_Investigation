The flickering neon sign of the Blue Moon Diner cast an oily sheen across Dr. Eleanor Vance's rain-slicked coat as she stepped inside. The scent of stale coffee and frying bacon hung heavy in the air, mingling with the murmur of late-night chatter and the clinking of silverware.  

Eleanor, a woman whose sharp hazel eyes seemed perpetually assessing her surroundings, pulled her collar tighter against the biting November wind that howled outside. Her mind, usually a whirlwind of case files and psychological profiles, was unusually quiet. It had been three months since she'd last walked into the interrogation room at the city precinct, three months since the case of Jacob Miller had consumed her every waking thought. 

Miller, a charismatic businessman accused of orchestrating his wife's murder, had shattered Eleanor's faith in the human psyche. His calculated coldness, his practiced remorse, the way he’d manipulated every therapist and counselor who crossed his path – it all left a bitter taste on her tongue, a lingering doubt that gnawed at her confidence.  

Tonight, however, she was here for something different. A break, perhaps. Or maybe just a greasy burger and a strong cup of coffee to fuel the long hours ahead. The precinct called early tomorrow morning; a new case awaited, one she hoped wouldn't mirror the horrors of Miller's twisted mind.  

She slid into a booth in the corner, away from the bustling crowd, and ordered a black coffee. As she waited, her gaze drifted to the grimy window overlooking the deserted street, its reflection mirroring the turbulence within her soul.  The diner’s warm glow seemed to offer a fragile sanctuary, a temporary reprieve from the darkness that threatened to consume her.
