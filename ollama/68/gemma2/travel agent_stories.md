The humid Miami air hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Rose's tiny office, thick with the scent of coconut sunscreen and desperation. Sunlight streamed through the cracked blinds, highlighting dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. A half-eaten bag of stale pretzels sat precariously on the edge of Amy’s desk, its contents mocking her dwindling hope for lunch. She stared at the computer screen, each blinking cursor a tiny hammer blow to her already frayed nerves.  

"Dream Vacations," the faded banner above read, irony dripping like the condensation on the office window. 

Amy, once brimming with passion for exotic locales and bucket-list adventures, now felt more like a seasoned sailor caught in a perpetual storm. Business had dwindled to a trickle since the pandemic, and her small agency was teetering on the brink of insolvency. The stack of unpaid bills by her coffee machine seemed to grow taller every day, a silent testament to her dwindling fortunes. 


Outside, the city buzzed with life, oblivious to Amy's internal struggle. But inside this cramped office, time seemed to crawl, punctuated only by the insistent chirping of her phone – another client seeking a refund, another dream deferred.
