The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beatrice Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the alphabetized shelves lining the pharmacy walls.  

Eloise was used to the relentless buzz; it had been the soundtrack to her life for the past fifteen years since she took over the family business in quaint, seaside Oakhaven. Oakhaven itself wasn’t much to look at – a collection of charmingly dilapidated buildings huddled against the windswept coast – but its inhabitants were as warm and resilient as their weathered homes.  

It was a slow Tuesday morning. A few regulars shuffled through, picking up their prescriptions with practiced ease, exchanging the usual pleasantries with Eloise about the weather or their grandchildren. But today, something felt different. The air was thick with an unsettling anticipation, like a storm gathering on the horizon. 


Eloise adjusted her spectacles and scanned the street outside. A lone figure stood across from the pharmacy, his back hunched against the chill wind, staring intently at the storefront.  He wore a worn fedora pulled low over his brow, casting his face in shadow. He seemed out of place in Oakhaven's tranquil tableau. Eloise felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. This wasn’t just another prescription pickup. Something was about to change.
