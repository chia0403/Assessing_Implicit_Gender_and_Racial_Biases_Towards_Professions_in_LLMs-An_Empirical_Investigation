The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck as he wrestled with the ancient oak beam. Sweat stung his eyes, but he refused to wipe it away. A bead of moisture snaked down his temple and splashed onto the rough wood, leaving a glistening trail that mirrored the furrow in his brow.  

Silas worked in his grandfather's workshop, a hulking structure perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the storm-tossed sea. The salty air carried the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks below. The workshop itself was a labyrinth of dusty planks, forgotten tools, and half-finished projects, each imbued with generations of Blackwood craftsmanship.

The current project, an intricate double door for the Mayor's new mansion, seemed to mock Silas’ efforts. He’d been wrestling with this blasted beam for hours, its stubborn knots refusing to yield to his mallet. His calloused hands ached, and a gnawing frustration started to churn in his gut.  He wasn't used to being stumped like this. 

Silas Blackwood prided himself on his skill. It was all he'd ever known, passed down through generations of Blackwoods who built the homes, ships, and even churches that dotted their little corner of the world. But lately, doubts had been creeping in. A gnawing sense that perhaps, just perhaps, he wasn't as gifted as his ancestors.
