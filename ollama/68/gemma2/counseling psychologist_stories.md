Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Amelia Vance's heart.  She stared at the rain-streaked cityscape beyond her office, its usual vibrancy dulled by the storm’s fury. The late afternoon light cast long shadows across her cluttered desk, where a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat abandoned next to a stack of patient files. A shiver ran down her spine, not entirely from the chill seeping through the old building's drafty windows.

Amelia Vance, a counseling psychologist specializing in trauma and grief, felt an unsettling unease settle over her.  The storm mirrored the turmoil brewing within her own mind. The news report she’d caught earlier about the missing child gnawed at her, its details blurring into a terrifying tapestry of fear and uncertainty. And now, with each gust of wind and flash of lightning, it felt like that story was becoming more real, encroaching on her carefully constructed world of normalcy within these four walls. 


Her phone rang, shattering the tense silence. She picked it up, her voice betraying a tremor she tried to mask. "Dr. Vance's office."

The caller identified themselves as Mrs. Eleanor Bellweather, a new patient requesting an emergency appointment. Amelia swallowed hard, her unease growing. The woman’s voice was filled with a desperate urgency that sent a chill down her spine. 


"Mrs. Bellweather," Amelia said, forcing calm into her tone, "I'm booked solid today, but I can..." 

But the words died on her lips as Mrs. Bellweather's frantic plea cut through the line: "It's my daughter… she’s gone… just like they said on the news…"


The storm raged on, now a symphony of terror, as Amelia knew this call was about to plunge her into the heart of the darkness that threatened her city and its unsuspecting inhabitants.
