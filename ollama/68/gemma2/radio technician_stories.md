The humid Mississippi air hung thick in the cramped confines of Clyde "Sparky" Beaumont's shack. It wasn't much – just a weathered wooden structure tucked behind his grandfather's ramshackle general store in tiny Oakhaven, Louisiana.  

The smell of solder and motor oil mingled with the sweet scent of magnolia blossoms drifting in through the open window. A half-eaten pecan pie sat cooling on the workbench next to a tangle of wires and spare radio parts. Clyde wiped sweat from his brow as he meticulously replaced a faulty capacitor, muttering under his breath about cheap Chinese components. Outside, cicadas thrummed their incessant song, a rhythmic counterpoint to the crackle of static emanating from the battered old Zenith transceiver on his workbench.  

Clyde leaned back, squinting at the dial, trying to pinpoint the source of the faint signal bleeding through the noise. It wasn't anything he'd heard before – not the usual chatter of ham radio operators or the distant hum of a weather broadcast. This was something else entirely, a low, pulsing tone laced with an undercurrent of… discordance.  

He adjusted the tuning knob, bringing the signal into sharper focus. A shiver ran down his spine. It wasn't just static anymore. Words, fragmented and distorted, whispered through the receiver. 


"Oakhaven... something... coming..."
