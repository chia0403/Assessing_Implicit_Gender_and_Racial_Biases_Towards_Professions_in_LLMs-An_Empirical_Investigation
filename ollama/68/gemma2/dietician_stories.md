The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling farmers' market, illuminating rows of vibrant produce and fragrant herbs.  

Amelia Thistlewood, a petite woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Her name tag, pinned neatly to her denim apron, read "Amelia - Nutrition Advice". She wasn't selling anything today; she was simply offering free consultations, hoping to connect with folks who needed guidance on healthy eating habits. The market, a kaleidoscope of colours and sounds, was always a hive of activity, but Amelia found a peculiar stillness within its chaos. A quiet hum resonated in her chest, a feeling she often experienced when surrounded by fresh food and the promise of nourishment. 

She adjusted the basket of apples resting beside her, a gift from Farmer Joe â€“ a kind man with weathered hands who understood the importance of healthy soil and wholesome produce. Amelia smiled, knowing that these apples would be enjoyed by many throughout the day. As she settled into her makeshift stand, waiting for the first eager faces, a young woman approached, her eyes clouded with worry and frustration.
