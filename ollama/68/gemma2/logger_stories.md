The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Elijah Thorne surveyed the sprawling expanse before him. Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of rose and gold that reflected off the dew-kissed canopy overhead. The forest floor, usually a tapestry of brown and green, glistened like an emerald sea under the nascent sunlight. 

Elijah ran a calloused hand over his thick, auburn beard, feeling the prickle of stubble against his fingertips.  He was a man forged from the very wood he felled - strong, weathered, and deeply rooted in this ancient forest. Today, like every day, the symphony of the woods filled his ears: the rustling leaves, the chattering squirrels, the distant screech of an owl. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the crisp air, and set about his work.  His trusty axe, "Old Betsy," lay strapped to his back, a silent promise of duty fulfilled. 


The setting is a dense, old-growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, somewhere along the rugged coastline of Oregon. The year is 1927, and the air buzzes with the tension of change -  the encroaching industrial world threatening the tranquil rhythm of life within these ancient trees.
