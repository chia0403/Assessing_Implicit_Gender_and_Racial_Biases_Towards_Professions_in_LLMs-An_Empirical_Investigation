The scent of lavender cleaning spray hung heavy in the air, battling with the ghost of jasmine perfume that clung stubbornly to the velvet drapes in the grand drawing-room of Blackwood Manor. Emilia Thistlewood hummed softly to herself as she meticulously dusted a silver candlestick taller than her own head, careful not to disturb the intricate etchings of mythical creatures. 

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient oak trees that clawed at the manor's stone walls. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, blurring the world beyond into a watercolor wash of grays and greens. Emilia found comfort in the familiar rhythm of her work, a stark contrast to the storm raging outside.  

Blackwood Manor had been her home for as long as she could remember, raised by Mrs. Blackwood herself after her parents died tragically young. Now, at twenty-five, Emilia knew every nook and cranny of the sprawling house, every creak of the floorboards, every sigh of the wind whistling through the chimneys. She was more than just a housekeeper; she was the silent guardian of its secrets, keeper of its memories, and confidante to its solitary inhabitants -  the aging Lord Blackwood and his reclusive daughter, Agatha. 


The storm suddenly intensified, shaking the manor with a primal fury. A flash of lightning illuminated a dark corner of the drawing-room, revealing a faint shimmer in the air. Emilia's humming ceased abruptly, replaced by a prickle of unease that settled deep in her bones.  Something was amiss. This wasn't just a storm; it felt... different.
