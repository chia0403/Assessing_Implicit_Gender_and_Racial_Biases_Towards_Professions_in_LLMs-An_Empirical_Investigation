The August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Vance's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he shifted precariously on the sloping roof, adjusting a loose shingle with practiced hands. He could practically feel the heat radiating from the asphalt beneath his work boots, each step a gamble against the slick surface. Below him, Mrs. Peterson’s quaint Victorian house stretched its gingerbread trim towards the sky, a patchwork of vibrant paint fading in the relentless summer sun. 

Eli wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smudge of grime across his forehead. The air buzzed with the drone of cicadas and the distant hum of traffic on Elm Street. He was alone on the roof, a solitary figure amidst the sprawling suburbs of Maplewood, Wisconsin, where the aroma of freshly cut grass mingled with the sweet scent of honeysuckle.  


The job wasn't particularly challenging - just a routine repair for Mrs. Peterson’s leaky attic - but Eli took pride in his work. He liked being up here, high above the mundane world, feeling the wind ruffle his hair and the sun warm his skin. It was a different kind of solitude than he found in the crowded bars downtown, where the noise only served to amplify his loneliness.
