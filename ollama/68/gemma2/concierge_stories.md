The air in The Grand Regency hummed with hushed whispers and the clinking of champagne flutes. It was always like this on a Saturday night – an orchestra of elegance conducted by the city's elite.  At the heart of this symphony stood Alistair Percival Worthington III, head concierge of the hotel and master of unseen strings. He knew every guest by name, their preferred brand of whiskey, and the subtle tremor in their hand when they were about to receive a particularly unwelcome piece of news. Tonight, though, Alistair felt a different kind of tension thrumming through the grand lobby. A storm was brewing, not outside, but within the gilded walls of The Grand Regency.


Alistair straightened his impeccably pressed waistcoat, adjusting the tiny silver eagle pin that perched on its lapel.  His gaze swept across the room, taking in the tableau: a young couple whispering secrets by the fireplace, an elderly gentleman meticulously polishing his monocle, a group of women giggling over hushed conversations about diamonds and gossip. It was all orchestrated chaos, and Alistair thrived in it. But tonight, something felt different – like a dissonant note in a perfectly tuned melody.  


Then he saw her. A woman, standing alone by the grand staircase, shrouded in shadow and radiating an aura of quiet defiance. Her emerald green eyes seemed to pierce through the swirling fog of champagne bubbles and social pleasantries, searching for something, or perhaps someone. Alistair knew, with a certainty that bordered on premonition, that this woman would change everything.
