The bell above Amelia Clementine's door tinkled with a sigh as she opened it for her next client. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the familiar streetlamps into shimmering halos. The scent of lavender and rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp pavement and blooming lilac from the potted plant by the entrance. 

Amelia, a woman built like a sturdy oak, smiled warmly at the man standing on her doorstep. He was hunched under a worn raincoat, his shoulders tense, as if carrying the weight of the world on them. 

"Evening," Amelia greeted him, her voice a soothing balm against the storm raging outside. "Welcome to Serenity Massage."


She gestured towards the softly lit waiting area with its plush armchair and flickering candlelight. The room was designed for tranquility, a haven from the chaos of the city just beyond the threshold.
