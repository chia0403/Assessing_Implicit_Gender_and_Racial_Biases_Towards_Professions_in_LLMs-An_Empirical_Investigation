The air in Mercy General’s ER was thick with the smell of antiseptic and desperation. A low hum vibrated through the fluorescent lights, casting an anemic glow on the chaotic scene before Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.

One moment you were stitching up a kid’s knee, the next you were grappling with a full-blown cardiac arrest. Amy wouldn’t have it any other way. The unpredictable chaos was the very thing that kept her blood pumping, her mind sharp, her heart strangely content. 


As she scribbled notes on a patient's chart, the doors swung open with their usual bang, revealing a man clutching his stomach and gasping for breath. His face was contorted in pain, beads of sweat clinging to his forehead. This wasn’t going to be a simple sugar rush case. Amy felt a familiar thrill shoot through her – time to put her skills to the test.
