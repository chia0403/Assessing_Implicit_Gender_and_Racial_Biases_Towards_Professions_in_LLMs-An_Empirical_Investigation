Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, highlighting dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering ghosts. Outside, the cacophony of Los Angeles hummed – a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the incessant chatter of ambition. But inside, silence reigned, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of Elara's fingers against her laptop keyboard.
