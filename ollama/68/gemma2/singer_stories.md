The air hung thick with anticipation, heavy as the scent of stale beer and cheap perfume that permeated The Rusty Bucket. A haze of cigarette smoke swirled above the makeshift stage, illuminated by a single bare bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling.  Eleanor "Elle" Beaumont adjusted the strap of her guitar, her fingers nervously tapping against the worn wood. This dive bar on the outskirts of New Orleans was about as far from Broadway as she could imagine, but desperate times called for desperate measures. 

Tonight was Elle's last shot. She had two weeks left before eviction loomed over her tiny apartment above Mr. Dupree's voodoo shop. Her savings were dwindling faster than a Mardi Gras parade float after the rain, and the only option left was The Rusty Bucket’s infamous "Open Mic Night". A night where talent was drowned out by drunken chatter and questionable karaoke attempts. Elle hoped, with every fiber of her being, that tonight would be different. 


Elle took a deep breath, closing her eyes for a moment, picturing the faces in the crowd as expectant listeners instead of indifferent patrons.  She whispered to herself, "Just get through this song. Just one song." 

As she strummed the opening chords of her original tune, a hush fell over the bar. For the first time all night, the air crackled with something more than anticipation – it crackled with possibility.
