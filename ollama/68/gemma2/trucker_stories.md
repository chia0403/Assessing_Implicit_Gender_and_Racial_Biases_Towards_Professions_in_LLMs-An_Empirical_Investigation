The diesel engine hummed like a contented cat as Amelia "Amy" Rose Thornton pulled onto the dusty stretch of Route 66. The Arizona sun beat down on her rig, a gleaming Peterbilt 379 she affectionately called "Betsy," making the chrome gleam like molten gold.  

Dust devils danced across the asphalt ahead, swirling in the heat haze that shimmered off the cracked earth. Abandoned gas stations, their neon signs long extinguished, stood like skeletal sentinels along the faded highway. This stretch of Route 66 was a ghost town, bypassed by modern highways and forgotten by time. But Amy loved it. She thrived on the solitude, the wide-open spaces, and the stories etched into the cracked asphalt. Each mile she covered whispered tales of weary travelers, broken dreams, and fleeting moments of Americana captured in faded photographs hanging in roadside diners. 


Amy squinted at the sun, its glare reflecting off her visor. Her CB crackled with static, a lonely echo in the vast emptiness. She knew she was headed into the heart of nowhere, but for Amy, that was exactly where she belonged.
