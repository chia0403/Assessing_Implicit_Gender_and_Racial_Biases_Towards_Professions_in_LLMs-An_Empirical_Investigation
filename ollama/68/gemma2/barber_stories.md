The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven from decades of memories. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty front window, cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Alaric Bartholomew's barbershop. Each inch of the place spoke volumes: the faded posters advertising "Lucky Strike" cigarettes, the chipped porcelain sink, and the worn leather barber chairs that creaked like old men sharing secrets.  

Alaric, his silver hair slicked back with pomade, ran a calloused hand over the blade of his razor, humming a tuneless melody under his breath. He'd been cutting hair in this very shop for forty years, watching generations of men come and go, their lives unfolding like chapters in a book beside him. Today, however, felt different. A strange energy crackled in the air, an anticipation that prickled at the back of Alaric’s neck. 


He glanced at the clock – 8:57 am.  Just three minutes until the doors swung open and the day began, just three minutes until someone new walked into his world.
