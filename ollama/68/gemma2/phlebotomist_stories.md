The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cramped waiting room.  It was the kind of sterile beige that screamed “medical facility,” yet somehow still managed to feel depressing. Amelia glanced at her watch – 9:52 am. Five minutes until her shift started, and already three patients were slumped in their chairs, fidgeting with pamphlets titled "Understanding Your Bloodwork."

Amelia sighed. She loved the quiet satisfaction of drawing blood – the precise prick, the gentle pull, the little red vial filling up like a tiny promise. But she wasn't sure she was cut out for the waiting room drama.  The anxious whispers, the shuffling feet, the occasional outburst when someone realized they'd forgotten their insurance card – it all wore on her nerves. Still, she had bills to pay and, despite her reservations, this phlebotomy gig at Meadowbrook Clinic kept her afloat.
