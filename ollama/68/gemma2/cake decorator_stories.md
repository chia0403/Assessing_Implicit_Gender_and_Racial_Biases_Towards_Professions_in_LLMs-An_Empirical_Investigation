The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and impending disaster.  Elara "Ellie" Rosewater, her brow furrowed in concentration, wielded a piping bag like a weapon against the swirling buttercream chaos on her countertop. Her latest commission, a three-tiered monstrosity meant to resemble a blooming sunflower field for a celebrity wedding, was threatening to become more of a muddled mess than a masterpiece. 

The sun beat down on Ellie's tiny bakery, "Sweet Surrender," perched precariously in a back alley off Sunset Boulevard. Outside, the buzz of Los Angeles hummed around her, a chaotic symphony punctuated by passing cars and the distant wail of a siren. Inside, it was a different kind of chaos â€“ the kind that involved melting chocolate, temperamental fondant, and Ellie's rapidly dwindling patience. 


The wedding was tomorrow.
