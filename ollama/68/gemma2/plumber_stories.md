The insistent drip-drip-dripping from Mrs. Periwinkle's bathroom sink was like a metronome keeping time with Bartholomew Quillfeather’s growing frustration. He knelt beside the porcelain basin, his brow furrowed in concentration as he inspected the rusted pipes beneath the sink. 

Bartholomew wasn't new to plumbing nightmares. In fact, his business, “Quillfeather's Quick Fixes,” had built its reputation on rescuing residents of Willow Creek from their water woes. But this case felt different. There was a strange hum emanating from the pipes, like a hidden lullaby humming beneath the incessant drip. 

Willow Creek itself was a quaint town nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont. Its gingerbread houses were adorned with overflowing flower boxes and friendly porch swings creaked rhythmically in the warm summer breeze. But Bartholomew knew that beneath the idyllic facade, secrets whispered through the cobbled streets and old stone walls, just like the hum he felt coming from Mrs. Periwinkle's pipes.
