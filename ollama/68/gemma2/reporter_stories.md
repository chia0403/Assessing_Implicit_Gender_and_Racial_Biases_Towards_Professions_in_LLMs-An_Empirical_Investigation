Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Grind, blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically across the street. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Beaumont hunched over her worn notepad, the acrid scent of stale coffee clinging to the air like a second skin. She chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reread the tip scribbled in shaky handwriting: "He doesn't know he's being watched. They're closing in."

Amy was a reporter for The Daily Grind, a struggling local paper with more holes than funding. Her beat was whatever fell through the cracks - petty theft, lost dogs, the occasional council meeting that descended into chaos. But this tip, received anonymously just hours ago, felt different. It reeked of danger, whispered promises of a story that could shake the city to its core. 

The setting: A rundown diner on the outskirts of Havenwood, a once-bustling port city now teetering on the brink of economic collapse. The air is thick with the smell of salt and decay, and shadows lurk in every corner.  Amy's heart pounded against her ribs as she reread the tip one last time, a knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just another story; this was a chance to prove herself, to uncover something big.
