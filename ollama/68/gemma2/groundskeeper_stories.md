The dew clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick's worn boots like miniature jewels, glistening under the pale pre-dawn light filtering through the ancient oak canopy. He knelt beside a bed of pansies, their velvety petals just beginning to unfurl, and snipped away a rogue leaf with practiced precision. The air was thick with the earthy scent of damp soil and the faint sweetness of honeysuckle, a perfume that Bartholomew Thistlewick found as comforting as a warm blanket on a cold night.

He worked at Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion nestled amidst rolling hills in rural Gloucestershire. Its weathered stone fa√ßade seemed to sigh under the weight of centuries, its ivy-covered walls whispering secrets to those who dared listen. Inside, the manor housed generations of memories, each etched into its ornate woodwork and dust-laden tapestries. Bartholomew knew every inch of it, from the hidden rose garden behind the grand library to the forgotten attic room with its dusty gramophone. But his true kingdom was the sprawling grounds surrounding the mansion, a vibrant tapestry of meticulously manicured lawns, towering trees, and fragrant flower beds that he tended with the reverence of an artist. 


Bartholomew Thistlewick, at sixty-two, had lived more lives than most people dreamt of. He'd been a shepherd, a soldier, a bricklayer before finding his calling as Blackwood Manor's groundskeeper. His weathered hands, calloused and strong, spoke volumes about a life spent in service to the earth, and his eyes, the color of aged whiskey, held a wisdom gleaned from years spent watching nature's subtle dance.
