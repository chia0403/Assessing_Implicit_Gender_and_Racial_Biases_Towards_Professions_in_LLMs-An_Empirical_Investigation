The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Eleanor Vance's office cast long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, her waiting room smelled faintly of lavender hand sanitizer and stale anxiety. A young woman with bright pink hair sat hunched over a well-worn copy of "Moby Dick," her face illuminated by the pale blue glow of her phone screen. The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second a hammer blow against the fragile silence.

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, her gaze drifting across the room, landing briefly on the framed diplomas hanging crookedly on one wall. A doctorate in clinical psychology from Harvard University. Board certified in child and adolescent mental health. It felt like a lifetime ago, before the weight of the world had settled on her shoulders, before her own anxieties threatened to drown her.  


Tonight, she knew, the waiting room would hold another story, another soul seeking solace amidst the chaos of their own minds. The question was, would Eleanor be strong enough to offer it?
