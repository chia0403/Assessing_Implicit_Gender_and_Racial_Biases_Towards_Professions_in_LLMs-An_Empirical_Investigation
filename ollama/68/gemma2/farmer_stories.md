The sun cracked over the eastern ridge, painting Amelia Thistlewood’s face in streaks of gold and rose as she surveyed her field. The first frost had kissed the leaves overnight, turning them brittle and brown, but the soil beneath was still yielding, rich and dark from the recent rains. She inhaled deeply, savoring the earthy scent mingled with the crisp morning air.  A symphony of birdsong filled the valley, a chorus welcoming the new day, while further down the road, a lone rooster crowed its declaration of dawn. Amelia Thistlewood, her boots sunk deep in the mud, knew this was her rhythm, her heartbeat – the slow, steady pulse of life on the farm.  
 
This wasn't just any farm; it was Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a place steeped in family history and whispers of forgotten magic. Amelia’s ancestors had worked this land for generations, their names etched into the weathered oak trees that lined the property line like silent guardians. She could feel their presence, a comforting weight on her shoulders as she walked among the rows of wilting cornstalks, preparing for the harvest. But there was an underlying tension in the air, a subtle shift Amelia couldn't quite place. Something felt different this year, a sense of anticipation that prickled at the edges of her senses.
