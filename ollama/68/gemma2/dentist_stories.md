The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Anya Sharma's office, a comforting aroma to some, but to her, it was a constant reminder of the anxieties she navigated daily. Her small dental practice, nestled on a quiet side street in suburban Boston, was a haven for patients seeking relief from toothaches and fear. 

Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, casting warm squares on the linoleum floor where Dr. Sharma meticulously arranged her instruments. The day had started like any other: humming with the gentle whir of the drill, punctuated by the occasional squeak of the swivel chair. But a new appointment – one shrouded in mystery – was about to disrupt the familiar rhythm. 


A man stood nervously outside, his face obscured by the shadows cast by a wide-brimmed hat. His heavy coat concealed his figure, and he seemed to shift uneasily as if battling an internal storm. This wasn't just another patient seeking a filling or a cleaning; this was different.  Dr. Sharma felt it in her gut. Something about him, something unspoken, whispered of secrets hidden beneath the surface.
