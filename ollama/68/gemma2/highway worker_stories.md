The sun bled across the asphalt, turning it from black to molten gold. Sweat stung Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' eyes as he wrestled another section of barrier tape into place. The morning haze hung thick over Interstate 95, blurring the distant city skyline and casting everything in an ethereal, almost dreamlike quality.  

Bart squinted at the traffic rumbling past, a steady stream of metal and glass hurtling towards their destinations. He felt invisible to them, just another part of the roadside tableau - a faded yellow vest, a lonely orange cone, the hum of a distant jackhammer. 

He tugged his cap lower, shielding his eyes from the glare as he scanned the horizon. Today's stretch of I-95 was quiet, no fender benders or accidents to interrupt the monotony. Just another day on the asphalt river, where time flowed at the speed limit and stories unfolded in fleeting glimpses behind windshields. 


Bart craved something more than this predictable rhythm. Something unexpected, something that would break the endless cycle of asphalt and traffic, but for now, he was just another cog in the machine, keeping the flow going.
