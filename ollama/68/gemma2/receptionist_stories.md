The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's head like a swarm of impatient bees. Her gaze flitted across the sparsely decorated waiting area of Dr. Anderson's practice - a beige canvas dotted with faded floral arrangements and a lone magazine rack groaning under the weight of outdated Vogue issues. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and nervous anticipation. Eleanor, perched on her swivel chair behind the worn reception desk, was acutely aware of every cough, every shuffling footfall, every rustle of paper that punctuated the silence. She longed for the familiar chime of the doorbell announcing a new patient, any distraction from the gnawing emptiness of the morning. 


Dr. Anderson's practice was located in a quiet suburb just outside the bustling city center, nestled between a laundromat and a bakery with the perpetually warm scent of fresh bread wafting through the open door. The street itself was lined with quaint brick houses, each window box overflowing with geraniums that struggled to bloom against the encroaching winter.
