The rain hammered against the grimy window of Alistair Finch's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the tired city below.  Neon signs bled their sickly colours onto the slick asphalt, reflecting like shattered rainbows in the puddles that pooled around discarded coffee cups and forgotten dreams. Alistair himself was perched on the edge of his desk, chin resting on his knuckles, staring out into the gloom. His trench coat hung over the back of a chair, the collar pulled high against the chill that seeped through the cracks in the old building's walls.  A half-smoked cigarette smoldered in an overflowing ashtray beside him, its ember a flickering counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Alistair Finch wasn't known for his optimism, and this case wasn't doing much to change that. 


He had been sent a single photograph – a faded Polaroid of a woman with haunted eyes and a defiant smile. On the back, in shaky handwriting, was a single word: "Find her." No name, no address, no clues beyond that piercing gaze and the sense of desperation radiating from the photo itself.  This wasn't Alistair's usual clientele – he dealt in stolen jewels, cheating spouses, and missing cats, not vanished women with secrets buried deep within their souls. But something about this case pulled at him, like a moth drawn to a flickering flame. A desperate whisper in the storm. He took a drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling around his face like a shroud.  He had a feeling this was going to be a long night.
