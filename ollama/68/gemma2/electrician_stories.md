The flickering neon sign cast an oily green glow across Elias Thorne’s grease-stained overalls.  Rain lashed against the diner windows, blurring the already hazy lights of the strip mall where he stood. The "Open 24 Hours" sign above him buzzed erratically, its light struggling to pierce the gloom. Elias sighed, tugging his faded red beanie lower over his ears. Another night, another busted circuit. This time it was Betty’s Burgers, a greasy spoon that smelled perpetually of bacon and desperation.  He knew better than most what desperation looked like. It lived in his own toolbox, coiled tight like a live wire waiting to shock him awake. 


Elias Thorne wasn't just any electrician; he was the last hope for a town choking on its fading dreams. This dusty corner of Nevada, once booming with silver mines and saloons, had been reduced to crumbling buildings and vacant eyes. But tonight, Elias felt a flicker of something else amidst the usual despair. A spark of possibility, maybe even hope, hidden beneath the grime and rain.
