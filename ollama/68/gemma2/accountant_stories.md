The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch, casting a sickly pallor over the rows of spreadsheets stretching before her. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, a blur of motion as she reconciled accounts for the hundredth time that week. The air in the cramped cubicle was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  

Amelia's office was tucked away in a forgotten corner of the bustling city, on the third floor of a nondescript building whose only claim to fame was its proximity to an overpriced sushi bar and a perpetually clogged drainage system. The walls were adorned with faded motivational posters featuring clich√©s like "Dream Big" and "Believe," which felt more ironic than inspiring in this dimly lit purgatory. Outside, the incessant honking of traffic formed a dull roar, punctuated by the occasional screech of brakes and the distant wail of a siren. 


The city throbbed with life, unaware of Amelia's quietly unraveling world within these four walls.
