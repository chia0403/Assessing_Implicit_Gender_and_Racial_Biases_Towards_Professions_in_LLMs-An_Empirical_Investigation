The flickering neon sign outside cast Dr. Eleanor Ashcroft's silhouette against the rain-streaked window like a macabre dance. Inside, the waiting room of "Ashcroft & Associates" was sparsely populated â€“ just Mrs. Peterson, nervously wringing her hands over a tissue, and a teenage boy slumped in a chair, headphones blasting music that vibrated the floorboards. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her eyes. The Seattle rain seemed to seep into everything, even her bones. 

It was a Tuesday, 7:45 pm, and the clinic was usually buzzing with patients by now. But tonight, an unnerving stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the glass panes. Eleanor knew this quiet wasn't normal. Something was off.  She just couldn't put her finger on it.
