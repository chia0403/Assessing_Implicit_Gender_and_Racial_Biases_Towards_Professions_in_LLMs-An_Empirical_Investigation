The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and simmering barbecue. Sweat beaded on Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's brow as she navigated the crowded farmers market, her brightly-colored sales banner snapping in the breeze behind her. This wasn't exactly where she envisioned herself at twenty-five, hawking handmade bath bombs amidst rows of plump tomatoes and fragrant basil. But a recent layoff from her corporate marketing job had quickly put an end to dreams of corner offices and expense accounts. Now, Amy was all about "natural ingredients" and "self-care rituals,"  hoping her homemade concoctions could bring in enough dough to keep the lights on and her landlord at bay. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the bustling marketplace, painting the wooden stalls a warm gold. The air buzzed with the chatter of shoppers, the laughter of children chasing pigeons, and the rhythmic strumming of a lone guitarist in the corner. A stray dog sniffed curiously at Amy's display, its tail wagging hopefully. This was her new reality: vibrant chaos, unpredictable customers, and the constant pressure to make every sale count.
