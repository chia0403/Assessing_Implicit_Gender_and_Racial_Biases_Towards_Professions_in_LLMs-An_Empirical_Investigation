The sun beat down on Jasper Thorne’s back as he swung his hammer, the rhythmic clang echoing through the dusty quarry.  He wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak across his grime-stained face. The air hung heavy with the scent of crushed limestone and the earthy tang of freshly turned soil. Around him, men worked in unison, each focused on their task: some chipping away at the rough stone, others shaping it into blocks with chisel and mallet.  

Jasper Thorne wasn't like them. He was a sculptor among quarrymen. While others saw only raw material, Jasper saw potential – shapes waiting to be unleashed, stories yearning to be told in cold, hard stone. His workshop, a ramshackle hut nestled against the cliff face, housed his most prized possessions: a collection of tools honed to perfection, worn smooth by years of dedicated use, and shelves overflowing with unfinished sculptures, each a testament to his unwavering passion. 


Jasper’s quarry was nestled in the shadow of Mount Cinder, an extinct volcano whose peak loomed over their small village like a watchful guardian. The mountain was more than just a landmark; it was woven into the very fabric of their lives, its slopes providing the raw materials for their buildings and tools, its fertile soil nurturing their crops. But lately, whispers had begun to circulate about strange occurrences on the mountain – unusual tremors, unexplained lights, and unsettling noises in the night. These stories, dismissed by most as superstitious ramblings, gnawed at Jasper's mind, fueling a growing unease that mirrored the churning within his own unfinished work.
