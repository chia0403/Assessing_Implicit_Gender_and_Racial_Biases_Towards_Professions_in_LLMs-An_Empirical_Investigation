The biting wind whipped through Amelia Thistlewick's auburn hair as she surveyed the expanse of the Cairnmoor Wildlife Sanctuary. Snow dusted the ground, transforming the usual patchwork quilt of green meadows and golden bracken into a monochrome canvas.  A lone crow cawed in a skeletal oak tree, its black feathers stark against the gray sky. Amelia tugged her woolen scarf tighter, her breath puffing out in visible clouds. It was December in Scotland, and winter had arrived with a vengeance.

Amelia Thistlewick, head caretaker of Cairnmoor, wasn't fazed by the chill. She thrived on the solitude and quiet of the sanctuary during this season. The bustling summer activity - tours, educational programs, and overflowing enclosures - dwindled to a hushed routine of feeding schedules and watchful vigilance. But Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything. This place, with its rescued animals and sprawling wilderness, was her home, her passion. 


She glanced towards the main lodge, a cozy stone building nestled amidst the rugged landscape. A plume of smoke curled from the chimney, promising warmth and a steaming cup of tea. But first, she had a morning patrol to complete. Amelia grabbed her well-worn notebook and set off into the snow, her footsteps crunching on the frosted ground.  The sanctuary was vast and diverse -  a haven for injured birds, orphaned mammals, and even the occasional exotic reptile rescued from neglectful owners. 


Today's priority was checking on the Highland cattle, huddled together in their barn against the bitter wind. They were a gentle bunch, these giants, but Amelia knew they needed extra care during the harshest months. Then there were the red deer, wary and watchful, roaming free in the nearby glen. She would have to be extra careful not to startle them. And somewhere, hidden amongst the snow-covered pines, lived the sanctuary's newest resident: a young wolf pup named Fenris, orphaned and desperately needing Amelia's care. 


As she trudged deeper into the wilderness, Amelia breathed in the crisp air, her heart filled with a familiar sense of purpose. It was a cold December morning, but within the sanctuary walls, life thrummed on, waiting for Amelia's watchful eye.
