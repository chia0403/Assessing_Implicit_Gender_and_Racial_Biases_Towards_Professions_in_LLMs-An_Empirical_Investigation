The clack of Eleanor Thistlewick's typewriter was the only sound in the otherwise silent office. Outside, London roared with the symphony of a summer evening -  the distant wail of sirens, chattering crowds spilling out of pubs, and the rhythmic thump of a bass line from somewhere across the Thames. But here, nestled in her small corner cubicle on the top floor of the Grandchester Building, Eleanor was lost in a world of carbon copies and neatly typed memos. 

The faint scent of lavender from her desk blotter mingled with the stale air of old paper and forgotten coffee. Her once pristine white blouse was now dotted with ink stains, testament to a morning spent battling a recalcitrant typewriter ribbon.  Eleanor sighed. Another day in the life of a secretary at Grandchester & Sons, purveyors of fine automobiles and occasional targets of flamboyant eccentrics. 


At least it was quiet for now. The storm usually hit around four p.m., a whirlwind of frantic phone calls, demanding clients, and Mr. Fitzwilliam's endless stream of nonsensical requests. Eleanor adjusted her spectacles and tapped her fingers on the keys, waiting for the inevitable chaos to begin.
