The recycled air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous sweat. Amelia Rose Thornton smoothed down her navy blue uniform, her knuckles white against the crisp fabric. She glanced at the boarding pass in her hand: Flight 347 to Cancun, departure imminent.  

Amelia had been a flight attendant for five years, navigating turbulent skies and even more tumultuous passengers with practiced ease. But today, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran through her, a feeling she couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the unusually low number of passengers – only two dozen souls braved this midday flight to paradise. Or maybe it was the unsettling glint in the eyes of the lone man who had boarded last, his worn leather briefcase clutched tightly to his chest.

The plane was a Boeing 737, its belly painted with the bright colors of  Tropical Airways. It sat on the tarmac at LAX, bathed in the harsh glare of the California sun. Outside, the bustle of airport activity – the screech of luggage carts, announcements booming over the speakers, and the constant hum of conversation – faded into a distant murmur as Amelia stepped onto the jet bridge, her heart pounding a silent rhythm against her ribs.
