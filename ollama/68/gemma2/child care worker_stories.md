The air in the Playroom thrummed with the chaotic symphony of childhood: shrieks of laughter bouncing off the brightly painted walls, the rhythmic clatter of plastic blocks, and the constant hum of negotiations between miniature dictators vying for control of the red fire truck.  Amelia Harper, her blonde ponytail snagged on a rogue building block and perched precariously atop her head, surveyed the scene with a practiced calm. She'd been managing this preschool pandemonium for five years, and while she sometimes longed for the peace and quiet of a library, there was a certain magic in witnessing these tiny humans navigate their world with such fierce passion and boundless energy. 


Today, however, Amelia felt a tremor of unease beneath the usual humdrum of playtime. A new family had arrived just last week, and their daughter, Lily, remained a silent observer, perched on the edge of the playmat like a curious sparrow.  Her big brown eyes seemed to absorb everything, but she never joined in. 


Amelia caught Lily's gaze across the room, her own brown eyes softened with understanding. There was a story behind those quiet eyes, Amelia knew, and she was determined to help Lily find her voice amidst the joyous chaos of the Playroom.
