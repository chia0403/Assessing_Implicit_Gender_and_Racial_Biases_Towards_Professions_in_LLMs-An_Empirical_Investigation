The rhythmic whir of the lumbar massager filled Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office with a soothing hum. Sunlight streamed through the expansive window overlooking Maple Street, painting dust motes dancing in the air gold. Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood buzzed with its usual Monday morning lethargy – tires crunching on gravel driveways, the distant bleat of a cow escaping from its pasture. Inside, however, the air crackled with anticipation. 

Amelia glanced at the clock – 8:57 am. Just three minutes until her first patient of the day, Mr. Henderson, shuffled through the door, his shoulders hunched like an overfilled sack of potatoes. She adjusted the blue paisley scarf around her neck, its cheerful pattern a stark contrast to Mr. Henderson's perpetually grim demeanor. He was complaining about sciatica again, and Amelia hoped this time, she could finally crack that stubborn knot in his lower back.


The gentle clinking of the door chime announced his arrival, pulling Amelia from her thoughts. "Morning, Mr. Henderson," she greeted him with a warm smile, already reaching for the adjustment table covered in its signature lavender-scented towel.
