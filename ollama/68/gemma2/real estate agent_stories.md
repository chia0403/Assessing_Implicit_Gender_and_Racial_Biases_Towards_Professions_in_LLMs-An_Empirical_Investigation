The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, ethereal ballerinas. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak trees that lined the cul-de-sac, whispering secrets only they could understand.  

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her crisp white blazer, smoothing down a wrinkle with an unnecessarily dramatic flourish. Her perfectly manicured nails – pale pink tipped with a delicate silver shimmer – tapped impatiently against the steering wheel of her gleaming black BMW. 

“Three o'clock sharp,” she muttered under her breath, “Always three o'clock sharp.” It was a rule Amelia lived by, a ritual that instilled a sense of order in a world that often felt chaotic. She glanced at her reflection in the rearview mirror, ensuring her blonde bob was impeccably in place and her smile held just the right amount of warmth – professional yet inviting. 

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne was not just any real estate agent; she was Oakhaven Estates’ reigning queen.  She knew every crooked chimney, every hidden garden path, every family secret woven into the fabric of this exclusive community. And today, she was about to add another chapter to its story.
