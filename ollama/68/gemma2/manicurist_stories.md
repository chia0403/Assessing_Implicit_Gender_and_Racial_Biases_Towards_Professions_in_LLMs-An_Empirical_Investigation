The air hung heavy with the scent of acetone and lavender as Evelyn "Eve" Juniper expertly filed down the sharp edges of a client's chipped nail.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window of "Juniper & Jade," bathing the small salon in a warm glow. Outside, the bustling energy of downtown Chicago hummed, but inside, Eve's world was confined to the plush red leather chair and the gentle clinking of tools against ceramic. 

Her shop, nestled on a charming cobblestone street between a trendy bookstore and a vintage clothing store, was her sanctuary. A haven from the city's relentless pace, a place where anxieties were soothed by the rhythmic whir of the electric file and stories shared over manicures.  Eve, with her warm smile and penchant for intricate nail art, was known to be a confidante as much as a beautician. But today, even Eve couldn't quite shake a feeling of unease. A prickle at the back of her neck, a lingering sense that something wasn't quite right.
