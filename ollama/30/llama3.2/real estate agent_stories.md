Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and weathered buildings. The air was filled with the sweet scent of saltwater taffy and the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

Inside the bustling real estate office of Coastal Properties, 32-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring blankly at her computer screen. As one of the top agents in town, she had seen it all - from tearful first-time buyers to wealthy investors looking for the perfect investment opportunity.

But despite her success, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The market seemed stagnant, and the few clients she had coming in were all looking for properties with one thing in common: a connection to Ravenswood's troubled past. It started with rumors of an old mansion on the outskirts of town, said to be cursed by the ghost of its former owner, the reclusive millionaire, Malcolm Blackwood.

As Lexi pondered her next move, her phone rang, breaking the silence. It was the office manager, Karen, with a message from the mysterious Mr. Jenkins - a wealthy client who wanted to meet with Lexi in person to discuss a potential listing for his enigmatic estate. Little did Lexi know, this meeting would set off a chain of events that would change her life forever.
