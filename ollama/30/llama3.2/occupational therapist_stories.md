Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air, feeling the familiar tension in her shoulders as she gazed out at the sprawling cityscape before her. As an occupational therapist specializing in pediatric rehabilitation, Lexi was no stranger to the stress of her job – but that didn't mean she enjoyed it. With a deep breath, she shouldered her bag and set off for the hospital, ready to face another day of working with children who were struggling to find their place in a world that often seemed too big and overwhelming.

The setting was a large city hospital, specifically the pediatric rehabilitation unit on the 10th floor. The walls were lined with rows of identical cubicles, each one filled with the sound of beeping machines and the soft chatter of children recovering from illness or injury. Lexi's office was tucked away in one corner, surrounded by framed photos of her own childhood adventures and a few choice mementos from her graduate school days.

As she made her way to the elevator, Lexi's mind began to wander to the day ahead – a meeting with a new family whose child had been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder, followed by a session with one of her current clients who was struggling to master basic motor skills. It promised to be a long and challenging day, but Lexi was ready for it. She took a moment to collect herself before stepping into the elevator, her eyes scanning the familiar floor numbers as she mentally prepared for another day of helping children find their strength and resilience.

How's that? I've given you a sense of Lexi's personality and profession, as well as the setting of her workplace. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
