As the last wisps of sunset faded over the small town of Willow Creek, Dr. Emily Alexandra Wilson made her way back to her quaint veterinary clinic, nestled on the outskirts of town. The sign above the door creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Willow Creek Animal Hospital" in bold letters.

The clinic was a warm and welcoming space, filled with the comforting scent of disinfectant and the soft hum of animal companions waiting for their turn to be seen. Emily had always loved this place, where she could spend her days surrounded by furry friends and helping them heal from illness or injury. As a veterinarian with a passion for holistic care, Emily took pride in providing compassionate treatment that combined traditional medicine with natural remedies.

As she unlocked the door and stepped inside, Emily was greeted by the expectant faces of her patients: a yapping terrier mix named Baxter, a sleek black cat named Midnight, and a scrappy little puppy named Luna. Each one was waiting for their scheduled appointment, or perhaps hoping to sneak in for a quick visit before bedtime.

But today, something felt off. A sense of unease settled in the pit of Emily's stomach as she made her way to the back office to review the day's schedule. The phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking the silence. It was an unfamiliar number, but Emily answered anyway, curiosity getting the better of her.

"Willow Creek Animal Hospital," she said brightly, expecting perhaps a lost pet or a routine inquiry about services.

But instead, a low, gravelly voice spoke on the other end, sending shivers down Emily's spine: "Dr. Wilson, we need to talk."
