Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Canyon, casting a reddish-orange glow over the rugged terrain. Heavy equipment operator, Ryder Jackson "Hawk" Hawkins, sat atop his trusty Caterpillar 345B excavator, surveying the landscape with a practiced eye. The hum of the engine and the creak of the hydraulic system were the only sounds that broke the silence as Hawk surveyed the vast open space.

The canyon was a vast network of canyons, mesas, and rock formations that stretched for miles in every direction. It was a place where only the hardiest of explorers dared to tread, and Hawk knew it like the back of his hand. He had spent countless hours operating equipment on this very ground, digging trenches, hauling ore, and excavating foundations.

Hawk's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of radio crackle coming from his comms device. "Hawk, this is dispatch," a voice said, its tone urgent. "We've got a situation at the old mine site, 3 kilometers due east of your location. Reports are coming in that there's been a cave-in, and we need someone to get out there ASAP."

Without hesitation, Hawk put the excavator into gear and began to move towards the mine site, his mind already racing with plans for what he would find when he arrived.
