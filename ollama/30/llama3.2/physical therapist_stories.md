Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, Physical Therapist at Mercy Hospital, stood in front of the large window of her office, gazing out at the grey morning sky that seemed to match the mood of her patient, Mrs. Jenkins, who lay motionless on the therapy table below. The hospital's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow over the room as Lexi began to review the day's schedule with her team.

The small clinic where she worked was located in a quiet corner of Mercy Hospital, far from the bustling ER and operating rooms that dominated the rest of the building. It was here, among the rusted wheelchairs and worn-out couches, that Lexi spent most of her days helping patients regain their strength and mobility after injuries or surgeries.

As she scanned the day's appointments on her clipboard, a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach. Today was the day Mrs. Jenkins had promised to try out her new prosthetic leg for the first time. Lexi had been working with Mrs. Jenkins since the accident that had left her limb severed below the knee, and she knew firsthand the struggles this woman would face.

But as Lexi turned back to prepare for the session, a knock at the door broke the silence, and a soft voice whispered "Dr. Thompson?" It was her new colleague, Dr. Ryan Lee, with whom she had been assigned to work on a project to develop a new rehabilitation program for patients with spinal cord injuries.

Lexi's instincts told her that something was off about this encounter...
