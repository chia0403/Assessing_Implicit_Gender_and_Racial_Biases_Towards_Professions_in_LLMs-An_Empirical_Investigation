Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City, a grey industrial town nestled between the Appalachian Mountains and the Ohio River. The fog rolled off the water, shrouding the city's crumbling factories and rundown apartment buildings in a damp mist.

In his cramped, smoke-filled office above the deli on Main Street, private detective Julian Sebastian "Jules" Thompson sat at his cluttered desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. His eyes scanned the scattered papers and photographs on the surface, searching for any sign of clues that might crack the latest case he'd been hired for.

At 35, Jules was a seasoned investigator with a reputation for being one of the best in town. A former cop turned private eye after a stint in the Ashwood PD, he had honed his skills on the mean streets of this unforgiving city. His no-nonsense attitude and sharp instincts had earned him a loyal client base, but also made him wary of getting too close to anyone â€“ or anything.

The phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking Jules' reverie. He answered it with a gruff "Thompson." The voice on the other end belonged to his old friend and occasional client, Ruby LaRue, owner of the local jazz club. Her tone was urgent and concerned.

"Jules, I need your help. Again."
