Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Hudson River, shrouding the city in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp cloth. It was 5:00 AM on a chilly autumn morning in New York City, and the streets were already coming alive with the sounds of honking horns and chattering pedestrians.

In a cramped, dimly lit drafting room deep within the bowels of a Manhattan skyscraper, a lone worker stirred from his slumber. His name was Elliot Wintersmith, and he was a skilled drafting worker at the prestigious architecture firm of Smith & Associates. Elliot's eyes fluttered open as the morning light crept through the grimy windows, casting an eerie glow over the rows of dusty drafting tables and scattered papers.

With a groan, Elliot swung his legs over the side of his chair and planted his feet firmly on the ground, feeling the familiar ache in his back from hours spent hunched over the keyboard. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, squinting at the clock on the wall: 5:05 AM. Just another day in the trenches of Manhattan's concrete jungle.
