The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that seemed to lean in towards each other as if sharing a secret. It was a typical morning in April, with a gentle breeze carrying the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers through the air.

In a small workshop tucked away on Raven's Alley, a lone figure stirred from his slumber. His name was Emrys Thomas Wychwood, and he was a stone cutter of some renown in Ravenshire. For years, Emrys had honed his craft under the watchful eye of the town's master mason, learning the intricacies of shaping and polishing the finest granite and sandstone that the countryside had to offer.

As he emerged from his narrow bed, Emrys stretched his lean frame and yawned, revealing a smattering of freckles across his nose. His dark hair was tousled, as if it had been disturbed by a restless night's sleep, and his eyes gleamed with a quiet intensity that hinted at the passion and dedication that drove him to create beauty from raw stone.

With a soft creak, Emrys made his way to the workshop, where a faint scent of lime mortar and freshly cut wood greeted him like an old friend. The day ahead promised to be a busy one, with a commission from the town's church to supply new pillars for their steeple. Emrys had spent hours selecting the finest stone, and now he set to work, his hands moving with a practiced ease as he began to shape and polish the granite into the intricate columns that would soon rise high above the town's rooftops.
