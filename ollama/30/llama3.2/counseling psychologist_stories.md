Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the bustling streets of downtown Manhattan. As a licensed counseling psychologist with a private practice on the Upper West Side, Lexi had seen her fair share of stressed-out clients, but today felt different. Maybe it was the lingering sense of unease that had been plaguing her since the last session of the day, or maybe it was the nagging feeling that she was running out of time to help one of her most troubled patients.

Whatever the reason, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that today would be a day like no other. She had agreed to meet with a new client, a young woman named Sarah who had been struggling with anxiety and depression for months. As Lexi walked to the subway, she felt a sense of trepidation building in her chest. What if this session didn't go as planned? What if Sarah's case was more complex than Lexi had initially thought?

The subway car lurched forward, swallowing up Lexi's doubts in its wake. She settled into her seat and began to review the notes she had taken on Sarah's case, her mind whirling with possibilities and questions. Little did she know that this session would be just the beginning of a journey that would test her skills, challenge her assumptions, and force her to confront some painful truths about herself.

Setting:

The story takes place in downtown Manhattan, specifically on the Upper West Side, where Lexi has a private practice as a counseling psychologist. The setting is autumnal, with crisp air and changing leaves, which adds to the sense of unease and uncertainty that permeates the opening scene.
