Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Registered Nurse Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the worn pavement of the Pioneer Square neighborhood. The neon lights of the bars and clubs that lined the street cast a gaudy glow, a stark contrast to the gloom that had been hanging over the city all day.

Emilia, or Mia as she was known to most of her friends, took a deep breath of the damp air, feeling the stress of her shift at Seattle General Hospital begin to seep out of her pores. She had spent the last eight hours tending to patients with everything from flu bug to heart attacks, and all she wanted now was to head home, pour herself a glass of wine, and forget about the day's trials.

But as she gazed up at the old clock tower that dominated the square, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was different. Tonight felt like more than just another long shift at the hospital - it felt like something was waiting for her, lurking just beyond the edge of town. And with a thrill of anticipation mixed with a dash of fear, she turned to make her way towards the ferry terminal and the darkness that lay ahead.
