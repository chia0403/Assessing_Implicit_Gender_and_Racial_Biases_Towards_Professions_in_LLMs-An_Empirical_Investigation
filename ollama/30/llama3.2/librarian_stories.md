Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a chilly autumn morning in the small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of rural England. The sun had barely risen over the rolling hills, casting a warm golden light over the quaint streets and shops. In the midst of this peaceful scene stood the old library, its stone fa√ßade bearing the weight of centuries of knowledge and stories.

Inside, Emilia Fothergill, the librarian with a passion for dusty tomes and forgotten tales, was already hard at work. Her eyes shone behind wire-rimmed spectacles as she expertly sorted through the morning's batch of donations, her fingers tracing the spines of the books with a mix of excitement and trepidation.

As she worked, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in Willow Creek. The town had always been quiet and predictable, but lately, whispers of strange occurrences had begun to circulate. Books would go missing from the shelves, only to reappear with cryptic notes scrawled in the margins. Some even claimed to have seen ghostly apparitions flitting around the library's labyrinthine corridors at night.

Emilia, with her love of mystery and her sharp mind, felt an inexplicable pull towards unraveling the mystery behind these strange happenings. Little did she know, her life was about to become intertwined with a world of magic, secrets, and ancient tales that would challenge everything she thought she knew about her quiet town.
