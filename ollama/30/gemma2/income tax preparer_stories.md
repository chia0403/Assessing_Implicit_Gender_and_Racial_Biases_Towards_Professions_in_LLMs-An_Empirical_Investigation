The fluorescent lights buzzed above Beatrice "Bea" Amelia Hawthorne's head like a swarm of agitated wasps. Their pallid glow illuminated piles of receipts, W-2 forms, and crumpled 1099s spread across her desk – a battlefield of numbers in her small office, tucked away in the forgotten corner of a strip mall. Outside, the January wind howled, rattling the flimsy windowpane and mimicking the anxiety gnawing at Bea's insides. It was tax season – that three-month period where she donned the mantle of financial savior, sifting through the chaos of other people's finances to ensure they didn't end up owing Uncle Sam a fortune.  This year, though, felt different. An unsettling tremor of dread ran beneath Bea's usually calm exterior. This wasn't just about crunching numbers and filing forms; something whispered in the margins, hinting at a mystery buried deep within the very heart of her clients' stories. 


Bea took a deep breath, steeling herself for the onslaught.  The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her first client – Mr. Harold Jenkins, a retired plumber with a reputation for missing deadlines and hoarding receipts like precious gems. As Harold shuffled in, his face etched with worry lines, Bea knew this was just the beginning. The whispers had grown louder. This tax season, something was about to unravel.
