The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A lone crow cawed from the towering Douglas fir that loomed over Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood, casting long shadows across his weathered boots. Sunlight, filtered through a canopy of emerald leaves, dappled the forest floor where Bart stood, axe resting against his thigh.  A symphony of birdsong filled the morning air, momentarily interrupted by the rasping whine of a chainsaw echoing from the depths of the woods. 

Bart squinted into the sun, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The first day of fall had arrived, bringing with it a crisp chill that promised both beautiful colors and treacherous ground conditions. He hefted the axe, its familiar weight comforting in his hands. It was more than just a tool; it was an extension of himself, a part of him as much as the calloused skin on his palms or the ache in his back after a long day's work. He took a deep breath, savoring the earthy aroma of the forest before taking his first step into the emerald heart of the woods. 


This wasn't just a job for Bart. It was legacy.
