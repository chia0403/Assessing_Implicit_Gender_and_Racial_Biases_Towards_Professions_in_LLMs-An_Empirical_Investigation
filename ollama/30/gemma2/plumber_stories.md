The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan's plumbing van, each drop a miniature explosion in the symphony of noise echoing through his ears.  He gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles white against the worn leather. The storm had rolled in fast, turning the usually bustling Market Street into a churning river of rushing water and overflowing gutters. Visibility was down to mere feet, the streetlights swallowed by the deluge. 

Bart sighed, adjusting his reflection in the rearview mirror. His face, weathered by years under sun and grime, was creased with worry lines that seemed to deepen with every passing storm. He wasn't fond of driving in this weather, but Mrs. Peterson’s call about a burst pipe had been urgent.  “My whole basement is flooded, Mr. Finnegan,” she’d wailed over the phone, “It’s like Niagara Falls down there!” 

Bart glanced at the address on his clipboard: 14 Elm Street, tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood known for its stately Victorian houses. He hoped Mrs. Peterson wasn't exaggerating about the flooding. He already felt like he was wading through an ocean just trying to get there.
