The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in Silas Bartholomew's Butcher Shoppe. Sunlight, filtered through grime-coated windows, cast dusty motes dancing in the swirling vapor rising from the hanging carcasses.  

Silas, his apron stained crimson and smelling faintly of sawdust and tallow, stood hunched over a slab of prime rib, his weathered hands expertly separating muscle from bone with a practiced grace born of years spent wielding cleavers and carving knives. The rhythmic thud of his hammer against the bone echoed through the narrow shop, punctuated by the occasional grunt of exertion. 

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Ashcroft were bustling with life - merchants hawking wares, children chasing pigeons, gossiping housewives lingering at doorways. But inside Silas's shoppe, time seemed to move slower, governed by the patient rhythm of his work and the solemn silence of the butchered beasts.
