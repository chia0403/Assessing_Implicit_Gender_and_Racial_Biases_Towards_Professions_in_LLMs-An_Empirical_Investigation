The whine of the jackhammer echoed across the dusty expanse of the Half Moon Bay excavation site, a jarring counterpoint to the cries of gulls circling overhead.  Sweat dripped from Bartholomew “Bart” Finchley’s brow, stinging his eyes as he braced against the tremor in his bones. It was barely eight in the morning and already the air felt thick with humidity and dust. 

Bart squinted at the glint of sunlight reflecting off something embedded in the earth before him. He wiped his forehead with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his sun-beaten skin. A sliver of metal, perhaps? Or could it be… he knelt cautiously, brush aside the loose soil and reveal a smooth, obsidian surface. It was like nothing Bart had ever seen before.
