Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eleanor Vivienne Pierce’s studio apartment, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The city lights blurred into an impressionistic smear through the downpour, reflecting in the glazed eyes staring back at her from the screen. It was 2:37 am, and the "deadline looming" notification on her laptop glowed accusingly, a stark reminder of her self-imposed purgatory. Eleanor wasn't just behind schedule, she was drowning in a sea of client revisions for a campaign for a new organic kombucha brand - a seemingly innocuous project that had become an existential crisis disguised as pixel placement and font choice. 

Her studio, perched on the fifth floor of a pre-war building with peeling paint and creaky floorboards, felt more like a prison cell than a haven. Posters advertising past projects – a vibrant mural for a local bakery, a minimalist logo for a tech startup – mocked her from the walls. Now, all she saw was another blank canvas, this one demanding the impossible.
