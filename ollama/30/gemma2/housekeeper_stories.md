The air hung thick with lavender and lemon polish in the grand entryway of Blackwood Manor. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating motes dancing in the dust that clung stubbornly to every surface. It was Agatha Thistlewood's least favorite time of day â€“ the pre-breakfast calm before the storm of activity descended upon the manor. She adjusted her spectacles, a glint of steel catching the light, and surveyed the scene with a critical eye. A stray feather lay on the Persian rug near the grand staircase, a testament to the recent visit of Lord Blackwood's pet parrot, Percy, who had a penchant for shedding plumage at inopportune moments. 

Agatha Thistlewood, a woman of formidable efficiency and unwavering loyalty, knew this house like the back of her hand. Every creak of the floorboards, every ticking clock, held a story for those willing to listen. She'd worked here since she was a girl, rising from scullery maid to housekeeper, earning the respect of the Blackwood family through years of quiet dedication and an iron will that could rival any butler. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Agatha's spine, whispering of a disruption in the usual order, a shadow lurking beneath the surface of the familiar routine. It was just a feeling, she told herself, dismissing it as nerves. Still, Agatha couldn't shake the sensation that the day promised to be anything but ordinary.
