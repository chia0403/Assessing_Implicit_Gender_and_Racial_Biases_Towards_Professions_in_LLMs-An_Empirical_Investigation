The air in the shack hummed with static, a constant companion to Elias Thorne's work. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee through the skeletal pines surrounding his isolated cabin, nestled deep in the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. Inside, however, the faint glow of the oscilloscope and the rhythmic click of Morse code keys provided a comforting sense of order amidst the chaos. 

Elias, with grease smeared across his weathered forehead and calloused fingers twitching impatiently over a tangle of wires, squinted at the screen. The signal was weak, barely a whisper against the background noise. It could be anything â€“ a distressed fisherman, a lost hiker, or just another rogue transmission from a forgotten satellite. 

Elias Thorne wasn't a man who enjoyed ambiguity. He craved clarity, order, the satisfying click of a correctly soldered connection. This signal, however, felt different. There was something about its erratic pulse, its fleeting whispers in an unknown language, that tugged at him like a forgotten dream.


He adjusted the tuning knob, his heart quickening with each imperceptible shift in the static. It wouldn't be long now. He could feel it.
