The polished marble floor hummed beneath Amelia Celeste's heels as she swept through the grand foyer of The Grandview Hotel. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like miniature constellations.  A symphony of hushed conversations and clinking china drifted from the adjacent dining room, mingling with the gentle rustle of silk gowns gliding down the sweeping staircase.

Amelia, her dark hair pulled back into a neat bun, surveyed the scene with practiced ease. She was the concierge at The Grandview – a bastion of luxury nestled in the heart of Paris, where every guest's whim was met with impeccable service and an air of effortless elegance. But beneath the veneer of sophistication, Amelia sensed a tremor. A subtle shift in the atmosphere, a prickling unease that whispered of secrets lurking beneath the polished surface. 


This morning, she had noticed it first in Mrs. Dubois’ frantic whisper as she requested a room change – claiming "things were moving" in her current suite.  Then, there was Mr. Moreau's unusual request for an old book on Parisian folklore – a title rarely sought by guests at The Grandview. And now, the faint scent of lilac lingered in the air, an aroma Amelia recognized as belonging to Madame LeClerc – a celebrated psychic who had disappeared from the hotel last week without a trace.

Amelia knew that Paris held a thousand hidden stories, both beautiful and terrifying. But something told her that this time, the secrets whispered at The Grandview were about to come alive.
