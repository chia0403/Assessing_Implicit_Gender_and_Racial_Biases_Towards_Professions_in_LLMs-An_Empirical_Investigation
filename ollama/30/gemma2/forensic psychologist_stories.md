The flickering neon sign of the "Blue Moon Diner" cast a sickly green glow across Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  It was 3:17 AM, a time best reserved for insomniacs and criminals, and Amelia found herself squarely in the latter category. The diner's greasy spoon ambiance did little to soothe her frayed nerves; she needed coffee, answers, and preferably not another existential crisis before dawn.

Amelia adjusted the brim of her fedora, its shadow obscuring the exhaustion etched into her features.  The case file lay open on the table beside her, illuminated by the harsh glare of a diner lamp. It detailed the brutal murder of a young artist named Leo Vance, his vibrant canvases splattered with crimson that mirrored the violence in his final moments. The police had found no leads, and Amelia, renowned for her ability to delve into the darkest recesses of the human mind, was their last hope. 

The diner's bell chimed as a lone figure entered, shaking water from a tattered umbrella. He was tall, with a lean frame that seemed swallowed by a threadbare coat. His eyes, hidden behind thick glasses, darted nervously around the room before settling on Amelia. A chill ran down her spine; she felt like she was being watched, scrutinized. 


The setting:  

A small, rundown diner in an equally run-down part of Chicago, late at night. Rain lashes against the windows, blurring the neon signs and casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt outside. The air inside is thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying grease, and despair.
