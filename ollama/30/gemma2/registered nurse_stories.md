The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was Clara Evangeline Beaumont's lullaby. She knew its melody by heart - the steady pulse, the occasional blip that sent a jolt through her, reminding her of the fragility she held in her hands every shift. The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood and the faintly sweet aroma of antiseptic wipes. Clara moved with practiced grace through the dimly lit room of Room 307, her footsteps barely disturbing the hushed silence.  

Her patient, Mr. Alistair Finch, lay still beneath a thin sheet, his chest rising and falling with each shallow breath. His face, pale and etched with worry lines, was hidden behind a tangle of white bandages, the remnants of a particularly nasty car accident he'd been in just yesterday. 


Clara leaned over him, her gloved hand resting lightly on his arm. "How are you feeling, Mr. Finch?" she asked softly, her voice barely audible above the hum of the machines. His eyes fluttered open, revealing a flicker of pain and fear beneath their hazy blue depths.
