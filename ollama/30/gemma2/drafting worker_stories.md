The air hung thick with the scent of graphite and cheap coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to Elara Nightingale like a second skin. She hunched over her drafting table, the glow of the gas lamp reflecting in the sharp curve of her cheekbones. Her fingers danced across the vellum, tracing intricate lines and filling in meticulous measurements for the new wing of the Royal Observatory. Outside, the city of Aethelhum thrummed with life â€“ a symphony of clattering carriages, hawkers' calls, and the distant hum of unseen industry. But here, in her cramped attic workshop, Elara found solace in the quiet precision of her work.  

Elara wasn't born to be a draftsman. She dreamed of grander things - of soaring through the clouds on airships, exploring uncharted territories, charting the celestial dance of stars and planets. But fate, as it often did, had other plans. Her father, a renowned astronomer himself, had died tragically in a laboratory accident when she was just a child. With her mother struggling to make ends meet, Elara took up his mantle, pouring all her unfulfilled dreams into the meticulous drawings that brought her small comfort and a modicum of financial security.
