The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending thunderstorms as Amelia Rose Beaumont surveyed the cluttered living room.  Sunlight filtered through dusty windows, casting long shadows on mismatched furniture draped in faded floral sheets. A lone ceramic cat perched precariously on a wobbly bookshelf, its chipped ear mirroring the state of this charming, but clearly neglected, Victorian home. 

Amelia sighed. This was her third listing in this historic district in just as many weeks, and each one seemed to be more dilapidated than the last. Yet, there was something about these aging houses, with their crooked window panes and peeling paint, that drew her in. They whispered stories of past lives, of families who had laughed and cried within their walls. 

She ran a hand over the rough wood banister, imagining children racing up and down the stairs, their laughter echoing through the halls. Perhaps this home could find its voice again, she mused, with a little TLC.  Amelia adjusted her straw hat, feeling a surge of optimism.  It was time to bring some life back into these forgotten corners of Savannah.
