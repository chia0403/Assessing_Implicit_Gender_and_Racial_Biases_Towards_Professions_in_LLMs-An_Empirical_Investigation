The sun beat down on Elias “Eli” MacAllister’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, sweat plastering his faded blue work shirt to his back. He squinted through the haze, watching the ribbon of asphalt shimmer in the distance, its surface reflecting the merciless glare of the midday sun. Around him, the Nevada desert stretched out in an endless expanse of ochre sand and scrub brush, punctuated only by the occasional gnarled Joshua tree clawing at the sky. 

Eli wiped his brow with a grimy sleeve, then took another swig from his thermos, the lukewarm coffee offering little solace against the oppressive heat. He scanned the horizon again, searching for any sign of movement beyond the dust devils swirling in the distance. It was always this way on Highway 95 – desolate and unforgiving, a constant reminder of how utterly insignificant he felt against the vastness of it all.  


He sighed, a plume of dust rising from his lips, and adjusted his tool belt. Another long day ahead, another mile of asphalt to repair, another fleeting moment in the endless tapestry of time woven across this harsh, beautiful landscape.
