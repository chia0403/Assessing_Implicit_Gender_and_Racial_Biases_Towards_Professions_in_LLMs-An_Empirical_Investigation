The opulent Grand Belvedere Hotel smelled like old money and lemon polish. It was the kind of place where champagne flutes were perpetually filled and gossip flowed as freely as the chilled Sauvignon Blanc.  

Elias "Eli" Blackwood, a lanky young man with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair perpetually falling into his face, navigated the marble halls with practiced ease. He knew the ins and outs of this building like the back of his hand, from the worn patches on the Persian rugs to the hidden service elevator that only he used after midnight. Eli was a bellhop, but in the Grand Belvedere, even a bellhop could be an unwitting participant in a grand, messy human drama. 


His shift was just beginning, and already the air buzzed with anticipation. A new guest had arrived - a mysterious woman who checked in under the alias "Madame Celeste," requesting the penthouse suite and absolute anonymity. Eli felt a shiver run down his spine. There was something about Madame Celeste that made him uneasy, something in her steely gaze and the way she carried herself like a coiled spring. He couldn't shake the feeling that this arrival would change everything at the Grand Belvedere.
