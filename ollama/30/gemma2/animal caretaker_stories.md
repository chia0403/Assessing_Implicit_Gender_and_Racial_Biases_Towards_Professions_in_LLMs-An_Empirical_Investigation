The air hung thick with the scent of hay and manure, a symphony of clucking, squeaking, and mooing filling Elara Nightingale's ears. Her boots crunched on the gravel path as she made her rounds through the sprawling barn, her worn leather gloves carefully examining each stall. The early morning sun slanted through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the slumbering animals.

Elara, a young woman with freckled cheeks and hair perpetually escaping from its braid, knew every creature here by name. She'd grown up on this farm, her life intertwined with the rhythms of the seasons and the needs of the animals. From the skittish goats to the majestic Clydesdale horses, she treated them all with a gentle hand and unwavering devotion.

Today, however, a gnawing unease sat in her stomach. Something felt off. The usually boisterous rooster had been unusually quiet, and Mrs. Peabody's prize-winning sow seemed listless, refusing her breakfast. Elara pushed these thoughts aside, reminding herself that sometimes animals just needed a little extra care and attention. But as she rounded the corner into the chicken coop, her heart lurched.
