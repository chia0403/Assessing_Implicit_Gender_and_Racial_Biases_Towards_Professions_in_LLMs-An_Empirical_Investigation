The scent of jasmine and burnt sugar clung to Dr. Evelyn Grace’s linen shirt as she pushed open the door to her seaside office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  A gentle breeze carried the mournful cry of gulls from the rocky shore just beyond the garden patio. The rhythmic lull of waves crashing against the cliffs provided a soothing backdrop to the day's appointments. 

Evelyn smoothed down her unruly auburn curls and took a deep breath, savoring the calming aroma of salt air mixed with the herbal tea steeping in her kitchen corner. It was always easier to face the often-turbulent emotions of her patients when surrounded by this serene coastal haven.  She glanced at the clock – 9:00 am sharp.  Her first appointment of the day, a young woman named Amelia struggling with anxiety and social phobia, would be here soon. Evelyn hoped today’s session would bring Amelia some relief from the storm raging within her.
