The air hung thick with diesel fumes and the smell of sunbaked earth.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, their swirling forms barely distinguishable from the hazy mirages shimmering on the horizon. The relentless Nevada sun beat down on Delphine "Del" Mallory's neck as she gripped the controls of her D9 Caterpillar bulldozer, its massive tracks churning through the dry clay with a low, guttural growl.

Del loved pushing dirt, shaping the earth with her machine. It was hard work, demanding physical strength and mental focus, but she found a strange peace in the rhythm of the engine, the scrape of metal on rock, the satisfaction of seeing the land transformed by her own hand. 


But today, something felt different. The oppressive heat seemed to press down on Del like an invisible weight, and a gnawing unease coiled in her stomach. A feeling she couldn't quite place, but one that whispered of danger lurking just beyond the horizon.
