The flickering neon sign cast an oily sheen across Evangeline "Evie" Celeste's worn leather boots as she waited outside The Velvet Moon. Rain hammered against the cracked pavement, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst of light from the streetlamp above. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, a familiar aroma to Evie after months spent navigating the grimy underbelly of Chicago's music scene.  

She gripped her worn guitar case tighter, its worn leather cold against her palm. Inside, nestled among layers of worn velvet, lay not just her instrument, but her dreams - each strummed chord a plea for recognition, a whisper into the deafening silence of an indifferent city. Tonight, however, felt different. A spark of nervous energy thrummed beneath her skin. This wasn't just another open mic night at The Velvet Moon, this was her chance.  A chance to prove she was more than just another hopeful lost in the city's labyrinthine shadows.
