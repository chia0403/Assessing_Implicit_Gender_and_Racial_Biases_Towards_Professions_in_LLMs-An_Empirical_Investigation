The faint scent of stale coffee hung in the air, mingling with the whispery rustle of documents being shuffled across her desk.  Amelia Grace Everly tapped her pen against the worn surface, counting the seconds until Mrs. Henderson would grace her office with her presence. It was 9:57 a.m., precisely seven minutes past their scheduled meeting time. Amelia, as always, had prepped everything: the agenda neatly printed and bound, the conference room table cleared of any clutter, and a pot of freshly brewed tea awaiting Mrs. Henderson's discerning palate.

The office was located on the sixth floor of the imposing Zenith Building, a granite monolith that dominated the city skyline. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across Amelia's tidy workspace. The view from her window was breathtaking: a panorama of bustling streets, towering buildings, and the glittering expanse of the harbour. But Amelia rarely had time to appreciate it. Her world was confined to this small office, a sanctuary of routine and order amidst the chaos of Mrs. Henderson's demanding schedule.
