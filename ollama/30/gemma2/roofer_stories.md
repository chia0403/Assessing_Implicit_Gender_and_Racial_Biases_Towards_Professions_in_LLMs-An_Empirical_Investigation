The humid Georgia air clung to Elias "Eli" Blackwood like a damp shroud as he hoisted another bundle of shingles onto the roof. Sweat trickled down his forehead, mingling with grime from the day's work.  He squinted at the rising sun, its glare reflected off the shiny metal siding of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian home. 

The old lady's house was a beauty, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town of Harmony Creek. Eli respected her stubborn refusal to sell when developers had come sniffing around, offering fortunes for her land. Harmony Creek wasn't much, but it held memories, and Mrs. Henderson wouldn't trade them for all the money in the world. Eli understood that sentiment.  He knew what it meant to hold onto something precious, even when the weight of it threatened to crush you. 


Eli took a swig from his canteen, the lukewarm water doing little to quench his thirst. Harmony Creek was beautiful, nestled between rolling hills and whispering pines, but summer in Georgia was a beast. One that demanded respect, hard work, and an endless supply of iced tea.
