The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the city skyline outside into an impressionistic watercolour of greys and blues. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous sweat. Eleanor sat across from Liam Gallagher, his fidgeting hands betraying the carefully constructed composure on his face.  He wore a suit that seemed too big for him, as if he'd shrunk into it under the weight of whatever turmoil brought him to her door. 

"So, Liam," Eleanor began, her voice soft but firm, "you said you wanted to talk about your nightmares."


The rain outside intensified, each drop a tiny hammer against the glass, mirroring the unease churning within the confines of Dr. Vance’s office.
