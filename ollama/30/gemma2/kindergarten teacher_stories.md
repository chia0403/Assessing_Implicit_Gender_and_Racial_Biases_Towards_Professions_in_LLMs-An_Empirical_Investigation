The scent of crayons, hand sanitizer, and something vaguely resembling burnt sugar hung heavy in the air as Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne surveyed her domain. Her tiny classroom, affectionately nicknamed "Miss Amy's Rainbow Room" by its four-year-old inhabitants, was a whirlwind of activity just moments before the morning bell had summoned them to their circle time.  Now, it sat in a state of organized chaos: half-finished finger painting masterpieces lay drying on the tables, a rogue stuffed unicorn peered out from beneath a tower of blocks, and a single glitter glue-covered shoe rested forlornly by the doorway. 

The day, Amelia knew, was about to begin its usual joyful descent into pandemonium.  And she wouldn't have it any other way.
