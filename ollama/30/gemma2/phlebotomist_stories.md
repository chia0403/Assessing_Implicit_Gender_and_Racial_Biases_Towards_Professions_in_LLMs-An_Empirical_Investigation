The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room. A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, mingling with the scent of antiseptic and desperation.  Amelia leaned back against the counter, her posture stiff from hours spent hunched over drawing blood. The clinic was perpetually understaffed, leaving her juggling patient intake, administering basic first aid, and occasionally even fielding phone calls while trying to keep a steady hand for the next vein prick.

Today was particularly chaotic. A flu bug had swept through the local school, turning the waiting room into a haven of sniffles, coughs, and weary parents.  Amelia watched as Mrs. Ramirez struggled to keep her feverish toddler from kicking at the nurse’s station. Another young boy sat slumped in a chair, his face pale and clammy, clutching his mother’s hand with a white-knuckled grip.

Amelia sighed, pushing back a strand of unruly auburn hair that kept falling into her eyes. She glanced at the clock: 3:47 pm. Her shift ended in fifteen minutes, but she knew it would be another half hour before the last patient was seen. Another sigh escaped her lips. Being a phlebotomist wasn't glamorous, but someone had to do it. And Amelia Hawthorne, despite the weariness etched on her face, was determined to see each patient through, one prick at a time.
