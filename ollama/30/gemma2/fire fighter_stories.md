The acrid scent of smoke clung to Elias Thorne's uniform like a second skin. He stood on the curb, his helmet tucked under his arm, watching plumes of black smoke billow from the third-story window of Mrs. Peterson's antique shop. The once quaint brick building now resembled a blackened maw, its facade crumbling under the assault of flames.  

Elias, a veteran firefighter with Station 17, had seen his share of blazes over the past fifteen years. But this one felt different. There was an unsettling silence hanging in the air amidst the chaos, a stillness that prickled at his senses. He scanned the street â€“ no frantic cries for help, no rushing paramedics, just the murmur of confused onlookers and the distant wail of approaching sirens. 

Elias tightened his grip on his axe. Something wasn't right. The scene was too eerily calm, the flames too focused, as if controlled by an unseen hand. A shiver ran down his spine, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the heat radiating from the inferno before him.
