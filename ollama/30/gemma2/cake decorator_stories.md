The air in "Sugar & Spice" bakery was thick with the scent of vanilla, almond extract, and simmering buttercream.  Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating dust motes dancing above rows upon rows of brightly colored frosting tubs and sprinkles that resembled miniature galaxies. 

Elara Beatrice Davenport, her auburn braids pulled back in a neat bun, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. A half-finished three-tiered wedding cake sat cooling on a marble countertop – a delicate masterpiece adorned with sugar roses and cascading lilies, destined for Mrs. Hawthorne's daughter's big day. Elara was known for her intricate designs and meticulous attention to detail, her cakes works of edible art that made her the envy of every baker in town.

It was small, unassuming, and utterly devoid of any embellishment.  Yet, for some reason, it hummed with an unsettling energy that made Elara’s fingers itch to start sculpting.


This ordinary cake held the potential for something extraordinary, she knew. But what?
