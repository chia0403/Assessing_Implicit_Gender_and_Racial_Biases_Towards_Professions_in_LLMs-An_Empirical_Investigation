The morning air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain as Dr. Amelia Rosalind Thornton adjusted her white coat, its crispness a stark contrast to the humid Charleston air. She surveyed her practice, "Thornton's Teeth," a charming brick building nestled between a quaint antique shop and a bustling bakery on King Street. 

Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the polished wooden floors. The waiting room was quiet, save for the gentle tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging rhythmically like a metronome marking the passage of time. 


Amelia took a deep breath, smoothing down her auburn hair that escaped its neatly pinned bun. She was about to embark on another day filled with drilling, filling, and soothing anxieties â€“  the daily dance of a dentist in a historic city where charm met chaos.
