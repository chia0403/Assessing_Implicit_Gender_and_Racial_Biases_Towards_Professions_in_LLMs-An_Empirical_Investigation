The air in the quarry hung thick with the scent of dust and damp earth.  Sunbeams, fractured by the dense canopy of evergreen trees overhead, cast shimmering, dappled patterns on the rough-hewn floor of Elara Stonehaven’s workshop. It was a cramped space, carved out from the heart of the mountain itself, its walls still bearing the rough marks of the chisel and hammer.  Elara herself was hunched over her workbench, her brow furrowed in concentration as she carefully honed a blade, her movements precise and practiced after years spent shaping stone into art. The rhythmic rasping of the file against steel mingled with the distant thrumming of the quarry, a constant symphony that had been the soundtrack to Elara's life since she was a child.


This wasn't just any workshop, though.  It was nestled deep within Mount Veridia, a peak known for its unique, iridescent stones – each one holding within it a whisper of magic. It was here that Elara honed her skill, crafting intricate ornaments and powerful talismans, each piece imbued with the mountain's ancient power.
