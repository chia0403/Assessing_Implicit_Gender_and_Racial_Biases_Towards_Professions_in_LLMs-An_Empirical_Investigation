The smell of burnt toast hit Amelia Willowwood first, followed by the shriek of a particularly irate toddler. It was 7:15 AM, precisely five minutes before the rest of the Sugarplum Daycare crew arrived, and Amelia's Monday morning had already started with a bang. She peeked into the kitchen, where little Timmy Thompson stood triumphantly beside the blackened remains of his "breakfast toast," which looked more like charcoal briquettes.

The daycare itself was housed in a rambling Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Maple Creek, a town perpetually stuck in autumn.  Sunbeams, filtering through dusty stained glass windows, illuminated colorful patches on the worn carpet of the main playroom. A tattered parachute hung limply from the ceiling, and a collection of half-finished finger paintings adorned the walls like cheerful abstract art. Outside, the wind rustled the crimson leaves clinging to the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the manicured lawn. 

Amelia sighed. This wasn't how she envisioned her day going. She'd hoped to spend it reading stories and playing dress-up with the younger children, not putting out fires - metaphorical or otherwise. But as always, Sugarplum Daycare had a way of throwing curveballs, and Amelia was determined to meet them head-on, one burnt toast incident at a time.
