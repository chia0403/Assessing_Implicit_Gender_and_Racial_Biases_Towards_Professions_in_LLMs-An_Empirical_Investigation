The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven with whispers of chamomile and eucalyptus. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains, dappling Amelia Celeste’s bare arms as she kneaded into her client’s tense shoulders. A sigh, almost a sob, escaped the woman's lips, a testament to Amelia's skill. This was Amelia’s sanctuary, "The Tranquil Touch," nestled in a quiet corner of Asheville, North Carolina. Mountains rose like slumbering giants beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, their peaks shrouded in wispy morning mist.  

Amelia loved her work. It wasn’t just about the physical relief she provided; it was about being a silent witness to people's stories, their unspoken anxieties and hidden joys unfolding beneath her hands. But today, Amelia felt a knot of unease tightening in her own chest. Something was different. The air felt charged with an energy that didn't belong to the usual soothing atmosphere of her practice.  She couldn’t quite place it, but a sense of foreboding lingered, as if the tranquility she so carefully cultivated was about to be shattered.
