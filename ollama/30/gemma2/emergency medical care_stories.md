The acrid smell of smoke clung to Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne's scrubs like a stubborn shadow.  It was a scent she'd grown accustomed to in her five years as an EMT, a constant reminder of the chaos and fragility of life that she navigated on a daily basis. This time, though, the smoke wasn't just background noise. It swirled around her ankles, a thick grey curtain concealing the source of the emergency call. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the abandoned warehouse district in Baltimore, painting the crumbling brick buildings in hues of burnt orange and deep purple. A lone streetlamp flickered erratically, casting an unsettling dance of light and shadow on the cracked pavement. The air, thick with the smell of smoke and decay, was eerily still, broken only by the distant wail of a siren echoing through the deserted streets.  


Amy took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. She could hear the anxious chatter of her partner, Michael, over their comms. They were both rookies on this shift, fresh out of training and thrust into a world where split-second decisions could mean life or death. But Amy wouldn't let fear paralyze her. 


She pulled her flashlight from its holster, the beam cutting through the smoky haze as she cautiously stepped forward, ready to face whatever lay beyond the veil of smoke.
