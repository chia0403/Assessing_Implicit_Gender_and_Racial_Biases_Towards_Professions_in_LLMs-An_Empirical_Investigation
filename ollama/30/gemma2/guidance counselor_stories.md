The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor.  A faint scent of stale coffee and teenage desperation hung in the air. This was the reality of Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont's life - Guidance Counselor at Bayview High, where the pressures of college applications often overshadowed the simple joys of adolescence.

She sighed, knowing that today's pile wouldn't be the last. The bell would ring soon, ushering in another wave of students seeking her counsel, each one carrying their own unique story waiting to be told. 


Eleanor glanced at the clock, a sliver of sunlight slicing through the blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. 
It was almost time.
