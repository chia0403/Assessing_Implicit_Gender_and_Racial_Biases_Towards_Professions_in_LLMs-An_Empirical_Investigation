The sun bled across the horizon, painting the dusty mesas in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple.  Crows cawed their morning lament from atop weathered fence posts, their harsh cries echoing across the sprawling expanse of Double Diamond Ranch. Silas Jebediah Thorne squinted at the rising sun, his calloused hands gripping the chipped enamel mug of lukewarm coffee tighter. The Arizona air, already thick with the promise of a scorching day, tugged at his worn Stetson as he surveyed his kingdom. 

Silas had inherited Double Diamond from his grandfather, a gruff man whoâ€™d lived and died by the rhythm of the land. The ranch wasn't thriving, not like it used to. Drought lingered, cattle prices were plummeting, and whispers about selling up were swirling like dust devils in the dry wind. But Silas wouldn't hear of it. This land was in his blood, etched into his soul as surely as the barbed wire fence snaking through its valleys. He would fight for Double Diamond, tooth and nail.
