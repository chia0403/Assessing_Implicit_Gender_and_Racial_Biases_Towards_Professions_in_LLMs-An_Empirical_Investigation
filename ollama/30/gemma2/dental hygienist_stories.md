The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of blood – not hers, thankfully – that clung to the back of Elara Juniper's throat.  

Elara hated Wednesdays. It was always the busiest day at Pinewood Dental, and today was no exception. The waiting room buzzed with anxious patients clutching appointment cards, a cacophony of coughs and sniffles filling the air. Sunlight streamed through the large picture window, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the warm haze. Elara sighed, adjusting her blue scrubs and steeling herself for another day of scraping plaque and probing gums. 

Her gaze fell on Dr. Thompson's reflection in the polished stainless steel tray – a perpetually furrowed brow over his wire-rimmed glasses, looking like he was constantly wrestling with an unwelcome toothache of his own.  He waved her over, his expression grim. "Juniper," he said, his voice gruff, "We've got a situation in room three." 


This wasn't going to be just another Wednesday.
