The mahogany conference table gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the anxious faces gathered around it. A faint scent of stale coffee and desperation hung in the air. Amelia "Amy" Brighton-Jones, CEO of Brighton Industries, tapped her pen against the polished surface, a whirlwind of worry churning behind her usually composed blue eyes.

It had been her father's office before him, and his father before that. Three generations of Brightons had built this company, brick by meticulously negotiated brick. But now, with quarterly reports dwindling and whispers of a hostile takeover swirling through the financial press, Amy felt a cold knot of fear tightening in her chest.  This meeting wasn't about progress; it was about survival.
