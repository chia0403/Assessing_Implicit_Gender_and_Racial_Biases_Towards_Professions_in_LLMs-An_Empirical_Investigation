The frigid air bit at Sergeant Elara Thorne's exposed cheeks, turning her breath to ephemeral puffs of white that vanished into the swirling snow. Above, the Citadel loomed, a monolithic structure of cold obsidian against the bruised twilight sky. Her breath hitched as she scanned the desolate landscape; the biting wind whipped around her, carrying whispers of something both ancient and unsettling. 

Elara tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword, its familiar weight grounding her. The snow-dusted plains of Eredon stretched before her, a seemingly endless expanse broken only by the occasional gnarled tree, skeletal and stripped bare by winter's relentless grasp.  Tonight, the silence felt heavier than usual, pregnant with an ominous anticipation that prickled at the back of Elara's neck. A shiver ran down her spine, unrelated to the cold. The border between civilization and the encroaching wilderness was thin here, and tonight, it felt dangerously frayed. 


The first rays of dawn were beginning to paint the eastern horizon a pale lavender when the scoutâ€™s frantic cry tore through the stillness.
