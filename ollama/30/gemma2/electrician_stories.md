The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt insulation.  Sparks showered down like a miniature fireworks display as Elijah "Eli" Stone wrestled with the overloaded wiring in Mrs. Patterson's attic. Dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through the grimy skylight, illuminating cobwebs strung like macabre decorations. Eli, his brow furrowed in concentration, swore under his breath for the fifth time. This wasn't just a faulty circuit; it was a tangled mess of haphazard additions and ancient wiring that looked like it had been installed by a pack of squirrels on caffeine.

Eli lived and breathed electricity. He understood its hum, its pulse, its potential for both creation and destruction. But even he felt intimidated by this attic labyrinth. The old house, perched precariously on the edge of town, seemed to resist his every move, its creaking timbers groaning with disapproval as he climbed deeper into its belly. 


**Setting:**

A dilapidated Victorian mansion in a small, forgotten town nestled on the edge of a vast, rolling plain.  The town itself is struggling economically, with many homes showing signs of neglect and decay. The house Mrs. Patterson lives in sits at the very edge of town, bordering on abandoned land where wildflowers push through cracks in the pavement.
