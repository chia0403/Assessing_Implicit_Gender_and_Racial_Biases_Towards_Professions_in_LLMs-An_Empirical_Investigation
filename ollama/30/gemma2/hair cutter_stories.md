The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and freshly brewed coffee as Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses. She surveyed the clutter of her salon â€“ "Beatrice's Bows" -  with a practiced eye. A stray bobby pin glinted on the dusty floor, a rainbow of hair clips lay forgotten on a shelf, and a half-finished tapestry depicting a unicorn wearing a top hat hung crookedly on the wall. Amelia sighed. It was a charming mess, just like her clientele in the quirky seaside town of Seabrook. 

Seabrook wasn't exactly bustling with high fashion or celebrity clients. But Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything. Her regulars were a colorful bunch - weathered fishermen with salt-and-pepper beards, giggling grannies with sky-high perms, and even the occasional eccentric artist sporting hair that defied gravity. Today was just another day in paradise, until the doorbell chimed, announcing a visitor Amelia hadn't expected. A woman entered, draped in black from head to toe, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  Her air of mystery sent a shiver down Amelia's spine - this wasn't a regular Seabrook resident.
