The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Eleanor Vance’s cluttered office. Stacks of file folders leaned precariously against overflowing shelves, their spines whispering tales of anxieties, traumas, and childhood struggles. Outside, the late afternoon sun painted the windows a warm orange, but within these walls, the air remained thick with unspoken worries. 

Eleanor sat at her desk, reviewing Ms. Rodriguez's referral for ten-year-old Gabriel Martinez. "Aggressive behavior," it read, "difficulty focusing, withdrawal from peers." A familiar knot tightened in Eleanor’s chest.  These were the whispers of a soul struggling, and she was tasked with deciphering their meaning.  Gabriel’s case, however, felt different, imbued with an unsettling undercurrent that sent a shiver down her spine. It wasn't just the words on the page; it was something else, a silent echo in the stillness of the room. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, pushed the file aside, and reached for her mug of lukewarm tea.  Time to listen. Time to unravel the story hidden behind Gabriel’s silence.
