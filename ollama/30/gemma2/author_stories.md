The salty tang of the Pacific air whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's hair across her face as she perched on the rickety wooden balcony overlooking the churning ocean. Below, waves crashed against the shore, their white foam mimicking the flurry of anxieties swirling in her stomach. 

Amelia was a novelist, though lately "novelist" felt like a grandiose title for someone who hadn't finished a single draft in months. Her last book, a sweeping historical romance set in Victorian London, had been a critical darling, but its success had also become a crushing weight. How could she possibly live up to the expectations of her readers, let alone surpass the magic of that first story? 

Her rented cottage on the craggy coast of Oregon was supposed to be her sanctuary, a place where inspiration would flow freely and her words would dance across the page. But the vastness of the ocean seemed to mirror the emptiness in her soul, and the crashing waves only amplified the silence in her head.
