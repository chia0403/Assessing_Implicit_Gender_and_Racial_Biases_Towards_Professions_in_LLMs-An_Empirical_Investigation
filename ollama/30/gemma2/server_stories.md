The clatter of forks against ceramic plates was like a metronome keeping time with the anxious hum in Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's chest.  She balanced three steaming platters – one laden with blackened salmon, another overflowing with creamy mashed potatoes, and the last piled high with glistening green beans – her hands slick with sweat despite the frigid air conditioning that blasted from the vents above. The aroma of garlic, rosemary, and butter clung to the air like a comforting shroud, yet Ellie couldn't quite shake the feeling of impending doom that had settled over her since she’d clocked in for her shift at “The Rusty Anchor”  

The restaurant, a once-vibrant seafood joint tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina, was now perpetually shrouded in an aura of faded grandeur. Its charm had been swallowed whole by dust and neglect, leaving behind chipped paint, worn linoleum floors, and an ambiance that whispered of better days. The clientele tonight seemed to reflect the restaurant’s decline – a handful of regulars nursing half-empty glasses of beer at their usual corner table, and a solitary couple huddled in a booth near the window, whispering secrets over lukewarm cocktails.  

 Ellie navigated the labyrinthine tables with practiced ease, her smile strained but genuine as she greeted each patron. She hoped, desperately, that tonight would be different. A night where tips flowed freely, laughter filled the air, and maybe even a glimmer of hope would pierce through the gloom. But for now, the rhythmic clinking of silverware was all that punctuated the silence, a mournful soundtrack to Ellie's dwindling optimism.
