The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Mrs. Amelia Blackwood's meticulously organized classroom. It was the first day back after summer break, and even with the windows wide open, the stale air hung heavy with the scent of dusty textbooks and unfulfilled potential. 

Amelia straightened her blazer, smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles. The crisp white shirt beneath felt scratchy against her skin, a reminder that she was back in the trenches of high school English, facing another year of teenage apathy and existential angst. 

Outside, the Virginia summer clung to the air like a damp blanket. Cicadas droned their incessant symphony, and the distant rumble of thunder hinted at an impending storm.  Inside, Amelia surveyed her kingdom: rows of empty desks, each adorned with a neatly placed nameplate, and a whiteboard starkly blank, begging for inspiration. It was a clean slate, a chance to make a difference, if only she could find the energy.
