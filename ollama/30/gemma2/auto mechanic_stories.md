The grease under Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Johnson's fingernails was more permanent than her lipstick.  She ran a rag over the rusted hood of a '67 Mustang, sighing as she caught sight of another dent. It wasn't much, but it added to the car's already tragic patina. This one belonged to old man Henderson, whose life seemed to revolve around tinkering with this ancient beast and complaining about the youngsters these days.  

Amy worked at "Grimes & Grubbs Auto Repair," a cramped, cluttered shop tucked away on a forgotten side street in Detroit. The scent of motor oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with burnt coffee and stale donuts. Outside, the city groaned under the weight of another industrial winter, a blanket of steel-grey clouds obscuring the already dim sun. 


Amy wasn't sure what she loved more: fixing things or defying expectations. Being a woman mechanic in Detroit was like wearing a crimson dress to a funeral â€“  bold, unexpected, and often met with raised eyebrows. But Amy had a knack for it, her calloused hands moving with practiced grace as she wrestled engines back to life.
