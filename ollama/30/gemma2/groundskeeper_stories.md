The first rays of dawn pierced through the canopy of ancient oaks, casting long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown paths of Blackwood Manor. Dew clung to the manicured lawns like scattered diamonds, sparkling under the rising sun. Edgar Bartholomew Thistlewick, head groundskeeper for the past thirty years, shuffled towards his shed, his gnarled hands clutching a steaming mug of tea. 

The manor itself loomed above him, a gothic monolith of crumbling stone and ivy-choked turrets, a monument to a forgotten era. Its once opulent gardens had succumbed to nature's relentless embrace, choked by wild vines and overrun with exotic flora that whispered secrets in the morning breeze. Edgar knew every inch of this wilderness, from the hidden grotto where ancient marble statues lay half-buried in moss to the secret rose garden, its thorny walls shielding a symphony of forgotten blooms. He was the keeper of these secrets, the shepherd of this overgrown paradise. 


But today felt different. A chill settled in Edgar's bones, a premonition that hung heavy in the air, as if Blackwood Manor itself held its breath, anticipating something... momentous.
