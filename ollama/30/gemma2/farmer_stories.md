The rooster's crow was just starting to echo through the mist-wreathed valley when Elias Thorne pried open his sleepy eyes. Dawn in Applewood Valley was always painted in shades of soft lavender and pearlescent gray, a stark contrast to the fiery sunsets that scorched the sky at day's end. 

Elias pulled himself from the rough cotton sheets, the chill seeping through the thin walls of his farmhouse. He rubbed a hand over his face, the stubble prickly against his palm. It was going to be a long day.  He could already hear the insistent clucking of hens demanding breakfast and the impatient stamping of hooves as his young mare, Willow, waited for her morning oats. The apple orchards outside, laden with plump, blushing fruit, beckoned him with their promise of a bountiful harvest, but first, there were chores to be done, baskets to be filled, and a mountain of orders to fulfill before the market opened at sunrise. 


He pulled on his worn leather boots, the familiar scent of hay and damp earth filling his nostrils. The world outside was waking up, stirring with the promise of a new day in Applewood Valley â€“ a place where life moved slowly, dictated by the seasons, and where Elias Thorne, the hardworking farmer, held court over his humble kingdom.
