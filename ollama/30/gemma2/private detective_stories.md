Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, each drop a tiny hammer striking against the already cracked glass. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting fractured shadows across the worn leather armchairs and dusty filing cabinets that cluttered the space. A thin plume of cigarette smoke rose from Alistair's own ash-filled ashtray, disappearing into the gloom like a forgotten memory.  

Alistair, a man whose face bore the map of countless sleepless nights and one too many close calls, leaned back in his chair, his gaze fixed on the flickering streetlight outside. It cast an orange glow over the rain-soaked asphalt, illuminating a lone figure hunched beneath its meager light. A woman. Tall, cloaked in shadow, she clutched something to her chest.  Her distress was palpable even from across the street.

He sighed, stubbed out his cigarette, and reached for the battered rotary phone on his desk. "Give me a line on that dame," he muttered into the receiver, his voice rough as sandpaper. "I think I have a new case." 


Alistair Finch wasn't your typical private detective. He was more of a last resort â€“ a man who dealt in whispers and shadows, where justice was a murky concept and truth was often a commodity bartered for with cash and favors. But when the woman outside walked into his office, she brought with her a story that promised to be anything but ordinary.
