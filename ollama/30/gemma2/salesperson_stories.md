The humidity clung to Alistair Montgomery like a damp shroud as he navigated the labyrinthine aisles of the flea market. Beads of sweat trickled down his temples, blurring the already faded hand-painted signs advertising "Vintage Treasures" and "Guaranteed Authentic Artifacts."  Alistair adjusted his tie, the silk feeling scratchy against his skin, and tugged on his collar – a futile attempt to combat the oppressive heat. 

This wasn't Alistair's usual stomping ground. He was a high-end furniture salesman, accustomed to the polished hardwood floors and muted tones of the upscale gallery where he spent most of his days. But today, desperate to secure a particularly elusive antique clock for his demanding client, Mrs. Delacroix, he found himself at this chaotic marketplace. 

The air buzzed with the cacophony of haggling vendors and curious customers, a stark contrast to the hushed reverence he was used to in his world. Alistair scanned the stalls, hoping against hope that amongst the cluttered piles of mismatched trinkets and questionable "heirlooms" lay the elusive timepiece he sought.  His phone buzzed in his pocket – a reminder from Mrs. Delacroix: "Clock by Friday, Alistair. No excuses." The pressure was on.
