The scent of cedarwood oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, sweet aroma of lavender soap. Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Willowbrook's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the bustling city of Seattle hummed with life, a symphony of car horns and distant sirens, but within these walls, time seemed to move at a slower pace. 

Eleanor, her name tag gleaming on a crisp white coat, adjusted the small sign above the examination table that read "Please Remove Shoes."  She took a deep breath, the calming scent of the office filling her lungs, and prepared herself for another day of easing pain and restoring balance, one spine at a time.
