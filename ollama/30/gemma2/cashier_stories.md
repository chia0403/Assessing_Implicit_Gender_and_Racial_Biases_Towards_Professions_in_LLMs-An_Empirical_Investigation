The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Clementine's head, casting a sterile glow over the neatly arranged aisles of "Everyday Essentials." The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and discounted cleaning supplies. Bea leaned against the counter, her nametag pinned precariously on a threadbare green shirt.  It was Wednesday afternoon, the slowest time at the store besides Mondays before noon. This meant boredom was an unwelcome companion, and Bea found herself tapping out intricate rhythms on the worn keyboard of the cash register.

The bell above the door tinkled, shattering the monotonous silence. Bea straightened up, her eyes following the new arrival.  He was tall and cloaked in a long, dusty coat, his face partially obscured by the wide brim of a fedora. He stopped short at the counter, a single weathered suitcase tucked under his arm. 


Bea knew this wasn't your average customer. "Welcome to Everyday Essentials," she chirped, her voice bright despite the weariness creeping into her bones.  "Can I help you find something?"
