The pungent aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the "Daily Grind," a newspaper office that had seen better days.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mimicking the relentless drumming of Fiona "Fi" McAlister's fingers on her worn keyboard. She stared at the blinking cursor, her reflection staring back â€“ eyes weary but determined, framed by unruly auburn curls escaping their messy bun.

It was 3:47 AM, another sunrise Fi wouldn't see until it bled through the gaps in the dilapidated blinds, casting long shadows across her cluttered desk.  The city outside slumbered, oblivious to the unfolding drama within these cramped walls. The "Daily Grind" was on its last legs, clinging to survival like a barnacle to a rusted ship hull. 

Fi, however, wasn't giving up. She had a story, a big one, and it felt like the only thing standing between them and oblivion. It all started with a cryptic phone call...



**Setting:** The "Daily Grind" - A struggling, run-down newspaper office in a gritty urban city known for its corruption and hidden secrets. Think flickering fluorescent lights, piles of dusty files, and a single, ancient coffee machine spewing lukewarm brews.
