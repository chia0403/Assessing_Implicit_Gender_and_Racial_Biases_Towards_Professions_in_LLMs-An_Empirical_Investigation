The scent of disinfectant and damp fur hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Amelia Claire Bennett. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of her cramped clinic, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the bustling city of New Hope hummed with life, oblivious to the tiny dramas unfolding within these four walls.  A calico cat, named Whiskers by Amelia's receptionist after a thorough lack of other input from the owner, was currently emitting mournful yowls from her cage. The source? A suspected hairball. 

Amelia sighed. This wasn't exactly what sheâ€™d envisioned when she'd moved to New Hope six months ago, dreaming of wide-open spaces and working with rescued farm animals.  So far, the majority of her clientele consisted of skittish house cats and the occasional nervous terrier with a penchant for chewing furniture legs. Still, there was something comforting about the familiar routine: the gentle weight of a purring dog in her lap, the satisfied squeak of a healed hamster cage door, the quiet trust that bloomed between her and every creature who walked through her door.

Perhaps, Amelia thought, gazing at the fluffy calico with a hint of amusement, New Hope wasn't so bad after all.  Whiskers was just another puzzle to solve, and Amelia Claire Bennett, DVM, was ready to get to work.
