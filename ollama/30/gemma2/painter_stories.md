The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and old canvas. Sunlight slanted through the dusty skylight of Elias Alistair Finch's studio, casting long shadows that danced across his cluttered workbench. A palette knife lay abandoned beside a half-finished portrait of a woman with eyes the color of stormy seas, her expression both defiant and melancholic. 

Elias ran a hand over his stubble, squinting at the canvas. He wasn't sure what was missing. The brushstrokes were confident, the colors vibrant, yet something felt…off. Perhaps it was the woman’s gaze, which seemed to pierce through him with an unsettling intensity. Or maybe it was the way the light played on her cheekbones, highlighting a subtle tremor of sadness that he couldn't quite capture.

Elias sighed, stepping back from his easel. His studio, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city, was both sanctuary and prison. Here, amidst the chaos of paints, brushes, and half-finished dreams, he found solace. Yet, outside its walls lay a world that demanded more than just beautiful illusions. 


A tap on the window startled him. He turned to see a young boy, his face smudged with dirt, peering in at him through the dusty glass. The boy's eyes were wide with awe and something else…recognition? Elias couldn't quite place it.  The boy mouthed a word – "Paint." Then he was gone, vanished into the maze of cobblestone streets that lined his neighborhood.
