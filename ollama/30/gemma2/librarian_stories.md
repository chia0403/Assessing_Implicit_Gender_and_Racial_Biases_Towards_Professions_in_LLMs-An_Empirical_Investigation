The scent of old paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma familiar to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne as she adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the stacks of her beloved library. Sunlight streamed through the tall arched windows, casting dust motes dancing in the golden light onto the worn wooden floorboards. 

Amelia straightened her cardigan, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, revealing a wrist adorned with a collection of antique book charms. She loved this time of day, when the library was quiet, hushed except for the rustle of turning pages and the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. It was a haven, a sanctuary for words and stories, and Amelia felt most at peace amidst its sheltering walls. 

But today, an unusual silence hung heavy in the air. The usual hum of activity – the clatter of chairs being rearranged, whispered conversations between patrons, the cheerful chatter of children lost in storytime – was absent. Even the dust motes seemed to dance more slowly, as if sensing the unease that settled over Amelia like a shroud.
