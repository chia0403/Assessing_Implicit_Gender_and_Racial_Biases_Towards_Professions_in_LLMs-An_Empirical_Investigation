Petty theft, vandalism, assault…a predictable pattern that had landed him back in her office for a mandatory meeting. Amelia sighed. This was the part she hated - the inevitable feeling of déjà vu, knowing that for every Michael Donovan who entered her life, there were countless others waiting just outside the door. But she kept going, driven by a stubborn belief that somewhere beneath the layers of anger and despair, every person held a flicker of something worth saving.
