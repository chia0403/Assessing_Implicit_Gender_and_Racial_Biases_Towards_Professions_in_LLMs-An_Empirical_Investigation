Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's quaint chiropractic office, blurring the colorful autumn leaves swirling outside. The scent of cinnamon and damp earth mingled with the faint aroma of liniment, creating a unique olfactory signature for her practice nestled in the heart of Maple Creek.

Evelyn adjusted the framed anatomy chart on the wall, its worn edges testament to years of helping people find relief from pain and improve their posture. She sighed, glancing at the clock. Another quiet day. The relentless downpour seemed to be deterring even the most dedicated back-pain sufferers.


Just as she settled into her chair with a cup of chamomile tea, the bell above the door tinkled, announcing a visitor. Evelyn straightened, expecting Mrs. Henderson with her recurring shoulder problem. Instead, a tall, imposing figure stepped inside, water dripping from his long black coat. His face was obscured by the shadows cast by his fedora, but she could sense an aura of urgency emanating from him.

"Dr. Thorne?" his voice, deep and resonant, boomed through the small office. "I need your help."
