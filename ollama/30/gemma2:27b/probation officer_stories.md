Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Holloway's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over stacks of files piled precariously on her desk. Each file represented another soul entrusted to her care, another life teetering on the edge. Today, however, one file felt particularly heavy: that of Marcus Thorne, a young man with haunted eyes and a past as dark as the storm raging outside. 

Bea had been assigned Marcus' case two weeks ago, fresh out of his stint in juvenile detention for petty theft. He was supposed to be on probation, holding down a job, staying clean. But something about Marcus' quiet demeanor and the tremor in his hands during their first meeting set off alarm bells in Bea's gut. 

The rain intensified, blurring the cityscape beyond her window into an impressionistic smear of grey and neon. Her phone buzzed, startling her. It was a call from the local police precinct. They had found Marcus unconscious in an alleyway, his clothes torn, a bruise blossoming purple on his cheek. Bea's heart hammered against her ribs. This wasn't petty theft anymore. This smelled like trouble. Deep, dangerous trouble.
