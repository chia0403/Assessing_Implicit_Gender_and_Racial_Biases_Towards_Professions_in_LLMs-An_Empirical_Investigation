The scent of lilies, jasmine, and a touch of cinnamon hung thick in the air, swirling with the gentle hum of the ceiling fan. Rosalind Blythe adjusted a crimson rose, its velvety petals catching the morning sun filtering through the dusty shop window.  Her fingers, calloused but nimble, moved with practiced ease as she arranged the blooms into a vibrant bouquet. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh buzzed with early morning life – the clattering of delivery carts, the distant bellow of bagpipes, and the cheerful chatter of market vendors. Rosalind inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar symphony of her world: the fragrant chaos of her shop "Rosalind's Blooms" nestled in the heart of Edinburgh's historic Grassmarket. 


Today was different though. A nervous tremor danced in Rosalind's hands as she placed the last rosebud into the arrangement. Today wasn't just another day; it was the day Lord Alistair MacDougal, a notoriously reclusive and wealthy patron of the arts, was scheduled to visit her shop. He had commissioned a piece for his daughter's upcoming debutante ball – a challenge Rosalind relished but also feared. The weight of expectation felt heavier than any bouquet she’d ever crafted.
