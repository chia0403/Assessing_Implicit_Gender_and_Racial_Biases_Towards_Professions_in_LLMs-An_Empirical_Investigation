Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Cavendish's office, mimicking the tempest raging inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettlingly sterile glow on the worn leather armchair opposite her desk.  It was typically occupied by a child struggling with anxieties, social issues, or learning disabilities, but today it sat empty. 

Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls, the tension knotting her shoulders. It was late Friday afternoon, and she hadn't heard back from Principal Hawthorne about a student referral.  This wasn't unusual – Hawthorne was notorious for last-minute requests – but Amelia felt an unsettling urgency this time. The cryptic email simply stated "urgent matter, student in need of immediate evaluation," followed by the name: Ethan Blackwood. 

Something about the name sent shivers down her spine. It echoed with a familiarity she couldn't place, yet triggered a deep-seated unease. Amelia peered out the window at the grey sky swirling above Hawthorne Academy, its imposing brick facade shrouded in mist. She knew there were secrets within those walls – whispers of troubled pasts and buried traumas. Today, it felt like one of those secrets was reaching out to her.
