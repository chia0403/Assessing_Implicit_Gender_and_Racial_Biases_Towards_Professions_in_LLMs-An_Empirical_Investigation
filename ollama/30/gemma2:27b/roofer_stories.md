The midday sun beat down on Elias Finch's neck, turning his collar damp with sweat. He squinted, adjusting the brim of his worn leather hat as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian house before him. Its slate tiles, once a dignified grey, were now mottled with moss and lichen, some cracked and loose like aging teeth. 

Elias tightened his grip on the hammer, its familiar weight comforting in his calloused hand. He wasn't afraid of heights, not anymore. Years spent navigating the treacherous slopes of countless roofs had instilled a quiet confidence in him. But this house, with its intricate turrets and dormers, presented a challenge unlike any he'd faced before. 

A breeze ruffled the leaves of the towering oak tree beside him, sending a shower of acorns cascading onto the weathered shingles below. Elias inhaled the crisp autumn air, tinged with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. It was a day for hard work, a day to earn his keep and maybe even a little extra for a decent meal at The Rusty Nail that evening. He hefted himself onto the first rung of the ladder, muscles straining under the weight of his tool belt.
