The humid air hung thick in The Battered Whisk, clinging to Evangeline Rose Cartwright like a damp apron. Sunlight streamed through the bakery's dusty window, illuminating clouds of powdered sugar that danced in its beams.  Evangeline sighed, wiping a stray bead of sweat from her brow and smoothing down her flour-dusted apron. Today was shaping up to be one of those days where the buttercream wouldn't cooperate and every piping tip seemed determined to clog.

But Evangeline wasn't fazed. She loved the chaos of The Battered Whisk, a tiny bakery tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Charleston.  It had been her grandmother's pride and joy, and now it was Evangeline's turn to carry on the legacy. Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced over the surface of a towering three-tiered cake destined for a lavish wedding reception. 

She paused, tilting her head and studying her creation.  The buttercream roses weren't quite blooming as gracefully as she envisioned. A frown etched itself onto Evangeline's face. This cake had to be perfect; it was for the granddaughter of the woman who'd taught her everything she knew about baking. The weight of expectation settled on her shoulders, heavier than any bag of flour.
