The insistent chirping of a smoke detector pierced through Eloise Ainsworth's dream. She swatted at it blindly, the remnants of sleep clinging stubbornly to her eyelids.  

Eloise worked as a childcare provider in Sunnyside Preschool, a cheery yellow building nestled between a bakery smelling perpetually of cinnamon and a laundromat that hummed with the rhythmic whir of washing machines. It was a place where crayons ruled supreme and giggles echoed through the hallways, but right now, it felt miles away.  

The smoke detector continued its shrill cry, finally pulling Eloise fully awake. She sat up in bed, her heart thudding against her ribs like a trapped bird. The smell of something acrid tickled her nose. Panic surged.  She scrambled out of bed and raced towards the kitchen, her bare feet slapping against the cold linoleum floor. 

Smoke billowed from under the oven door. Eloise's breath hitched. This wasn't just burnt toast. This was trouble.
