Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Elara Finch's office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. The worn-out motivational poster depicting a sunrise over snow-capped mountains felt laughably ironic today. Outside, the sky was the colour of slate, and hope seemed as distant as those peaks.

Elara sighed, pushing away the stack of college applications that seemed to grow taller by the hour. It was senior year at Northwood High, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst the pine forests of Vermont. Elara had been a guidance counselor there for ten years, witnessing countless students navigate the choppy waters of adolescence. Yet, this year felt different, heavier. 

Perhaps it was the lingering chill from the recent blizzard that had crippled the town for days, isolating them from the outside world. Or maybe it was the palpable anxiety hanging in the air, a collective dread about the uncertain future beyond Northwood's walls.  Whatever the reason, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that this year held something unusual, something she couldn't quite grasp.
