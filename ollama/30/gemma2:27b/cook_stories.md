The humid air hung heavy in the alleyway behind La Petite Grenouille, clinging to Elodie Marchand's skin like a damp apron. The clattering symphony of dinner service echoed from the open kitchen door: sizzling pans, the sharp bark of orders, and the rhythmic thud of cleavers against butcher blocks. Elodie inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar aroma of garlic, herbs de Provence, and simmering wine sauce. It was chaos, but it was her chaos.

Elodie, head chef at La Petite Grenouille for the past five years, had learned to thrive in this whirlwind. She moved with the practiced ease of a dancer, her hands flitting between chopping onions, stirring roux, and tasting sauces with an almost reverent focus. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled on her shoulders like a dusting of flour. The air seemed charged, crackling with anticipation.

As Elodie reached for the jar of capers, a figure emerged from the shadows at the end of the alley. Tall and cloaked in darkness, he leaned against the brick wall, his face obscured by the dim light. A chill snaked down Elodie's spine. This was no ordinary customer seeking a late-night bite. Something about him, the way he stood so still, so watchful, sent shivers dancing across her skin.
