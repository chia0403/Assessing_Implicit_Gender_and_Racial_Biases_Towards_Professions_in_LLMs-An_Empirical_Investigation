The air in Blackwood Manor hung heavy with dust motes dancing in the pale morning sunbeams that streamed through grimy windows. Agatha Pettigrew, her grey bun tight against her scalp, surveyed the scene with a sigh. The once-grand drawing room was now a mausoleum of forgotten memories - cobwebs draped like gauzy curtains over antique furniture shrouded in white sheets, a faded Persian rug barely visible beneath years of accumulated grime. It was a far cry from the bustling, laughter-filled home Agatha remembered from her childhood, when she’d sneak into this very room to gaze at the glittering chandelier and dream of becoming a princess.

Now, at forty-five, with calloused hands and a spine that protested every bend, she was just Agatha Pettigrew, housekeeper to Blackwood Manor – a decaying testament to a family fortune long gone. The last Blackwood, old Mr. Alistair, had passed away six months ago, leaving the manor in Agatha's capable but weary hands.
