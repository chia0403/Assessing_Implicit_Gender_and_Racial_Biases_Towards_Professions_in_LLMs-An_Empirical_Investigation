Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, the sound echoing through the vaulted ceilings like mournful whispers. Penelope Hawthorne, her silver braid swinging gently as she moved, adjusted a stack of ancient tomes on a mahogany trolley. The scent of aged paper and leather mingled with the earthy aroma of rain-soaked cobblestones wafting in from the open doorway.  

Penelope, the library's sole caretaker for the past twenty years, paused, her gaze drawn to a peculiar book nestled amongst the others. Its cover, worn smooth by time, bore no title or inscription, only an intricate silver clasp shaped like a serpent devouring its own tail. Curiosity tugged at Penelope. She had never seen this book before, and the library's collection was meticulously catalogued.  Who would have donated such a curious artifact?
