Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Sharma's office, mimicking the staccato rhythm of Elara Blackwood’s anxious heartbeat. Outside, the world was a blur of gray and green, mirroring the unease that churned in her stomach. Today wasn’t just another Tuesday filled with flossing demonstrations and plaque removal; today, Elara had to face a fear she'd been avoiding for years – public speaking.

Dr. Sharma, ever the encouraging mentor, had nominated Elara to present on oral hygiene at the local senior center. A seemingly simple task, but for someone who preferred the quiet hum of the ultrasonic scaler to the clamor of an audience, it felt like scaling Mount Everest. The sterile scent of disinfectant and mint usually calmed her nerves, but today, even the familiar smell couldn't quell the rising tide of panic.

Elara glanced at the presentation notes laid out on the countertop, their cheerful font a mocking reminder of the challenge ahead. A wave of nausea washed over her. Maybe she could feign a sudden illness? Or perhaps "accidentally" delete the presentation files?
