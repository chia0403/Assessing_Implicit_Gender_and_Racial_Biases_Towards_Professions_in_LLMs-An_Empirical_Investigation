The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning his weathered skin even more leathery than usual. Sweat trickled down his brow, stinging his eyes as he gripped the controls of the massive Caterpillar excavator. The air hung thick and hot, smelling of diesel fuel, dust, and freshly turned earth.

Silas was perched high above the ground, the world a tapestry of browns and greens below him. He expertly maneuvered the excavator's arm, scooping up a mound of red clay and depositing it in the waiting dump truck with practiced ease. This job site, a sprawling expanse near the edge of the Mojave Desert, was his domain. 

For Silas, operating heavy machinery wasn't just a job, it was an art form. He could feel the subtle vibrations of the earth through his boots, the hum of the engine resonating deep in his chest. Every movement, every adjustment of the levers and pedals, felt instinctive, almost like an extension of himself.  

But today, Silas couldn't shake a gnawing unease. It started as a whisper at the back of his mind, growing louder with each passing hour. Something felt off, something he couldn't quite put his finger on. Maybe it was the unusually quiet site, devoid of the usual cacophony of construction noise. Or perhaps it was the strange, unsettling dreams he’d been having lately – vivid nightmares filled with swirling dust and shadowy figures. 


Whatever it was, Silas knew he had to pay attention. He wasn't a man who easily dismissed gut feelings, especially when they came laced with a touch of the supernatural, which Silas couldn't quite explain but always seemed to linger around him.
