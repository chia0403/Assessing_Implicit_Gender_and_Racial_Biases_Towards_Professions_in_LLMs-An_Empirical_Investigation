Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne's third-grade classroom, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside her. The scent of crayons and stale goldfish crackers hung heavy in the air, usually comforting, but today it felt oppressive.  She stared at the hastily scribbled note on her desk: "Parent Teacher Meeting - Urgent. Please call Mrs. Ramirez ASAP."

Evelyn's stomach churned. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. Little Mateo Ramirez had been acting strangely for weeks - withdrawn, fidgety, and plagued by nightmares that left him clinging to his mother in the mornings. Now, this note, delivered with a hurried whisper by Mateo himself, sent a shiver down her spine. Evelyn knew Mrs. Ramirez well; she was a pillar of the community, always ready with a helping hand and a warm smile. For her to request an urgent meeting meant something truly unsettling had occurred.

Evelyn took a deep breath, pushed back the chair that creaked in protest, and dialed the familiar number. The ringing seemed to echo the anxiety building within her.
