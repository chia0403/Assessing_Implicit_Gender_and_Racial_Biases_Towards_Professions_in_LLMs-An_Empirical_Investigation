The clatter of plates and the murmur of lunchtime conversations formed a familiar symphony in Amelia Rose's ears. The diner, "Betty's Bites," was packed as usual on a Tuesday, its red vinyl booths overflowing with hungry office workers and local retirees. Sunlight streamed through the greasy windows, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing above the worn linoleum floor. Amelia, a petite whirlwind of energy in her Betty's Bites uniform – crisp white shirt, black pleated skirt, and sensible shoes that she secretly longed to replace with something more stylish – weaved between tables with practiced ease, her notepad a shield against rogue elbows and spilled coffees.  She knew most of the regulars by name, their orders memorized: Mr. Henderson's double cheeseburger with extra pickles, Mrs. Goldstein's tuna melt on rye with a side of coleslaw, young Tommy's chicken fingers and fries with enough ketchup to drown a small country. Today, however, a new face sat at table six. A man, tall and shrouded in shadows from his wide-brimmed hat, sat nursing a cup of coffee. His eyes, the only visible feature beneath the brim, were fixed on Amelia as she approached. Something about them sent a shiver down her spine – they weren't just observing, they were studying.

"Welcome to Betty's Bites," Amelia said with a practiced smile. "Can I get you anything?"
