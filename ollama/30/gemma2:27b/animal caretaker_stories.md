Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, drumming a relentless rhythm that echoed through Amelia Finch's bones. She pulled her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself, the chill seeping into her despite the layers.  Hay dust swirled in the dim light filtering through grimy windows, catching the glint of Amelia's silver hair as she moved between stalls.

The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of wet hay, manure, and something else – a faint metallic tang that sent a shiver down her spine. It was coming from the far stall, the one housing Jasper, the old grey stallion rescued from a cruel racing stable just a few weeks ago. He wasn't eating, and Amelia knew he needed her.

Stepping carefully into the stall, she reached out a calloused hand towards Jasper’s trembling flank. The horse flinched, his eyes wide with fear and something else – pain. Amelia felt a pang of sympathy; this majestic creature, once a champion, was now reduced to a shivering shadow. Something wasn't right.
