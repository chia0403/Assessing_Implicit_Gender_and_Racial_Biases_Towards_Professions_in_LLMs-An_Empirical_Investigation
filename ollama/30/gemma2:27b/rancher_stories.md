Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling reddish-brown against the backdrop of an unforgiving sun. The air hung thick and heavy, tasting of sweat and dry grass.  Jasper "Jeb" Callahan squinted at the horizon, his weathered face etched with worry lines deeper than the irrigation ditches crisscrossing his parched land. Jeb had been a rancher in these parts for over forty years, weathering droughts and dust storms, but this one felt different. It was relentless, sucking the life out of everything it touched.

His calloused hand tightened around the worn leather reins of his mare, Belle. She snorted softly, sensing his unease. "Don't you worry, girl," Jeb murmured, stroking her neck. "We'll get through this. We always do."  But even as he spoke the words, a nagging doubt gnawed at him. The creek that fed his land had dwindled to a trickle, and his herd was growing thin and restless. 

Jeb needed rain. He needed it desperately.
