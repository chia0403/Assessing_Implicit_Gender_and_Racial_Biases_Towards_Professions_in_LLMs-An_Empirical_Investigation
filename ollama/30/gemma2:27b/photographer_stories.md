The humid air hung thick in the alleyway, clinging to Eliza Winthrop like a damp shroud. The stench of rotting fish and stale beer wafted from overflowing bins, mingling with the sweet aroma of jasmine creeping over a crumbling brick wall.  Eliza raised her camera, its worn leather cool against her palm, and framed the scene: a lone street lamp casting an anemic glow on the cobblestones, illuminating the discarded plastic toys and crumpled newspapers scattered around it. 

This was Eliza's playground, the forgotten corners of New Orleans where beauty hid in the shadows, waiting to be captured by her lens. She wasn't interested in the postcard-perfect facades of the French Quarter; she sought out the stories whispered in peeling paint and cracked concrete, the lives etched into weathered faces and dusty doorways.  Eliza believed that even decay possessed a certain grace, a melancholic beauty that spoke volumes about time's relentless passage.
