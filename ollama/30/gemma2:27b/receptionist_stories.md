The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Penelope Thistlewick's meticulously organized desk. It was 8:47 AM sharp, two minutes before the deluge began. Penelope smoothed her navy blue cardigan, inhaled deeply the scent of lavender hand lotion, and prepared herself for the onslaught.  She worked at "The Spire," a towering skyscraper housing the city's most prestigious law firm.

From her perch behind a sleek granite counter, Penelope was the first point of contact for everyone: frantic clients clutching wads of paperwork, slick lawyers in tailored suits radiating impatience, and delivery people perpetually battling overloaded trolleys through revolving doors. Today, the air crackled with an unusual tension. A high-profile case involving a tech mogul accused of embezzlement was about to commence, and Penelope could feel it humming beneath her polished nails, a current of anticipation and anxiety.  

She straightened a framed photograph of her ginger cat, Mr. Whiskers, and took a deep breath. The elevator dinged, signaling the arrival of the first wave.
