Rain hammered against the windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's dental practice, mimicking the relentless throbbing in her jaw.  She tapped a manicured fingernail against the cold glass, watching the streetlights blur into shimmering halos beneath the downpour. It was Tuesday, which meant it was root canal day – her least favorite procedure. 

The quaint brick building that housed Evelyn's practice nestled on a quiet corner in the heart of Oakhaven, a town where time seemed to move at the pace of the nearby creek. Its cobblestone streets and Victorian-era homes exuded a charm that Evelyn initially found irresistible.  However, after five years, the charm had begun to wear thin. She yearned for the bustling energy of her former life in Chicago, for the anonymity of a city teeming with millions. 


Oakhaven felt stifling, like a too-tight sweater on a humid summer day. Still, she'd promised herself she'd stay another year – finish paying off her student loans and then, maybe, just maybe, she'd finally be free to chase the dreams she'd tucked away in a dusty corner of her heart.
