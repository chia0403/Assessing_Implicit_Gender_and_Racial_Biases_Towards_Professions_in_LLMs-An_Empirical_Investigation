Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, blurring the lights of the fishing village into halos of gold. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and brine. Elara Finch, a physician’s assistant with eyes as blue as the stormy sea outside, sighed as she checked her watch for the tenth time in as many minutes.

She couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in the usually placid village of Oakhaven. It started with the whispers – tales of strange lights on the horizon and fishermen returning empty-handed, their faces pale and etched with fear. Then came the nightmares, vivid and unsettling, that plagued Elara's sleep, filled with images of churning waves and a monstrous silhouette rising from the depths.
