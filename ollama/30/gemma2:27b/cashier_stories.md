The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Marie Delacroix's head, their sterile glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor and making her already tired eyes sting. It was 3:17 pm, the Tuesday afternoon slump had well and truly set in, and Evelyn longed for nothing more than to be curled up on her couch with a mug of hot chocolate and a good book.

Instead, she stood behind the counter at "Benny's Bargain Bin," a discount store smelling perpetually of mothballs and cheap cologne, scanning cans of dented peaches and bags of off-brand chips for customers who looked like they hadn't slept in days. The bell above the door chimed, jolting Evelyn back to reality. A tall woman with wild, grey hair and eyes that shimmered like amethysts entered the store, her worn leather boots clicking against the linoleum. Evelyn braced herself. Something about this customer felt different, intriguing... and maybe a little dangerous.
