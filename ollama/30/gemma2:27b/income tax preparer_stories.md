The stale air of the cramped cubicle pressed in on Elias Thaddeus Finch like a damp wool blanket. Outside, the April sun was finally breaking through the perpetual drizzle that had plagued Seattle for weeks, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Elias sighed, pushing a strand of unruly auburn hair from his eyes. Tax season was always brutal, but this year felt especially oppressive. The endless stream of receipts, W-2s and 1099s seemed to multiply overnight, each one carrying the weight of another person's financial anxieties. He adjusted his spectacles, their worn frames reflecting the harsh fluorescent light overhead, and braced himself for the next client.

Elias wasn't cut out for this. He dreamt of open spaces, of windswept hills and the scent of pine needles.  Instead, he was trapped in a beige purgatory, surrounded by the monotonous drone of calculators and the hushed desperation of people hoping for a refund they might not deserve. Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as Mrs. Henderson, his 10:30 appointment, entered the cubicle. Her usually cheery face was drawn tight, her eyes darting nervously around the room.  She clutched a manila envelope to her chest like a lifeline, and Elias couldn't shake the feeling that this tax season was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
