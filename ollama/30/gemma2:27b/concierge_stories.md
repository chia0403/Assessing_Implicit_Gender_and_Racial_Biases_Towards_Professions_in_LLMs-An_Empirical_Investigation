The grand oak doors of The Gilded Magnolia swung open with a sigh, releasing Amelia Blackwood into the humid Charleston air. Sweat already prickled at her temples despite the early hour.  Even this close to the Battery, the heat seemed to rise from the cobblestone streets in shimmering waves.

Amelia adjusted the silk scarf around her neck, a pale blush against the charcoal of her dress uniform. The Magnolia's concierge was expected to be immaculate, even when battling Charleston's relentless summer. A bead of perspiration dared to escape and roll down her cheek. She discreetly dabbed it away with a linen handkerchief before turning towards the day's arrivals. 

A sleek black limousine idled at the curb, its tinted windows reflecting the morning sun. Amelia smoothed her apron and braced herself. The Magnolia hosted its fair share of eccentrics and demanding clientele, but today promised to be something special. Whispers had circulated amongst the staff about a new arrival, one with an air of mystery and untold wealth.

As the limousine's door opened, revealing a figure cloaked in shadow, Amelia felt a shiver of anticipation run down her spine. This wasn't just another guest; this was someone who might change everything.
