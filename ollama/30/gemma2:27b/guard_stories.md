Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Citadel's west tower, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the rusted bars that enclosed Bartholomew "Barty" Thorne's meager observation post. A chill seeped through Barty's threadbare tunic, despite the crackling hearth fire in the corner.

The Citadel of Ebonhold loomed over the city, its jagged silhouette a stark reminder against the storm-ridden sky. Built centuries ago from obsidian-black stone, it housed the Order of the Silver Hand â€“ an ancient brotherhood dedicated to protecting the realm from unseen threats. For decades, Barty had served them faithfully as a guard, his weathered face and piercing blue eyes bearing testament to years spent on watch. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling unease ran down his spine, urging him towards the window.  He peered through the rain-streaked glass, searching for the source of his anxiety.
