The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and burnt coffee as Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted the mirror, catching a glimpse of her own reflection.  Dark curls escaped their usual bun, framing tired hazel eyes. A sigh escaped her lips as she surveyed the worn leather of her barber chair, the chipped porcelain sink, and the mismatched collection of vintage hairdressing posters that adorned the walls of "Ellie's Snip Shop." The shop was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town.  Sunlight struggled through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. It was a Tuesday morning, and business was slow. Ellie idly twirled a strand of her own hair, wondering if she should invest in some brighter paint for the shopfront, something to lure in the tourists who swarmed the nearby Royal Mile.  

Today, however, all Ellie yearned for was a decent cup of tea and a chance to catch up on the latest Agatha Christie novel she'd been neglecting. Just then, the bell above the door chimed, jolting her back to reality. A figure stood framed in the doorway, silhouetted against the weak morning sun.  Ellie straightened her apron, plastering on her best smile.

 "Good morning! What can I do for you?"
