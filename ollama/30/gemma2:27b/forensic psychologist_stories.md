Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the city below. The incessant drumming echoed the relentless pounding in her chest.  A file lay open on her desk, its contents a gruesome tapestry woven from police reports, witness testimonies, and autopsy photographs. The victim: Amelia Croft, a vibrant young artist found brutally murdered in her own apartment. The suspect: Lucas Thorne, Amelia's estranged fiancé, currently sitting across from Eleanor, his gaze vacant and his fingers nervously twisting a silver ring. 

Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the interrogation ahead.  Lucas was a puzzle – charming yet withdrawn, professing innocence but harboring secrets that clung to him like shadows. Could she unravel the truth hidden beneath his carefully constructed facade? Or would this case, like so many others, leave her questioning the very nature of good and evil?
