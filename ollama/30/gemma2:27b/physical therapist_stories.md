The scent of antiseptic and lavender disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma to Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows of the clinic, illuminating dust motes dancing above the polished hardwood floor. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of cicadas filled the late summer afternoon. Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting from the patient chart in her hand to the bustling street scene beyond the glass.

She was bone-tired. The past few weeks had been a relentless blur of appointments, paperwork, and battling insurance companies. But as she looked at the young woman tentatively stepping onto the parallel bars, a flicker of purpose ignited within her. Maya Torres, barely twenty, was recovering from a devastating car accident. Her leg, once strong and agile, now trembled with apprehension beneath its cast.

Eleanor straightened, plastering a reassuring smile on her face. "Ready to give it another try?" she asked, her voice gentle yet firm.
