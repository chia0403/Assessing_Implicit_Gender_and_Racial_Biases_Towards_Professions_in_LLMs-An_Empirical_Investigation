Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew Quill's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the already battered glass. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation, a fragrance Bartholomew had come to associate with his clientele in this forgotten corner of the city. He sat hunched over his desk, a mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf him. Outside, the neon sign of "Quill & Feather Insurance: Protecting What Matters Most" flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the peeling wallpaper. 

Bartholomew sighed, massaging the bridge of his nose. He hadn't had a decent lead in weeks, and his meager savings were dwindling faster than he cared to admit. Just as he was contemplating calling it quits for the day, the rusty bell above the door clanged, startling him out of his despair. A figure shrouded in shadow entered, bringing with them a gust of wind and the scent of damp earth.
