The humid air hung thick in "Nails by Nina," the scent of acetone and lavender polish battling for dominance. Nina Petrova, with her fiery red hair piled atop her head like a precarious cinnamon bun, expertly maneuvered a cuticle pusher along Mrs. Henderson's wrinkled nail bed.  Outside, a summer thunderstorm grumbled, threatening to unleash its fury on the quaint town of Seabrook. Inside, however, Nina's salon was a haven of calm. The gentle whirring of the fan mingled with the soothing tinkling of wind chimes hanging by the window, casting dancing shadows across the pastel walls adorned with seashell-themed artwork.  But despite the serene atmosphere, Nina couldn't shake off a nagging unease. A feeling that something was about to change, a shift in the tide as undeniable as the approaching storm.
