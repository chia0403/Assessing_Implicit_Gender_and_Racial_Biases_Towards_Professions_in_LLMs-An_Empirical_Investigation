The first rooster hadn't even thought about crowing yet when Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood stumbled out onto his porch, pulling his threadbare flannel shirt tighter against the pre-dawn chill. A thin layer of frost clung to the wooden planks beneath his boots, crunching softly with each step he took towards the barn. The air hung heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, a familiar scent that Zeke had breathed in for all 42 years of his life.

Beyond the rolling hills of his family farm, nestled in the heart of Kentucky's bluegrass country, the sky was beginning to bleed shades of lavender and apricot.  The silhouette of the old oak tree by the creek, its gnarled branches reaching towards the heavens like arthritic fingers, stood stark against the lightening horizon. Zeke paused for a moment, taking in the quiet beauty before him, a fleeting moment of peace before the day's relentless toil began.

Today was different, though. Today, a letter from the bank lay on his kitchen table, its crisp white envelope a stark contrast to the worn wood.  It held news that Zeke had been dreading for months - foreclosure. The farm, passed down through generations of Blackwoods, was in jeopardy.
