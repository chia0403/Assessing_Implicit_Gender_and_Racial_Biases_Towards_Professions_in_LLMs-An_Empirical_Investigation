The humid air hung heavy over Savannah's cobblestone squares, thick with the scent of blooming jasmine and decaying magnolia leaves. Sunlight glinted off the wrought iron balconies overlooking Forsyth Park, where tourists snapped selfies against the backdrop of the iconic fountain. Beneath the shade of a sprawling live oak, 28-year-old Elias Jasper Thornton meticulously pruned a rosebush, his calloused fingers dancing amongst thorns with practiced ease.

Elias loved this time of day - the quiet hum of the city waking up, the soft chirping of sparrows in the branches overhead, and the feeling of cool earth beneath his worn boots. Landscaping wasn't just a job for Elias; it was an art form. He saw beauty in every leaf, every petal, every gnarled branch. Today, however, the usual serenity was disrupted by a knot of anxiety twisting in his stomach. 

A mysterious letter had arrived that morning, addressed simply to "The Gardener." It promised a chance at something extraordinary, but Elias couldn't shake the feeling that he was stepping into something far beyond the familiar borders of his meticulously manicured world.
