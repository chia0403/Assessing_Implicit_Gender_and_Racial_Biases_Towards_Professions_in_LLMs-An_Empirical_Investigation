The scent of iron and rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of decay that always seemed to cling to Bartholomew "Bart" Grimshaw's apron. Dawn was just breaking over Bleakersville, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets and painting the butcher shop windows a pale rose. Bart, his hands already stained crimson from prepping the day's cuts, surveyed his domain with a gruff satisfaction. Hooks laden with glistening haunches of venison hung from the ceiling, sausages plumped proudly in their casings, and mounds of freshly ground beef awaited transformation into pies and stews.

Bleakersville was a town steeped in tradition, its inhabitants clinging fiercely to the old ways. Bart, with his thick beard streaked grey and eyes as sharp as his cleaver, was a living testament to that. He knew every family's preference â€“ Mrs. Hemmings preferred her lamb chops extra thick, while young Master Finch adored his sausages spiced with just a hint of cinnamon. But today felt different. A tremor of unease ran through Bart, an unsettling premonition he couldn't quite shake off. Perhaps it was the raven that had perched itself on the windowsill, its black eyes seeming to pierce through him. Or maybe it was the dream he'd had the night before, a swirling vortex of blood and bone that left him cold with dread. Whatever the reason, Bart felt a storm brewing, one that threatened to shatter the familiar rhythm of Bleakersville life.
