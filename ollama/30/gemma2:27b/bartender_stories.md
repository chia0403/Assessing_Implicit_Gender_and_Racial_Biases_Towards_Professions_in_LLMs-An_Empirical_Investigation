Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Drunken Mermaid, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elias Blackwood's chest.  The dimly lit bar, usually bustling with sailors and dockworkers on a Friday night, was eerily quiet. Only two patrons huddled at opposite ends of the mahogany counter – a hulking fisherman nursing a pint of ale and staring morosely into the murky depths, and a young woman in a crimson dress nervously twisting her silver ring. Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back and his blue eyes clouded with fatigue, meticulously polished a glass, avoiding their gazes.

The salty tang of the sea air mingled with the scent of spilled ale and sawdust, a familiar comfort that offered little solace tonight. The news had spread like wildfire through the port – Captain Thorne's ship, "The Siren's Call", hadn't returned from its last voyage. Elias knew Thorne, a gruff but fair man with a twinkle in his eye, who always ordered his usual double rum and coke after a successful haul. Now, his stool sat empty, a stark reminder of the treacherous ocean that could snatch lives as easily as it granted them.


Elias sighed, his chest tightening. He hadn't known Thorne well, but they'd shared enough late-night stories and stolen glances at passing ships to forge a bond. The silence in the bar was deafening, broken only by the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock behind him, each chime marking another agonizing moment.

He needed a distraction, something to pull him out of this swirling vortex of grief. Glancing towards the door, he hoped for a burst of energy, a new story, anything to break the monotony.
