The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and salt, a familiar aroma that clung to Elias Finnigan like a second skin. He stood on the rickety platform overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, his weathered hands gripping a chipped mug of lukewarm tea. The wind whipped at his worn canvas apron, carrying the cries of gulls overhead and the distant clang of the shipyard bell. Below him, the skeletal frame of a fishing trawler awaited its final touches – Elias’s touch. He ran a calloused thumb along the rough grain of the elmwood railing he was crafting, his mind tracing the intricate curves and angles that would soon guide fishermen safely across the waves.

Elias Finnigan wasn't just any carpenter; he was a shipwright, a descendant of generations who had carved their lives into the bones of these vessels. The sea was in his blood, a restless tide that ebbed and flowed through him, pulling him towards its vast expanse even as it threatened to swallow him whole.
