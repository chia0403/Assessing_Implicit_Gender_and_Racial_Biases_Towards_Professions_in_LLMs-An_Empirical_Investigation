Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Tranquil Touch", blurring the neon "Open" sign into an ethereal glow. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, punctuated by the faint tinkling of a wind chime. Esmeralda Thorne adjusted the flickering candle on her massage table, its flame dancing in sympathy with the storm raging outside. 

She glanced at the clock â€“ 7:58 PM. Only two minutes until her last appointment for the evening. Tonight's client was a new one, a Mr. Alistair Blackwood, requesting a deep tissue massage. Esmeralda had already glimpsed his file - an imposing figure with a history of chronic back pain. She hoped she could bring him some relief tonight, even if the world outside felt like it was falling apart.
