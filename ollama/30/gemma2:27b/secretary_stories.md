Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Grand Blackwood Hotel" sign across the street. Eleanor Beatrice Finch tapped her scarlet fingernails impatiently on the worn mahogany desk. The insistent tick-tock of the antique clock seemed to mock her growing anxiety. 

Mr. Hawthorne had been gone for nearly two hours, and normally he wouldn't leave his office unattended for longer than a lunch break. But today was different. Today, a sense of unease coiled tightly in Eleanor's stomach.

She adjusted the spectacles perched precariously on her nose and glanced at the stacks of files piled high beside her typewriter. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and dust, a familiar comfort in the cavernous silence of Mr. Hawthorne's office. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the turbulence brewing within Eleanor. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
