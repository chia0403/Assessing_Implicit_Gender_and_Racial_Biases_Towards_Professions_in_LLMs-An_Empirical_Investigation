The rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the relentless rhythm of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's heartbeat. The air in the surgery suite hung thick with antiseptic and tension. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the chill, a testament to the complexity of the case before her: a young boy, barely ten, his tiny chest rising and falling shallowly beneath the harsh glare of the overhead lights. His name was Ethan, and he had been brought in after a horrific hit-and-run accident.

Evelyn surveyed the scene. Her team, faces taut with concentration, moved with practiced efficiency. The anesthesiologist, Dr. Chen, monitored Ethan's vitals while Nurse Ramirez prepped instruments with unwavering precision. But even their seasoned expertise couldn't quell the knot of anxiety in Evelyn's stomach. This wasn't just another surgery. This was a fight against time itself.
