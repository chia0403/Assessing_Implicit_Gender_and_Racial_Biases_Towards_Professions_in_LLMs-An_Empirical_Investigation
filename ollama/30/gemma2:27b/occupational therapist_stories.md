The rain hammered against the skylight of Amelia Rose Cartwright's tiny office, mimicking the frantic drumbeat of her own anxiety.  Sunlight, which usually streamed through the pane and bathed the cramped space in a welcoming glow, was swallowed whole by the oppressive grey clouds. Outside, the wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes, mirroring the swirling chaos within Amelia. She chewed on her bottom lip, nervously tapping her pen against the patient file spread open before her: Mr. Elias Thorne, 78 years old, recent stroke survivor, severe right-sided weakness.

She prided herself on building trust and rapport with her patients, creating individualized therapy plans that focused on regaining independence and joy. But Elias Thorne felt different. His stoicism bordered on hostility, his eyes distant and guarded as if he'd erected an impenetrable wall around himself. Amelia had a feeling cracking through that wall would be the biggest challenge of her career yet.
