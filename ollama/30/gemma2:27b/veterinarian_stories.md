Rain lashed against the windows of the weathered barn, each drop a frantic drummer in the symphony of the storm. The air hung thick with the scent of hay, manure, and something else Amelia Cavendish couldn't quite place – fear. She knelt beside the shivering mare, her stethoscope pressed against the animal’s heaving flank. A guttural whine escaped the creature's throat, a sound that tugged at Amelia's heartstrings. 

The old barn, perched on a windswept hill overlooking the rolling emerald fields of County Clare, was Amelia's sanctuary. For generations, the Cavendish family had cared for the animals of this remote Irish village, their bond with the land and its creatures woven into the very fabric of their lives. But tonight, something felt different. The storm raged with an unnatural ferocity, mirroring the unease that churned within Amelia.

The mare's eyes were wide with terror, reflecting a darkness Amelia had never seen before. This wasn’t just colic or a broken leg. Something primal, ancient, stirred in the shadows of the barn.
