Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Inside the cramped office, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Eleanor Ainsworth, her sensible heels tapping nervously against the worn linoleum floor, stared at the overflowing in-tray on her desk. Each file represented a potential sale, a chance to claw her way out of this soul-crushing job and into something, anything, better.

Eleanor wasn't built for selling used appliances. Her nimble fingers itched to create, not convince. She yearned for the smell of paint thinner and the whir of a potterâ€™s wheel, but bills didn't pay themselves, and her tiny apartment needed rent. So she pushed down the creative ache and picked up a file labeled "Johnson - Refrigerator."  

Mr. Johnson was likely another weary soul, drowning in debt and clinging to a sputtering appliance that refused to die. Eleanor sighed. This was going to be a long day.
