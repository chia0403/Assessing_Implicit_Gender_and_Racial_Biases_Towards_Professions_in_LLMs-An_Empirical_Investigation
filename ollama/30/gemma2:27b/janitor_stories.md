The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Elias Bartholomew, reflecting off the slick linoleum floor in fractured patterns. The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail mixed with stale popcorn and the lingering phantom aroma of spilled soda. Elias pushed his mop down the deserted corridor of the Grand Majestic Theatre, the only sound his rhythmic swishing and the distant drip from a leaky pipe somewhere backstage. 

He knew this place like the back of his calloused hand â€“ every creaky step on the fire escape, every dust bunny lurking under velvet seats, every hidden nook where forgotten playbills curled like autumn leaves. Elias Bartholomew was a man who lived in shadows, invisible to the glamorous actors and enthralled audiences who filled the theatre by night. He was the custodian of their dreams, cleaning up after their fantasies, his own life a quiet, unassuming act.

But tonight, something felt different. The silence seemed heavier, charged with an unspoken anticipation. A shiver ran down Elias' spine as he paused at the stage door, a faint glimmering light emanating from within. Curiosity tugged at him, whispering promises of a hidden truth waiting to be uncovered.
