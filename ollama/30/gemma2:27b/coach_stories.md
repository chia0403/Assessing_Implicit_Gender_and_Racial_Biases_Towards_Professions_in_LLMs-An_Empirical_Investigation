The humid Alabama air hung thick over the dusty football field, clinging to Amelia "Mimi" Blackwood like a second skin. The setting sun cast long shadows from the bleachers, painting the worn grass in hues of orange and purple. Mimi squinted, her brow furrowing beneath a cascade of fiery red curls escaping their ponytail.  She surveyed her team - the Eagles of Jefferson High - lined up for another grueling drill. 

They were young, raw talent hungry for success, but plagued by doubt and a lack of discipline. Mimi knew this wasn't just about winning games; it was about forging them into men. Men who could face adversity head-on, both on and off the field. This season, she vowed, would be different.
