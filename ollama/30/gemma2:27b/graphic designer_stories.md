The flickering neon sign outside "Pixel Pushers" cast an anemic glow on Evelyn Albright's face as she hunched over her desk. Empty coffee cups littered the surface like fallen soldiers, each one testament to another hour spent wrestling with a recalcitrant logo design for a vegan dog food company. The air in the cramped studio apartment was thick with the smell of stale ramen and desperation.

Outside, the relentless thrum of New York City pulsed through the thin walls, but Evelyn barely noticed. Her world had shrunk to the glowing rectangle of her laptop screen, where a cartoon bulldog with suspiciously human eyes stared back at her, refusing to embody the organic, wholesome image the client desired. 

Tonight, she knew, sleep was a luxury she couldn't afford. The deadline loomed like a hungry wolf, and Evelyn, armed with nothing but caffeine and pixelated hope, braced herself for another all-nighter.
