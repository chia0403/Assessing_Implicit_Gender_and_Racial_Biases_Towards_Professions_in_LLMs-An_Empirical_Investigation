Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. The incessant drumming seemed to mirror the relentless pounding in Amelia Cartwright's chest. She stared at the file spread before her on the worn mahogany desk â€“ a tangled mess of eviction notices, medical bills, and faded photographs. Her client, Mrs. Eleanor Petrov, was facing homelessness, drowning in debt after her husband's sudden passing. 

Amelia felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle onto her shoulders. She wasn't just fighting for a roof over Mrs. Petrov's head; she was fighting against the apathy of a system that seemed to chew up and spit out those who couldn't afford a good lawyer. This dingy office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Chinatown, might not have been much, but it was her haven, her battlefield. From this worn desk, Amelia Cartwright would wage war on injustice, one case at a time.
