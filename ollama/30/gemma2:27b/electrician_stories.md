Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the mostly empty space.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cracked vinyl booths and faded checkered floor. Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy, his work boots leaving damp prints on the linoleum, scanned the menu with a sigh.

He hadn't planned on being in Harmony Creek this late. A faulty circuit breaker at Mrs. Henderson's antique shop had turned into a tangled mess of ancient wiring and squirrel infestations. By the time Bart had coaxed the electricity back to life, the sun was setting and his stomach growled like a disgruntled badger. 

Harmony Creek wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis.  It was a small town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, where time seemed to move at a slower pace, measured by the changing seasons and the rhythm of cicadas in summer. Bart, with his calloused hands and grease-stained overalls, fit right in. He was a man of few words, but his work spoke volumes â€“ reliable, honest, and capable of bringing light into even the darkest corners.
