The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's weathered face as he squinted through the grime-coated windshield.  Dust devils danced in the distance, twisting like phantoms across the cracked asphalt ribbon that stretched before him. The air hung heavy and hot, thick with the scent of dry earth and diesel fumes. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt affectionately nicknamed "Betty," grumbled contentedly beneath him, the steady thrumming of her engine a familiar lullaby.

Bart was hauling a load of fresh produce from Fresno to Omaha, a route he'd traversed countless times before.  The endless plains of Nebraska stretched out before him like a rumpled green carpet, punctuated by distant silos and the occasional lonely farmhouse. The monotony was soothing, a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. But today, Bart felt a gnawing unease in the pit of his stomach. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a subtle shift in the air that whispered of unseen danger.
