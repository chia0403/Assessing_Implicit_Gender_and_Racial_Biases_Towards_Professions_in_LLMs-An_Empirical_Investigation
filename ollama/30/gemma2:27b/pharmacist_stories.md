Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously above Eleanor Vance's head.  Inside the dimly lit Corner Drugstore, she tapped her pen impatiently against the counter, the rhythmic click the only sound competing with the relentless drumming of rain. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and dusty pill bottles. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded beast, sending shivers down Eleanor's spine despite the warmth radiating from the ancient radiator beneath the window. 

Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting to the clock ticking away on the wall. It was almost 3 AM, a time when even insomniacs usually surrendered to sleep. But tonight, she was alone. The usual trickle of late-night customers – overworked nurses, weary truck drivers, desperate mothers with feverish children – had dwindled to nothing.  She was starting to think that maybe the storm had scared everyone indoors when the bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer.

Eleanor straightened up, pushing aside her weariness and plastering on a practiced smile. She glanced up, expecting to see a familiar face from the neighborhood. Instead, she was met with a pair of piercing blue eyes staring back at her from beneath the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. The stranger's face was obscured by the gloom, but his presence filled the small drugstore with an unsettling chill.
