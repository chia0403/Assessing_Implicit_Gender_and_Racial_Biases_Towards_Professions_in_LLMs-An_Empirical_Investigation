The air hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and fear. Amelia "Amy" Chen gripped the gurney's railing, her knuckles white against the cold metal.  Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder with every passing second. This was it. The call had come in barely ten minutes ago - a multi-vehicle collision on Highway 101. Amy could already picture the scene: twisted metal, shattered glass, and faces contorted in pain.

Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm echoing the approaching sirens. She took a deep breath, willing herself to stay calm. This was what she trained for.  This was why she'd chosen this life - to be there when chaos reigned, to be a beacon of hope in the face of suffering.

As the ambulance roared into the hospital bay, Amy knew this night would test her limits.
