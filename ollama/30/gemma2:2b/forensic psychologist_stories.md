Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Alistair Crowe's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside his own mind. The pungent scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air as he studied the body slumped across the examination table. A young woman, barely more than a girl at seventeen, her face contorted in silent agony. Her eyes, once bright and curious like a starlit sky, were now vacant and cold.  Dr. Crowe ran a trembling hand over his forehead, fighting off the wave of nausea that threatened to overwhelm him. 

The case was unlike anything he’d encountered before. The victim, Amelia Hawthorne, had been found dead within the restricted grounds of Blackwood Manor, an imposing gothic mansion steeped in local legends and whispered secrets.  Her cause of death: a seemingly impossible combination of injuries - stab wounds inflicted with meticulous precision that defied explanation, followed by an almost ritualistic series of burns applied to her body. 

The victim's mind seemed to be as disjointed as the evidence itself. Dr. Crowe struggled to understand Amelia’s last moments - she hadn't spoken a word before death, and yet, there was something in the way she lay,  a primal scream frozen on her lips. Blackwood Manor held an echo of the past, its crumbling stone walls whispering tales of forgotten tragedy. It felt as if the very air was thick with unspoken history, suffocating him with its weight and mystery. 

His only hope lay within the fragmented memories of Amelia's surviving sister, a young woman whose grief hung heavy like a shroud. The girl’s terror was palpable, her voice cracking with the sheer pain of losing her sibling. Dr. Crowe knew this case wasn't just about unraveling a murder; it was about piecing together a shattered soul and understanding the dark secrets that lay beneath the surface of Amelia's life.
