## The Ghost in the Glass

**Setting:** A sprawling metropolis shrouded in perpetual twilight. Neon signs flicker like fireflies against the gray sky, casting an eerie glow over the towering skyscrapers that seem to scrape the very clouds. Rain falls intermittently on the cracked pavement, reflecting the city's harsh beauty.

**Character:** 
* **Name:**  Elias Thorne

   * A name whispered in hushed tones by colleagues and clients alike. Elias is a rising star in the architectural world. He possesses an uncanny ability to envision buildings that defy convention, spaces that seem to breathe life into the very city they inhabit. But beneath his dazzling talent lies a melancholic truth: Elias is haunted by the ghost of his late grandmother, a renowned architect who had mysteriously vanished before his birth. 

**Opening:**  Elias stared out the panoramic window of his office tower, the neon lights painting his reflection in shades of purple and red. A city symphony played below him - the rhythmic pulse of traffic, the distant wail of sirens, the murmur of thousands of lives unfolding in this urban labyrinth. But Elias’s mind was a chaotic storm of memories. 

His grandmother's ghost lingered in every detail, her presence a tangible chill he couldn't quite explain. She had been working on a project, an impossible dream within the confines of their city, and then… gone.  Gone like the fog that clung to the skyline, leaving behind only a lingering sense of emptiness and unanswered questions. 

He clutched his worn sketchpad - the one she gave him before disappearing. It held her most prized blueprints: sketches of buildings that defied gravity, structures seemingly woven from light itself. But Elias’s grandmother had never explained their meaning, not to him, not before she vanished. 

The city lights reflected on the glass building, but something deeper – a spectral image, a phantom silhouette  - shimmered in its depths. Elias leaned back, his eyes widening. 
He wasn't sure if he should be terrified or hopeful... because tonight, he was going to find out what those blueprints truly meant.
