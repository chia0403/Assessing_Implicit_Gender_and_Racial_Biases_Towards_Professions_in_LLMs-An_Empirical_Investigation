The air in Dr. Amelia Thorne's office hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and lavender, each room meticulously arranged to offer a soothing atmosphere. Outside, the gentle rhythmic sway of the old maple tree outside cast long, lazy shadows across her waiting area. Inside, however, Amelia couldn't shake the knot of tension she held in her shoulders. The day had started like any other, filled with the comforting routine of adjusting spines and relieving aches, yet today, a dissonant note played throughout her symphony.

Amelia's name was whispered on the lips of countless patients: a testament to years of dedicated service, but also a constant reminder that she was "the one who could fix" them all. But lately, even Amelia felt like something was off-kilter, as if there were cracks in the foundations upon which her life and practice had been built. 

It wasn't just the recent influx of patients struggling with chronic pain, a problem no chiropractor could ignore. It was the growing unease that gnawed at her inside, a feeling amplified by the news headlines about healthcare being squeezed from all sides and people like her fighting a losing battle against insurance companies.  She had always believed in healing, yet the weight of an ever-shifting political landscape felt heavier than any patient's burdened spine.
