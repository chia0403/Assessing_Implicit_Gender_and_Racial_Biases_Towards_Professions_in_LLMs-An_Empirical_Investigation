The aroma of warm yeast and cinnamon filled the air around Elias Everbrook’s bakery, swirling in a delicate dance with the salty tang of sea spray carried on the breeze. The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Little Cove, swirling around the weathered brick walls of his quaint shop like an ethereal ghost. The sun, still shy behind a veil of clouds, cast a pale light over the bustling harbor town, painting everything in hues of soft gold and rose pink. 

Elias Everbrook, known as “Eli” to everyone who knew him, was one of Little Cove’s oldest residents. His shop, nestled on the edge of the cobbled waterfront, had been passed down through generations within his family – a testament to Eli's skill in crafting pastries that defied time and tradition. The stories of his gingerbread men coming alive after nightfall, or his apple pies so plump they seemed to hum with happiness, were whispered by townsfolk like fables passed from mouth to ear. 

Eli stood at the counter, hands dusted with flour, humming a quiet tune as he prepared for the day's rush. A steady stream of customers filtered in, their faces alight with anticipation as they clutched crisp paper bags and exchanged whispers about the latest gossip from the harbor. Eli’s heart swelled with pride as they eagerly awaited his signature creations: each loaf of bread, each delicate pastry a testament to his years spent kneading love into every bite.
