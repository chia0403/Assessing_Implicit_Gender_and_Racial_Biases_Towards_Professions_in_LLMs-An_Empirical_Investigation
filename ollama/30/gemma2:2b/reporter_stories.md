Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the abandoned diner, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of Amelia Thorne's anxiety.  The neon sign, "Betty's Diner," flickered erratically above the cracked asphalt outside, casting long, wavering shadows that stretched like grasping claws across the decaying facade. It was a place Amelia had vowed never to revisit after her last assignment here - the story about Mrs. Henderson's missing husband, a tale she’d uncovered in the dead of night.

She was alone, a lone wolf in this concrete jungle, miles away from the bustling newsroom where her editor awaited her with a fresh batch of caffeine and even more demanding questions about that missing husband case.

"He's coming back," it read, “But he won’t be alone.”  The words were cold on her skin, a chilling premonition that sent shivers down her spine. The only question was: what had been unearthed? And who – or what – was waiting for her at the heart of this forgotten diner's mystery?
