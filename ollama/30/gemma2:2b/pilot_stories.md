The desert wind whipped Amelia "Ace" Davenport's hair across her face as she stared down at the scorched earth below.  Dust devils danced across the cracked surface of the dried riverbed, remnants of a storm long gone. The air hung heavy and stagnant, thick with the heat of the unforgiving Arizona sun. Ace tightened the straps on her flight suit, feeling the familiar weight shift against her hips as she prepared for takeoff.  She was perched precariously atop a rusted hangar door in the middle of the desolate landscape, its weathered metal groaning under her presence like an old soul remembering forgotten times.

It had been five years since she left the comforts of a controlled environment, five years since she'd traded the sterile hum of air traffic control for the raw fury of the open sky. Now, alone with only the engine's roar and the desert's whispered secrets, Ace felt like a lone hawk on the wing, poised to plunge into the unforgiving void.  The old Piper Warrior 35, affectionately nicknamed "Phoenix," sat dormant in the shadow of her hangar, its faded paint job hinting at countless adventures long passed. Tonight, it was time to fly again. 

Tonight, she'd chase after a phantom: a legend whispered amongst seasoned pilots - a hidden valley said to hold the secret to untold riches and buried mysteries. The only problem? No one else believed it, leaving Ace alone in her pursuit of an impossible dream. But tonight, there was something different about the wind's whisper against her ear; the faint echo of something more than just desert dust.
