Rain lashed against the classroom window, mimicking the frantic beat of Ms. Amelia Evergreen's heart as she smoothed out the wrinkles in her worn sweater.  The aroma of stale coffee from yesterday's pot clung to the air like a persistent cloud. It was just 8:00 am, yet the storm outside seemed determined to mimic the chaos swirling within her own mind. Just three more weeks until summer break and… well, that was all she could think about.  The words "resignation" and "retirement funds" had been flung around like confetti in a recent meeting with the principal. 

Ms. Evergreen's gaze landed on her twenty-five years of accumulated teaching experience reflected back at her from the class photo pinned to her door. The children, faces now aged beyond recognition, had stared out at her with their wide eyes filled with both wonder and mischief – memories she would never forget.  Her heart ached for them, but the fear in her own chest felt just as real as the rain pounding against the windows. 

The clock chimed 8:05, signaling the official start of another day at Willow Creek Elementary. But Ms. Evergreen knew that this school year was about to be far more complicated than any lesson plan she had ever written. This storm was not about weather; it was personal and she just wasn't sure what form her own hurricane would take.
