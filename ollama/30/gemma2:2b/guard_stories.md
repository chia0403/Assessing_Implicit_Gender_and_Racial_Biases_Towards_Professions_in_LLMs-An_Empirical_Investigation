The iron gates groaned as Corvus Thorne, his scarred face etched with fatigue, pushed them open. The air hung heavy, thick with the smell of brine and fish guts, the only discernible change from the suffocating summer heat in this damp, sea-worn city. His worn tunic clung to him like a second skin, sweat already pooling beneath it despite the chill that clung to the stone walls of Port Avaris. 

Corvus was one of the few guards remaining after the King's men had taken them by storm. They hadn’t even bothered with his usual patrol route, leaving him with only the echoes of screams and the chilling silence of abandoned watchtowers. He wasn’t assigned to a specific tower anymore, but instead walked the ragged perimeter of the outer walls, tasked with keeping an eye out for any signs of life beyond the flickering torches. 

His duties felt like more than just duty now. Every rustle in the shadows, every flicker of light that didn't belong, made his heart pound a frantic tattoo against his ribs. The memories were too fresh, the faces too stark: burnt flesh and blood-stained sand, the King’s men laughing as they tore his comrades from their posts. 

He knew he had to be vigilant. Port Avaris was his responsibility now; a silent watch in the face of an encroaching darkness.
