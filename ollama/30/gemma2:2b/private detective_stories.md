Rain lashed against the worn mahogany desk in Mr. Edgar Thorne’s office, mimicking the frantic drumming of his fingers on the frayed leather-bound file. The stench of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional hiss of the gas heater struggling to fight off the chill seeping through the ancient windows.  His name, like most things about him, was as unassuming as a greyhound. Edgar Thorne. A name that had become synonymous with the kindest corner of the city's underworld, where secrets were currency and justice was a forgotten myth.

He skimmed the file, its pages marked by years of use – each line of scribbled notes and half-formed theories like a fingerprint on his weary soul.

The Blackwood lineage held an almost mythical status in the underbelly of this city - their wealth and connections whispered tales of corruption and blood spilled on the cobbled streets.

The weight of it felt heavy in his stomach, each tremor of his worn fedora mirroring the storm outside and the knot of anxiety in his chest.  He needed answers. He had to find it.
