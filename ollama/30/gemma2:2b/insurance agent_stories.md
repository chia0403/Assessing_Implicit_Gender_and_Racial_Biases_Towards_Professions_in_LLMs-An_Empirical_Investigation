The rain hammered against the windows of Ethan Carter's office like tiny fists drumming on wood.  He hunched over his desk, its surface slick with condensation from the endless downpour. Outside, Portland was in its familiar, moody state - grey skies choked with clouds, a city perpetually shrouded in fog that clung to everything, even the hopes and dreams of people like him. Ethan Carter, Allstate Insurance Agent extraordinaire, hadn't seen the sun in what felt like months, not since the big windstorm had swept through town last week. It wasn’t just rain; it was a feeling of endless melancholy that clung to every corner of his office - a feeling that mirrored the dreary weight on his shoulders.

His phone buzzed with another call from a distressed homeowner, another claim filed amidst the storm's aftermath. He sighed and picked up the receiver, the familiar voice of Mrs. Peterson on the other end crackling through the speakers.  
“Ethan, dear, you’ve been neglecting your calls,” she said, her voice laced with concern. “This time I lost more than just my prized antique teacups…my roof caved in during the storm!” 

Just another day at the office for Ethan. Or maybe just a day of trying to find some sunshine amongst the clouds of despair.
