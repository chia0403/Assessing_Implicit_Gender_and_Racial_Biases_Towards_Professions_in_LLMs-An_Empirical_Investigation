## The Green Thumb Curse

**Setting:**  A perpetually gray city called Ashhaven, where sunlight struggles to penetrate the dense smog hanging over its skyscrapers. Even the sky seems permanently overcast, mirroring the perpetual melancholy etched onto the faces of its inhabitants. This wasn't always the case; a century ago, Ashhaven was known for its flourishing gardens and vibrant flora, but progress had left its mark, replacing green with steel and concrete. 

**Main Character:**  Ethan Thorne - a young landscaper whose hands have become his canvas. Ethan has inherited his grandfather’s love for greenery, finding solace and purpose amidst the barren streets of Ashhaven. He believes that even in this bleak landscape, life can be nurtured.


The first thing Ethan noticed when he looked up from his meticulously-ordered notebook was the swirling storm outside. Not just any storm - a tangible, menacing presence that seemed to suck the very air out of his lungs.  He had been tending to Mrs. Hemlock’s prized lavender bush all morning, its feathery blossoms promising summer's gentle embrace even in this bleak city, when the storm broke. He looked up at the clouds, heavy and pregnant with rain, and a shiver ran down his spine. 

Ethan had always been drawn to the beauty hidden beneath Ashhaven's grim exterior.  He believed that every blade of grass, every leaf on a forgotten tree held a story waiting to be told. But this storm felt different. It was not just wind and rain; there was an undercurrent of power in the air, a silent threat he couldn’t quite grasp. He had heard whispers of the “Green Thumb Curse,” a local legend passed down through generations about a powerful, forgotten force that could bloom even amidst ash and decay.  

Could this storm be more than just weather? Or was there something deeper at play, something whispering in his soul with the rhythm of falling raindrops? He couldn’t shake off the feeling, an unease tightening its grip around his heart, urging him to seek answers within the very soil that he tended so meticulously.
