The air in the workshop was thick with sawdust and tension. The smell clung to everything, even Elias's worn shirt after he'd stepped out for a quick lunch. He pushed open the heavy steel door, its hinges groaning like an old man complaining about his back. Sunlight streamed through the grimy skylight, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Elias pulled off his hat and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.  

His name was Elias Blackwood, but most called him "Eli" – a nickname earned by years spent drawing plans, blueprints for everything from small cottages to towering skyscrapers. He worked at Blackwood & Sons Engineering, nestled within a sleepy town on the outskirts of Boston. The shop felt like an old friend - familiar, yet occasionally frustratingly stubborn.  

Today wasn't one of those days. Today, it was a storm brewing in the workshop – not literal, but as palpable as the air itself. The owner, Mr. Blackwood (Elias’s grandfather, and whose name he shared), sat at his desk, hands clenched around a blueprint. His face, usually etched with an easy smile, had become grim. 

"Eli," he began, his voice low and gravelly like the floorboards beneath their feet, "We need to talk about this project."
