The morning air was crisp, biting at Amelia's exposed cheeks as she surveyed the construction site.  Dirt kicked up by heavy machinery formed ephemeral clouds in the pale sunrise, and Amelia shivered, pulling her worn denim jacket tighter around herself.  Her name was Amelia 'Amy' Bellweather, and she’d been a highway worker for longer than she cared to remember - over twenty years – but still found something comforting in the rhythmic clang of hammer against metal on this new stretch of asphalt. The endless ribbon of black-top stretched out before her like a canvas waiting for paint, a promise of progress.  

The setting sun was long gone, turning the already muted landscape into a symphony of fading colours.  A lone hawk circled lazily above, its shadow an accusing finger against the dying light.  It cast a haunting presence on Amy's already tired face, reminding her that even in the vastness of this world, she still had to carry the weight of the everyday burdens of life. 

She adjusted the straps of her tool bag, its contents familiar and comforting: pliers, wrenches, and countless other tools essential for keeping the roads open.  The quiet hum of machinery was a constant companion in this lonely task, a lullaby that brought back memories of her father, who had taught her how to mend the road with his own hands before she even knew what she wanted to be.
