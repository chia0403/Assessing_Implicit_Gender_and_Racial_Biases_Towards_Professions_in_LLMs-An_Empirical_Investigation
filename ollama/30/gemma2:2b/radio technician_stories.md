The air hung thick with static as Elias “Eli” Finch carefully adjusted the tuning dial on his old mahogany console radio. The hum of the machine was almost hypnotic in its rhythm, a counterpoint to the incessant wind howling outside his ramshackle shack nestled amidst the California redwoods.  It was 1957, and Eli lived alone, dedicated to listening – not just for any broadcast signal, but for that elusive one that whispered of something far greater than the mundane.

Eli’s fingers danced across a worn-out schematic as he tried to pinpoint the source of an erratic radio wave, a glitch in the otherwise static-filled airwaves.  He swore under his breath, frustration twisting its tendrils around his heart. Years spent tinkering with old radios and deciphering their cryptic language had honed his senses, but this… this was beyond anything he'd ever encountered. It felt as if an unseen hand were playing tricks on the very fabric of space and time.

The only light inside came from a single lamp hanging precariously over Eli’s workbench, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the hum of the radio.  He had been trying to piece together this anomaly for weeks, but it remained frustratingly elusive. All he knew was that something vital was being obscured by this strange interference.   Eli’s brow furrowed in concentration as he muttered under his breath, "Just find me the right frequency, girl… I know you're out there."
