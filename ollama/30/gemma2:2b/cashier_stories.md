The fluorescent hum of the supermarket echoed through the crisp morning air as Cassandra "Cassie" Moonwalker, with her usual tired sigh and rumpled uniform shirt, scanned an overflowing basket of apples towards the checkout counter. The aroma of baked bread lingered in the air, a comforting familiarity that did little to counteract the icy dread creeping up Cassie's spine. 

It was another Sunday morning, one of those days when life at the Super Mart felt like an endless loop of customer requests and low-paying overtime shifts.  The quaint town of Oakhaven had always been a place of quiet charm, but lately, it seemed to be losing its luster. The once bustling bakery now stood empty, the newsstand was struggling to stay afloat, even Mr. Henderson's beloved antique shop was feeling the pinch. This wasn't just another Sunday morning; this felt like something bigger was brewing beneath the surface of their placid lives. 

And Cassie knew it in her gut, as she watched Mrs. Peabody, a regular customer with a penchant for gossiping and a sour expression etched across her face, push her cart towards the checkout lane with an alarming urgency.   Something wasn't right.  Cassie had a feeling this day would be different.
