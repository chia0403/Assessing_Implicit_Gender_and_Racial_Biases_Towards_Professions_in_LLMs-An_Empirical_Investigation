##  Setting:

**The Grand Clocktower**, a stately Victorian building perched precariously on a hill overlooking the bustling port city of Avalon. The air here crackles with an almost tangible energy - a mix of salt spray from the endless ocean trade routes and the fiery passion of the harbor's denizens. 


## Character:

**Amelia Thorne**, she knew everyone by their nicknames and whispered secrets between the creaks and groans of the building, her sharp wit as sharp as the scissors in her desk drawer.  At 27, Amelia was a veteran receptionist at The Grand Clocktower, though her youthful face suggested otherwise - etched deep lines hinted at countless late nights and even more tales she’d woven into the fabric of the hotel's history.


## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the glass windows, mimicking the erratic rhythm of Amelia's heartbeat.  She stared at the sea of faces flooding through The Grand Clocktower's main entrance - merchants from distant lands, sailors with tales of treacherous journeys, and lovers whispering secrets in shadowed corners. Each face held a story, each one waiting to be heard. 

She took a deep breath and began her daily routine,  the familiar motions washing over her like the tide. She filed letters, polished silver cutlery, refilled the punch bowl for the evening's grand ballroom event, and even danced through the mundane with a flourish of her fingers as she tallied the day’s receipts. 

But tonight was different. The air buzzed with an undercurrent of anticipation, tinged with the unsettling hum of a hidden storm brewing within the heart of Avalon.  Amelia noticed it in the hesitant glances exchanged between guests and the ever-shifting shadows at the back door. Tonight, even the Clocktower seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something momentous to unfold.
