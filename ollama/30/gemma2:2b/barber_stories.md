The scent of sandalwood and hot oil hung heavy in the air, clinging to Thomas "Tommy" Blackwood like a second skin.  He ran his calloused hand over his salt-and-pepper beard as he surveyed his shop, "Blackwood's Blades," its worn mahogany door standing sentinel against the boisterous city life just outside. A chipped tin sign above the door read "Shave & Straighten," and Tommy knew every line of that familiar slogan by heart. 

Outside, the roar of horns and the clatter of passing carriages filled the air with an energetic chaos. But inside, Tommy's world was a sanctuary of quiet hums, clinking shears, and the gentle rasp of a straight razor on skin. For him, the rhythm of clippers and the soft scent of aftershave were as familiar and comforting as the worn leather of his barber chair. 

For thirty years, Tommy had been a steady hand in this corner of the city, shaping men into their best selves.  He dealt with swaggering businessmen seeking a sharp trim for their big pitch and anxious young lads looking to lose themselves in a new shave before their first day at university. Yet, some days, he'd be faced by an emptiness that chilled him even deeper than the winter winds outside. Today, Tommy felt it more acutely than usual.
