The scent of burnt coffee clung to the air like a bad memory. Ms. Evelyn Thorne, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, stared out the window of the empty counseling room, watching a rainstorm lash against the glass. It was almost as if the sky was mirroring the storm brewing inside her. 

She had spent years guiding students through their adolescence - helping them navigate the choppy waters of high school and ultimately steer them towards the right course in life. Now, she felt adrift, lost on an uncharted sea of uncertainty. The once-familiar comfort of her own routine had been replaced by a deafening silence that seemed to echo the emptiness in her heart.  Evelyn Thorne, seasoned counselor, guidance mentor extraordinaire â€“ was finally facing a challenge she never anticipated.
