## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with the smell of old paper and stale coffee in Theodore "Teddy" Finch's office. Sunlight streamed through the high windows, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the beams. Teddy, his graying hair combed meticulously back from his forehead, stared intensely at a file folder spread across his mahogany desk.  A tremor ran through his hand as he picked up a particularly thick document, its pages filled with seemingly endless legal jargon and cross-hatched scribbles in an unfamiliar language.
