## The Whispering Pines

The air hung thick and heavy with pine needles and damp earth. A steady drizzle coated the forest floor in a thin sheen, mimicking the rhythmic patter of the rain hammering against the sturdy pines that surrounded it all.  His name was Silas Blackwood, and for twenty years he’d carved his life into these ancient giants, each log a testament to the strength he’d found in wood. His calloused hands, gnarled by time and toil, gripped the worn handle of his axe as he surveyed the forest with an air of quiet contemplation. 

Silas' camp was nestled within the heart of this sprawling redwood grove, a rustic cabin made from reclaimed lumber that seemed to melt into the surrounding trees. But tonight, the whispers in the wind felt different. They carried a sense of urgency, of something lurking just beyond the veil of the forest’s ancient embrace. The usual tranquility had been shattered by an unsettling hum, a low vibration that seemed to emanate from the depths of the woods. 

Silas frowned, his weathered face creased with worry. Something was amiss. A knot of dread formed in his stomach as he glanced at the half-finished log he'd been working on earlier. It wasn’t just the weather; something about this forest seemed to be shifting, almost…growing restless.
