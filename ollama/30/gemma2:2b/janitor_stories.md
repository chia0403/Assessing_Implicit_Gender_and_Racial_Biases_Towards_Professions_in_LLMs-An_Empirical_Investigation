The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony, their sickly yellow beams bathing the echoing halls of the Grand Majestic Academy in an ethereal glow.  Dust motes danced like tiny specters in the air, swirling around the worn mop and bucket resting beside Theodore "Theo" Franklin's foot.  He was a man who understood the language of silence â€“ a master of the mundane humdrum life of cleaning, one that had followed him since his days scrubbing greasy floors in his family's restaurant.

The Grand Majestic Academy, once a beacon of youthful dreams and ambition, now stood as a monument to forgotten glory. The grandeur of its Victorian facade was marred by chipped paint, peeling marble, and the occasional ominous crow perched on the rooftop like a watchful guardian of secrets lost.  Theo knew the academy's soul; its hidden history woven into every cracked floorboard, every damp stain on the tapestry lining, and every echo that seemed to linger just beyond hearing.
