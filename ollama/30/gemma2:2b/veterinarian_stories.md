## Story Opening:

The air in the clinic hung thick with disinfectant and pet-related anxiety, a symphony conducted by Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Nightingale's gentle but firm hand as she examined Clover, a six-year-old Schnauzer with the spirit of a lion trapped in a dog's body. Ellie traced her calloused fingers across Clover's shaking fur, feeling the tremor of fear thrumming beneath the surface like a small earthquake. 

"Tell me again," Ellie said softly, eyes crinkled at the edges, "what exactly happened today?"  She knew it was more than just a playful tumble down the dog park hill – this wasn't the usual 'stubbed paw' or 'lost tail.' This was Clover’s story; a tale woven with whimpers and a nervous energy that only Ellie, her long-time friend, could sense. The setting: Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic, nestled amongst towering oaks and willow trees whispering secrets in the breeze,  a haven for furry friends from the sleepy town of Oakwood.
