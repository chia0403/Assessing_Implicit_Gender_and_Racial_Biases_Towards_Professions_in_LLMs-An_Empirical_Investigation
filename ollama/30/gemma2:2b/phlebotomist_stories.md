## The Vanishing Point

The fluorescent lights hummed over Amelia "Amy" Thorne's head, casting sterile shadows on the worn linoleum floor of the clinic.  Her fingers, stained with years of dark red and blue ink, tightened around the thin plastic bag containing Mr. Peterson’s blood sample.  His name was a whisper in her mind, the same way his last words – “It's all gone” - echoed in the back of her throat. Amy traced the etched pattern on the vial with her thumb, a silent plea for answers that no one could give.

The clinic smelled faintly of antiseptic and old paper, the familiar aroma she’d grown to accept as the scent of normalcy in this world where chaos reigned just beyond the walls.  It was here that Mr. Peterson, once a vibrant businessman with a booming laugh and a penchant for brightly coloured ties, had found himself, his entire life draining away like water through a sieve. He’d come in seeking answers, hoping for some kind of solace amidst the swirling vortex of what he now called “his vanishing point”. 

Amy, ever observant, noted the way Mr. Peterson sat hunched over, his shoulders slumped as if the world itself were pressing down on him.  He hadn’t spoken since arriving, a stoic figure shrouded in a sea of silent grief. The only sound that pierced the quiet was the gentle whirring of the blood centrifuge – its rhythmic drone mirroring the internal turmoil swirling within Amy's own heart.

Today, she would not just extract his blood. Today, she would try to understand where he'd been lost. And perhaps, in doing so, uncover the truth behind Mr. Peterson's vanishing point.
