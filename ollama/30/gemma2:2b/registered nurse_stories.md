Rain lashed against the windows of the Nightingale Sanitarium in Seattle, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Blackwood's chest. It was always this way after a shift - her scrubs soaked through with sweat and guilt. Tonight, though, it wasn't just the physical burden of the day.  Amelia, RN for over ten years at the Sanitarium, clutched a letter in her trembling hands – an official summons to an interview with the renowned Dr. Evelyn Carter, known as "The Miracle Doctor" for her revolutionary techniques in treating chronic neurological disorders. 

The Sanitarium walls were cold stone and chipped paint, echoing with the whispers of the afflicted. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the tang of desperation, both familiar yet suffocating. It had been years since Amelia had felt truly hopeful about the patients she saw; every one a lost puzzle piece in a larger medical mystery that left her feeling helpless. But tonight, as she stared at the letter’s crisp edges and considered the words "Dr. Carter requests your presence," a spark of possibility ignited in her weary heart.

Could this be the chance to escape the familiar prison of routine? Could Dr. Carter's methods offer a way beyond the limitations of traditional medicine, into something new and... potentially impactful?
