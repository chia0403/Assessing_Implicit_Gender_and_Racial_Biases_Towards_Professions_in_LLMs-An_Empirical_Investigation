## The Drain's Secret

**Setting:**  Old Man Withers' house was nestled in the quiet, tree-lined streets of Maple Creek. A quaint little town with a history as old as its maple trees, the place held a charm that made it feel like stepping back into a forgotten era. 

**Character:**  Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, the man who lived and breathed pipes, could fix anything from clogged toilets to leaky boilers. Though his work was often mundane, Bart found solace in his ability to bring order and function to the chaos of daily life. At 52 years old, he had seen it all - broken hearts, overflowing dishwashers, and even a few runaway hamsters who decided plumbing wasn't just for the humans after all.

**Opening:**  A rainstorm was hammering against the roof of Old Man Withers' Victorian home, each gust of wind sounding like an angry orchestra crashing its way through the living room window.  The rain lashed down, blurring the streetlights into watery ghosts.  Bart, his hands still sticky with grease, stood hunched over a rusty pipe in the basement, trying to coax life back into a stubborn clog that seemed determined to remain stubbornly deadlocked.

Suddenly, a shiver ran down Bart's spine - a feeling of unease mingled with something else he couldn’t quite place.  The smell of damp earth and a faint hum resonated from the pipes, as if something otherworldly was stirring beneath the floorboards. It was then that Bart noticed the faint, ghostly shimmer on the pipe's surface, like a reflection of an unseen world. 


**End Scene:**  "Well, Mr. Withers," Bart sighed, "looks like there’s more to this plumbing than meets the eye." He stood up, feeling both intrigued and unnerved by the strange incident.  Could this be another story waiting to be written in the messy canvas of life?
