The rhythmic clang of the hammer on granite echoed through Elias Stonehand's workshop, blending with the rasping murmur of the wind whistling down from the craggy peaks that encircled his tiny town of Avani. Elias was a man built like a mountain himself, broad shoulders and calloused hands mirroring the raw beauty of the stone he worked with. Avani was nestled between towering cliffs, its inhabitants fiercely independent yet bound by ancient ties to the land. This quiet life was the only solace Elias had found after his last major project - carving the memorial to the King's Last Stand, an inscription etched into a massive granite slab that was supposed to bring peace after decades of bitter conflict. The stonework had been his magnum opus, his legacy for his family and a symbol of Avaniâ€™s past. 

The stone he worked on now felt different than it had before - heavier, more significant. It wasn't just the granite; it was the weight of years of toil, the echoes of lives lived and lost within its rough contours.  Elias knew that this piece of rock wasn't destined to be a mere monument. Avani needed something more, something born from his own grief and yearning for resolution. He needed to understand what lay dormant in these stones, what message they held beneath their surface.
