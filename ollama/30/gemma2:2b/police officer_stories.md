Rain lashed against the windows of Detective Amelia Sterling's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign outside into an abstract smudge.  The scent of stale coffee clung to her worn-out armchair like a ghost, its warmth offering only a fleeting comfort in the chilly room. It was 3 AM, and the city beyond the rain-streaked glass was a symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens, each note echoing the frantic rhythm beating inside Amelia's chest.  She stared out at the relentless downpour, her mind replaying the gruesome scene she had found earlier that day –  a single, pristine white rose left on the desk of the murdered Detective Jones. 

Detective Jones, a man as gruff as his name suggested, and as dedicated to truth and justice as his reputation demanded. Now, he was gone, another victim in a city where shadows hid more than just secrets, and the lines between reality and nightmare blurred under the relentless pressure of the unforgiving night. Amelia closed her eyes, trying to grasp at anything other than the suffocating tension that clung to her like the wet air on the city street. 

The clock ticked with agonizing slowness. Another victim, another unsolved case. A familiar ache settled in her gut, a feeling she had grown all too accustomed to over the years.  She knew this case would be no different; another tangled web of lies and secrets, another shadow in the night. But even as the rain continued its relentless assault on the world outside, Amelia's resolve hardened, fueled by an unshakeable promise – she wouldn’t let them forget Jones. She couldn’t, not if it was her last case and her last breath.
