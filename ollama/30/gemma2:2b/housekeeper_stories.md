The early morning mist clung to the cobblestones like a forgotten dream, swirling through the gaslights that flickered in their rusty cages across the square. The air was thick with the scent of rain and wood smoke, a familiar perfume on Ashworth's perpetually damp apron.  Her name was Elspeth Ainsley, but everyone called her 'Ash'. She was a housekeeper of habit, a silent guardian to the grand, decaying mansion on Elm Street that housed the eccentric Lord Blackwood - and his collection of forgotten relics. 

Ash knelt in the shadowed doorway of the grand ballroom, her gaze fixed on a dust bunny dancing with the air currents.  It wasn't just the dust; it was the memories lingering there, each speck whispering tales of lavish balls and stolen kisses, whispered secrets between lovers, and perhaps even a bit of sorrow that couldnâ€™t be swept away by even the strongest broom. The mansion seemed to hold its breath in the pre-dawn silence, its heart still beating with echoes of life long gone.
