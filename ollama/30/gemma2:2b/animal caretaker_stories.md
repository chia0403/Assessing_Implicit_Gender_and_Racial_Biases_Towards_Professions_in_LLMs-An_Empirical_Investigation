Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Willow's small shelter, turning it into a blurry world of grey and green.  Willow adjusted her worn beanie as she scurried between rows of cages, checking on her charges: a family of rambunctious squirrels, a grumpy old badger with more teeth than sense, and a collection of exotic birds whose feathers were an array of vibrant colours that seemed almost absurd in the dreary downpour. Her own reflection in a cage's metal door looked tired; sleep-deprived eyes framed by perpetually messy brown hair -  the weight of responsibility was evident on her face, a quiet storm brewing within those wide, expressive eyes. 

Her name was Willow Grace, and she had sworn to care for these creatures, all strays and lost souls, just as she'd been raised in the loving embrace of her own small family farm.  But lately, a creeping unease gnawed at her heart like a hungry fox, leaving her restless and longing for something more than the mundane routine of feeding, cleaning, and documenting their daily life.
