The air hung thick with anticipation and stale perfume as Ezra “Easy” Jackson checked his pockets one last time. He was a beacon of sunshine in a city that wore its melancholy like a tattered coat – even the pigeons seemed to carry a melancholic strut. The hotel, the grand Astor Grand, loomed before him, its ornate facade gleaming against the late-afternoon gloom.  It had seen more weddings, reunions, and whispered promises than any other building on State Street. 

Ezra adjusted his bow tie, hoping it wouldn't clash with the crimson of his coat. He was no stranger to a well-polished smile and a friendly "Welcome home!" but tonight, something felt different. Tonight, he felt like he was carrying not just luggage and baggage, but a secret too heavy for anyone’s shoulders. 

He took a deep breath, ready to face the whirlwind of arrivals, check-ins, and hushed whispers that always surrounded this legendary hotel. He'd been there since before the ink dried on his contract –  the Astor Grand was not just a place; it was a legacy in waiting for him. And tonight, Ezra "Easy" Jackson was about to write the next chapter.
