Rain lashed against the windows of "The Rusty Compass," a bar tucked away on a cobbled side street in Salem's old quarter. The air inside hung thick with the scent of spilled ale, pine needles from the ever-burning fireplace, and a subtle metallic tang that was apparently a signature of Jasper Blackwood's potent concoctions. 

Jasper Blackwood wasn't your typical bartender.  He had eyes like steel and hair the color of raven feathers, which he often kept tucked behind a pair of thick, tortoiseshell glasses. A name whispered by legends around these parts, the whispers claiming he could foresee what was coming next - and sometimes even what was about to be forgotten. Tonight, however, his usual brooding silence was broken by a young woman with eyes as wide and terrified as freshly-fallen snow, clutching her battered purse like a life raft. 

"Help me," she choked out, "someone's after me."
