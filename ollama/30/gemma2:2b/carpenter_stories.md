The salty tang of air hung heavy in the air as Elias Thorne hammered the last nail into the weathered oak frame. It wasn't much to look at – just a plain wooden shed in the corner of his father's carpentry workshop, but to Elias, it was more than that. This shed held promise, whispered secrets of the long-forgotten dreams his father had kept hidden beneath years of sawdust and chipped paint. 

He ran a calloused thumb over the rough surface of the wood, feeling the familiar roughness against his skin. The smell of cedar and pine filled his nostrils, each stroke of the hammer sending a ripple of contentment through him. His work wasn't just about building things; it was about breathing life into them, imbuing every knot and curve with his father's legacy. 

Elias, though only twenty years old, had inherited the quiet determination that ran in the Thorne bloodline – a stubborn streak paired with a keen eye for detail and an unwavering love for all things wood. The workshop was his sanctuary, filled with the symphony of his tools, the scent of sawdust a constant reminder of the beauty he found in every piece of lumber.
