Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows of the old Victorian, each drop a tiny hammer against the silence inside.  The scent of damp plaster hung heavy in the air, thick as fog in an alleyway. Inside, Elara "Ellie" Thorne hunched over a toolbox, its dented metal worn smooth from countless hours spent tinkering and cursing under the flickering fluorescent light.  She was a woman born for circuits, her fingers dancing across copper wire with the grace of a seasoned dancer. Tonight, though, the usual hum of power that powered her world seemed to be crackling with an unfamiliar tension. The storm had been brewing all day, and it mirrored the turmoil within Ellie's own heart.  

Ellie was used to working on the city's forgotten corners - its crumbling infrastructure and the ghosts of past lives. Tonight, however, she found herself drawn to a place whispered about in hushed tones around the local tavern: The Blackwood Manor. A grand estate said to have been cursed by a heartbroken queen and now left abandoned after generations of neglect.  Ellieâ€™s father, a man who'd lived his life as a humble electrician, had always instilled in her a sense of responsibility to mend things, not just power lines, but also the broken pieces of people's lives - at least, that's what he would tell himself before taking another swig from his flask.  Tonight, though, she was facing the possibility of tackling something truly monumental. 

The storm raged on, mirroring the rising anxiety inside Ellie as she looked up at the Manor's decaying facade, its boarded windows reflecting a ghostly version of the city lights that danced around her like fireflies trapped in amber. It seemed impossible - but then again, the power of this darkness always had an unsettling allure, pulling Ellie deeper into its embrace with every surge of electricity and whispered legend.
