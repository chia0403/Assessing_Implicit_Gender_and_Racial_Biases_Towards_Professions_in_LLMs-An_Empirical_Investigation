The air hung thick with the scent of aged leather, sawdust, and iron. It was the kind of smell that clung to your clothes and your soul, as familiar and comforting as an old pair of boots.  This was Bartholomew "Bart" Thorne's domain: The Butcher's Block, a tiny shop tucked away in the back alleys of Old Port City. 

Bart wasn't just any butcher. He possessed an uncanny ability to read the animal's soul –  a skill honed by years of intimate conversation with cows and pigs who had long since settled into his routines and understood the rhythm of his hands. His shop wasn’t just a place for meat; it was a sanctuary, a stage, where each animal became a performer in Bart's grand theatrical display: the precise dance of the cleaver against bone, the graceful arc of the knife across flesh, and finally, the carefully carved masterpiece that emerged from his skilled hands.  

Bart had never felt like he belonged anywhere else, and yet today, a gnawing unease throbbed in his chest as he waited for Mrs. Fitzwilliam's orders – her monthly meat delivery, always delivered with an air of peculiar urgency, was due. He ran a hand over the worn leather apron, its familiar roughness a calming influence. 


He glanced towards the back room where the butcher’s block stood, patiently waiting. It was there that his real work began; not simply cutting meat, but shaping it, carving out its essence to meet the unique needs of each customer.
