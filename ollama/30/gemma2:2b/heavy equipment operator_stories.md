The air hung thick with the scent of diesel and pine needles as Bartholomew "Barnacle" Billingsworth, his massive hands gripping the controls of the bulldozer, wrestled it through the tangled undergrowth. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy of ancient redwoods, casting shifting shadows on the rough-hewn earth. The year was 1947, a time when men still carried axes and shovels alongside their wrenches and pliers, when the whisper of diesel engines spoke louder than machines with flashing lights or whirring blades.  Barnacle's calloused hands knew every curve and crevice of this behemoth, its steel ribs resonating with his own heartbeat as he pushed forward, each pass a rhythmic dance against the obstinate earth. 

The site was nothing short of hostile – tangled vines choked the towering trees, fallen logs formed precarious bridges over hidden ravines, and moss-covered boulders rose like jagged teeth from the ground. This wasn't just logging; it was shaping this forgotten landscape into something new – a stage for the dreams of those who dared to envision a world beyond the confines of their own time.  Barnacle was more than a heavy equipment operator; he was the architect of this transformation, wielding steel and dirt as if they were extensions of his own will.
