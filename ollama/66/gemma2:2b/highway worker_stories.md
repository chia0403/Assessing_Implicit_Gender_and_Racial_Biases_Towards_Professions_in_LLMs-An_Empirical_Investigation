The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Felix "Flash" Mercado's back as he wrestled with a stubborn section of asphalt.  His face, tanned and weathered like the desert floor itself, crinkled into a tight grimace. He was in his element – or as close to it as one could be amidst a sea of yellow machinery and the constant hum of traffic - but even Flash, a man who'd spent a lifetime under the unforgiving gaze of the open road, wasn’t immune to the searing heat. 

His crew had been working on stretch of highway 95 for weeks, trying to keep up with the growing population in the Phoenix suburbs.  They were tasked with widening and repairing sections of the aging infrastructure that connected them all. The project was an endless march of earth movers and concrete mixers, a symphony of noise punctuated by the occasional blast of rock-crushing machinery. 

Flash, his tool belt laden with wrenches and hammers, surveyed the task ahead.  He had been fixing asphalt in this desert town for over two decades. He’d seen it all - from the dust storms that rolled through like angry giants to the quiet solitude of a midnight repair under a sky littered with stars. But tonight, there was a different kind of tension, something thicker than usual hanging in the air.  The normally bustling highway stood eerily silent - an unsettling silence only broken by the rhythmic clangs and groans of his team's efforts.
