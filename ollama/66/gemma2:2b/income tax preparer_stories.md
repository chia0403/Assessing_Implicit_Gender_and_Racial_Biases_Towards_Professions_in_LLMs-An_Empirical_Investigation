The fluorescent hum of the overhead lights seemed to be mocking Amelia's strained focus. Papers piled on her desk like forgotten dreams, each one a microcosm of someone else’s life - hopes and fears reflected in their neatly filled out forms. This was always the week before April 15th, a time when the weight of the tax season pressed down on everyone like a humid summer storm. Amelia knew it well, she'd been a certified income tax preparer for nearly two decades now.

Her small office at "Filing Freedom" was tucked away in the heart of Millwood, a bustling town where life unfolded in neat, predictable seasons - spring cleaning, summer barbecues, autumn pumpkin patches, and winter holidays. The warm tones of the place felt comforting despite the chaos that surrounded her.  But this year, something was different. There was a tension in the air, a feeling of urgency Amelia couldn't quite shake.

Amelia's fingers hovered over her phone, the screen displaying a message: "Meet me at the usual spot – 7 pm." The sender, a cryptic note that left her more confused than intrigued. She was used to a steady stream of clients but this... this felt like the start of something bigger, something she couldn’t decipher.   


**Setting:** A cozy-looking office in Millwood, Connecticut. The walls are warm brown and covered with family portraits.  A well-worn coffee machine sits on one corner, constantly emitting a gentle steam that blends with the scent of old paper and printer ink.
