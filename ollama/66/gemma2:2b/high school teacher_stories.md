## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A dilapidated Victorian mansion perched atop a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic. Stormy waves crashed against the craggy coast, mirroring the tempest raging inside Ms. Eleanor Blackwood's heart. 

**Character:** Ms. Eleanor Blackwood, age 34, was a history teacher at St. Cecilia Academy - an institution renowned for its rigorous academics and even more infamous for its haunted halls. She wasn't afraid of ghosts – she had seen her share in the dusty, forgotten corners of history books.  What scared her were the whispers that seemed to follow her into the silence of empty classrooms after school, echoing her deepest anxieties about facing her own legacy as a Blackwood. 

**Opening:** The last bell hadn't even rung before Ms. Blackwood hurried down the winding staircase in the grand old mansion. She hated this part; the silent house seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something, but not wanting to reveal what that "something" was.  A chill ran down her spine as she passed a shadowed alcove where the once-vibrant tapestry depicting St. Cecilia’s martyrdom now hung tattered and forlorn. The ghostly glow from the fading moonlight cast the room in an eerie silence, punctuated only by the creaking floorboards underfoot. 

"Just another day at the academy," Ms. Blackwood muttered to herself, a familiar feeling of dread settling on her shoulders. She glanced at her reflection in the dusty grand mirror:  her tired eyes held a lifetime’s worth of secrets, their reflection haunted by the whispers echoing through the walls… and something else. Something that felt like a premonition.
