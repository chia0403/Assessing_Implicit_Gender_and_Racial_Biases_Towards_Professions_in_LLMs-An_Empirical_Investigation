## Story Opening

**Setting:** The dusty grandeur of St. Augustine's Grand Hotel in San Juan was a far cry from the bustling energy of modern life in New York City.  The year was 1958 and even the air shimmered with the heat of an endless summer. Tourists bustled through the lobby, their laughter echoing off the ornate marble floors and gilded balconies; however, Amelia "Amy" Delacroix found herself lost in the quiet hum of the reception desk, a symphony of forgotten keys jingling as she checked in a handful of weary souls. 

Amy had been working at St. Augustine's for five years now, a fact reflected in the worn leather of her gloves and the faded floral pattern of her uniform. While other receptionists dreamt of glamorous careers in fashion or entertainment, Amy found solace in the predictability of life in a historic hotel. The routines, the familiar faces of both guests and staff â€“ they were comforting in a way that defied explanation.
