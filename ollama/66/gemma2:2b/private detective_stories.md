Rain lashed against the grimy windows of  "The Rat's Nest," the kind of downpour that sucked all warmth out of even the thickest coat. The air inside hung heavy with cigarette smoke and desperation, just like the city outside. My name’s Jasper “Jack” Thorne, and for five years, this has been my office: a worn leather armchair by a chipped fireplace, stacks of dusty files on every surface, and a perpetually leaking ceiling. 

The phone in my hand buzzed with an unfamiliar number. "Thorne?" I growled into the receiver, the voice on the other end crackling like static over a thousand tin cans. "It's Mr. Sterling. You better come quick."  A chill prickled at the back of my neck, even though it was a muggy November day. The kind of call that meant trouble, and usually, trouble came with a price tag as big as a penthouse suite and a threat that could melt your soul faster than a summer afternoon. 
 
The city's shadows whispered secrets – ones better left buried in the concrete tombs of forgotten dreams. But sometimes, it was these whispers that led to answers, like finding a thread in a tapestry of lies. Tonight, I needed both. A city slicker with a heart as cold as his penthouse windows; and a story that had me chasing ghosts and shadows in a place where hope was the rarest commodity.
