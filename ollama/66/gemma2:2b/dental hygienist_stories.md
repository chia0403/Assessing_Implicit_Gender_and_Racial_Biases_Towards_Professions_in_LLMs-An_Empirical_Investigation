The aroma of chlorinated water and peppermint was almost a second skin to Elara Thorne by this point. After years spent working as a dental hygienist in Dr. Evans's bustling office in the heart of Downtown San Francisco, she could smell its signature blend even from a block away. The air hung heavy with the fluorescent hum of X-ray machines and the gentle clink of metal instruments being sterilized – all perfectly orchestrated for the 9am pre-dawn chaos that was her daily ritual.

Elara stood at the entrance to the waiting room, adjusting her blue scrubs before sighing heavily as she surveyed the chaotic scene unfolding in front of her: a young boy with sticky fingers and an air of defiance perched on the edge of his seat, his eyes wide with what she hoped wasn't fear; a nervous couple whose smiles were more forced than genuine, their hands clasped tightly; and Mrs. Henderson, always at odds with the dental chair despite a lifetime of clean teeth, complaining about the temperature in the room like it personally offended her. 

Her mind wandered to the upcoming appointment – the one with Mr. Garcia, who'd never been particularly keen on going to the dentist. Today was his first visit since the accident last month, and Elara felt a strange mix of responsibility and anticipation as she awaited Dr. Evans's entrance. The man's health had become a silent question mark in her life, and he held the key to unraveling it.
