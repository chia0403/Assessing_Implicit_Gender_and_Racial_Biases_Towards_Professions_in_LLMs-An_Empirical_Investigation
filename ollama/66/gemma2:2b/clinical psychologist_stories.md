Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the cityscape into a kaleidoscope of blues and grays. Inside, the plush leather armchair that he normally found so inviting seemed to mock him with its silent comfort.  Elias rubbed his weary eyes, trying to ignore the persistent ache in his temples that mirrored the thunder outside. It had been a long week, filled with anxieties and secrets that clung like fog, refusing to dissipate. 

His latest patient was proving especially difficult. He called himself "Victor", but Elias knew there was more to him than just a name. He'd brought Victor in for what he thought was a standard case of social anxiety, but something in the way Victor spoke about his life, his voice tight and strained like an unstrung violin string, had set Elias on edge. 

Victor needed Elias to see beyond the superficial, through the fog of anxieties that seemed to suffocate him. The rain outside mirrored the storm brewing within him; the pressure was building, threatening to burst at any moment.  Elias knew this was only the beginning. He just hoped he could navigate this turbulent sea of emotions and help Victor find his way back to calm before he himself went under.
