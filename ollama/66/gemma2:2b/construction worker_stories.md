The air hung thick and heavy over Riverton like a wet blanket, the kind that pressed you down with its dampness and clung to your skin even after a shower.  Reginald "Reg" Thornton squinted through the haze of morning mist that rolled off the rushing Riverton Creek, his worn leather work boots kicking up dust on the gravel path. The sun was only beginning to crest the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and fading orange - a sunrise meant for poets, not construction workers like Reg. 

His company had been hired to renovate the old Millhaven Diner, its tired facade a beacon of forgotten times that now stood on the cusp of being reimagined.  A dilapidated relic in the middle of Riverton's bustling downtown, it was set for demolition and replacement with a gleaming modern eatery. It was this very demolition site - the one Reg was tasked with overseeing - that held the promise of something more than just another job to him. 

Riverton had always been more than just his hometown; it was a canvas he'd grown up painting, brick by brick, in the faded blue overalls he wore like a second skin. This place held memories, some bittersweet and others joyful, all woven into the fabric of his life. The old diner, for instance, represented a time when life moved at a different pace, when conversations flowed over plates of greasy fries, and the clatter of dishes was music to Reg's ears. And he knew, deep down, that this new, modern version would not erase those memories but merely replace them with newer ones - ones he hoped would be just as vibrant and colorful as the town itself.
