The frigid air bit at Elara's exposed cheeks as she trudged through the blizzard, each step echoing off the snow-laden stone walls of Castle Aerilon. The wind howled like a wounded beast, whipping snowflakes into swirling eddies that obscured her vision.  Her breath formed small clouds in the biting cold, and her thick furs did little to ward off the relentless assault. Elara tightened her grip on her sword hilt, its worn leather reassuringly smooth beneath her fingers. 

For years, sheâ€™d patrolled these snow-choked grounds as a guard, sworn to protect the city of Aerilon and its people from any threat, human or beast.  But tonight, even the usual sense of duty seemed tainted with an edge of dread. The king had grown agitated, his usual jovial demeanor replaced by a deep frown that tightened the lines on his face like winter frost. Elara knew he was harboring secrets, anxieties swirling in their castle's shadowy corners, and she felt drawn to uncover them, even if it meant facing the storm herself.
