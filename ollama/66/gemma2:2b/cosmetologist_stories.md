## Story Opening: The Fade Out

**Setting:** A sun-drenched salon tucked away on a quiet street in Savannah, Georgia. Palm trees sway gently against the windows, casting dancing shadows across the worn but luxurious furniture and plush velvet chairs. 

**Main character's name:** Elara Beaumont, known to her clients as "Ellie"

Elara Beaumont stood at her station – a testament to decades of devoted service to her clientele. Her hands, long and nimble like dancers', were covered in an iridescent powder, the remnants of a recent client's glamorous mermaid-inspired transformation.  She gazed into the mirror, meticulously combing through her hair as a gentle breeze wafted in from the open window. It was nearly time for closing, but instead of the usual quiet hum of preparation for tomorrow’s appointments, there was an unsettling silence. The air felt heavy, thick with something she couldn't quite name. 

A single strand of blonde hair fell across Elara's forehead, and she brushed it back with a practiced ease.  The clock on the wall ticked down towards midnight, each second echoing the growing tension within her. It wasn't just the usual pre-closing blues; this felt different. A feeling that something was about to fade out.
