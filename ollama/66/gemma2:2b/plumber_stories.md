## The Rusty Wrench & The Rain-Soaked Alley

Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of the apartment like a thousand tiny fists, each one pounding out a rhythm against the already warped glass. Inside, the air hung heavy with the smell of burnt coffee and stale cigarettes. **Elias Thorne**, his hands calloused from years spent wrestling with stubborn pipes and leaking faucets, sat hunched over a half-empty mug of lukewarm tea. Outside, the alley behind his building was a symphony of misery – overflowing trash bins groaned under the weight of their refuse, rats scurried in the shadows, and puddles gathered, reflecting the flickering neon signs of the nearby diner in a distorted, watery sheen.

Tonight, Elias wasn't even close to dealing with the usual chaos. The job he had just finished was… unusual. A high-society couple with a penchant for vintage lamps called him for a "rejuvenation" of their antique bathroom fixtures. It involved replacing old pipes and cleaning out a century’s worth of grime, but what Elias found truly perplexing was the strange, almost childish glee in Mrs. Featherstone's voice when she explained it all. 

It wasn't just the joy in her voice; there was an underlying… urgency. Like she couldn't wait to get back into that dripping, leaky, antique bathroom and start playing with something other than her collection of vintage teacups. Something about Mrs. Featherstone made Elias uneasy, but he had long since learned not to rely on gut feelings when a job was just another pipe and fixture in the grand scheme of life. 

Except this time, it felt different.
