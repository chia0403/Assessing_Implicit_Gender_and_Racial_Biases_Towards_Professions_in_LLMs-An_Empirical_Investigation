The aroma of ginger and turmeric hung thick in the air of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Sterling's small apartment kitchen, battling with the lingering scent of burnt chamomile tea that clung to her last-minute attempt at holistic wellness.  Across the worn linoleum counter sat Ethan, a man whose gaunt frame seemed to shrink under the glow of his phone screen, highlighting the worry etched around his tired eyes. Amy ran a hand through her already messy bun, pulling a heavy sigh into her voice as she spoke. 

"Ethan, you look like you've been wrestling with a dragon. What is it this time?"  She peered at him from beneath her glasses, their silver frames catching the faint light spilling in from the kitchen window. The setting was quaint - a cozy haven of chipped teacups and worn bookshelves – yet its normalcy felt suffocating against the weight of Ethan's worry. 

Ethan swallowed, his gaze flickering between Amy and the phone screen as he mumbled, "It's... It's my mom.  She's not eating properly and the doctors are worried." His voice cracked with unspoken fear, a tremor in his otherwise stiff posture. "I'm running out of ideas and..." He trailed off, leaving a palpable silence to hang heavy between them. The setting sun cast long shadows across the kitchen floor, blurring the line between reality and Amy’s growing sense of urgency.  Her heart pounded a frantic rhythm against her ribs as she knew this was more than just Ethan's usual anxieties; this felt different, darker.
