Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst on the glass as if trying to pierce the veil between worlds. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Croft hunched over her desk, the scent of stale coffee and old newspapers heavy in the air. The flickering neon glow of the city outside cast a sickly green hue on her face, etched with fatigue lines that could only be described as "lived." 

Her story was one she'd chased for weeks: the shadowy whispers of illegal organ harvesting in the decaying alleys of New Alexandria. A place where hope and despair choked each other in equal measure, where poverty bred desperation and desperation led to unthinkable acts. Amy knew this. She lived here, her family roots deep in this city's underbelly. 

The weight of unspoken stories pressed down on her like a physical burden.  Her notebook lay open next to a pile of crumpled newspaper clippings: the faces of the victims, their eyes wide with fear and desperation. This was more than just a story; it was a fight for justice in a city where even the law itself seemed to crumble under the pressure of greed and corruption.
