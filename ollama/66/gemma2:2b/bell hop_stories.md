The air in the Grand Aurora Hotel was thick with the scent of stale cigars and forgotten dreams.  Even the faint glimmer of moonlight struggled to pierce the heavy curtains that veiled the expansive lobby, casting long shadows like grasping hands on the plush carpets. It was here, amidst the grandeur of a thousand shimmering chandeliers and marble fountains, that Arthur Blackwood, known by his fellow bellhops as "Artie" for short, found himself wrestling with an unfortunate combination of fatigue and despair.  The job – always so glamorous, he'd been told, like stepping onto a stage right out of an old movie – had instead turned into a nightly grind of lugging luggage and chasing stray cats through opulent hallways.

His usual routine was set in stone: greet each guest with a smile stiff as a marionette, follow their every whim (even the most bizarre ones), carry heavy suitcases up and down multiple flights of stairs, all while pretending to be enthused by the endless stream of "How are you this evening?"'s. Tonight was especially tiresome; the hotel had attracted a particularly boisterous party of socialites with a penchant for loud music and even louder arguments.  Artie longed for his old life as a college student: dusty study corners, quiet nights reading poetry, and the comforting warmth of the coffee machine in the dorm common room.
