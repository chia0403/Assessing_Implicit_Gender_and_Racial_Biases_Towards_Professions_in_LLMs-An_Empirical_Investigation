## The Scent of Salt & Secrets

**Setting:** A bustling seaside town called Havenwood on the Oregon coast, where weathered clapboard houses hug the rocky shoreline.  The salty air stings Amelia's face as she steps out of her small car, a canvas-covered wagon creaking in its tow behind. 

**Character:** Dr. Amelia Bellweather. Though just in her early thirties, Amelia carries the weight of years on her shoulders, both from running her own bustling veterinary clinic, "Pawsitive Vibes," and from the lingering tragedy that has left her jaded and guarded.  The warmth of the Oregon sunshine is a familiar balm to her soul, but she struggles with finding true happiness amidst the quiet solitude.

**Story Opening:**  A seagull calls out, its cry echoing against the backdrop of crashing waves. Amelia's gaze drifts over the sand-swept beach as she walks towards the clinic, her worn boots crunching on the damp grains. The familiar scent of salt and seaweed washes over her. Her eyes fall on a small, silver box nestled amidst the clutter of her office.  Inside it lies a faded photograph of a young girl with sea-green eyes and a mischievous grin - the only remaining clue to unraveling a secret that has haunted her for years.
