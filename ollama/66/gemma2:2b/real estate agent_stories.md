Rain lashed against the windows of "Magnolia Manor," a historic Victorian house on Oak Street in charming yet notoriously competitive Hudsonville. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Carter, her auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun, surveyed the cluttered living room. Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunbeams filtering through stained glass, illuminating chipped porcelain dolls nestled amongst floral wallpaper and forgotten tea sets. 

It was Amy's second week selling Magnolia Manor, a task she relished â€“ not for its potential profits, but for the chance to restore its faded glory and perhaps even learn a thing or two about herself along the way.  The previous owner, Mrs. Peabody, had been a recluse in her own right, a woman rumored to be both brilliant and eccentric, who'd left behind only echoes of her past: cryptic journals filled with forgotten recipes, dusty photo albums depicting bygone Hudsonville, and an air of unspoken sadness that permeated the very walls.
