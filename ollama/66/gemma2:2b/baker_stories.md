The air hung heavy with the scent of yeast and woodsmoke, mingling in a heady perfume that clung to Elara Blackwood's apron like a second skin. The aroma, always intoxicating, seemed even more potent this evening as she surveyed her bakery, nestled amongst the quaint, cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Elara, known by everyone from the baker's wife down to the postman for her delicate pastries and unwavering spirit, was preparing for the annual Harvest Festival.

For Elara, the festival wasn’t just about pumpkin spice cookies and apple pies. It was a symphony of tradition, each element playing its part in a ritualized dance around the harvest moon. Every year, she baked not only sustenance but also memories—for this was her legacy:  memories woven into every crumb, every flaky crust. But tonight, something felt different. A tension lay thick as honey in the air. The usual jovial chatter of families discussing their recipes and plans for the festival had been replaced by a hushed silence, punctuated only by Elara's rhythmic kneading. 


This year, Oakhaven faced its first drought in decades, leaving the once-abundant land barren and parched.  Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.  And Elara, her brow furrowed with concern as she glanced at the wilting sunflowers growing on the windowsill, felt that the festival’s usual light was dimming.
