The humid New Jersey air hung heavy, clinging to Dr. Elias Thorne like an unwanted guest. It mirrored the unease festering in his chest as he stared out at the shimmering surface of Lake Hopatcong.  His lab bench was littered with discarded coffee cups and empty vials, each one a monument to a failed experiment.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting sickly-green shadows that danced with every gust of wind through the open window. 

Elias wasn't a man easily deterred. For years, he had devoted his life to unraveling the mysteries of consciousness. He believed, with unwavering conviction, that understanding the human mind held the key to unlocking humanity's potential for growth and progress. But lately, his research seemed stagnant, the endless trials leading him further down a rabbit hole of dead ends. 

He’d poured his heart and soul into this project – Project Aurora, he’d called it. It was supposed to unlock the secrets of memory encoding, a breakthrough that could rewrite the future of human potential. But every iteration had yielded nothing but frustration.  Elias' wife's gentle voice, a soft echo from a life outside the lab, urged him to take a break. He glanced at the worn photo on his desk - a picture of her, her eyes shining with warmth and laughter, framed by the golden glow of the setting sun. 

A sudden crash echoed from down the hallway.  Elias flinched. It was just the wind playing tricks on him. But then he saw it – a shimmer in the reflection of the lake, as if something had shifted between reality and fantasy. Was this his mind playing tricks on him? The lab door creaked open, and a woman with piercing blue eyes and a shock of red hair stood silhouetted against the setting sun.  
 
"Dr. Thorne," she said, her voice like ice in the summer night. "We need to talk."
