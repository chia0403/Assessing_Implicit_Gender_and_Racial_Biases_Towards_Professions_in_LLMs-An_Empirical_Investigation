The air hung heavy with rain and diesel smoke as Lieutenant Amelia "Amy" Hayes, Station 42's bravest (and most caffeine-deprived) firefighter, stepped out of her truck. The storm had been relentless, churning up the streets of Oakhaven like a miniature hurricane. Her uniform clung to her damp skin as she surveyed the scene: an old mill building, its silhouette jagged against the bruised sky. 

The call hadn't been easy - reports of possible structural damage and trapped workers.  Amy couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. The storm had a bite, a sense of urgency that made her skin prickle. This wasn't just another call; this was Oakhaven in the throes of a weather fury, and Amy had to get down there before it was too late. 


**Setting:**  Oakhaven is a quaint seaside town known for its fishing industry and charming cobblestone streets. However, beneath the cozy facade lies a history of hidden secrets and industrial decay. The mill building in question is an ancient structure with a dark past, rumored to house forgotten accidents and whispers of a ghost trapped within its walls.
