The wind whipped through the overgrown fields surrounding Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  A chill hung in the air that seemed to cling to even the warmest spots beneath the sprawling oak canopy.  Even at his best, Silas wouldn't call the setting "idyllic" - more like a haunted stage, all shadowed corners and rustling whispers.  He adjusted the battered cap perched atop his head, its faded maroon shade blending almost entirely with the rust-tinged leaves that littered his once bright yellow overalls. 

Silas Blackwood was no stranger to hardship, but even he couldn't quite explain why this job felt so... heavy, a weight pressing down on him like a leaden cloak.  For years, the manor had been a silent symphony of whispers and shadows, each breeze carrying with it stories of long-dead families, their secrets locked within the creaky floorboards and cold stone walls. It was a place where he felt both deeply understood and utterly alone.
