The wind, a constant companion in this town nestled between jagged peaks and a churning sea, whipped at Finnigan "Finn" O’Connell's worn Stetson as he surveyed the half-finished building.  Sunlight glinted off the rusted metal of a dilapidated old crane, its shadow stretching across the dusty work site like a skeletal hand reaching for the sky. The air was thick with the smell of sawdust, tar, and salt - a potent cocktail that whispered of long days, hard work, and forgotten dreams in this forgotten corner of the world. 

Finn had known nothing but the rhythm of the roof -  the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against wood, the groan of the aging structure as he lifted shingles, the wind whistling through the gaps like a restless spirit. Now, at forty years old, the familiar scent and sounds were starting to feel more than just work. Finn was built for this rhythm; for the solidity of wood planks and steel beams, for the quiet satisfaction of building something that would stand against the whims of time. 

But this job – his father's legacy – held a different kind of weight.  His dad had built these homes, brick by brick, with a grit and determination that Finn knew was fueled by more than just the call of the trade. It was tied to something deeper, an unspoken promise whispered in the wind itself.

**Setting:** A small coastal town, nestled between rugged mountains and the tumultuous sea. The town is known for its fishing industry and weathered wooden homes with strong roofs, built to withstand harsh weather.
