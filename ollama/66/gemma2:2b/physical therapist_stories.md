The worn leather creaked beneath Amelia's calloused hands as she adjusted the straps on the wheelchair. The humid air clung to her like a second skin, heavy with the smell of disinfectant and stale sweat. She scanned the crowded waiting room, noting a smattering of faces: elderly patients clutching their loved ones’ hands, teenagers slumped against the wall, and children bouncing in plastic chairs, their eyes wide with curiosity.  This was the everyday reality of her life: a symphony of pain, motion, and hope played out on the stage of every hospital floor.

Amelia, known to most simply as "Millie," had spent years meticulously building a career specializing in post-rehab exercises for stroke patients. The physical scars from the invisible battles they waged against paralysis were etched deep within her soul. Yet, today was different - a wave of anxiety gripped Millie's chest as she surveyed the room. This wasn't just another day at the office. Today marked the first time she was treating someone with something truly unprecedented: a patient with a rare neurological disorder that hadn’t been diagnosed for years.  It was an opportunity, but also an enormous challenge.

A figure in the back corner caught Millie’s eye. A young man, barely out of his teens, sat hunched in silence, his head bowed low. His gaze met hers for a brief moment before he looked away, shame swirling beneath his eyes. He held onto his wheelchair – its metal frame gleaming under the fluorescent light – like it was an anchor against the churning sea of uncertainty that seemed to be engulfing him.
