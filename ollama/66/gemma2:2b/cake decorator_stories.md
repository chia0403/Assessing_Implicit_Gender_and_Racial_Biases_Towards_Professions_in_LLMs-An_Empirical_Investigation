## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the colorful storefront displays into a watercolour mess. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of vanilla, sugar, and something akin to despair – a mixture only amplified by the mournful accordion playing on the corner. The name "Cakeland" wasn't just written in flourishes across the awning; it was literally etched onto the bakery itself, a testament to its owner, Elsie Butterfield. 

Elsie herself, her face hidden behind a veil of flour-dusted bangs and a frown as deep as a double cream frosting swirl, stood at her stainless steel countertop. Her hands, usually nimble with floral buttercream swirls and delicate piped designs, were currently frozen, their movements sluggish under the weight of failure. A single chocolate cake sat precariously on its stand, a victim of Elsie's latest artistic blunder – a lopsided mountain peak that refused to rise, even after hours of meticulous piping and re-piping. 

The shop door creaked open again, letting in another storm and another soul seeking solace in the sweetness of life's little luxuries. But this time, Elsie felt no excitement for the familiar faces or their eager smiles, only a growing sense of hollow defeat that mirrored the rain falling on the city outside.
