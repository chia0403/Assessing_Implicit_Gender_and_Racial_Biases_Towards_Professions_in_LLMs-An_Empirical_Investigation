## The Whispering Walls 

**Setting:** 1920s Chicago - A bustling metropolis with whispers of scandal, ambition, and secrets lurking in its shadowy corners.  The Art Deco skyline reflects off the rain-slicked streets as Amelia "Amy" Dubois, secretary to the enigmatic Mr. Reginald Blackwood, navigates the labyrinthine office building. The air is thick with cigar smoke, dust motes dancing in the fluorescent lights overhead, and the faint scent of old money and forbidden desires. 

**Opening:**  The heavy mahogany door clicked shut behind Amy as she walked into Mr. Blackwood's private office. The walls were lined with antique maps that seemed to pulse with unseen energy. A portrait of a woman with melancholic eyes stared down at her, the only other piece of furniture in the room. Amy felt like an explorer entering a lost civilization, surrounded by history and mystery. 

"Amy," Mr. Blackwood's voice was a velvet rasp, "I need you to prepare me for tonight's meeting." His smile, when he looked up from his newspaper, was both unsettlingly predatory and faintly tragic.  The room felt like it held its breath, waiting for her response. A shiver ran down Amy's spine. It wasn't the formality of the request - she knew how to handle a man as formidable as Mr. Blackwood, but there was something else in the air tonight. The weight of secrets seemed to press upon Amy, pressing her against the edge of her chair as she took a deep breath and began to prepare.
