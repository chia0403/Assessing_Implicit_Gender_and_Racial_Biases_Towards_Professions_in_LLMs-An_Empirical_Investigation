##  Setting the Stage

**Location:** A dilapidated lighthouse on a windswept clifftop overlooking the turbulent Atlantic Ocean. 

**Year:** 1943

**Main Character:** Dr. Alistair Blackwood - a gifted physician with a haunted past and an unwavering dedication to saving lives.  Years of witnessing tragedy in war-torn Europe have left their mark, etching lines of despair into his usually warm brown eyes. He prefers the solitude of his work to the chaos of people, finding solace amidst the quiet hum of machinery within the lighthouse's old generator room.

**Setting Opening:**

Rain lashed against the rusted metal of the lighthouse, a rhythmic counterpoint to the howling wind that buffeted its ancient walls. Inside, Dr. Blackwood meticulously documented his latest discovery on the tattered medical charts, the faint smell of antiseptic and sea salt lingering in the air.  The storm had been raging for days, but a different kind of storm brewed within him - a tempest of guilt and fear. He had taken care of Mrs. Mallory's son, James, just a week ago, his chest ravaged by a fever that could never be fully explained. But there was no answer in the lab reports, no logic to the boy's sudden demise. 

James had been more than a patient; he had been hope, a fleeting spark of optimism in a world drowning in despair. Now, with each passing day, the void left by Jamesâ€™s absence felt as vast and unforgiving as the ocean roaring outside. Dr. Blackwood knew he couldn't allow fear to consume him, but the haunting weight of his responsibility threatened to pull him under.  He needed answers, and they were elusive, like the echoes of a long-forgotten lullaby. He needed something - anything - to quell the growing tide of uncertainty within him.
