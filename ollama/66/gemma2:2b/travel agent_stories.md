The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and anticipation, a heady cocktail that Amelia "Amy" Sterling found intoxicatingly familiar. Her small office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, was awash in sunshine streaming through the gaudy stained glass windows. Every inch of it was adorned with maps, postcards, and framed photos of exotic locales – all reminders of her passion for travel, for adventure, for escaping the mundane. 

Amy ran "Sterling Journeys" - a name that held an air of class and sophistication, but one she’d painstakingly built herself from humble beginnings. She dealt in bespoke trips, crafting itineraries around a client's deepest desires – be it a rugged trek through Nepal's Himalayas or a leisurely cruise down the Nile River.  

But today was different. Today, Amy found herself at the helm of a whirlwind of emotions as she prepared for her most challenging and personal assignment yet: a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Antarctica for an eccentric billionaire's 70th birthday. It wasn’t just the destination that felt daunting - it was the man behind it all,  Mr. Julian Thorne. A ruthless businessman with a reputation that stretched from Wall Street to world-renowned art museums, and now, to Amy's surprise, an invitation to witness his most private adventure: a journey into the icy wilderness.
