Rain lashed against the library windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Evelyn Thorne's heart as she reread the faded letter again. The ink was so thin it practically disappeared on the brittle parchment; each word a shard of glass catching and shattering in her chest. 

Evelyn, the last remaining guardian of the Blackwood Archive nestled within the ancient stone walls of Blackwood House, felt like a moth drawn to a flickering flameâ€”a flicker that promised both hope and despair. The letter, bearing the faded hand of a long-forgotten ancestor, held the key to unlocking a family legacy she had only ever dreamed about: her missing twin sister's truth. 

The year was 1947, the setting Blackwood House, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the turbulent North Sea. The rain was relentless, turning the cobblestone path leading to the house into a mirror reflecting the swirling grey sky. 


**Character:** Evelyn Thorne - A sharp-witted and introspective librarian with a deep love for history and an unshakeable sense of duty to her family legacy.
