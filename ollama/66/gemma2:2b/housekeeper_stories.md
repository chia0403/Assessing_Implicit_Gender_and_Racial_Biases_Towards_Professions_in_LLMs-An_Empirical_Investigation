Rain lashed against the windows of Featherstone Manor like tiny fists trying to punch their way through the heavy pane glass. Inside, Elspeth Hawthorn meticulously polished silver spoons in the flickering gaslight glow, her face set in a tired frown. The air was thick with the scent of lavender polish and damp wool, a familiar aroma that clung to the house's dusty corners despite its opulent grandeur. For years, she’d been the silent caretaker of Featherstone Manor, a world apart from the bustling life Elspeth had grown accustomed to back in London. 

At the edge of the ornate mahogany staircase leading to the grand library, her gaze fell upon Lady Blackwood's untouched tea set on the marble pedestal by the fireplace. The Lady’s usual vibrant floral patterns were replaced with a stark white and black motif, each piece as cold and empty as the woman herself. Elspeth had been tasked with caring for the ailing Lady since her husband's passing, but even after months of tending to her every whim, she found little solace in the isolation that now surrounded her.  

The storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Elspeth - a churning storm of longing, anxiety, and an unshakeable sense that something truly dreadful awaited them all within those closed-off walls.
