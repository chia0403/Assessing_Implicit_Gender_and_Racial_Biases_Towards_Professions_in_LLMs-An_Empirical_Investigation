The numbers danced before her eyes â€“ a dizzying waltz of debits and credits, each one mocking her dwindling hope.  Her life, once a well-ordered symphony of spreadsheets and invoices, had descended into an unsettling dissonance. A month's worth of late payments, a missing deposit from Mrs. Peabody's estate, and the sudden departure of her partner, Arthur, had left her drowning in a sea of financial anxiety.

**Main Character:** Amelia Thorne - A sharp and meticulous bookkeeper whose life is crumbling under the weight of her circumstances.
