## The Whispering Dust

**Setting:** A crumbling, Victorian manor hidden away on a sleepy corner of London.  The late afternoon sun casts long shadows through dusty, leaded glass windows onto worn Persian rugs in ornate halls. Outside, rain pattered against the chipped marble facade like a mournful drumbeat. 

**Main Character:** **Reginald "Reg" Featherstonhaugh**, a man whose life was as predictable as the dust motes dancing in the weak sunlight. For twenty years, he'd been the manor's humble janitor, his days marked by the repetitive rhythm of sweeping, polishing, and mopping the vast halls and decaying rooms.  

**Opening:**  

Reg ran his worn-out mop across the floor, its metallic head scraping against chipped tiles. A low groan emanated from the floorboards beneath him, a sound as familiar as the creak of his own joints. He grimaced, wincing at the dampness that always clung to the old wood. “Just another Tuesday,” he sighed, turning his worn-out hat over in his calloused hand. His boots thudded against the cold stone floor as he made his way down a hallway lined with faded portraits of long-vanished ancestors, each face frozen in a silent scream.  Suddenly, a whisper brushed against Reg's ear. It wasn't the wind whistling through the broken chimney, nor the creak of the ancient staircase. This was something else, something heavy and laced with fear. 

He paused, listening. The whisper was faint, almost imperceptible at first, like smoke from a forgotten fire. Then, it became more distinct, echoing in the vast emptiness of the house: "She's coming…"  It clung to him like cobwebs, each word dripping with an unsettling dread. Reg straightened, his eyes flickering towards the grand staircase that led upwards, shrouded in perpetual shadow.
