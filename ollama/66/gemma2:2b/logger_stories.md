The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth.  A mist clung to the forest floor like a shroud, blurring the jagged edges of ancient pines towering above him. Even through his worn, leather jacket, the chill seeped into Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's bones, making each movement an effort. He hunched deeper into his thick wool beanie, pulling it further down over his face as he surveyed the sprawling clearing. The lumberjack's eyes, a sharp blue under the pale winter sun, scanned the rows of felled trees, searching for the telltale sign – the rust-colored stain marking a freshly cut branch. 

The silence wasn't complete; the low hum of distant machinery and the occasional crack of a tree snapping served as a constant reminder of the relentless march of progress. But it was a silence Teddy cherished - a silence born out of years spent in the heart of the woods, a silence that spoke volumes about the unforgiving world around him. It was a world he knew intimately, a world where the whisper of wind through leaves held secrets as old as time itself. He had grown up amongst this wilderness, learning its rhythms and accepting the brutal demands it placed on his soul. 


His work boots crunched over the frost-covered ground as Teddy started towards his truck – a rusted beast that served him faithfully for years.  He was the last man standing in the clearing, before the dawn broke and the other workers would return to town with their tales of felled trees and stories of hard-won glory.
