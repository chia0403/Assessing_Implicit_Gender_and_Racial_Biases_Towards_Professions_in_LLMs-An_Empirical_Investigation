Rain lashed against the attic window, blurring the already fading light of dusk. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing away a stray strand of grey hair that had escaped her bun. The manuscript lay open on her desk, the words swimming before her tired eyes. It was a historical romance, all sweeping declarations and improbable duels, and Eleanor, for all her years in the publishing industry, couldn't muster even a flicker of interest.

The attic office of her Victorian home, usually bathed in warm sunlight, felt cold and oppressive tonight. Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple over, their spines promising fantastical adventures and gritty realism, yet all Eleanor could see were deadlines and dwindling enthusiasm. Her career, once filled with the thrill of discovering new voices, had become a monotonous cycle of red pen marks and strained negotiations with demanding authors.


Eleanor longed for something different, something that would ignite her passion for storytelling once more. But what? She glanced at the overflowing bookshelves lining the walls, a testament to a life spent immersed in words. Perhaps it was time for a change, a chance to break free from the predictable rhythm of her editing life and embrace something new.  

The insistent drumming of rain against the windowpane seemed to echo this sentiment, urging her towards an unknown horizon.
