The scent of decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet reminder that autumn had arrived at Blackwood Manor. Elias Thorne, his weathered face framed by a halo of silver hair, shuffled along the cobblestone path, a battered rake clutched in his gnarled hands. The manor loomed above him, its gothic silhouette stark against the bruised twilight sky. Its windows, dark and vacant, stared down like watchful eyes. Elias had tended these grounds for over forty years, each season leaving its mark on him just as it did on the sprawling estate. 

He paused at the edge of the rose garden, where withered blooms clung stubbornly to their thorny stems. A shiver danced down his spine, a prickle of unease he couldn't quite explain. Something felt different this year, a subtle shift in the air, a weight pressing down on him like an unseen hand.  

Elias knelt, carefully plucking a fallen rose and tucking it behind his ear. He always loved roses - their fleeting beauty mirroring the ephemeral nature of life itself. But today, even their delicate scent seemed tinged with melancholy.
