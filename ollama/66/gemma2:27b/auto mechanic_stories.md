The rusted groan of a 1978 Chevy Nova’s door echoed through Elias “Eli” Thorne’s cluttered workshop. A symphony of clanging tools, whirring fans, and the distant rumble of traffic on Route 66 punctuated the sound. Eli squinted at the Nova's dented fender, his grease-stained hands tracing the faded emerald paint. The Arizona sun beat down through the open bay door, turning the concrete floor into a baking sheet.

Eli, with his shock of unruly red hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through machinery, sighed. This wasn't exactly the classic muscle car he dreamed of restoring, but it was paying the bills. And besides, every car had its own story, even this rusty relic. He could already picture the young couple who'd once cruised Route 66 in this Nova, their laughter echoing through the open windows, the radio blasting classic rock.  He wondered what had happened to them, what adventures they'd gone on, and why this car had ended up abandoned in his dusty yard.

Eli grabbed a wrench, ready to delve into the Nova's secrets. He knew every bolt, every hose, every gear like the back of his hand. This wasn’t just a job; it was an art form, a way of connecting with history and giving life back to forgotten machines. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck hinted at something more than just engine trouble waiting under the hood.
