The pungent scent of iron and salt hung heavy in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Barty" Butcher's thick apron like a second skin.  Morning light, still pale and hesitant, filtered through the dusty windowpanes of his shop, illuminating streaks of crimson staining the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Hollow Creek were just beginning to stir with life â€“ fishmongers hawking their wares, milkmaids clinking pails against their skirts, and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer punctuating the quiet hum of the town awakening.

But inside "Barty's Best Cuts", time seemed to move at its own pace, dictated by the rhythmic thud of cleavers and the steady drip of blood from the carcasses hanging in the cool back room. Barty, a man built like an ox with hands as rough as sandpaper, surveyed his inventory with a critical eye. Today was market day, and he needed every cut to be perfect, every sausage plump and juicy, every bone stripped clean. His livelihood depended on it.

Yet, despite the familiar routine, a knot of unease tightened in Barty's gut. Something felt off. A whisper of apprehension carried on the morning breeze, unsettling the usual calm of his world.
