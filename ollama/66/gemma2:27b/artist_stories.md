Rain lashed against the grimy skylight of Eliza Beaumont’s attic studio, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound on the corrugated plastic. The air hung heavy with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, punctuated by the acrid tang of burnt coffee from the forgotten mug nestled beside her easel.  Eliza, hair escaping its braid and splattered with paint, stood back from her canvas, squinting through the gloom. 

The cityscape she was attempting to capture - a sprawling vista of rain-slicked cobblestone streets and looming Victorian buildings – seemed stubbornly resistant to her brushstrokes. Buildings leaned at unnatural angles, shadows refused to cooperate, and the distant gleam of gaslights looked more like the glint of alien eyes peering through the mist. Frustration tightened in Eliza's chest, a familiar ache that accompanied many late nights spent wrestling with her art.
