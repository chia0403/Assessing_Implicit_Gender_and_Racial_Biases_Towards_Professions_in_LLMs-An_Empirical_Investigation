Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The mahogany desk, usually polished to a gleam, was cluttered with case files, half-eaten sandwiches, and empty coffee mugs. A faint scent of stale tobacco lingered in the air, a testament to Elias's late nights spent poring over legal documents. He was known for his relentless pursuit of justice, even when it meant bending the rules.

Tonight, however, the case before him felt different. It wasn't the usual corporate greed or white-collar crime. This involved a young woman, Amelia Hayes, accused of arson and facing years in prison. Elias had never met her, but something about her wide, pleading eyes in the mugshot gnawed at his conscience. He knew she was innocent â€“ he could feel it in his bones.

The clock ticked relentlessly towards midnight, each second pushing him closer to a decision that could make or break Amelia's life. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, heavy as the rain-soaked city outside.
