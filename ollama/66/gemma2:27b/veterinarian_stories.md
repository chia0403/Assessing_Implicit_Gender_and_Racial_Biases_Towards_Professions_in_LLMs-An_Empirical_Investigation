The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and fear. Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the makeshift clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow on Amelia Rose Cartwright's already frayed nerves. The flickering fluorescent light cast long, grotesque shadows on the dirt floor, highlighting the worried faces gathered around her. A young girl clutched a whimpering puppy in her arms, its fur matted with blood. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to summon the calm she desperately needed. This wasn't the sterile, climate-controlled clinic she was used to back in Chicago. This was a dusty, ramshackle building in the heart of rural Costa Rica, where the nearest vet was hours away by treacherous mountain roads. She had come here volunteering for a month, hoping to make a difference, but tonight, faced with this injured puppy and its heartbroken owner, Amelia felt overwhelmed.
