Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the frantic pounding in Eloise Margaret Cavendish's chest. It was 2:37 am, and the usually hushed halls echoed with the insistent beeping of monitors and the hurried footsteps of fellow nurses. Eloise, her blonde braid escaping its confines and sticking to her damp forehead, rushed towards Room 204, her heart heavy with a premonition she couldn't shake. 

Inside, Mr. Henderson, her patient for the past week, lay pale and still beneath the crisp white sheets. The rhythmic beep of his heart monitor had slowed to an unnerving crawl, each blip like a desperate gasp for air. Eloise felt a cold dread creep up her spine as she instinctively checked his pulse, thin and weak against her fingertips.  This wasn't just another late-night shift; this was a battle for Mr. Henderson's life, and Eloise knew, with chilling certainty, that the odds were stacked against them.
