The sawdust swirled in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the open windowpane of Elias Finnigan's workshop. He inhaled deeply, the scent of pine and cedar filling his lungs like a familiar embrace.

Yet, even in this small project, he poured his heart into every detail - the smooth curves of the lid, the delicate carvings of playful rabbits along its sides.
