Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, blurring the twinkling lights strung across the quaint courtyard. The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, usually soothing but tonight tinged with an unsettling edge. Amelia Hawthorne, her hands trembling slightly, adjusted the delicate tealight candles lining her massage table. 

Amelia wasn't normally one to be rattled. Five years as a certified massage therapist had honed her into a beacon of calm, adept at melting away stress and tension from even the most tightly wound clients. But tonight was different. Tonight, she felt a prickle of unease crawling up her spine. Her last appointment, scheduled for 8 pm sharp, was with a Mr. Silas Blackwood. A name that whispered of shadows and secrets.

He hadn't specified any particular treatment, merely requesting "whatever Amelia deemed necessary." His voice on the phone had been low and gravelly, devoid of the usual pleasantries exchanged by clients. And something about his silence after she confirmed the appointment, a lingering pause before he hung up, sent shivers down her arms.  

As the clock chimed eight, Amelia forced herself to take a deep breath. Serenity Spa was her sanctuary, a place where she helped others find peace. She wouldn't let fear taint its walls. With a determined nod, she straightened her white tunic and waited, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the windowpane amplifying the tension in the air.
