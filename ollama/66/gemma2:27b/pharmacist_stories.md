Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Evergreen Apothecary," blurring the neon "Open" sign into an indecipherable smear.  Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously counted out lavender capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The air hung thick with the scent of chamomile and menthol, a comforting aroma that usually calmed her nerves. Tonight, however, even the soothing presence of her apothecary couldn't dispel the knot of unease twisting in her stomach.

A persistent cough echoed from the back room, followed by the muffled clang of a dropped jar. Eleanor sighed, pushing aside the prescription bottles and smoothing down her crisp white coat. Old Mr. Hawthorne was notorious for his clumsiness, but tonight something felt different. It wasn't just the storm raging outside; there was an underlying tension in the air, a sense of foreboding that prickled at the back of Eleanorâ€™s neck.  

As she headed towards the back room, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a late-night customer. Eleanor paused, her hand hovering over the doorknob. Should she greet them or see to Mr. Hawthorne first? A shiver ran down her spine, and she made a decision.

"Just a moment," she called out, her voice echoing in the cavernous space of the apothecary. "I'll be right with you."
