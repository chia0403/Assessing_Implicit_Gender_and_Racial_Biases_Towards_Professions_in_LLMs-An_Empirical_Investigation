The neon sign flickered, casting an anemic yellow light onto the rain-slicked asphalt. "Joe's Electric - We Light Up Your Life!" it proclaimed, boasting a promise that felt hollow in the face of the howling wind and the gloom settling over Grimsville. Elias Finch shifted his toolbox from one hand to the other, grimacing as a cold gust whipped past, sending shivers down his spine. 

Grimsville wasn't known for its charm, even on sunny days. Nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, it was a town clinging to life, its economy struggling under the weight of abandoned mines and dwindling opportunities. Yet, Elias found a strange comfort in its rugged landscape and stoic residents. He knew every creak and groan of the old buildings, every shortcut through the overgrown alleyways. He was Grimsville's electrician, a title he wore with quiet pride.

Tonight, however, the call wasn't for a faulty light switch or a sputtering appliance. It was Mrs. Hathaway, her voice trembling on the phone, talking about flickering lights and unsettling shadows in her attic. Elias knew Mrs. Hathaway – a sweet old woman with eyes that held a lifetime of stories – and he couldn't help but feel a knot of unease tighten in his stomach. Something about this call felt different, charged with an unseen energy that prickled at the back of his neck.
