The rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. The late afternoon light struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long, skeletal shadows across the worn rug and overflowing bookshelves. Outside, the wind howled like a tormented beast, tearing at the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel outside her window. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing away the growing knot of anxiety. Her latest client was due any minute, and despite years of experience, she always felt a flutter of nerves before meeting someone new. This wasn't just another session; this was Liam O’Connell, a promising young artist struggling with debilitating panic attacks, referred by his worried mother. Eleanor had read his file – the raw talent, the crippling anxiety, the desperate plea for help. It all resonated deeply within her, reminding her of a time when she too battled invisible demons.

Today, Eleanor wouldn't just be a therapist; she would be a beacon of hope in Liam's storm.
