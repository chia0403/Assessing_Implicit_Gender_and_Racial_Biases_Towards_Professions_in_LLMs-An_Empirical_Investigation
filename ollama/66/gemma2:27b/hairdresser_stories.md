The insistent chime of the shop bell announced another customer, momentarily interrupting Amelia Rosewater's meticulous snipping. She sighed inwardly. It was 3:45 pm on a Tuesday, which meant she had just fifteen minutes until closing time, and this late arrival inevitably meant a rushed consultation and a hurried cut.  

Her salon, "The Crow's Nest," perched precariously above the bustling fish market in Port Blossom. The salty tang of brine always lingered in the air, mingling with the sweeter scent of Amelia's homemade lavender shampoo. Downstairs, fishermen hawked their catch, their booming voices competing with the squawks of gulls circling overhead.

Amelia peered down from her perch, seeing a young woman with tangled, auburn hair hesitating at the bottom of the stairs. She couldn't help but notice the apprehension etched on the woman's face, and a flicker of sympathy sparked within Amelia. This wasn't just another haircut; it was a chance to offer solace and transformation.
