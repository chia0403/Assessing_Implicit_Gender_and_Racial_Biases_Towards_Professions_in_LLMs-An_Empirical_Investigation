Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already muted view of the industrial cityscape beyond.  Inside, Emilia "Em" Rose Cartwright, a woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its braid and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a hawk, meticulously adjusted the straps on her patient's wheelchair. The faint scent of disinfectant mingled with the tang of stale coffee in the air, creating a familiar aroma unique to this place.

Today's session was with Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter who had suffered a stroke three months ago, leaving him with paralysis on his right side and a crushing sense of frustration. Em understood that frustration intimately. She knew the delicate dance between hope and despair that played out in the hearts of her patients, and she dedicated herself to guiding them through it, one painstaking movement at a time.

But today felt different. A palpable tension crackled in the air as Mr. Henderson glared defiantly at the wheelchair, his left hand clenched into a fist. Em sensed a storm brewing, not just outside, but within the man himself.
