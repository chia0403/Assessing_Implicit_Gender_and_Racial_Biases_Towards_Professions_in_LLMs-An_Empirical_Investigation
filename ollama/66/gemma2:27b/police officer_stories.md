Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Detective Elias "Eli" Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store sign across the street. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, two aromas Eli had come to associate with his beat in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. A single, flickering fluorescent bulb cast harsh shadows on the cluttered desk, illuminating a half-eaten beignet and a stack of cold case files that seemed to grow taller every day. 

Eli sighed, rubbing a hand over his tired face.  He had been staring at the same photograph for the past hour - a young woman with laughing eyes and auburn hair cascading down her shoulders, frozen in time. Her name was Celeste Moreau, and she had vanished without a trace three years ago. This case, like so many others in this city steeped in mystery and shadows, seemed destined to remain unsolved.
