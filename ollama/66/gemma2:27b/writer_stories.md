Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Eleanor Ainsworth's typing. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and old paper – a familiar perfume in this ramshackle Victorian house perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish coast. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, sending shivers down Eleanor’s spine despite the crackling fire warming her cramped writing space.

Eleanor paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The words refused to come, the blank page mocking her writer's block. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the very house she inhabited, was proving more challenging than anticipated. Perhaps it was the oppressive atmosphere, the creaking floorboards and flickering candlelight that fueled her anxieties. Or maybe it was the unsettling feeling of being watched, a sensation she couldn't shake off despite being alone.
