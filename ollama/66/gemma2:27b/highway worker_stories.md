The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's shoulders, turning his already sweat-soaked t-shirt into a second skin. Dust devils danced across the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him, swirling red dust into miniature tornadoes that vanished as quickly as they appeared. Eli squinted against the glare, the shimmering heat haze distorting the distant mountains into wavering mirages. The air hung heavy and still, punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of his shovel against gravel as he worked on patching a pothole near mile marker 127.

This stretch of Highway 40 had seen better days, Eli thought grimly. Years of relentless sun, bone-chilling winters, and countless trucks hauling cargo across the country had taken their toll. Every day was a battle against crumbling asphalt, gaping potholes, and the relentless march of time. Yet, Eli found a strange satisfaction in it all.

He liked the solitude, the way the endless horizon calmed his restless spirit. He liked knowing that he played a part, however small, in keeping this vital artery flowing, connecting people and places across the vast expanse of the Nevada desert.  Today, though, the silence was broken by an unfamiliar sound â€“ a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere deep within the canyons that bordered the highway. Eli paused, his shovel hovering in mid-air. He'd worked this stretch for five years and never heard anything like it before. Curiosity warred with caution. He knew better than to wander off into those desolate canyons, but something about that sound...it called to him, promising a mystery waiting to be unraveled.
