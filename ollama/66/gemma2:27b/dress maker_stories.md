Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Esmeralda Delacroix's atelier, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. The air inside was thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax, punctuated by the sharp tang of freshly-cut silk. Esmeralda herself, her hands stained indigo from dyeing a gown for the mayor's wife, paused mid-stitch, listening to the tempest raging outside.

Her atelier, nestled in a cobbled alleyway behind the bustling Grand Market of Veridia, was her sanctuary. Sunlight rarely pierced the grimy windows, but inside, Esmeralda had cultivated an oasis of shimmering fabrics, delicate lacework, and the constant hum of her trusty sewing machine.
