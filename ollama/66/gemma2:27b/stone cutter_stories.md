The midday sun beat down on Alastor Blackwood's stooped shoulders as he chipped away at a block of rose granite. Dust swirled around him, catching in his thick, grey beard and stinging his eyes. The quarry echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammer against stone, punctuated by the occasional grunt or curse from the other men working alongside him. Alastor didn't mind the noise; it was the soundtrack to his life, as familiar and comforting as his own heartbeat.

The quarry was nestled in a valley just outside the bustling city of Eldoria, its cliffs rising like jagged teeth against the azure sky. Veins of quartz and granite crisscrossed the landscape, a testament to the earth's fiery birth. Generations of stone cutters had labored here, extracting the raw material that built Eldoriaâ€™s grand cathedrals, bridges, and statues. Alastor was part of that lineage, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him.
