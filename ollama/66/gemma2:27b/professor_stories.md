Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Professor Eleanor Vance's study, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of light from the ornate chandelier overhead.  The air smelled of woodsmoke and old books, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eleanor. Tonight, however, it did little to quell the unease twisting in her gut. 

Eleanor pushed aside a stack of dusty tomes on medieval alchemy, their leather covers cracked and faded. Her gaze drifted towards the antique clock ticking ominously in the corner, its pendulum swinging with metronomic precision. Each tick seemed to amplify the silence that had settled over the once-bustling university campus.  

The phone lay silent beside her, a testament to the unusual quietude that had fallen upon Oxford. It had been three days since anyone had seen Professor Alistair Finch, Eleanor's colleague and close friend. The normally jovial historian had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note and an unsettling sense of foreboding.


Eleanor tapped her fingers nervously against the mahogany desk, its surface scarred with years of scholarly pursuits.  Finch's disappearance felt different from anything she'd encountered before. It wasn't simply a matter of someone going missing; there was something darker lurking beneath the surface, a chilling whisper in the wind that spoke of secrets best left buried.
