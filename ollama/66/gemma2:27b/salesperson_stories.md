The flickering neon sign outside "Bargain Buys" cast Amelia Cartwright's face in alternating shades of lurid green and sickly yellow. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, mingling with the smear of cheap lipstick she'd applied that morning. The August air hung thick and heavy, a damp blanket suffocating any breeze. Amelia tugged at the collar of her polyester blouse, wishing for the hundredth time she'd opted for the sleeveless option. 

She stood on the cracked asphalt parking lot, staring through the dusty windowpane into the dimly lit store interior. Empty cardboard boxes piled precariously near the entrance mocked her with their silent promise of unsold merchandise. Amelia had been a salesperson for Bargain Buys for three months now, and each day felt like an uphill battle against apathy, exhaustion, and the ever-present stench of stale discount perfume.
