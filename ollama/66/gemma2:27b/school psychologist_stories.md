Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  She stared at the referral form in front of her, the neat cursive script outlining the case like an ominous blueprint: "Ethan Walker, 16, displaying signs of acute social withdrawal, insomnia, and sudden academic decline." The referral came from Mrs. Reynolds, Ethan's English teacher, a woman known for her patience and unwavering belief in her students. That Eleanor was being called in meant things were serious.

Eleanor’s office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Northwood High School, felt as dreary as the November day outside. Posters promising "Positive Thinking" and "Resilience" hung limply on the walls, mocking the current atmosphere. The worn armchair opposite her desk sat empty, waiting for Ethan's arrival. A knot of anxiety tightened in Eleanor’s stomach. Teenage angst was one thing, but something about this case felt different, heavier.
