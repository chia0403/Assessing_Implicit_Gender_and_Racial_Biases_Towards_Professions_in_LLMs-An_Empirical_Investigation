Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Dr. Evelyn Briar's chiropractic clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. The air hung heavy with the scent of rain-soaked asphalt and eucalyptus from the lone tree struggling to survive in the cracked concrete lot outside. Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Business was slow today â€“ no surprise given the torrential downpour that had been hammering the city for hours. 

She idly traced the chipped paint on her worn wooden desk, wondering if she'd ever be able to afford a fresh coat. Evelyn had poured her heart and soul into this clinic, nestled in the heart of Oakland's gritty Fruitvale district, hoping to bring affordable wellness to her community. Yet, despite her dedication and skill, success seemed perpetually out of reach.  


As thunder rumbled overhead, shaking the old building to its core, the bell above the door jingled. Evelyn straightened, a flicker of hope igniting in her chest. Maybe today wouldn't be so slow after all.
