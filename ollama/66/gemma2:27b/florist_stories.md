Rain hammered against the glass panes of "Petal & Stem," blurring the neon sign into a shimmering pink blob. Inside, Amelia Rosethorn sighed, her reflection in the dew-laden blooms a pale echo amidst the vibrant chaos of her shop. Lilies wept pearly tears onto crimson carnations, while orchids, proud and aloof, seemed to sneer at the storm raging outside.  

Amelia loved storms, usually. They brought a sense of cleansing, of starting anew. But tonight, the relentless downpour mirrored the turmoil in her own heart. The note, tucked beneath a wilting daisy on her doorstep that morning, had thrown her world into disarray. "The roses are dying," it read simply.

Amelia knew exactly which roses it meant â€“ the ones she'd meticulously cultivated for years, a legacy from her grandmother. Roses that were rumored to bloom only for those with pure hearts.  And Amelia, lately, hadn't been sure if hers was still pure enough.
