The scent of caramelized sugar hung thick in the air, clinging to Elara Roseberry's apron like a second skin.  Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, illuminating dust motes dancing above a mountain range of cooling cupcakes. Outside, the bustling marketplace of Saffron Square hummed with the chatter of vendors and the clatter of horse-drawn carts. Inside "Sugarplum Dreams," Elara's world was one of vibrant buttercream swirls, delicate sugar flowers, and the quiet satisfaction of transforming simple cakes into edible works of art. Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. 

Lord Beaumont's birthday celebration was just two days away, and Elara had been commissioned to create the centerpiece cake â€“ a towering masterpiece fit for Saffron Square's wealthiest nobleman. The pressure was immense.  One misplaced swirl, one lopsided tier, and her reputation as Saffron Square's finest cake decorator would crumble faster than a stale biscuit.
