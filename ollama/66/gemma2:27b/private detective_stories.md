Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the 'Lucky Clover Tavern' across the street. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation â€“ a familiar cocktail in this part of town. Alistair, a man whose face bore more wrinkles than years, sighed as he leaned back in his creaking leather chair. He was known for taking on the cases nobody else wanted: missing persons who'd likely skipped town, petty thefts with no leads, and the occasional heartbroken soul searching for closure.

Today's visitor, however, promised something different. A woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, had arrived just before the storm hit. Her voice, when she spoke, was hushed and tinged with an urgency that pricked at Alistair's curiosity. "Mr. Finch," she had said, her eyes darting around the cluttered room, "I need your help. My husband...he's gone missing, but this isn't like him. Something is wrong."
