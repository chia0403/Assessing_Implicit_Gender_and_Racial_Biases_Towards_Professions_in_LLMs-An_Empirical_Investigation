The recycled air hummed with a faint, sterile scent as Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz navigated the cramped galley of Flight 472. Outside, somewhere between the cotton-candy clouds and the sapphire expanse, lay the twinkling lights of Chicago. She knew this route well – Chicago to Los Angeles, twice a week – but tonight felt different. A prickling unease sat just beneath her ribs, like a forgotten loose thread threatening to unravel her composure.

Maybe it was the full moon casting an ethereal glow across the cabin, or perhaps the way Mr. Henderson in seat 23A kept nervously tapping his foot and avoiding eye contact. Whatever it was, Esme felt on edge, her usual bubbly demeanor replaced with a quiet tension. As she adjusted the trolley laden with mini-bottles of Chardonnay and lukewarm pretzels, she couldn't shake the feeling that something unexpected was about to happen.
