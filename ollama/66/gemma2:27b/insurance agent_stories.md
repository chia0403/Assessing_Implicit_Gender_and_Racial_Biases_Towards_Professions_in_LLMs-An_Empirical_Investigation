Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Theodore "Teddy" Quincy's office, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety throbbing in his chest. The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "Quincy & Sons Insurance: Protecting What Matters Most," seemed to mock him with its false promise. His desk was piled high with unpaid bills and claim forms, each one a testament to the dwindling fortunes of his family's once-proud business.

Teddy stared out at the storm-ravaged street below, where flickering streetlights cast long, distorted shadows.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp asphalt and distant sirens. He needed this sale. A hefty policy for a prominent art collector could be the lifeline Quincy & Sons desperately needed. But Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood, notorious for her discerning eye and icy demeanor, was proving to be an exceptionally tough nut to crack.
