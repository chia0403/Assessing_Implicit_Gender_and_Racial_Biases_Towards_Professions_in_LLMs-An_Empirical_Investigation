The wind howled like a banshee through the Iron Gates of Drakkenfell, whipping snow into Theodore Alistair Thorne's face as he trudged his lonely beat along the ancient stone wall. Drakkenfell Penitentiary loomed behind him, a hulking monstrosity of granite and iron bars that seemed to claw at the storm clouds above. The prison lights flickered erratically, casting long, grotesque shadows across the frozen wasteland.

Theodore shivered, pulling his threadbare cloak tighter around himself. He'd been stationed at Drakkenfell for five years now, enough time to know that the biting wind was just a prelude to the bone-chilling cold that would settle in after nightfall. It wasn't the cold he feared, though. 


Theodore Alistair Thorne had seen things in these five years that chilled him to his very core, things that lingered in his nightmares long after the sun rose and cast its weak light upon the snow-covered yard. He knew what lurked within those walls – men driven mad by despair, criminals hardened by violence, creatures whispered about only in hushed tones… 

Tonight, something felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, a prickling unease that tightened Theodore's grip on his spear. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the howling wind and the distant clang of metal on stone – a sound that echoed through Theodore's bones like a warning bell.
