The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck, turning his already tanned skin a shade darker. He crouched precariously on the steeply pitched slate roof of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn shingle. Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakhaven shimmered like emerald velvet, oblivious to Eli's struggle against gravity and crumbling mortar.

But this particular roof, with its intricate dormers and hidden valleys, was proving a challenge. It was an old house, whispering stories in the creak of its rafters and the groan of its settling timbers. Eli felt a strange sense of connection to it, as though he were peeling back layers of time with each shingle he replaced.
