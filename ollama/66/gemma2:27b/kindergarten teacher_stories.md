The scent of glue and crayons hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale apple juice that always seemed to permeate Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Winthrop's classroom. Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking the playground, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays.  Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping from its messy bun, surveyed the chaos unfolding before her with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. 

Little Timmy was attempting to glue his shoe to the table, while Penelope insisted on wearing her princess tiara upside down. In the corner, two boys were engaged in a heated debate over the ownership of a particularly well-worn teddy bear, their voices rising in indignant squeaks. It was just another typical Tuesday morning at Sunshine Kindergarten.
