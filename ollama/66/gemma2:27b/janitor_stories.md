The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted gymnasium floor.  Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow.  Elroy Bartholomew Higgins III, better known as "Roy" to anyone unfortunate enough to have to speak with him, heaved a sigh that echoed through the cavernous space. His mop, already heavy with grime, scraped against the polished wood floor, leaving behind streaks of murky water.

He hated nights like this - quiet, empty, echoing with the ghosts of laughter and cheers from long-gone basketball games and pep rallies.  Roy felt them, those unseen spectators, judging his every clumsy swipe, his tired posture, the way he muttered obscenities under his breath when the stubborn gum stuck stubbornly to the mop head.

The silence was broken only by the rhythmic squeak of his shoes and the distant rumble of thunder rolling in from the storm-laden sky outside.  It promised rain, a downpour that would surely flood the gutters outside the gym doors, leaving Roy with yet another mess to clean up before sunrise.
