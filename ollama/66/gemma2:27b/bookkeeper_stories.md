Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew Quill's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and old paper, a testament to the years Bartholomew had spent hunched over ledgers in this cramped back room above Mrs. Peabody's bakery.

Now, with eviction looming and creditors circling like vultures, Bartholomew was faced with an impossible choice: surrender to his fate or find a way to claw his way back from the precipice.
