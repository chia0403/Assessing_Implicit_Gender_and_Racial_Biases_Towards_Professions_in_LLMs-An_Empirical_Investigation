The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung thick with perfume and anticipation. Chandeliers dripped like diamonds from the vaulted ceiling, casting shimmering pools on the marble floor where Eliza "Ellie" Cartwright navigated the swirling throngs of guests with practiced ease. Her navy uniform, crisp and starched, barely contained the energy that thrummed through her petite frame. Ellie wasn't just a bellhop; she was a conductor, orchestrating the arrival and departure of dreams within these hallowed walls.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension crackled beneath the surface of the usual opulent facade. Whispers followed a gaggle of men in dark suits who strode purposefully towards the grand staircase, their faces grim. Ellie caught snippets of conversation â€“ "missing artifact," "ancient society," "dangerous consequences." Curiosity piqued, she subtly maneuvered her luggage trolley closer, hoping for a glimpse of whatever intrigue was unfolding.
