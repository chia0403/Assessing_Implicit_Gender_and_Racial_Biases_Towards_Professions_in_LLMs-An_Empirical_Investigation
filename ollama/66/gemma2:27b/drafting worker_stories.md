The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Elara Vance's head as she hunched over her drafting table. Sheets of vellum, smelling faintly of ozone and graphite, were spread out before her, crisscrossed with precise lines that defined the skeletal structure of a new apartment complex. Outside the window, the relentless July sun beat down on the concrete jungle of New Alexandria, turning the glass into a shimmering mirage.

Elara sighed, pushing a stray curl away from her face. The lines blurred together after hours of staring, and her wrist ached with the familiar burn of repetitive motion.  She longed for something more than these cold, calculated blueprints - something with life, movement, maybe even a splash of color. But this was New Alexandria, where efficiency and uniformity reigned supreme. Every building, every street, every citizen seemed molded from the same sterile mold.

Then, a crumpled envelope landed on her desk, breaking the monotonous rhythm of her work. The return address simply read: "Anonymous." Curiosity piqued, Elara carefully unfolded the letter, her fingers tracing the unfamiliar handwriting. Inside, a single sentence promised to upend her world: "Meet me at the abandoned Observatory tonight, midnight. Bring your dreams."
