The air in "Nails by Nina" hung thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine polish. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating swirls of pink and blue glitter on the manicure table. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her scarlet nails clicking against the ceramic surface, surveyed her work with a critical eye. A swirl of amethyst shimmer, perfectly applied on Mrs. Henderson's ring finger, seemed to wink back at her. 

Amelia, known affectionately as "Mimi" by her regulars, was more than just a manicurist. She was a confidante, therapist, and occasional gossip columnist for the ladies of Elmwood Avenue.  Her salon, nestled between a struggling bakery and an overly-enthusiastic dog groomer, had become a haven for weary souls seeking respite from their everyday dramas. 

Today, however, something felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the surface of normalcy, amplified by the insistent buzzing of Amelia's phone. It was her grandmother, Nana Rose, calling for the third time in an hour, her voice tinged with worry and cryptic warnings about "trouble brewing." Amelia sighed, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. Elmwood Avenue had always been quiet, almost sleepy.  What on earth could be wrong?
