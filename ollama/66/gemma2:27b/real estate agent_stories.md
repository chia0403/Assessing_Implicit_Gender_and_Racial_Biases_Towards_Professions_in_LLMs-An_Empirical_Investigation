Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's beat-up Ford Fiesta. It was the kind of torrential downpour that made even seasoned Seattleites reconsider their love affair with drizzle. Bea chewed on her thumbnail, staring at the dilapidated Victorian looming in the distance.  

37 Oakhaven Lane - a crumbling monument to a bygone era, its paint peeling like sunburned skin and ivy crawling up its facade like grasping fingers. It was the kind of house that whispered stories, secrets buried beneath layers of neglect. Bea, with her love for fixer-uppers and penchant for uncovering hidden gems, couldn't help but feel a thrill of anticipation. This wasn't just another listing; it was a challenge, a chance to breathe life back into something forgotten.
