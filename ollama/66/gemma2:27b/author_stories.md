Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the warped glass. Amelia Blackwood huddled deeper into her threadbare armchair, its stuffing sighing with every shift in her weight. Dust motes danced in the weak beam of her desk lamp, illuminating pages scattered across the worn wooden surface â€“ the remnants of a manuscript she'd been wrestling with for months. The words blurred before her eyes, as unyielding as the storm raging outside.

Amelia was an author, though "struggling" barely scratched the surface when describing her career. Her debut novel, a gothic romance set in the misty moors of Yorkshire, had garnered critical acclaim but dismal sales. Since then, she'd been chasing that elusive spark of inspiration, that perfect blend of words and worlds that would catapult her into literary success.

But tonight, even the ghosts of her imagination seemed to have fled, seeking refuge from the storm's fury. The silence in the attic was broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the occasional groan of the old house settling around her. Amelia sighed, her fingers tracing the faded inscription etched into the armrest: "Let your story unfold." A legacy left by her grandmother, a woman who'd whispered fantastical tales beneath the same leaking roof.

Perhaps, Amelia thought, it was time to listen to those whispers again.
