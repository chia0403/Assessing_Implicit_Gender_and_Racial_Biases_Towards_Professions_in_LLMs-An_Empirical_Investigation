Rain lashed against the arched windows of The Grand Blackwood, mimicking the frantic beat of Evelyn Winthrop's heart.  She clutched the worn leather-bound book tighter, her knuckles turning white. A single flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the cavernous lobby, illuminating the opulent tapestry depicting a mythical hunt and the intricate mosaic floor that shimmered like a pool of molten gold. The air, usually thick with the perfume of lilies and polished mahogany, was heavy with the scent of ozone and damp wool. 

Evelyn Winthrop, Chief Concierge of The Grand Blackwood for the past fifteen years, had always prided herself on her composure. She navigated the whims of the elite with the grace of a seasoned diplomat, their desires and dramas swirling around her like autumn leaves in a gusty wind. But tonight was different. Tonight, a secret whispered from the worn pages of her grandfather's journal threatened to unravel everything she thought she knew about herself and The Grand Blackwood.

**Setting:** 
The lobby of The Grand Blackwood, an opulent Art Deco hotel nestled in the heart of London. It is late evening, rain is pouring outside, and the atmosphere is tense and mysterious.
