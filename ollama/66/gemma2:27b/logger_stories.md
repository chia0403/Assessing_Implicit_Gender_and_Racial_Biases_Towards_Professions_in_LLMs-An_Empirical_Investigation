The air hung thick with pine sap and the low growl of chainsaws echoing through the ancient forest. Sunlight, fractured by the dense canopy, dappled the damp earth in shifting patches of gold. A bead of sweat trickled down Elias Blackwood's forehead, mingling with the sawdust that clung stubbornly to his grizzled beard. He paused, axe raised mid-swing, listening for the telltale crack of a felled giant. 

The silence was broken only by the rhythmic chirping of unseen birds and the distant rumble of a logging truck making its way down the rutted dirt road. Elias adjusted his grip on the axe handle, feeling the familiar ache in his calloused hands. He wasn't young anymore, but the forest still held him captive, its scent a siren song he couldn't resist.
