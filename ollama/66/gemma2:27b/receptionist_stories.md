The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Eloise Beatrice Cartwright's neatly arranged desk. Stacks of appointment cards stood like colorful sentinels, their edges perfectly aligned. A faint scent of lavender wafted from the diffuser she'd strategically placed near her phone, attempting to mask the stale air conditioning and the underlying aroma of antiseptic that permeated the entire building. Eloise tapped a polished red nail against the counter, her gaze fixed on the revolving door beyond which the city pulsed with a chaotic energy she couldn't quite tap into. 

Today was different. Today, Eloise felt it in the prickling of her skin, the sudden fluttering in her chest - something unusual was about to happen. It wasn't the usual parade of anxious patients, clutching crumpled medical records and casting furtive glances at the ticking clock on the wall. No, today promised something more... intriguing.
