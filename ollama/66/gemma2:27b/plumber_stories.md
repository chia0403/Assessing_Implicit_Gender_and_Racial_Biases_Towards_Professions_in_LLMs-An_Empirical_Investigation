The greasy wrench slipped in Esmeralda "Esme" O'Malley's calloused hand, sending a jolt of pain up her forearm. She hissed, dropping the tool onto the grimy concrete floor of Mrs. Henderson's basement.  

A symphony of dripping echoed around her: from the rusted pipes overhead, the leaky faucet Esme had already identified as the culprit, and the sweat gathering on her brow. "Damn it," she muttered, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. The air in the cramped basement was thick with the smell of mildew and something else, faintly metallic, that made her stomach churn. 

Mrs. Henderson's Victorian house perched precariously on a hill overlooking the fog-choked city of Dunwich.  The house itself seemed to groan under the weight of its years, each floorboard creaking like a weary old man. Esme suspected the plumbing was just as ancient, a tangled web of lead and copper pipes begging for replacement.

She picked up the wrench again, the familiar weight comforting in her hand. "Alright, Henderson pipes," she said with a grin, "let's see what you're hiding."
