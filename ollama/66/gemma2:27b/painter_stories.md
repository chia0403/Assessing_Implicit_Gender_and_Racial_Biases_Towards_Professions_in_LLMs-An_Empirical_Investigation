The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Cavendish as she stood before her easel. Sunlight streamed through the arched window of her attic studio, bathing the canvas in a warm glow. Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague hummed with life, but up here, amidst the dusty canvases and tubes of paint, Eleanor existed in a world of her own creation. 

Her current work, a vibrant still life of pomegranates bursting open on a pewter platter, was proving more challenging than expected. The crimson seeds seemed to shimmer with an inner light, resisting her attempts to capture their jewel-like quality. Frustration gnawed at Eleanor as she dipped her brush in cadmium red, the colour seeming dull and lifeless against the canvas. She longed for the inspiration that had once flowed so freely, but lately it felt like a fickle muse who had abandoned her altogether.
