The rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Theodore Beaumont’s workshop, mimicking the furious rhythm of his heartbeat. Outside, the cobbled streets of Whitechapel were slick with mud and shadowed by a perpetual dusk. Gas lamps flickered weakly, casting elongated shadows that danced like wraiths in the gloom. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, lavender soap, and the faint tang of blood.

Theodore, his hands trembling, surveyed the latest commission laid out on his worktable: a velvet doublet, the color of dried roses, embroidered with intricate silver thread depicting snarling wolves. It was an exquisite piece, fit for a king, but its intended wearer sent shivers down Theodore’s spine. 

Lord Alistair Ravenswood.  A man whispered to be as cunning as he was cruel. A man who demanded perfection, and punished those who failed him.


Theodore's needle hovered above the fabric, frozen by doubt. He could refuse the commission – pack up his meager belongings and vanish into the night. But where would he go? Who else would take in a tailor with a reputation for being... different?

He glanced at the silver embroidery on the doublet, its menacing wolves seeming to leer back at him. A choice had to be made. And Theodore Beaumont, despite his fear, knew deep down that he wouldn't run. He wouldn't break the vow he'd made to himself - a vow to use his needle and thread not just for beauty, but for something more. Something meaningful. Something... dangerous.
