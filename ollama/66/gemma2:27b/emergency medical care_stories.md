The air in the ambulance thrummed with urgency, vibrating through Evelyn Grace Montgomery's very bones. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already dim streetlights into hazy halos.  Evelyn, her blonde braid whipping across her forehead, gripped the gurney rails as it lurched around a sharp corner. The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor seemed to echo the frantic drumming in her chest. Inside the back of the ambulance, a man lay pallid and still, his breathing shallow and ragged.

Evelyn's gaze darted between the pale face before her and the vitals displayed on the screen above.  She knew this wasn't just another routine call. This was different – something in the air crackled with tension, with an undercurrent of fear she couldn’t quite place. The streetlights flickered, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the ambulance walls, amplifying the sense of unease settling over her.

This night was shaping up to be unlike any other Evelyn had faced in her five years as a paramedic in the bustling city of New Haven.
