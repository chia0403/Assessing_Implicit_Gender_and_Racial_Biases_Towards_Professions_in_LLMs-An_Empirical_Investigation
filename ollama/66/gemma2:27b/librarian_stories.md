Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Cartwright's chest. The ancient building groaned under the onslaught, its centuries-old timbers protesting each gust of wind that tore through the gnarled oak trees outside. 

Elara, her silver hair escaping its braid and damp against her temple, peered anxiously at the grandfather clock ticking away in the corner. Ten minutes past closing time, and no sign of Mr. Hawthorne. He was usually punctual, arriving precisely as dusk settled, requesting a particular volume from the restricted section with an enigmatic smile. Tonight, however, his absence felt unsettling, like a missing note in a familiar melody. 

As head librarian for over thirty years, Elara knew every creak and whisper of Blackwood Library. Yet, tonight, the silence between the raindrops felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken secrets. The flickering gas lamps cast long shadows that danced ominously on the dusty shelves, whispering tales of forgotten lore and ancient magic. A shiver ran down Elara's spine. Something wasn't right.  

She decided to wait ten more minutes before locking up for the night, her gaze fixed on the rain-streaked windowpane, hoping against hope that Mr. Hawthorne would emerge from the storm.
