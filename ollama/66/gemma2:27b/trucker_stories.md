Rain lashed against the windshield of Jeremiah "Red" Callahan's Kenworth T680, blurring the already fading neon glow of the Dusty Wheel Diner sign in the distance. The highway stretched before him, an undulating ribbon of black asphalt disappearing into the swirling grey mist. Red squinted through the downpour, his grizzled face illuminated by the flickering dashboard lights. His CB crackled with static, the usual chatter of truckers drowned out by the relentless storm.

Red had been on the road for three days straight, hauling a load of lumber from Oregon to Nebraska.  The promised break in Amarillo never materialized – instead, he was caught in this unforgiving deluge somewhere in the desolate expanse of western Kansas. He longed for a hot cup of coffee and a plate of greasy hash browns, the kind only a roadside diner like the Dusty Wheel could provide.

He wrestled the massive rig into a gravel pull-off just beyond the diner's sign, its faded paint barely visible through the sheets of rain. Red sighed, weariness heavy in his bones. Something about this place felt… off. He couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that he wasn't alone in the storm.
