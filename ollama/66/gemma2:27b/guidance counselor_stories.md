The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Blackwood's head, casting a sickly yellow glow across the mountain of college brochures littering her desk. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves against the windows of Willow Creek High School, mimicking the swirling anxiety in Elara's stomach. It was guidance counselor conference week, and she dreaded facing the judgmental stares of her colleagues from wealthier districts. They’d talk about their students’ Ivy League acceptances and internships at prestigious companies, while Elara would be left to explain how she helped a single mother navigate FAFSA applications or guided a student with dyslexia through standardized testing.

Willow Creek was a small town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, its economy struggling since the coal mines closed down decades ago.  Many of Elara's students faced daunting obstacles: poverty, lack of access to technology, and limited opportunities. Yet, they possessed an unwavering resilience that Elara found both inspiring and heartbreaking. She poured her heart into helping them find their paths, even if those paths led to community colleges or trade schools instead of four-year universities. This week, however, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was failing them.
