The rhythmic clatter of Penelope "Penny" Cartwright's typewriter was the only sound that dared break the oppressive silence of Mr. Blackwood's office. Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of the once-opulent space.  Heavy velvet curtains hung limply, their crimson hue dulled with age. A towering mahogany desk, scarred and scratched from years of frantic note-taking and spilled ink, dominated the room. 

Penny sat perched on her stool, her fingers flying across the keys as she transcribed yet another rambling dictation from her employer. Mr. Blackwood, a reclusive novelist known for his macabre tales and erratic temperament, was currently lost in a fever dream about a haunted manor and a spectral butler with an insatiable appetite for revenge.

Penny sighed inwardly. While she admired Mr. Blackwood's literary talent, his eccentricities were starting to wear on her nerves. Today, the scent of lavender incense hung heavy in the air, clashing unpleasantly with the stale smell of old paper and forgotten dreams.
