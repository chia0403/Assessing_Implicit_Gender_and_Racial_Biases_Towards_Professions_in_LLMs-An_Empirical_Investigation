The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles as Elias Hawthorne hefted another log onto his shoulder. Dawn was just breaking over the Oregon Cascades, painting the towering Douglas firs in hues of amber and violet.  Sweat beaded on Elias' brow despite the chill clinging to the morning air. Each muscle in his body ached – a familiar ache that came with years spent wrestling giants from the forest floor. He wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his weathered face. 

Elias wasn’t just any logger. He was a "faller," responsible for bringing down the behemoth trees with precision and skill. His grandfather, a man whose stories were as tall as the pines themselves, had taught him the ancient art of felling trees.  The forest was Elias' cathedral, its rustling leaves his hymns, its towering trunks his sentinels. 

But lately, the symphony of the woods had been tinged with a dissonant note - the distant roar of chainsaws and the unsettling murmur of progress creeping closer to his beloved haven.  Elias felt it in his bones, this change that threatened to unravel the delicate balance he'd lived by for so long. This day, like all the others before it, was a fight against time, against the relentless advance of civilization that seemed poised to devour everything he held dear.
