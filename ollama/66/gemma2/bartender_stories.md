The air in The Rusty Tankard hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation.  Neon flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the worn-out booths and sticky countertop. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already hazy view of the deserted street outside. Behind the bar, Amelia "Amy" Bellweather polished a glass with practiced ease, her movements as smooth and predictable as the rhythms of the late-night crowd. She was used to these faces: the weary truckers, the lovelorn poets, the lonely souls seeking solace in a bottom-shelf bottle. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease danced on the back of Amy's neck, a premonition that this night wouldn't follow the usual script.  


The Rusty Tankard was a dive bar tucked away on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, a town where dreams went to die and hope lingered like cigarette smoke in the air. The kind of place where secrets whispered louder than laughter, and every story had a layer of grit beneath it.
