The relentless drizzle of Seattle painted the city in shades of grey, mirroring Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s mood.  Her black trench coat clung to her like a second skin, offering little protection against the biting wind that whipped through Pioneer Square. The scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony for someone who spent their days navigating the city's underbelly. 

Amelia, known as Amy by most, adjusted the strap of her messenger bag, the weight of legal files pressing against her hip. Her latest assignment:  Marcus "The Wrench" Williams. A notorious car thief with more convictions than fingers on his hands, Marcus had just been released from a six-year stint at Monroe Correctional Complex. 

Standing outside the dilapidated apartment building where Marcus was supposed to be residing, Amy surveyed the scene. Graffiti marred the brick facade, and broken windows stared blankly like hollow eyes. A flickering neon sign cast an unsettling green glow across the rain-slicked pavement. This wasn't exactly a rehabilitation haven.  

Taking a deep breath, Amelia pulled out her badge and stepped into the building, bracing herself for whatever awaited her inside.
