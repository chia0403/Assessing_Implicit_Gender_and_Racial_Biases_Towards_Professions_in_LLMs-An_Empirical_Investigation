The air in "The Gilded Oyster" was thick with the scent of old mahogany, salt-laced sea breeze, and something faintly metallic that Eleanor Mayhew chalked up to years of spilled drinks and forgotten oyster shells. The restaurant, perched precariously on the edge of a rocky cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, had seen better days. 

Eleanor navigated the uneven floorboards with practiced ease, her worn-out leather shoes whispering against the aged wood. She expertly dodged errant elbows and stray napkins, weaving through tables occupied by tourists eager for their seafood fix and locals nursing pints of ale, lost in hushed conversations. The low hum of conversation mingled with the clinking of glasses and the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore below â€“ a familiar symphony to Eleanor's ears. 


Eleanor paused at table eight, her bright smile masking the weariness settling deep in her bones.  Another evening, another shift, another chance to escape the relentless pull of reality. She placed a steaming pot of clam chowder on the table, its pungent aroma momentarily eclipsing the metallic tang of the air.


 "Evenin', folks," she chirped, her voice as warm and inviting as the glow of the lanterns strung across the restaurant's weathered ceiling.
