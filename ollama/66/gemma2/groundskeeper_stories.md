The morning mist clung to the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Manor like a shy child, hesitant to reveal the day's warmth.  Bartholomew Quillfeather, his weathered face etched with the wisdom of years spent coaxing life from the earth, surveyed his domain. He inhaled deeply, the crisp air carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and damp soil, a symphony only a groundskeeper truly understood. His calloused hands instinctively reached for the worn leather handle of his trowel, its familiar weight comforting in his grip.  Oakhaven Manor was more than just a place Bartholomew tended; it was a living tapestry woven with memories, secrets whispered by rustling leaves, and stories etched into the very bark of the ancient oak that stood sentinel at the manor's entrance. 


It was here, amongst the roses blooming defiant against the lingering chill and the meticulously trimmed hedges, that Bartholomew found solace. His world existed within these carefully curated borders, a haven of quiet routine and earthy beauty. He knew every crack in the cobblestone path, every curve of the rose bushes, every bird's nest hidden amongst the fragrant lavender. But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickle of unease beneath his calm facade.  He couldn't shake the feeling that this peaceful haven was about to be disrupted.
