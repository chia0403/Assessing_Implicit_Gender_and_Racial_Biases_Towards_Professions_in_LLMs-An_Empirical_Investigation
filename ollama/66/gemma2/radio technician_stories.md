The air crackled with static as Amelia "Amy" Bellweather tightened the last bolt on the antiquated receiver.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, reflecting the flickering light of the single bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling of the dusty repair shop. Outside, the storm raged, lashing against the corrugated iron roof like a thousand tiny fists. The wind howled its mournful song through gaps in the window frames, competing with the incessant hiss and pop emanating from the contraption before her. 

Amy lived above the shop, a ramshackle building on the outskirts of Dustbowl, a forgotten town clinging to life at the edge of the Wasteland.  Dust Bowl was a place where memories died faster than hope, and radios were more valuable than gold. They offered whispers of a world beyond the desolation, faint signals that hinted at life, connection, maybe even civilization. 

The receiver she worked on belonged to Old Man Hemlock, his weathered face etched with desperation as he clutched a worn photograph in his trembling hand. It depicted a younger, smiling woman, her eyes sparkling with warmth. "She's out there," he'd whispered, his voice hoarse. "I can feel it. Just get this thing working, Amy."

Amy knew the weight of Hemlock's plea. In Dust Bowl, every crackle and pop held the potential for a lifeline.  And as the storm raged around them, she held her breath, hoping against hope that this time, the signal wouldn't be lost in the static.
