The flickering fluorescent lights of the therapy room cast a sterile glow on Amelia Josephine Carter’s face. Sunlight streamed in through the tall windows, but it couldn't quite pierce the shadows that lingered beneath her eyes, a constant reminder of the long night shift she'd just finished. She ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, the exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and faint traces of lavender from the diffuser in the corner – a futile attempt to mask the institutional odor that permeated the entire wing.

Amelia worked at Mercy Hospital, a sprawling behemoth on the edge of the city, its towering walls seemingly impervious to both joy and despair.  She was an occupational therapist, dedicated to helping patients regain their independence after injuries or illnesses had stripped them of their ability to navigate the world. Today, her first patient was Michael – a young man who'd lost his leg in a motorcycle accident just last month.  Amelia glanced at his file again, her heart tightening with a familiar mix of empathy and determination. His case wasn’t easy, but Amelia believed that even amidst the wreckage of physical trauma, there was always a spark of resilience waiting to be ignited.


The door creaked open, revealing Michael's worried face, framed by a tangle of dark hair and shadowed by the fatigue etched into his features.  Amelia offered him a tired smile. "Ready for another session?" she asked, her voice raspy from disuse.
