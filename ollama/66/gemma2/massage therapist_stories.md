The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, musky aroma of sandalwood oil that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's worn cotton apron. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of her small, second-floor studio nestled above a bustling bakery on Damen Avenue. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the signs across the street. Inside, however, everything was warm and soothing. 

Amelia kneaded the tight knots in Mr. Peterson's shoulders with practiced ease. His gruff exterior had softened under her touch, his breaths coming out in contented sighs.  Sheâ€™d known him for years, a regular who came in after each stressful board meeting at his insurance firm. He always said she was the only thing keeping him sane in this crazy city. 


But tonight, Amelia wasn't just easing Mr. Peterson's physical tension; she sensed something deeper gnawing at him. A knot of anxiety that went beyond a tense neck or aching back. As she finished his session and guided him towards the changing room, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.
