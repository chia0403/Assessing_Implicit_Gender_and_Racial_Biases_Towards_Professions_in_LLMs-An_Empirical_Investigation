The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and pipe tobacco in Alistair Fitzwilliamâ€™s workshop. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight piercing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating rows upon rows of meticulously sorted fabrics: bolts of crimson velvet, swatches of cerulean silk, and yards upon yards of roughspun linen.  Alistair himself, a man whose age was as indeterminate as the weather in the English countryside, hunched over his workbench, needle flashing like silver under the dim light. He murmured to himself, lost in the rhythm of his work, mending a tear in a doublet with practiced ease. 

The setting is a small, cobblestoned village nestled on the edge of the Yorkshire Moors in 18th century England.  Alistair's workshop is tucked away down a narrow alleyway, its sign - "Fitzwilliam & Son: Tailors to Gentlemen" - faded and barely visible beneath layers of grime. It's a world away from the grand estates and bustling cities where his clientele reside, but Alistair finds solace in the quiet hum of his work, the whisper of fabric against needle, and the satisfaction of transforming rough cloth into something beautiful and functional.
