The morning mist hung low over Elmwood Manor like a shroud, clinging to the ancient oaks that lined the drive and swallowing the sounds of the waking world. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled Amelia Thistlewick's nostrils as she unlocked the front door. The manor, with its sprawling wings and crumbling facade, was a silent behemoth, holding secrets within its shadowed halls. 

Amelia, her worn woolen coat pulled tight against the chill, surveyed the scene with practiced eyes. The cobblestones leading to the grand oak doors were slick with dew, and the brass knocker gleamed ominously in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows. This was Elmwood Manor, her domain, a place where dust settled undisturbed for years and echoes whispered of forgotten laughter and tragedy. 

As head housekeeper, Amelia knew every creak and groan of the manor, every stain on the threadbare carpets, every portrait that watched silently from its frame. She was the silent guardian of this crumbling world, keeping the past alive through meticulous cleaning and a deep respect for the history woven into its very walls.  Today, however, a new kind of unease prickled at Amelia's skin. The silence felt deeper, heavier, as if the manor itself held its breath, waiting for something to happen.
