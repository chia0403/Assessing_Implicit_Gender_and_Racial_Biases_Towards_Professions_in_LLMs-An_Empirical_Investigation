The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's worn uniform like a second skin. He pushed his mop across the polished floor of the Grand Blackwood Library, the late-night quiet broken only by the rhythmic squeak and the distant hum of the ventilation system. Moonlight filtered through the arched windows, casting long, skeletal shadows from the towering bookshelves that lined the walls. Outside, the city slept, oblivious to the secrets whispered within these hallowed halls. 

Bart paused, his mop handle resting against a shelf crammed with leather-bound tomes. A stray sunbeam illuminated a faded inscription on one volume: "Beware the whispers in the darkness." He shrugged it off as another romantic flourish from some dusty gothic novel. The library had its share of eccentrics and forgotten lore, but Bart had seen enough to know when fiction blurred into reality.

Or so he thought.  


This night, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck that sent a shiver down his spine. Perhaps it was the unusually low number of late-night readers, or maybe it was the way the shadows seemed to dance with an unnatural intensity. Either way, Bart couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.  He quickened his pace, eager to finish his rounds and escape into the anonymity of the city streets.
