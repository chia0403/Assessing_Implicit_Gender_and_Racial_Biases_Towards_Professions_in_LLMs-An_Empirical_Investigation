The air hung thick with the scent of lilies and regret in the Grand Blackwood Hotel's opulent lobby. Polished marble floors gleamed beneath shimmering chandeliers, reflecting the worried faces of guests pacing nervously like caged sparrows. This was not the usual humdrum of high tea and hushed conversations; this was a gathering storm, and concierge Alistair Finchley knew it before the first raindrop splattered on the glass doors. 

Alistair, tall and impeccably dressed in his midnight blue uniform, surveyed the scene with practiced calm. His silvered hair was swept back neatly, revealing piercing blue eyes that missed nothing.  He moved through the anxious crowd like a conductor leading an orchestra of chaos, calming frayed nerves and dispensing information with the measured precision of a Swiss watch. A storm wasn't just brewing outside; it was gathering force within these walls, and Alistair Finchley, the unsung hero of the Grand Blackwood, was about to be swept right into its heart.
