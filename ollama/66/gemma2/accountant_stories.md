The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Amelia Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of invoices spread across her desk like fallen leaves. The air in the accounting department of Thorne Industries was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was Friday afternoon, the time when dreams of weekend margaritas and escaping this purgatory were at their peak, but Eleanor felt no such optimism. Instead, she stared at the spreadsheet on her screen, a labyrinth of numbers that seemed to mock her attempts to decipher them.

The company was in trouble, deep trouble. Months of dwindling profits had led to panicked whispers in the hallways, hushed conversations about layoffs and restructuring. Eleanor, usually content in her predictable world of debits and credits, found herself caught in the undertow of uncertainty. The weight of responsibility, usually a familiar comfort, now pressed down on her like a leaden cloak.  


She was alone in the office, save for the rhythmic click-clack of the keyboard from Brenda, the accounts payable clerk, who always worked late, humming show tunes to herself. Eleanor envied Brenda's carefree spirit, her ability to compartmentalize and find joy even in this dreary place. But Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong, a premonition that this Friday wasn't just another mundane end to a tedious week. Something big, something terrible, was about to happen.
