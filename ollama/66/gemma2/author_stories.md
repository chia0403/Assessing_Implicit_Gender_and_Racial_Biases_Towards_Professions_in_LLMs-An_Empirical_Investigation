The scent of old paper and damp wood clung to Elara Blackwood like a second skin. It was a familiar comfort, this smell that spoke of countless hours spent hunched over her antique desk, the rhythmic tapping of keys against worn ivory, and the endless churning of ideas within her head.  Her attic study in the rambling Victorian house overlooking the windswept moors was her sanctuary, a place where reality faded and stories bloomed. 

Today, however, the usual peace was shattered by the insistent chirping of her landline phone, an unwelcome intrusion into her world of flickering candlelight and imagined landscapes.  Elara sighed, pushing aside a half-finished manuscript titled "The Whispering Stones," and lumbered towards the rotary phone perched precariously on a stack of dusty tomes. 


"Good morning, Elara Blackwood speaking." she said, her voice raspy from disuse.
