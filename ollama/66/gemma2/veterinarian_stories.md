The humid Georgia air clung to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont like a second skin as she walked across the cracked asphalt towards her clinic. The late afternoon sun beat down mercilessly, casting long shadows from the swaying oak trees lining the road.  Hummingbirds buzzed lazily around the vibrant hibiscus bushes that bordered her property, their tiny wings beating furiously against the stagnant heat. Ellie pushed open the creaky screen door with a sigh, the familiar scent of disinfectant and animal fur washing over her like a comforting wave.

"Ellie! You're late!" came the cheerful voice of Daisy, her longtime receptionist, from behind the counter. 

Ellie chuckled, "Traffic was backed up on Main Street. A herd of goats decided to have a protest march, apparently."  She hung up her satchel and stepped into the warm chaos of her small-town clinic, where the familiar sounds of barking dogs, meowing cats, and the occasional clucking chicken provided a comforting soundtrack to her day. 


Ellie Beaumont's world revolved around healing creatures big and small, from the pampered Persian cat to the scrappy stray hound. She loved the simple rhythm of life in Pinewood Creek, even if it occasionally involved a rogue flock of chickens or a runaway goat herd. But today, Ellie felt a different kind of tension buzzing beneath her skin, a sense that something was about to change.
