The bell above the door tinkled its familiar welcome as Elias Blackwood adjusted the drape over his neck mirror. A quick glance at the half-empty waiting area told him he had another hour before his next appointment, which was good because Mrs. Patterson’s perm from last week had left him with a persistent scent of artificial berries and regret. 

Elias sighed, running a hand through his own unruly mop of dark hair, more in need of a trim than the clients he meticulously styled daily. His shop, "The Cutting Edge," was nestled in the quaint, cobblestone streets of Willow Creek, a town that clung stubbornly to its old-world charm despite the encroaching hum of modernization. 

Willow Creek was a place where everyone knew your name and gossip traveled faster than a runaway cat, making Elias's job more about social commentary than just snipping ends.  He prided himself on his ability to listen to the town’s woes, offering a sympathetic ear and a perfectly sculpted bob alongside his weekly wisdom. Today, however, the air felt thick with anticipation, buzzing with the kind of hushed excitement that preceded a storm - one that Elias suspected would have something to do with the arrival of the mysterious new family who had taken up residence in the old Victorian mansion on the hill.
