The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Sugarplum like a second skin as she adjusted her baker's hat. The late July sun beat down on "Amelia's Amazing Cakes," casting long shadows across the vibrant awnings lining Main Street in St. Augustine.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a cool counterpoint to the sweltering day. Flour dust motes danced in the golden light streaming through the shop windows, illuminating rows of colorful fondant flowers and gleaming sugar pearls.

Amelia Sugarplum, a petite woman with eyes as bright and blue as buttercream frosting, wiped her brow with the back of her hand. Her focus was sharp, honed by years of transforming simple sponge cakes into edible masterpieces. Today, however, she felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. It was the annual St. Augustine Bake-Off, and Amelia had poured her heart and soul into this year's creation: a three-tiered masterpiece inspired by the city's Spanish colonial history.  She just hoped it would be enough to win against the fierce competition, especially considering the newcomer who had opened a fancy patisserie across the street - a woman named Isabella Bellini, rumored to have trained under the most celebrated pastry chefs in Paris.
