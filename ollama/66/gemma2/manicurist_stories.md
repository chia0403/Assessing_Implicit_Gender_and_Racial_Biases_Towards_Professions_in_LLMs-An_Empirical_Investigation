The air hung heavy with the scent of acetone and jasmine as Amelia Rose Petrova filed away the chipped ruby-red lacquer on Mrs. Henderson's thumbnail. Outside, the Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, casting shimmering reflections onto the turquoise water beyond.  Amelia loved this time of day – the languid lull before the dinner rush when tourists still lingered on the beach and the rhythmic hum of hairdryers and chatter filled her salon, "The Coral Nail." 

She paused, listening to Mrs. Henderson recount her latest escapade with a local artist at the Wynwood Walls. Amelia knew all her regulars' stories – their triumphs, their heartbreaks, their juicy gossip about the Miami social scene. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on her skin, an undercurrent to the usual hum of contented chatter. As she moved to polish Mrs. Henderson's nails with a shimmery gold gloss, Amelia caught sight of a man sitting across the street, his gaze fixed intently on the salon. He was tall, dressed in black, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  He didn't seem like a typical tourist, and his presence sent a shiver down Amelia’s spine.
