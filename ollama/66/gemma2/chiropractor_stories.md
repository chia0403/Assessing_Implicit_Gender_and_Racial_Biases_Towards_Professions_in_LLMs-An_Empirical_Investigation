The scent of eucalyptus and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint hum of calming music that played softly from the speakers tucked into the corners of Dr. Amelia Brighton's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the bustling streets of downtown Asheville pulsed with life, but within these walls, a sense of serene calm prevailed.  

Amelia adjusted her glasses, peering at the x-ray on her lightbox. A familiar ache resided in her own shoulders, a constant reminder of the hours she spent hunched over patients, aligning spines and easing tension. It was a calling, this work, but it wasn't always easy. 


Today's first patient was Mrs. Eleanor Patterson, an elderly woman who had come seeking relief from the chronic back pain that threatened to steal her mobility. Amelia looked forward to helping her find some comfort, even if just for a little while. As she waited for Eleanor, Amelia took a moment to close her eyes, breathing in the calming scent of the office and letting the gentle music wash over her.
