The bell shrieked its metallic protest, slicing through the humid July air like a shard of broken glass. Ms. Eleanor Vance sighed, rubbing her temples as the final wave of students tumbled out of her classroom, leaving behind a symphony of rustling backpacks and half-eaten granola bars.  

She surveyed the room – textbooks piled haphazardly on desks, crumpled worksheets scattered across the floor, and a lone purple crayon abandoned like a fallen soldier beside a forgotten history project. Eleanor, despite teaching AP Literature at Northwood High School for ten years, felt a familiar wave of exhaustion wash over her. This year, especially, seemed to be dragging on forever. The endless standardized tests, the dwindling budget, the ever-present hum of parental anxiety – it all combined into a dull ache that settled deep in her bones.

But tonight, something was different. A faint tremor ran through the air, accompanied by an odd buzzing sound that vibrated up Eleanor’s spine. Outside, the cicadas seemed to fall silent, their usual chorus replaced by an unsettling hush.  Eleanor glanced at the clock – 6:01 PM. It was just past dismissal time, and the quiet felt more unnerving than peaceful. The air thickened with anticipation, a sense that something was about to change.


**Setting:** Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building on the outskirts of a small Midwestern town. The year is 2023.
