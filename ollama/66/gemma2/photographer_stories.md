The pungent aroma of salt and seaweed hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tangy bite of chlorine from the nearby public pool. Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries echoing off the weathered clapboard houses that lined Ocean Avenue. The setting sun cast long, orange shadows across the sand, turning it into a canvas of vibrant hues. 

Amelia "Amy" Rose Carter adjusted her camera bag, its weight familiar and comforting on her shoulder. She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar scent of summer on the Jersey Shore, a place she called home but always felt a strange pull to return to after long stints elsewhere. Today, like every other day for the past five years, she was here chasing light. 

Amy wasn't just any photographer; she was a master of capturing fleeting moments, the kind that whispered stories and held memories within their frames. She sought out the subtle beauty in everyday life, the way the sunlight danced on a child's face as they built a sandcastle, the melancholic sigh of the wind through the rusty swing set at dusk, the vibrant tapestry of colors exploding across the sky during a fiery sunset.  

But today felt different. Amy could sense it in the air, a shift in the familiar rhythm. A restless energy pulsed beneath the surface, beckoning her to capture something more than just the mundane beauty of her beloved shore town.
