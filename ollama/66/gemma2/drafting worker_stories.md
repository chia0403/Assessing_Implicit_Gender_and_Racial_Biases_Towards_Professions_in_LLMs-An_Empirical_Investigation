The air in the Drafting Department was thick with the smell of stale coffee and printer toner. Pencil shavings littered Elara Beatrice Finch's desk like fallen snowflakes, each one a testament to her meticulous work on the blueprints for the new Zenith City Hydroelectric Dam. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of drafting tables where workers hunched over their projects, their brows furrowed in concentration.

Elara, however, felt anything but concentrated. Her usual fervor for detail had dwindled to a dull ache. Her pencil lay abandoned beside a half-finished set of schematics, its graphite point dulled from countless revisions. The weight of the project pressed down on her, suffocating any spark of enthusiasm she once held. 

The dam was supposed to be Zenith City's salvation, a beacon of progress in a world grappling with dwindling resources. But lately, it felt more like a monument to bureaucracy and relentless deadlines. And Elara, caught in the middle, was starting to feel like just another cog in the machine.
