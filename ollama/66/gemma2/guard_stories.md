The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay as Elias Thorne, Sergeant of the Royal Guard, adjusted his helmet. Dawn bled across the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised orange and sickly yellow. Beneath his boots, the cobblestones of Port Ebonhaven were slick with a tide that had receded just hours before, leaving behind a carpet of seaweed and refuse. 

Elias squinted at the bustling market square ahead. Merchants hawked their wares - brightly colored fabrics, glistening trinkets, and live fish writhing in buckets. Beyond the stalls, shadowed figures moved through the labyrinthine alleys, their faces obscured by tattered cloaks. The city was alive, a tapestry of light and shadow, trade and treachery, all under the watchful gaze of the towering fortress that dominated the skyline â€“ Citadel Morwen. 

Elias took a deep breath, the salty air stinging his nostrils. He'd been stationed in Port Ebonhaven for three years now, long enough to know its secrets, its dangers, and the ever-present threat that lurked beneath the surface. Today was no different.  He tightened his grip on his sword hilt, ready for whatever chaos the day might bring.
