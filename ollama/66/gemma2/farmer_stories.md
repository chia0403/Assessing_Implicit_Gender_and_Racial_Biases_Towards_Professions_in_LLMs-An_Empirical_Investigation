The rooster's crow was a jarring alarm in Elias Hawthorne's ear, pulling him from a dream filled with plump tomatoes and the scent of fresh-baked bread. Sunlight streamed through the cracks in his boarded-up bedroom window, painting warm stripes across the worn patchwork quilt covering him. Elias sat up, stretching his aching back and letting out a long sigh. Another day on Hawthorne's Farm. 

His farm, nestled in the fertile valley of Willow Creek, was a tapestry woven from generations of sweat and sacrifice. Lush green fields sprawled before his weathered farmhouse, dotted with apple trees laden with ruby-red fruit. The air vibrated with the buzz of bees and the distant mooing of his cows. A gentle mist hung over the meadows, clinging to the blades of grass like shimmering jewels. It was a scene of idyllic peace, but Elias knew beneath its beauty lay the constant toil that kept it alive. He had inherited this farm from his father, and before him, his grandfather, and before them, generations stretching back as far as anyone could remember. The land was in his blood, every inch of it.  


The morning air held a promise of a busy day. Elias needed to tend to the vegetable rows, milk the cows, gather eggs, and fix the leaky roof on the barn – a task he'd been putting off for far too long. He rose, his joints creaking in protest, and pulled on his worn overalls.  As he stepped out onto the porch, a cool breeze whispered through the apple boughs, carrying with it the scent of earth and blooming wildflowers. Elias inhaled deeply, feeling the familiar tug at his heartstrings – this land was his legacy, and he would protect it, nurture it, until his last breath.
