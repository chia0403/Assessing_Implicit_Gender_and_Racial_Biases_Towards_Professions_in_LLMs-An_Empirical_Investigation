The air in the Grand Emerald Hotel hung thick with cigarette smoke and the cloying scent of jasmine from Mrs. Featherstonehaugh's suite on the seventh floor. Arthur Percival Bumblebottom, or "Artie" as he was known to regulars, skillfully maneuvered his trolley through the bustling lobby, dodging a gaggle of giggling debutantes and a portly businessman barking orders into a receiver clamped to his ear. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished marble floors, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the warm air. Artie paused at the front desk, awaiting instructions from Agnes, the eternally exasperated receptionist with a voice like a rusty hinge. 

"Bumblebottom," she rasped, peering over her spectacles. "Room 214 needs an extra pillow. And for heaven's sake, be discreet."  

Artie nodded, knowing full well that discretion was a rare commodity in this hotel, where secrets were as plentiful as spilled champagne and scandals bloomed like exotic orchids in the humid air. He adjusted his starched cap, the brass button glinting in the light, and set off for room 214, his senses alert to the whispers and rustling silk that accompanied him through the grand hallways of the Grand Emerald Hotel.
