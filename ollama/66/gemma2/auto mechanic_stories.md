The smell of burnt oil and gasoline was Amelia “Millie” Hayes’ perfume.  It clung to her faded blue overalls like a second skin, mingling with the faint scent of grease she could never quite wash away. Millie's world was confined within the steel walls of Hayes Auto Repair, a rickety building on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Montana, where the wind howled like a banshee and grit coated everything in a perpetual layer of grime. 

It wasn't much, but it was hers. A legacy passed down from her grandfather, a gruff man with calloused hands and a heart of gold, who had taught Millie everything she knew about engines, transmissions, and the stubborn magic that kept them running. Now, at twenty-five, she was Dustbowl’s only female mechanic, a title she wore with pride despite the raised eyebrows and snide remarks from some of the town's inhabitants. 


The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty floor of the garage as Millie wiped her brow with a grease-stained rag.  A steady rain had been battering the roof all morning, turning the usually parched dirt road into a slick mud pit.  It was the kind of day that made you yearn for the warmth of the shop's rusty old furnace and the comforting hum of a well-tuned engine.
