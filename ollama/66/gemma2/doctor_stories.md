The humid Mississippi air hung heavy in Jackson, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hayes sat on her porch swing, a mug of lukewarm coffee cooling in her hands, watching the late afternoon sun bleed into the horizon. Cicadas pulsed their ceaseless chorus, a soundtrack to the simmering heat that clung to everything.  Her white coat was draped over the back of the swing, its crisp lines a stark contrast to the languid, almost sleepy atmosphere settling over the town. She knew tomorrow would bring the usual chaos of Mercy Hospital's emergency room – gunshot wounds, drunk drivers, and maybe even a case of food poisoning from the local barbecue joint – but for now, she savored the quiet.

The porch swing creaked gently with every languid sway, a comforting rhythm that usually brought Amy solace. But tonight, it only served to amplify her unease. She'd received an anonymous letter earlier that day, tucked into her mailbox like a venomous serpent slithering into her peace.  It spoke of secrets, of mistakes buried deep within Mercy Hospital’s walls, and hinted at something far more sinister lurking beneath the surface. 


Amy knew she should ignore it, chalk it up to a prank or a deranged patient. But a prickling unease danced just below her skin. This wasn't some childish threat; there was a chilling undercurrent to the message that demanded attention.  And as the last sliver of sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across her porch, Amy Hayes knew she couldn't simply brush it aside.
