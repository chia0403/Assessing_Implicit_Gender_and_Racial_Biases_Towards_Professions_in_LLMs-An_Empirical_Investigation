The insistent hum of the fluorescent lights above seemed to amplify the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Rose Thorne's fingers on the worn veneer of her reception desk. It was 8:57 am, just three minutes shy of the official start of another day at Thorne & Associates, and the waiting room remained as silent as a mausoleum.  

Amelia sighed, adjusting the pearl earrings her grandmother had gifted her â€“ a small luxury in a world where practicality reigned supreme. The firm's founder, her grandfather, had believed in keeping things simple: beige walls, sensible furniture, and minimal distractions. It was a philosophy Amelia understood, even if she sometimes yearned for a splash of color, maybe a potted plant or two to break the monotony. 

Outside, the city of Aurora hummed with pre-dawn energy. A symphony of car horns and rumbling engines filled the air, a stark contrast to the hushed anticipation within the firm's sterile walls.  Amelia glanced at the clock again, its red hands inching closer to nine. Soon, the doors would swing open, ushering in a flurry of suits, briefcases, and urgent whispers.  Soon, the quiet calm would be replaced by the controlled chaos that defined Thorne & Associates.
