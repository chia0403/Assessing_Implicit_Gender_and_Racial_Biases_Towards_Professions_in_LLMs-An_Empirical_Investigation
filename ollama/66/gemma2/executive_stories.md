The city hummed beneath Amelia Hawthorne's penthouse suite, a symphony of car horns, construction rumbles, and distant sirens composing a melody as familiar as her own heartbeat.  A thin layer of smog hung over the glittering skyline outside, softening the sharp edges of skyscrapers that clawed at the bruised twilight sky.

Her gut twisted with the cold certainty that this wasn't just another late-night crisis call. This was bigger. Much bigger.
