The midday sun beat down on Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's back as she surveyed the construction site. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by beams slicing through the scaffolding that choked the once-majestic Victorian building. Amelia, her blonde hair escaping its braid and plastered to her forehead with sweat, grimaced. This wasn't the restoration project she had envisioned when she'd landed the prestigious commission a year ago.  

The setting: a crumbling, grand mansion on the outskirts of Charleston, South Carolina, overlooking the Ashley River. It was once the epitome of Southern elegance, a sprawling testament to Gilded Age wealth. Now, it stood as a skeletal silhouette against the vibrant blue sky, its ornate balconies sagging and its windows vacant eyes staring out onto the encroaching wilderness. The air thrummed with the cacophony of hammers, saws, and shouted commands â€“ a symphony of chaos orchestrated by a crew battling to salvage what was left of this architectural jewel. 


Amelia adjusted her glasses, pushing back stray strands of hair that threatened to obscure her vision. She wasn't sure if the building had been neglected, abused, or simply forgotten. But one thing was certain: it held secrets, whispered stories in the creaks and groans of its aged bones.  And Amelia, with her unwavering passion for history and architecture, was determined to unravel them.
