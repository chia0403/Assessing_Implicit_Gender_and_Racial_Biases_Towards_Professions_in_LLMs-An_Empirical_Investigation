The air in Ms. Eloise Beaumont’s office hummed with the low thrum of fluorescent lights and the scent of stale coffee.  She sat behind her cluttered desk, its surface an archipelago of half-eaten candy bars, discarded sticky notes, and well-worn self-help books. Outside her window, the August sun beat down on the asphalt playground, baking the air thick with the cries of children already restless for summer’s end. 

Ms. Beaumont sighed, pushing a stray strand of gray hair behind her ear. This was always the worst time of year – that purgatory between carefree summer days and the looming pressure cooker of another school year. The parents were anxious, the students were bored, and Ms. Beaumont felt the weight of all their anxieties pressing down on her like a wet wool blanket.  Just then, a hesitant knock on the door broke through the stagnant air. "Come in," she called out, bracing herself for whatever drama awaited.
