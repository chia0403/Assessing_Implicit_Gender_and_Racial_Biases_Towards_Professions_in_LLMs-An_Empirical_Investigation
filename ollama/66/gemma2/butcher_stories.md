The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and brine as Elias Bartholomew, known affectionately (or perhaps ironically) by most as "Beefy," hacked through a slab of prime rib. Sweat beaded on his brow, catching the light filtering through the grime-coated windowpanes of Bartholomew's Butcher Shop.  

The shop itself was a relic of a bygone era â€“ dark wood counters worn smooth by years of cleavers and hands, shelves stacked with jars of preserved sausages and pickled vegetables, and the faint hum of a butcher's saw that had been passed down through generations. Outside, cobblestones glistened under the flickering gaslights of Milltown, its inhabitants bundled against the encroaching autumn chill. The rhythmic clang of Elias's cleaver against bone was the only sound besides the distant clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the mournful cry of a stray dog somewhere in the labyrinthine back alleys. 


Elias paused his work, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. A bell chimed above the door as a customer entered, bringing with them a gust of cold air and the scent of damp earth.
