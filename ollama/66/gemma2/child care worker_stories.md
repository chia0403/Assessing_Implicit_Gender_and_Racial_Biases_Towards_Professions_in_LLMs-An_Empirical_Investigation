The aroma of cinnamon and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a potent reminder that Elara Willowbrook had once again underestimated the power of a preschool oven.  It wasn't the first time, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. Smoke curled from behind the makeshift barricade of cushions Elara had erected between the toddlers and the rogue batch of cookies baking inside. She sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that constantly threatened to escape its braid.

"Alright little ones," she announced with a forced cheeriness that wouldn't fool even the youngest in her care, "Snack time is postponed. We're going to have some special fire safety lessons instead!"  The toddlers, oblivious to the culinary disaster unfolding, erupted into squeals of delight at the prospect of anything involving a lesson, especially one involving dramatic pronouncements and waving arms.  

Elara smiled wearily. This was just another Tuesday morning at "Rainbow Dreams," a small, independent daycare nestled in a quiet corner of Brooklyn.  It was chaotic, messy, and often smelled faintly of burnt toast, but it was her haven.
