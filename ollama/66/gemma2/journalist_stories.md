The humid Hong Kong air clung to Amelia Beatrice Lee like a second skin as she navigated the bustling night market. Neon signs buzzed with advertisements in Cantonese and Mandarin, casting lurid shadows on the throngs of hawkers and shoppers. The scent of sizzling street food mingled with incense from nearby temples, creating a chaotic symphony for the senses. 

Amelia, her notebook clutched tightly in one hand and her phone pressed to her ear in the other, weaved through the crowd, ignoring the insistent tug of a child wanting candy floss. "No, Aunt Mei," she whispered urgently into the phone, "I'm almost there. Just need to get past this stall selling...are those pickled starfish?"

She could hear her aunt’s exasperated sigh on the other end. “Amelia, you're going to miss the entire meeting if you keep getting distracted!"


Amelia smiled sheepishly and mouthed a quick apology to the bewildered vendor before hurrying onward, her eyes fixed on the dimly lit doorway of a teahouse tucked away in a quiet corner of the market. It was here she was supposed to meet her source – a whistleblower with information that could rock the city’s notoriously corrupt political scene.
