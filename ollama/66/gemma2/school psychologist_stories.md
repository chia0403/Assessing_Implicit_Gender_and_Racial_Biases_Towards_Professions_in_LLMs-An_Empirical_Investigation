The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Albright's head, casting a sterile white glow over the cluttered office.  Paperclips clattered from their dispenser, landing on a mountain of student files already piled precariously high on her desk. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and anxiety - a potent mix that was as familiar to Eleanor as her own heartbeat. 

It was Friday afternoon, the day reserved for crisis calls, parent conferences, and those particularly baffling referrals that seemed to defy explanation. Today’s first call came in at precisely 3:17 pm. It was Mrs. Henderson from third grade, voice trembling with a mixture of worry and accusation. "Dr. Albright," she said, her voice strained, “Something is terribly wrong with Timmy. He says he sees… shadows."


Eleanor braced herself.  This was a school psychologist’s life: wading through the murky waters of childhood, trying to decipher whispers of fear, anxieties disguised as nightmares, and the occasional, inexplicable glitch in reality. She took a deep breath, smoothing down her already-rumpled cardigan. "Mrs. Henderson," she said, her voice calm and reassuring, "Let's start from the beginning."
