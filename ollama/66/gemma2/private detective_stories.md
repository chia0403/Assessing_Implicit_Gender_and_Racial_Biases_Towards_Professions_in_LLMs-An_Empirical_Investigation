The scent of stale beer and desperation hung heavy in The Rusty Nail like a fog. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign outside. Inside, the dim light cast long shadows across the grimy tables and sticky floor. This was Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's preferred haunt - cheap whiskey, indifferent barflies, and just enough trouble to keep her sharp.  

Ellie sat hunched over a half-empty glass, her trench coat pulled tight against the chill seeping in from the cracked door. The rain had started an hour ago, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest. Her client was late, again.  Heâ€™d promised to be here at nine, but it was almost ten, and the only thing arriving on time was the inevitable headache that followed a night of this watered-down whiskey. She glanced at the worn photograph clutched in her hand - a young woman with laughing eyes and hair like spun gold. The same golden hair that Ellie now wore braided into a tight bun, hidden beneath her fedora.  

The photograph had been left on her doorstep just hours ago, tucked inside an envelope sealed with a single wax drop. It read: "Find her." No name, no address, just that haunting image and a plea for help veiled in mystery.  Ellie knew this case wouldn't be easy. 


Her past experience taught her to expect the unexpected. And right now, the only thing she could expect was another long, lonely night spent chasing ghosts in The Rusty Nail.
