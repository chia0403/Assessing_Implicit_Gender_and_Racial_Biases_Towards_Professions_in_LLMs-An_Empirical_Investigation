The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head like an agitated hive of bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of "Bargain Buys." Each aisle stretched before her, crammed with discounted goods and faded dreams. A crumpled bag of potato chips lay abandoned by the candy display, a testament to someone who’d given up halfway through their bargain hunt. Amelia sighed, tapping her acrylic nails against the worn keypad of the register. 

It was Wednesday afternoon, the slowest time of day at Bargain Buys.  The usual after-work crowd hadn't arrived yet, and the early retirees had long since retreated to bingo night and their lukewarm coffee. This left Amelia with only the faint hum of the refrigerator in the back room and the occasional crackle of the intercom announcing "Employee discount applied" as a welcome distraction from the silence. She glanced at the clock - 3:12 PM - and wondered if Mr. Henderson, the grumpy manager with a penchant for mismatched socks, would finally grace her with his presence before closing time.  Or worse, she'd be stuck scanning empty shelves and counting imaginary dollars until seven o’clock rolled around.
