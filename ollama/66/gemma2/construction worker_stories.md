The morning sun was barely peeking over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty site when Elias "Eli" Vance swung his leg over the rusted scaffolding ladder. His boots landed with a familiar thud on the concrete floor, the scent of fresh asphalt and welding fumes hitting him like a warm hug.  He stretched, feeling the familiar ache in his lower back, a souvenir from years spent coaxing steel and stone into submission. 

The construction site was a symphony of chaos – the rhythmic clanging of hammers, the guttural roar of machinery, the shouts of foremen barking instructions. The air buzzed with activity, a hive of men and machines transforming a vacant lot on the outskirts of Chicago into a gleaming skyscraper that would soon pierce the city's skyline. 

Eli was just another cog in this machine, his calloused hands wielding tools with practiced ease. He’d spent most of his life here, surrounded by steel beams and concrete blocks, feeling more at home amidst the deafening roar than the hushed silence of a library. His world was measured in blueprints and cubic yards, his days defined by the rising and setting sun over this ever-evolving cityscape.
