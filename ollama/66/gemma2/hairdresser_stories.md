The air in "Shear Bliss" hummed with the low murmur of conversation and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors.  Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, casting golden rectangles across the rows of plush purple chairs. Lavender scented shampoo swirled in crystal clear bottles on the counter, a delicate floral scent battling the faint tang of bleach that always hung in the air.  

This was Esme Celeste Dubois's domain. She held court from behind her station, a whirlwind of bleached blonde curls and perfectly manicured nails, expertly weaving magic into unruly tresses. Her hands moved with practiced grace, transforming messy manes into sculpted masterpieces. Today, however, she felt the familiar prickle of unease beneath her usual confident facade. A nervous energy thrummed through the salon, emanating from a single client: Mrs. Amelia Worthington, her face pale and drawn, eyes filled with a desperation that Esme had only ever seen once before.
