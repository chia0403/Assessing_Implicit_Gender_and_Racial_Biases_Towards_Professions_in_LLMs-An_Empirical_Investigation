The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt solder, a familiar perfume to Elias Thornwood, master electrician extraordinaire.  His workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the bustling city of New Aethelgard, was a symphony of organized chaos. Tools lay scattered on meticulously cleaned workbenches, wires snaked across the floor like metallic vines, and salvaged circuit boards glinted under the dim glow of an old oil lamp. Elias himself, a man whose hands seemed more comfortable wielding pliers than forks, knelt beside a disassembled automaton, its intricate gears frozen in mid-motion. A tangle of wires lay beside it, each one labelled with a meticulous script only he could decipher. 


New Aethelgard, a city pulsing with magic and industry, was a place where steam engines churned alongside enchanted carriages, where cobblestone streets were illuminated by lampposts fueled by aetherium crystals, and where electricians like Elias were considered wizards of their own kind, capable of bending the very fabric of technology to their will.  But today, Elias's magic felt as dormant as the automaton before him. A sense of unease gnawed at his gut, a feeling that this repair wasn’t just about fixing gears and wires – it was about something bigger, something he couldn’t quite grasp.
