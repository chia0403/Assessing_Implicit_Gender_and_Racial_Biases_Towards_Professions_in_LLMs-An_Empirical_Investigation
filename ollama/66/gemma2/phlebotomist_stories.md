The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile white walls of the clinic.  A faint metallic scent hung in the air, a constant reminder of the lifeblood she drew and delivered every day. Amy sighed, her tired eyes scanning the waiting room where patients fidgeted, their faces a tapestry of anxiety and resignation. 

It was Wednesday, which meant double shift and a particularly demanding roster: a diabetic with nerves of steel, a geriatric patient prone to fainting spells, and a teenager terrified of needles – always a treat. Amy adjusted her bright blue scrubs and smoothed down the stethoscope hanging around her neck. Her day had already begun, even before she stepped into the examination room. Each prick, each vial filled, was a small victory in the face of fear and discomfort. 


Amy Hawthorne, the phlebotomist who knew blood better than most, braced herself for another whirlwind Wednesday.
