The crimson sun bled across the horizon, painting the endless expanse of the Aethel Sea in hues of fire and amethyst. Captain Elara Vance squinted through the cockpit canopy, her weathered face illuminated by the flickering console lights. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the already blurred landscape below – a patchwork of parched earth and sun-bleached salt flats that stretched as far as the eye could see.  

Elara's battered freighter, the 'Wanderer', groaned under the strain of its journey. The ancient vessel sputtered like a dying beast, its engine coughing out plumes of greasy smoke that trailed behind them like spectral serpents. 


This was no place for sentimental flights – this was Aethel Prime, a desolate world on the fringes of the known galaxy, where resources were scarce and hope even more so. It was here Elara had come to chase whispers, rumours of a long-lost artifact, a device whispered to hold unimaginable power. The only problem? No one knew if it was real, or if it existed beyond myth and legend.
