The scent of rain-soaked earth clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance's cardigan as she hurried across the manicured lawn of the Institute. The late afternoon sky was bruised purple and grey, threatening an imminent downpour. A single oak tree, its leaves glistening with moisture, stood sentinel at the entrance, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced in the flickering lamplight. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, their metal frames cold against her skin. Tonight's patient, a young woman named Amelia Hayes, had been referred for "intense anxiety" and "night terrors," but Eleanor sensed something more sinister lurking beneath the surface. Her gut, honed from years of dissecting troubled minds, whispered warnings she couldn't ignore. 

The Institute was a haven for the mentally afflicted, a fortress of brick and glass nestled amidst rolling hills. Its imposing facade promised healing, but Eleanor knew that sometimes, the very walls could hold secrets more terrifying than any patient they housed.
