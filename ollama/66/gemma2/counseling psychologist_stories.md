The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office was thick with the scent of lavender and desperation. Sunlight slanted through the blinds, casting long stripes across the beige carpet and landing directly on a single dusty ray of light filtering through the cracks in the windowpane.  Eleanor, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, sat perched on the edge of her leather armchair, waiting for her next patient. The ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner was a metronome keeping time with the anxious flutter in her chest. She wasn't sure if it was anticipation or the lingering unease from the last session that had left her feeling unsettled.  

Eleanor Vance, renowned for her empathetic approach and uncanny ability to decipher the tangled webs of human emotion, felt strangely out of her depth today. It wasn’t a specific case; rather, it was an overarching sense of dread that clung to her like morning mist. The city outside hummed with its usual symphony of chaos, but within the four walls of her office, a palpable silence hung heavy in the air, pregnant with untold stories waiting to be shared.
