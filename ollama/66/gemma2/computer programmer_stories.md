The neon glow of the city painted Elara Skye's tiny apartment in hues of electric blue and vibrant pink. Outside, the ceaseless hum of traffic mingled with the distant thrum of holographic billboards advertising the latest augmented reality experiences. Inside, Elara hunched over her monitor, a tangle of wires snaking from her custom-built rig like metallic vines. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, lines of code scrolling past in a mesmerizing blur.

Elara wasn't just any programmer; she was a specialist in "ghosting," a highly sought-after niche that involved manipulating digital remnants left behind by deleted data. People often whispered about her abilities, calling her "The Data Whisperer" â€“ a title she both embraced and resented. Tonight, however, Elara wasn't ghosting for the usual clientele - wealthy socialites desperate to uncover hidden secrets or corporations seeking buried intel. Tonight was different. Tonight, she was chasing a ghost of her own.
