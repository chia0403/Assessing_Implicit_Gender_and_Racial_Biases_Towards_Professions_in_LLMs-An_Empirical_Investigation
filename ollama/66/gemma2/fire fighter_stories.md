The acrid scent of smoke hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Brightonâ€™s uniform like a second skin.  She stood at the mouth of the burning warehouse, helmet tilted back, eyes scanning the swirling orange chaos within. Flames licked greedily at the corrugated metal roof, casting monstrous shadows that danced across the rain-slicked asphalt. A fierce wind whipped through the gaps in the building, sending debris spiraling into the night sky like fiery comets.  

Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself against the heat and the overwhelming sense of urgency. The warehouse was a labyrinth of stacked crates and machinery, its interior shrouded in smoke so dense it felt like wading through fog. Two firefighters were already inside, battling the blaze with hoses that hissed and spat water into the inferno.  

Amy grabbed her axe, feeling the familiar weight settle reassuringly in her grip. Time to get to work. 


The warehouse was located on the outskirts of Ashton, a bustling port city nestled along the jagged Maine coastline. The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its brick walls scarred and blackened by years of neglect. It had stood empty for decades, rumored to have been a hub for illicit activity in its heyday. Now, it was a tinderbox waiting to ignite.
