The air in Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop's office was thick with the scent of jasmine and unspoken tension. Eleanor, her fingers drumming a nervous rhythm on her worn antique desk, watched as Mr. Davenport paced back and forth like a caged lion. His usually impeccably tailored suit looked rumpled, his tie askew, and his face contorted in a grimace that could curdle milk. Outside the window, the London sky was turning the colour of bruised plums, mirroring the storm brewing within the office walls. 

Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to soothe the fluttering in her chest. She was just a secretary, an invisible cog in the grand machine of Davenport & Sons, but something about the urgency in Mr. Davenport's voice when heâ€™d called her in just moments ago had set her on edge.  


He stopped pacing abruptly, his gaze landing on Eleanor with a force that made her flinch. 

"Eleanor," he began, his voice gruff and low, "I need you to do something for me." He reached into his pocket, retrieving a thick envelope sealed with wax. His eyes, usually twinkling with mischief, were now dark and serious. "This is... delicate. And it needs discretion."


His words hung in the air like a promise and a threat, leaving Eleanor suspended between anticipation and apprehension. She knew whatever was in that envelope had the potential to change everything.
