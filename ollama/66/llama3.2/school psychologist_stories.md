Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In the heart of the town square stood the Oakdale High School, its stone fa√ßade bearing witness to generations of students, teachers, and community members who had walked through its halls.

Inside the school, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was making her way down the deserted hallway, her eyes scanning the lockers and classrooms for signs of life. As the school psychologist, Lexi was no stranger to the daily routines of Oakdale High's students, but tonight felt different. Perhaps it was the eerie quiet that hung over the school like a whispered secret, or maybe it was the sense of unease that had been building in her own mind all day.

Lexi had always loved working with kids, and as a school psychologist, she had seen her fair share of struggles and triumphs. But tonight, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A mysterious note had arrived at her office earlier that afternoon, its cryptic message scrawled on a piece of paper in red ink: "They're watching you."

Lexi pushed open the door to her office, a small room nestled between the school's main hallway and the library. The words on the note seemed to dance in her mind as she sat down behind her desk, her eyes scanning the familiar surroundings for any signs of what might be lurking just beneath the surface.

As she began to tidy up her notes and files, Lexi couldn't help but wonder: who had written that note, and what did they really want from her?
