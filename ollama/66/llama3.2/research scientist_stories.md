Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elianore "Eli" Quasar woke up to the sound of rain pattering against the windows of her small, cluttered apartment in the heart of Seattle's University District. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, revealing a tangled mess of curly brown hair and a scattering of dark circles under them. As she swung her legs over the side of the bed, her gaze fell upon the worn leather journal lying open on the nightstand, its pages filled with scribbled notes and equations that only made sense to her.

Eli stretched, feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders from hours spent hunched over a microscope or pouring over lines of code. As a research scientist at the University of Washington's Department of Physics, she had spent years studying the properties of quantum entanglement, hoping to unlock its secrets and make a groundbreaking discovery that would change the course of history.

But on this particular morning, Eli felt a sense of unease settling in the pit of her stomach. She had been working tirelessly for months, pouring over data and running simulations, but she couldn't shake the feeling that she was missing something crucial. Something that might just prove her theory wrong.

As she stood up and began to get dressed, the rain outside seemed to grow louder, as if it too sensed the turmoil brewing inside Eli's mind. She took a deep breath, trying to clear her head, but the doubts lingered, like a faint hum in the background of her thoughts.

The university's research facility loomed outside her apartment window, its sleek glass and steel fa√ßade reflecting the rain-soaked cityscape like a mirrored lake. Eli knew that she had a long day ahead of her - a meeting with her team to discuss their latest findings, followed by a grueling session in the lab to analyze data and run simulations. But as she headed out into the downpour, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just another ordinary day at the office...
