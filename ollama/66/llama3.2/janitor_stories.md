Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above the school's main hallway cast an unforgiving glare over the deserted corridors, the only sound the soft hum of the heating system and the distant echo of a janitor's cart rattling down the tile floor. Amidst this monotony, Amari Ramesh Patel moved with the quiet efficiency of a man who knew every nook and cranny of his domain.

As the school's lowest-paid janitor, Amari had spent years perfecting his craft, scrubbing toilets that seemed to never get clean enough for even the most fastidious administrators. His days blended together in a haze of disinfectant fumes and stale air, punctuated only by the occasional cry from a child or the clatter of pots and pans as he cleaned up after lunch.

Despite the drudgery, Amari took pride in his work, knowing that without him, the school's floors would be slick with spilled juice, the classrooms a mess of discarded papers and broken pencils. He moved with a practiced air, his worn sneakers making barely a sound on the linoleum as he made his way to the first floor's cafeteria, where the day's trash needed collecting.

As he turned the corner into the cafeteria, Amari caught sight of something that made his heart skip a beat - a small, folded piece of paper tucked away in a dumpster corner, with a note scrawled on it in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at 3rd floor hallway at 5pm. Come alone."
