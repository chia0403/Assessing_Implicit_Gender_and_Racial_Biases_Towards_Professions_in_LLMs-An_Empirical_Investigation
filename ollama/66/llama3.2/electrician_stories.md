Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small workshop nestled between the old mill and the local diner, a lone figure tinkered with a humming electrical circuit.

His name was Jack Alexander "Alex" Thompson, a 35-year-old electrician with a passion for restoring old houses to their former glory. With a thick beard and a mop of curly brown hair, Alex was always dressed in worn jeans and a faded plaid shirt, covered in grease stains from his latest project. As he worked, the sound of his wrench striking the metal studs echoed through the workshop, accompanied by the soft whir of his drill press.

Tonight, Alex was working on a particularly tricky repair - a vintage circuit breaker that had been installed in a 1920s bungalow on Elm Street. The homeowner, an elderly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, had asked him to fix it before the town's annual Harvest Festival, where she planned to showcase her prize-winning pumpkin pie. Alex was determined to get the job done, but as he worked, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that lingered just beneath the surface of his usually calm and methodical mind.

Little did Alex know, this would be only the beginning of a night that would change everything.
