Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Thompson stepped out of the dimly lit hospital corridor and into the crisp night air, the sound of rain pattering against the pavement a stark contrast to the sterile beeps and whirs of the operating room he had just left. The neon signs of the city's bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets.

As a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon at Mercy Hospital, Elliot was no stranger to long hours and high stakes. But tonight felt different, like something was weighing on his mind that he couldn't shake. He took a deep breath, letting the cool air fill his lungs, and made his way towards the parking garage where his old truck was waiting.

The city lights blurred together as he drove home, his thoughts consumed by the patient he had just operated on - a young woman named Sarah who was fighting for her life against a rare and aggressive form of cancer. Elliot couldn't help but wonder if he had done everything he could to save her, if there were any other options that might have given her a chance at survival.

As he pulled into his driveway, the lights of his house flickered on, illuminating the dark silhouette of his wife, Rachel, standing in the doorway. She smiled weakly as Elliot climbed out of the truck, her eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep.

"Hey," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "How was the surgery?"

Elliot's heart sank as he took in the worried look on his wife's face. He knew that Sarah's case would be weighing heavily on his mind for days to come, and he had a feeling that this wasn't going to be an easy night.
