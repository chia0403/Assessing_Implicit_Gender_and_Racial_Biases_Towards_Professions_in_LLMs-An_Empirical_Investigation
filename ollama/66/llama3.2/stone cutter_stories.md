Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Ashwood, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings. In the midst of this quaint village, a lone figure stood hunched over his workbench, surrounded by shards of stone and glinting steel tools. His name was Emrys Wystan Fletcher, and he was the town's most skilled stone cutter.

Emrys's eyes, a deep shade of blue that seemed almost grey in the fading light, were fixed intently on the piece of Carrara marble he was working on, carefully chipping away at its surface with precision and care. The sound of his tools - a gentle scratch-scratch-scratch as they bit into the stone - was the only noise to break the stillness of the evening.
