Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Manhattan gleamed like polished onyx as the night air clung to the skyscrapers like a damp shroud. Inside the opulent office of Johnson & Associates, a prestigious law firm in the heart of the city, the soft glow of overhead lighting cast an eerie pallor over the sleek, modern décor.

Avery Wren Everett, a sharp-minded and unyielding lawyer with a reputation for being one of the most formidable advocates in her field, stood at the window, gazing out into the darkness. Her piercing emerald eyes seemed to bore into the city itself, as if searching for some hidden truth that only she could uncover.

It was late on a Friday evening, and the office was almost deserted – just Avery, her assistant, Emily, and a lone, flickering computer screen casting an otherworldly glow over the rows of neatly organized files and tomes. The phone had been silent all day, but the silence was about to be shattered by an unexpected arrival that would set off a chain reaction of events that would shake Avery's carefully constructed world to its very foundations.

And then, just as she was starting to relax into the familiar rhythms of her workday, the soft chime of the office intercom pierced the air, sending a shiver down Avery's spine...

How does this sound?
