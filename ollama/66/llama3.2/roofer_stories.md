As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, Indiana, 32-year-old Jasper Elijah Wilson made his way back to his worn pickup truck, parked at the edge of the quiet neighborhood where he'd spent the day fixing leaky shingles and patching broken gutters. The smell of fresh-cut grass and freshly poured asphalt still clung to his clothes as he opened the creaky tailgate, revealing a toolbox that had been passed down to him from his father and a stack of half-empty cans of paint.

The Wilson's Roofing Co., Jasper's family business for nearly two decades, was nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, its faded sign bearing the same proud emblem – an eagle perched atop a curling brick – that Jasper's father had affixed to the door all those years ago. As Jasper loaded his gear into the truck, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss in this sleepy little town, where everyone knew each other's names and the only thing that ever seemed to change was the seasons.

A faint hum of anxiety thrummed through Jasper's chest as he gazed out at the familiar streets, lined with homes that had stood for generations. He'd always taken pride in knowing every corner of this town, but tonight something felt different – like a storm was brewing just beyond the horizon, one that would shake the very foundations of everything Jasper thought he knew about Willow Creek and his place within it.
