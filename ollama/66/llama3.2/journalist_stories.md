Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The small, coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, nestled in the rugged northwestern corner of England. The year is 2023, and the town has seen better days. Once a thriving hub for fishing and tourism, Ravenswood's economy has been in decline since the closure of its iconic fishing factory twenty years ago.

**Main Character:**

Meet Emily Rose Winters, a determined and resourceful journalist who has returned to her hometown of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea after several years away. Emily is a 30-year-old investigative reporter with a passion for uncovering the truth and telling the stories that need to be told. She grew up in Ravenswood, where she developed a deep love for the sea and its people, but also witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of economic decline and social isolation.

As Emily settles back into her childhood home, a small cottage overlooking the harbor, she can't shake the feeling that something is off in Ravenswood. The town seems quieter than it used to be, and the few new businesses that have opened up seem to be struggling to stay afloat. It's as if the town is holding its breath, waiting for something – or someone – to change its fortunes.

As Emily begins her investigation into the recent closures of several local businesses, she starts to unravel a web of secrets and lies that threaten to destroy the very fabric of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea. Little does she know, her own past is about to come back to haunt her, and the truth she uncovers will put everything – including herself – at risk.
