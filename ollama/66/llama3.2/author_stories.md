Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Paris glistened like polished onyx as Emilia Sophia Fournier stepped out of her small, cluttered apartment and into the gray dawn. She stretched her arms above her head, feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders from hours spent hunched over her writing desk. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of old books and stale cigarettes that lingered in every corner of her tiny space.

Emilia took a deep breath, letting the cool mist of the morning air fill her lungs. She had always loved this time of day, when the city was still waking up and the world felt full of possibility. As an author of literary fiction, she often found herself lost in the characters and worlds she created, but today, she just wanted to lose herself in the blank pages of a fresh notebook.

With a sigh, Emilia slung her worn leather satchel over her shoulder, its contents clinking softly against her hip. She had been working on her latest manuscript for months, pouring all of her hopes and fears into the story of a young woman named Colette, who struggled to find her place in a world that seemed determined to confine her.

As she walked through the deserted streets, Emilia felt a sense of restlessness building inside her. Something was missing from her latest chapter, something that refused to be written out or explained away. And yet, with every step, she felt a thrill of excitement, a sense that this story – like all stories – was still waiting for her to unlock its secrets.

How's this? I aimed to create a cozy and atmospheric setting, while also hinting at the main character's creative struggles and personal doubts.
