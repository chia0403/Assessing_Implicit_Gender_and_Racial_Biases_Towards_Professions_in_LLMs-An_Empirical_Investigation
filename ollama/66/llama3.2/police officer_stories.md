Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Detective Emilia Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the rain-soaked pier, her eyes fixed on the dark waters of the bay. The dim glow of the lighthouse in the distance cast an eerie light on the waves, as if beckoning her into the depths below. It was 3:47 AM, and the only sound was the rhythmic beat of the rain hitting the pavement.

Emilia took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist fill her lungs. She had always loved the early morning hours, when the city was still waking up and the world felt full of possibility. But tonight was different. Tonight, she had a case that required her attention – one that threatened to shake everything she thought she knew about this quiet coastal town.

The phone in her pocket buzzed with an incoming text from dispatch: "Possible homicide on pier 7. Witnesses report a fight and a body. ETA 15 minutes."

Emilia's heart sank as she gazed out at the water. This was it – the break they had been waiting for. The investigation into the string of disappearances that had plagued this town for months would finally have its answer. But as she turned to head back towards her car, a shiver ran down her spine.

Something didn't feel right.
