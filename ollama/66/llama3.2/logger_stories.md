Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Willow Creek, Oregon, like a damp blanket wrapping around its residents. The year was 1955, and the Great Depression was still a recent memory, but the logging industry had become a way of life for many families in this rural community. On a small cabin nestled at the edge of the forest, Elijah "Hawk" Hawkins stirred from his slumber, the sound of his wife, Ruth, calling out to him from the kitchen.

As he dressed in the dim light, Hawk gazed out the window at the towering Douglas fir trees, their branches swaying gently in the morning breeze. The smell of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a familiar scent that brought him comfort. He had grown up in these woods, learning the art of logging from his father, who had taught him everything he knew.

The Hawkins family's small cabin was surrounded by 200 acres of timberland, which Elijah spent most of his waking hours managing. His job at the local lumbermill paid decent wages, and he took pride in providing for his family and community. But with the logging industry facing stiff competition from big corporations, Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in Willow Creek.
