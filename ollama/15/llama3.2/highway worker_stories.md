Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since dipped below the horizon, casting a dark shadow over the stretch of Highway 17 that Jack Harrison had spent the better part of his life fixing. As a seasoned highway worker, Jack knew every pothole, every patch of oil-soaked asphalt, and every curve that could cause a car to spin out of control like the back of his hand. He'd worked on this very stretch for over a decade, and he thought he saw it all.

But tonight was different. Tonight, as Jack made his way down the deserted highway in his truck, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air was thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the soft hum of the diesel engine beneath him and the occasional hoot of a distant owl. Jack's eyes scanned the darkness, his hand instinctively reaching for the flashlight on his dashboard.

It had been a long day, filled with narrow escapes from feral dogs and treacherous road conditions that would make even the most seasoned driver think twice. But it was the phone call he'd received earlier in the evening – a cryptic message from an unknown number, warning him to stay off the highway for his own safety – that had really set Jack's teeth on edge.

He pulled over to the side of the road, the tires crunching on the gravel shoulder as he killed the engine. The darkness seemed to press in around him, and for a moment, Jack wondered if he'd made a mistake by staying out here alone. But then, something caught his eye – a small piece of paper stuck between the seats of his truck, a note scrawled in hasty handwriting that made his heart skip a beat.

"Get off the road," it read. "Tonight."

And with that, Jack's world went from ordinary to utterly, completely strange.
