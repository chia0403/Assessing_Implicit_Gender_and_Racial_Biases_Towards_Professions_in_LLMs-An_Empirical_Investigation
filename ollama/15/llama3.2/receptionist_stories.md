Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. The air was crisp and clean, carrying the scent of freshly brewed coffee from the local caf√© down the street. In a quiet office building on Elm Street, receptionist Emily Joy Thompson stirred in her chair, rubbing the sleep from her eyes as she checked the time for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.

It was 6:30 AM, and the office wasn't supposed to open for another hour. But with the recent change in management, Emily's boss, Rachel, had decided to bring the team in early to get a head start on the day. As she sipped her lukewarm coffee from the thermos on her desk, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over her. She was the only one who seemed to be taking this new "agile" work schedule seriously, while everyone else was still trying to adjust.

Just as Emily was starting to get settled in, she heard the sound of footsteps outside her cubicle wall. The door swung open, and a tall, lanky man with a mop of messy brown hair and a warm smile walked into the office, carrying a large coffee cup in one hand and a worn leather briefcase in the other. Emily's heart skipped a beat as she took in his familiar features - it was her old high school friend, Max Wells, who had come back to town after years away.

"Hey, Em!" Max said, flashing his famous smile as he made his way towards her desk. "Long time no see! What's the plan for today?"

Emily's eyes locked onto Max's, a mix of surprise and curiosity sparking within her. She hadn't seen or spoken to Max in over five years, not since their complicated high school romance had imploded. But something about the way he looked at her now - with kindness, but also with a hint of mischief - made Emily wonder if their past was about to catch up with them once again...
