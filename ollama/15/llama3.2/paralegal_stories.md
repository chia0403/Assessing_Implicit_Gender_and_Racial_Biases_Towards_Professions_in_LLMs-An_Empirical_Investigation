Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she gazed out the rain-soaked window of her small apartment, Emily Anne Thompson couldn't help but feel like another day was going to be just as dull as the last. A paralegal at a mid-sized law firm in downtown Seattle, Emily had grown accustomed to the monotony of office politics and endless paperwork. But it wasn't the 9-to-5 routine that kept her up at night - it was the nagging sense of injustice that seemed to seep into every case she worked on.

The dim glow of the city lights outside cast an eerie shadow over Emily's cluttered living room, a reflection of the messiness that had begun to creep into her own life. She had recently gone through a messy breakup with her long-term boyfriend, and the remnants of their relationship still lingered in every corner of her apartment - from the faded t-shirt on her bed to the scattered jewelry box that now sat empty.

Just as Emily was starting to feel like she'd hit rock bottom, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. She hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering who could be calling at this ungodly hour. Little did she know, it would be the start of a case that would shake everything she thought she knew about justice - and herself.

How does this sound? I've introduced Emily Anne Thompson as a paralegal working in Seattle, with a hint of personal struggle and a sense of restlessness. The story can now unfold from here, exploring her journey through a challenging case and perhaps revealing more about her background and motivations.
