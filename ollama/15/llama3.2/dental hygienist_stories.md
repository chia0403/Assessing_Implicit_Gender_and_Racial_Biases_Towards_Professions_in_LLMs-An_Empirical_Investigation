Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the small beachside strip where Dr. Emily Anne Waters, RDH, was preparing for another day at her dental practice. The smell of saltwater and fresh coffee wafted through the air as she prepped for the morning's appointments, her eyes scanning the rows of gleaming dental instruments on the counter.

Emily Anne had always loved working with people, but after years of studying to become a hygienist, she'd found that her true passion lay in making a difference in her patients' lives, one sparkling smile at a time. She took pride in her work, carefully removing plaque and tartar from teeth, educating patients on the importance of oral hygiene, and making even the most anxious patients feel at ease.

As she locked up the practice and headed out to grab breakfast at the local café, Emily Anne couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the usual chatter about the latest town gossip or the upcoming beach festival – it felt like there was a sense of unease in the air, a collective breath-holding as if everyone was waiting for something to happen. And Emily Anne had a nagging sense that she was about to find out what.

The sound of seagulls filled the air as she walked along the beach, the waves crashing against the shore just a few feet away. It was moments like these that made her grateful to live in Tidal Cove – there was something about the ocean's vastness and power that put things into perspective. But today, Emily Anne couldn't shake the feeling that her small town was on the cusp of something big, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.
