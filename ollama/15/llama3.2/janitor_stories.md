Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights above the worn linoleum floor cast an unforgiving glare on the drab concrete walls of Ravenswood High School, illuminating the dusty corners where generations of students had once left their mark. It was 7:30 AM on a chilly autumn morning, and the school was already stirring to life.

In the dimly lit janitor's closet, nestled between rows of rusty cleaning equipment and tattered paper towels, Jorge "Joey" Morales adjusted his worn denim jacket and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. At 22 years old, Joey had been working as a janitor at Ravenswood for three years, earning a meager but steady income to support himself while he attended community college on the weekends.

As he began to gather his cleaning supplies for the day – a battered vacuum, a stack of worn scrub brushes, and a canister of disinfectant – Joey's mind wandered to the day ahead. He had a part-time job at the school's cafeteria during lunch, where he would be serving soggy pizza slices to rowdy freshmen and anxious seniors alike. It was a thankless gig, but it paid the bills.

Joey took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for another long day of sweeping up after his fellow students' antics, as well as dealing with the occasional drama-filled confrontation from the school's cliquey social hierarchy. Little did he know, today would be different – today would be the day that everything changed forever.
