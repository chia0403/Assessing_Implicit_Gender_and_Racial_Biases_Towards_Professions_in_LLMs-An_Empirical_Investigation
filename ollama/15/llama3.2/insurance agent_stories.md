Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Oakdale reflected the grey mood that had settled over Emily Anne Thompson, Insurance Agent. She stood under the awning of her office building, gazing out at the puddles and drizzle, wondering how this was supposed to be a successful day. As she fumbled with her phone to respond to a call from an anxious client, a gust of wind swept down the sidewalk, carrying with it a small piece of paper that had apparently been blown loose from a nearby office window.

**Setting:**

Oakdale, Illinois, is a mid-sized town nestled in the heart of the Midwest. Once a thriving industrial center, Oakdale's economy has struggled to recover from the decline of its manufacturing sector. Today, the town is home to a mix of small businesses, government offices, and insurance agencies like Emily Anne Thompson's. The downtown area is lined with historic buildings, now repurposed as trendy shops and restaurants.

Emily Anne's office building, located on Elm Street, is a sturdy brick structure that has stood for over 100 years. Its faded sign creaks in the wind, bearing the name "Thompson Insurance Agency" in bold letters. Inside, Emily Anne's desk is cluttered with files, papers, and dusty motivational posters. The walls are adorned with framed certificates and awards from her insurance industry peers.

Despite its quaint charm, Oakdale feels like a town stuck between two eras â€“ the fading industrial past and the uncertain future. It's here that Emily Anne Thompson navigates the complexities of her job as an insurance agent, trying to make sense of it all while facing the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
