Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood, casting a misty veil over its quaint streets and weathered buildings. Inside the cramped, dimly lit office of "McTavish & Sons Plumbing," 32-year-old Angus McTavish rubbed the fatigue from his eyes. He'd been up since dawn, sipping cold coffee and staring at the tangled mess of pipes in front of him.

As a third-generation plumber, Angus had grown up learning the trade from his father and grandfather before him. But lately, he'd started to feel like he was stuck in a rut – same old jobs, same old customers, same old problems. The town's aging infrastructure seemed determined to keep him on his toes, but also perpetually broke.

Angus sighed, tucking a strand of damp hair behind his ear as he gazed out the office window at the rain-soaked streets below. He longed for adventure, for excitement – something more than just unclogging drains and fixing leaky faucets. Little did he know, that chance was coming in the form of a mysterious phone call from an unknown number, one that would set him on a course that would take him far beyond the limits of Ravenswood's sleepy streets.
