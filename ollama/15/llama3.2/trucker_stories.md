Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty road that stretched out before Ryder Jenkins like a cracked and worn ribbon. A former Army medic turned long-haul truck driver, Ryder had spent years crisscrossing the country in his trusty Peterbilt 359, hauling everything from fresh produce to machinery parts from one end of the continent to the other.

As he navigated the treacherous curves of Highway 40, Ryder's eyes scanned the dashboard, checking the fuel gauge and the GPS for any signs of trouble. He'd been on the road for over 24 hours, with only a quick stop in Flagstaff to refuel and grab a cup of coffee. His stomach growled with anticipation as he thought about the diner meal waiting for him back at his truckstop motel.

Ryder's rig, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha," had been his home away from home for years, and he knew every inch of her by heart. He'd spent countless hours tinkering with her engine, fine-tuning her performance, and making sure she was always ready to hit the road at a moment's notice.

But tonight felt different. Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, like a whispered warning in his ear that he couldn't quite ignore. It had started with a cryptic phone call from an old friend back East, who'd spoken of a strange occurrence on the roads of New Mexico - a string of bizarre accidents and unexplained events that had left investigators baffled.

Ryder's instincts told him to stay put, to avoid whatever was coming his way. But Bertha's engine purred smoothly beneath him, urging him forward into the unknown.
