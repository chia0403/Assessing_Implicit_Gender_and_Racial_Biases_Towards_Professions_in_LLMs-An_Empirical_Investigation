Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the Chicago skyline, casting a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers of the Loop, Systems Analyst Emilia Victoria Jenkins trudged wearily into her office building. It had been a long day at the IT department of the city's largest hospital, where she spent most of her waking hours wrestling with malfunctioning medical record systems and trying to keep the digital wheels of the hospital's administrative machinery from grinding to a halt.

Emilia rubbed the tired ache in her eyes as she dropped her bag onto the floor, the soft thud echoing through the quiet office. She had been working non-stop for 12 hours, troubleshooting a critical issue with the hospital's patient billing system, and was looking forward to a well-deserved glass of wine and a few minutes of blissful silence on her couch.

As she changed out of her worn jeans and faded t-shirt, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had spent hours poring over lines of code, searching for any hint of what might be causing the bizarre error message that had been popping up all day. And yet, despite her best efforts, she still hadn't found anything.

Now, as she made her way to the break room to grab a cup of coffee and collect her thoughts, Emilia felt a nagging sense of unease creeping over her. It was as if something - or someone - had set her on edge, and she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was.

Little did she know, that feeling would be just the beginning of a night that would change everything.
