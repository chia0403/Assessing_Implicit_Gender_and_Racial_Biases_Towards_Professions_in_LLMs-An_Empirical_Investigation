Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Mine, casting a reddish-orange glow over the dusty terrain as Jack "Hawk" Hawkins climbed out of his trusty John Deere 725E excavator. Hawk had spent the better part of twenty years operating heavy equipment on this very mine, and he knew its ins and outs like the back of his hand. The mine's operations manager, a gruff but fair man named Marcus Thompson, stood waiting for him outside the cab.

"Hawk, we've got a problem," Marcus said, his voice low and serious. "One of the tunnels is collapsing, and we need you to get in there and assess the situation ASAP."

Hawk nodded curtly, already knowing what he was getting himself into. He had seen collapses happen before, and it was always a nasty business. As he climbed down from the excavator, his eyes scanned the horizon, taking in the sprawling landscape of the mine. The Red Rock Mine was a behemoth of an operation, stretching for miles and covering hundreds of acres. It was a place where men came to work hard and earn their keep, but also a place where death lurked around every corner.

Hawk's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens wailing in the distance, growing louder by the second. He knew that meant help was on its way, but he also knew that time was running out. The collapse had to be stopped before it was too late.
