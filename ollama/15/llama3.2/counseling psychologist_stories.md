Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emilia Rose Jenkins stood at the edge of her office window, gazing out at the rain-soaked streets of Seattle. The grey sky seemed to match the mood that had been following her all week - one of exhaustion and frustration. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice on Capitol Hill, she'd seen her fair share of clients struggling with anxiety, depression, and trauma.

The soft hum of her computer and the occasional ring of the phone were the only sounds breaking the silence as she lost herself in thought. Her mind kept wandering back to the latest case that had landed on her desk - a young mother named Sarah, who was struggling to cope with the loss of her husband in a tragic accident. The guilt and grief that Sarah carried weighed heavily on Emilia's own shoulders, making it difficult for her to focus on anything else.

As she turned away from the window and began to tidy up her office, Emilia couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something was off, she couldn't quite put her finger on it. The clients who usually poured their hearts out to her - sharing their deepest fears and desires - seemed to be holding back this time. And it was making her question whether she was doing enough to help them.

The rain continued to fall outside, casting a gloomy shadow over the city. But inside Emilia's office, a small flame of determination flickered to life. She took a deep breath, grabbed her cup of cold coffee, and steeled herself for the long day ahead. It was going to be a tough one.
