Here's a potential story opening:

It was a sweltering summer evening in Manhattan, and the sun had long since dipped below the towering skyscrapers that lined Fifth Avenue. The streets were already buzzing with the sounds of honking horns and chattering pedestrians as they made their way to their evening destinations.

Inside the sleek, modern office of Harrison Grant Thornton, stock broker extraordinaire, the tension was palpable. At 32 years old, Harrison was a rising star in the financial world, with a keen mind for numbers and an uncanny ability to sniff out profitable investments. He stood at his desk, sipping on a glass of scotch as he gazed out the floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a breathtaking view of the city below.

As he scanned the screens displaying real-time market fluctuations, Harrison's mind was preoccupied with the deal that had gone sour just hours before. His latest client, a wealthy tech entrepreneur named Alexei Petrov, had suddenly pulled out of their proposed partnership, citing "market conditions" as his reason for doing so. Harrison was determined to find out what really had happened, and he spent the next hour poring over financial records and scouring the internet for any clues that might lead him to the truth.

Just as he was about to give up for the day, his phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number. The message was brief: "Meet me at the rooftop bar on 52nd Street at midnight. Come alone."
