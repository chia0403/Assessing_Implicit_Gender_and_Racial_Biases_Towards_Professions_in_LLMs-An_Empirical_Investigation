Here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, Captain Julian Alexander "Jules" Thompson banked his small Cessna 172 skyhawk to the left, the engines roaring in protest as he leveled out at 3,000 feet. Below him, the vast expanse of the Arizona desert stretched out like a canvas of endless gold, the rocky outcroppings and sand dunes glinting in the fading light.

"Flight 141, this is Air Traffic Control," crackled the voice over the radio, "clearance for descent into Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. Approach vector Bravo-12."

Jules nodded to himself, his eyes scanning the instruments on the control panel as he began his final approach. He had been flying for over 20 years, and yet every time he landed at PHX, he felt a thrill of excitement wash over him. There was something about the desert landscape that seemed to stir up a part of him that he couldn't quite explain.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the present day, with Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport as the main airport serving the city of Phoenix, Arizona. The airport is bustling with activity, with commercial airliners and general aviation aircraft coming and going at all hours. The desert landscape surrounding the airport is a mix of scrubby vegetation and rocky outcroppings, stretching out as far as the eye can see.

Jules' small Cessna 172 skyhawk, "Lucky Lady", was parked on the airfield, waiting for him to land and refuel before heading off on another adventure. Jules himself is a seasoned pilot in his late 40s, with a rugged, weathered face and piercing blue eyes that seem to bore into those he meets. He's a bit of a loner, but has a reputation as one of the best pilots in the Southwest, with a keen eye for navigation and a talent for getting out of tight spots.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other requests or questions.
