Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The snowflakes fell gently onto the small town of Willow Creek, casting a serene silence over its quaint streets and homes. Inside one of those homes, on Elm Street, a lone figure moved with purpose through the dimly lit corridors. Her name was Emilia Rose Fletcher, a no-nonsense housekeeper who had been employed by the reclusive Mr. Edward Blackwood for nigh on five years.

As she worked, her thoughts wandered to the peculiar events that had been unfolding in the town lately. The local diner had been serving up strange, unidentifiable dishes that seemed to be making people sick, and the police were stumped as to who was behind it. Meanwhile, rumors swirled about Mr. Blackwood's own mysterious past and the reasons he kept his doors locked and his windows barred.

Emilia had always been a loyal employee, but lately, she'd begun to feel a growing sense of unease whenever she entered the grand mansion that stood atop Elm Street. There was something in the air, something that made her skin crawl and her heart pound. As she swept the floors, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on her from the shadows.

And then, just as she finished dusting the last of the furniture, Emilia heard a faint creaking sound coming from upstairs.
