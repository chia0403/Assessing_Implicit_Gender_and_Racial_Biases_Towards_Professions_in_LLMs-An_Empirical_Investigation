Here's a potential story opening:

The rain pattered against the windows of Emily Rose Wilson's small travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co." like a chorus of whispers from the world beyond. It was a familiar sound, one that had accompanied Emily through countless mornings as she poured over maps and brochures, dreaming of far-off lands and exotic adventures.

As she sipped her coffee and gazed out at the gray London street, Emily's mind wandered to her latest client, Mrs. Jenkins, who was waiting anxiously for her return from a trip to the Scottish Highlands. Emily had promised her friend that she would ensure her favorite hotel, The Highland Lodge, was reserved for her stay. Now, as she began to tackle the day's paperwork, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

Just then, the phone on her desk rang, shrill in the quiet morning. Emily picked up, ready to tackle whatever travel requests came her way. But as she listened to the voice on the other end of the line, a name echoed in her mind: James Parker. A client who had been on her mind for weeks, and one whose request was about to send her life spinning into chaos.

"Hello?" Emily said, her pen poised over the paperwork. "Wanderlust & Co."
