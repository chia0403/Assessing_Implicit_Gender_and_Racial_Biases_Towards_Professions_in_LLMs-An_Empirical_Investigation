Here's a story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that clung to every surface like a cold sweat. It was the kind of morning that made you want to stay indoors with a hot cup of coffee and a good book, but for Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, electrician extraordinaire, it was just another day on the job.

As he sipped his own coffee - black as coal, just like his dark hair - Hawk gazed out at the skeletal silhouette of the old lighthouse that stood sentinel over Ravenswood's tiny harbor. The lighthouse had been a fixture in town since 1895, its towering spire and Fresnel lens still guiding sailors safely into the harbor even though most fishermen now used GPS to navigate.

Hawk himself was no sailor, but he did have a deep respect for the sea - and for the strange, unexplained occurrences that seemed to plague Ravenswood like a curse. It was as if the town was stuck in some kind of time warp, where ancient traditions and modern technology coexisted in an uneasy symbiosis.

And it was on just such a day, with the fog swirling around his ankles like a living thing, that Hawk received a call from the lighthouse keeper - his old friend, Emily Mayfield. Her voice was tight with worry as she told him she'd woken up to find the lighthouse's ancient electrical system dead - and not just any dead, but dead as in, completely non-functional.

Hawk's curiosity was piqued. He knew that the lighthouse's electrical system wasn't something you could simply "turn off" - it was a delicate balance of ancient wiring, flickering light bulbs, and mysterious, arcane energies that seemed to pulse through every rock and beam. And what was more, he had a feeling that this was no ordinary power outage.

"I'll be right there," Hawk said, already grabbing his toolbox as the mist closed in around him like a shroud.
