It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, the kind of night that made you want to curl up with a good book and a cup of coffee. But for August "Augie" Ryder, private detective and owner of Ryder Investigations, it was just another day on the job.

Augie sat at his desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, staring out the rain-soaked window of his small office in the heart of downtown Seattle. The neon lights of Pike Place Market reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets. It was 7:30 PM on a Tuesday, and Augie had just gotten back from a long day of case work.

As he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper to jot down some notes, his phone rang, shrill and insistent. He picked up, expecting it to be one of the usual calls from the local pawn shops or used car lots. But instead, it was a low, smooth voice on the other end.

"Augie Ryder, I need your help," said the voice. "My sister is missing. The police don't believe me, but I know something's wrong."

Augie's instincts kicked in, and he felt a spark of interest ignite within him. He grabbed his pen and notebook, ready to listen and take notes.

"Who is it?" Augie asked, his eyes scanning the small space of his office for inspiration.

"My name is Emily Wellesley," replied the voice. "And my sister, Lucy Wellesley, has been missing for three days now."

Augie's ears perked up at the mention of the surname. He knew that the Wellesleys were a prominent family in Seattle, with a reputation for wealth and influence.

"What makes you think your sister is in trouble?" Augie asked, already sensing that this case was going to be different from the usual missing persons' cases he'd handled before.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, and then Emily spoke up again. "Because I've been receiving strange phone calls, Mr. Ryder. Calls with no caller ID, but with voices that sound like they're coming from someone who knows my sister's secrets."

Augie's interest was piqued now. He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he waited for Emily to continue.

"I want you to find out what's going on, Mr. Ryder," she said finally. "I don't care if it means breaking some laws or disturbing some people. I just need to know that my sister is safe."

Augie nodded, even though Emily couldn't see him. He was already mentally preparing himself for the long and winding road ahead.

"I'll do what I can, Ms. Wellesley," he said finally. "But first, tell me more about your sister. What's she like? Who were her enemies?"

There was a pause again, and then Emily spoke up once more. "My sister is smart, but reckless. She's always been a bit of a wild child, Mr. Ryder. And as for enemies... well, I think you'll find that everyone in Seattle seems to have something to gain from Lucy's disappearance."

Augie raised an eyebrow at the cryptic comment. He knew that he was in for a wild ride with this case, and he was ready to take on whatever Seattle threw his way.
