Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Thorne's tiny apartment. The city outside - once a vibrant symphony of honking horns and laughter - had become a monochrome canvas of grey and dripping water.

She had tackled tough stories before, each one a victory against relentless bureaucracy, ruthless power, and the ever-present threat of getting swallowed whole by the city's underbelly. And as she stared out at the relentless downpour, she felt a familiar surge of determination. Amelia Thorne would uncover the truth, no matter how treacherous the journey might be.
