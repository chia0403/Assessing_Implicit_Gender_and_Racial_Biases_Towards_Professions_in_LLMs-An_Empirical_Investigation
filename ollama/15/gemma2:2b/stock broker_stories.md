Rain lashed against the arched windows of Arthur Sterling's office at First National Bank, each drop echoing like an impatient drumbeat against the silence that normally clung to him like a shroud. The city outside was a cacophony of honking taxis and roaring trucks, but inside, everything was muted, every surface reflecting the dim glow from the amber-hued desk lamp illuminating Arthur's face. 

Arthur Sterling, his immaculately-groomed grey hair catching the light in stark contrast to his pallid complexion, sat hunched over a spreadsheet, each number a testament to the crushing weight of his responsibilities.  His world was one of zeros and ones, a binary existence where fortunes were made and lost like chess pieces on a battlefield. He'd built his reputation on precision, on calculated risks that never faltered, always aiming for the stratosphere in an attempt to escape the monotony of their city life. 

But tonight, the numbers seemed to be mocking him. A strange sense of unease washed over him as he glanced at the clock – midnight. Every tick echoed a reminder of his mounting anxieties about his client, Mr. Davies, a notoriously volatile entrepreneur who was on the verge of collapsing under the weight of his own ambitions. Arthur had known Mr. Davies for years; they'd been partners in this high-stakes game of risk and reward, navigating through treacherous waters like a pair of seasoned pirates.  Tonight, however, those familiar waters seemed filled with more than just salt and wind – they were swirling with the ghosts of his client’s past failures. And Arthur was drowning in them.
