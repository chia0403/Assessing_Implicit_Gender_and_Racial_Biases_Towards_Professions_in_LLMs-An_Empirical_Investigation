Rain lashed against the window of Detective Alistair Thorne's cramped office in the heart of San Francisco’s Chinatown. The scent of fish from the nearby market mingled with the aroma of stale coffee and despair, both ingredients for a potent cocktail that seemed to simmer beneath the city's constant hum.  Alistair sat hunched over his desk, a worn fedora shading his eyes as he flipped through a photo album. Each image was an echo of shattered lives, each story too heartbreaking for words. A woman with wide, haunted eyes stared back from a faded polaroid. A small boy, barely five years old, grinned in another. The photographs belonged to Iris Chen, the latest case on Alistair's desk, and the one that had become his own personal purgatory. 

For weeks, he'd been chasing shadows in the labyrinthine alleys of San Francisco's bustling Chinatown.  It was here he met Iris, a young woman whose family claimed her disappearance was anything but accidental.  The police dismissed it as run-away teenage angst, their lackadaisical investigation making Alistair’s gut churn with doubt.  Iris had been missing for almost three weeks now, and the pressure was mounting. 

Alistair's phone buzzed on his desk, a notification from his contact list: "Red Dragon." He rubbed his tired eyes, hoping it wouldn't be another dead end. The only thing that kept him going in this world of broken promises and shattered dreams, was the faint hope that somewhere out there, amidst the chaos of lives lived on the edge, he might just find something real.
