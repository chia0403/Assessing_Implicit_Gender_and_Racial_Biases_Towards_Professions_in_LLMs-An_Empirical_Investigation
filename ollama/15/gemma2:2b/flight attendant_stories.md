The stale air of the cabin pressed against Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a damp blanket.  It reeked of cheap perfume and desperation, the scent she normally associated with overly-enthusiastic honeymooners on their first stop in Paris. Today, however, it was the acrid residue of stress clinging to the passengers, mirroring her own frayed nerves. The storm raged outside, whipping up the choppy Atlantic waters into a frenzy, while inside, tension simmered under the veneer of polite smiles and forced laughter. Amy had been stationed at Gate 36 for over five hours, witnessing this turbulent cocktail of emotions play out in front of her.  The delay was a direct consequence of a mechanical failure, which meant that everyone aboard would be stuck on this tiny metal bird while they waited for the mechanics to bring them back to life.  As she meticulously checked another passenger's boarding pass – another desperate attempt at an escape from their own storm – Amy thought about how little control anyone had over their fate. 


**Setting:** A mid-sized, budget airline jetliner departing from a coastal city in Ireland, headed for London, England. The plane is cramped and functional, but has the promise of a journey to a new world.  It's a Tuesday afternoon, October.
