The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a swarm of agitated bees, illuminating dust motes swirling in the stale air of the old theatre lobby.  They danced with the shadow of the colossal, ornate velvet curtain that hung from its towering stage, a silent sentinel to forgotten dreams and faded glories. This was the home of the Majestic, a once-grand opera house now only known for its crumbling facade and whispered tales of ghostly melodies.

It was here, amidst the decaying grandeur, that Elara Blackwood, a woman with eyes as gray as the chipped paint of the theatre's grand staircase, cleaned.  Her name echoed like a forgotten song, a melody lost in time's harsh wind. Elara was known throughout the building only as "Dust," her name given to her by the younger staff who found her presence a familiar comfort amongst the chaos. 

Elaraâ€™s hands moved deftly with a practiced grace. She swept dust from the plush velvet seats, mopped sticky remnants of forgotten concessions, and polished brass railings that once echoed with laughter and applause.  A quiet symphony played out in the stillness as she went through her routine - each movement a song, every sweep a note.
