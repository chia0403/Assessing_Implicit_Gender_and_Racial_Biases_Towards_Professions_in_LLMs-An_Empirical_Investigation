## Opening Scene:

**Setting:** The bustling waiting room of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center. Sunbeams slice through the windows, casting long, warm patches across the brightly-colored chairs and toys scattered on a makeshift play structure near the entryway. A low hum of conversation blends with the rhythmic whir of the television playing in the corner. 


**Character:**  Evelyn Thorne, her stethoscope clipped firmly to her coat pocket, was perched on the edge of an old-fashioned armchair, its worn floral fabric barely holding up against years of use and countless hugs.  Evelyn's sharp hazel eyes scanned the faces of families filing in, each one carrying their own unique burden. A knot of worry tightened in her chest as she watched children, eyes wide with apprehension, being ushered to chairs, their parents struggling to keep a facade of calm.


**Story Prompt:**

Evelyn was known for her gentle touch and unwavering optimism. She believed every single patient held the potential to reach for their dreams, even those seemingly unattainable - especially when paired with her unique understanding of human nature. Today, however, Evelyn felt an unwelcome darkness creeping into her normally sunny disposition. A shadow seemed to hang over a new group of patients:  the aftermath of a recent wildfire, leaving families traumatized and children grappling with fear and insecurity in the wake of displacement and loss. 


**End of scene.**
