The biting wind whipped Amelia's scarf around her neck as she stared at the crumbling fa√ßade of the ancient castle.  "Welcome to Dunhaven, folks," she announced in her brisk, cheerful tone, "the heart and soul of history!" She adjusted the strap of her backpack that contained not just brochures and guidebooks, but also a sturdy compass and a thermos of hot cider. 

Amelia's full name was Amelia Bellweather, though no one ever bothered to use it. Most referred to her as "Mrs. B," or sometimes, if they were feeling particularly adventurous, "Bell."  She loved the nickname; its simplicity held a certain elegance in comparison to her more formal self-described identity. 

Dunhaven Castle, with its gothic architecture and tales of forgotten knights and curses, was just one of the many historical gems she navigated each day as a tour guide in the bustling town nestled within a valley on the edge of an ancient forest.  But today, something felt different. A hushed tension hung in the air, a whisper of secrets that Amelia couldn't quite place but felt keenly in her bones.
