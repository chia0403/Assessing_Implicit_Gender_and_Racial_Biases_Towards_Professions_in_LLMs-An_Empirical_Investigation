The desert stretched before Dale "Dust Devil" Thompson like an unblinking eye, vastness mirroring the emptiness that had followed him for the past five years. His beat-up Peterbilt 18-wheeler hummed with its tired engine, barely a whisper against the unrelenting heat of midday Arizona. Dust Devil's eyes, weathered and sharp as a hawk's, scanned the endless ochre canvas before him. The truck was his sanctuary, but this particular stretch of interstate seemed to hold an unsettling stillness, punctuated only by the relentless whirring of the windsock and the occasional scuttling desert rat. He’d been hauling goods from the bustling ports of California to the dusty backroads of Montana for years – a life forged in asphalt and diesel fumes, yet it felt as if he was losing his grip on the road itself.
