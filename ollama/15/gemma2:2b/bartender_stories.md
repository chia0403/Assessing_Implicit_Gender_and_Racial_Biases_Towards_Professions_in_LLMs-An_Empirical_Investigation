Rain lashed against the windows of The Drunken Sparrow, each drop echoing like tiny knives against the glass. A storm had been raging for days, an unrelenting torrent that seemed to mimic the churning anxieties in Jasper Thorne's chest. He stood behind the worn oak bar, his hazel eyes focused on the swirling amber liquid he was stirring into a Manhattan. The familiar scent of rye whiskey and cherry liqueur did little to calm him; it just underscored the storm brewing both inside and out. 

Jasper Thorne had been running The Drunken Sparrow for six years now. Six years of serving locals like Mr. Fitzwilliam, who never tipped unless he received his daily three-shot espresso with extra foam, or Mrs. O'Malley, whose grumpy demeanor hid a fondness for the occasional strong whiskey neat. He knew every face in this town of cobblestone streets and crooked alleys, felt the pulse of their lives in the hum of the taproom’s ancient jukebox. But tonight, even the comforting routine of his usual clientele couldn’t soothe the storm within him - a storm fueled by a betrayal that threatened to engulf him whole. 

Tonight, someone new had walked into The Drunken Sparrow, someone who was as striking as they were enigmatic. With their hair like spun moonlight and eyes that held the wisdom of ages, they ordered only one drink - a glass of ice-cold gin with a single twist of lemon, leaving a lingering scent of floral notes in its wake.
