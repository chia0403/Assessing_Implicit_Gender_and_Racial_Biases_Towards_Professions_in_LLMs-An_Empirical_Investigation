## The Old Blackwood Door 

The wind whipped through Elias Hawthorne’s worn beard as he surveyed the sprawling redwood roof above. He held his toolbox tighter, knuckles white against its rough wood surface. Below him, the cobbled streets of Port Haven were blanketed in an unsettling mist, swirling like a drunken sailor's dreamscape. A chill settled into his bones that went beyond the damp air and the biting North Wind that swept off the distant Ocean.

Elias was a carpenter by trade, a craftsman who could coax life from wood like a magician conjuring a dove. He lived above his workshop, nestled between a crooked tavern called The Sea Dog and a grumpy fishmonger with a penchant for gossip. For thirty years he'd toiled in this corner of Port Haven, his workshop smelling perpetually of sawdust and the promise of new beginnings.

Tonight, though, Elias felt an unease unlike any other. It wasn’t just the wind or the creeping fog; it was something deeper, rooted in the air itself, a silent hum that spoke of hidden secrets. As he tightened a final screw on his newly crafted chest, a faint groan echoed from within the old Blackwood door that stood like a sentinel at the heart of his workshop – a door Elias knew held more stories than any seasoned sailor could ever dream of.
