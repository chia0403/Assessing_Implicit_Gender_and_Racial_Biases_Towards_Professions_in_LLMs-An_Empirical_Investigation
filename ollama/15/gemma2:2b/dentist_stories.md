The whirring of the drill seemed to amplify Dr. Amelia Pierce's anxiety. It wasn't just the usual pre-appointment jitters that accompanied any cavity filling; tonight felt heavier.  A thick fog had settled over her usually sunny disposition. Tonight was the night she and husband, Daniel, were finally going to meet with their long-time friend, Mrs. Evelyn Hawthorne. 

Evelyn hadn't contacted them for years, sending only cryptic messages through handwritten letters that arrived in a worn canvas bag.  Daniel, ever the pragmatist, had dismissed it as an emotional outburst from his grandmotherly mother, who'd convinced him to take over her bakery when he was twenty-five. But Amelia always felt something was off.  

The setting for their meeting was Evelyn's quaint cottage on the edge of town, nestled amongst ancient oak trees and lavender bushes. The house itself was a study in warm colours â€“ burnt sienna walls, faded teal shutters, and carpets woven with floral patterns. It looked as inviting as it felt unsettlingly silent. 

Amelia adjusted her pearl-buttoned coat, trying to appear calm but failing miserably. This whole situation was starting to feel like one of those old gothic novels she used to devour in her youth - a classic tale of mystery and hidden secrets.
