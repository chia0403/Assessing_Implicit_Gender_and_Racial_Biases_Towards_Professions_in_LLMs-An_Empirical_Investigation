The dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams, illuminating the spines of towering bookshelves that stretched towards the vaulted ceiling like ancient guardians. This was Elias Thorne's haven – the Blackwood Library, a sanctuary tucked away in the forgotten corner of Victorian London. As the lead archivist and librarian for the past twenty years, Elias had dedicated his life to preserving knowledge, nurturing its flow through generations, and ensuring the library remained a beacon of wisdom amidst the city’s ever-shifting tide. 

Today, however, felt different. A storm raged outside, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. The arrival of a cryptic letter from an unknown source had shattered the quiet rhythm of his routine, sending ripples through the library's normally tranquil existence. It was a summons to an enigmatic "Gathering," shrouded in mystery and whispered about in hushed tones by other librarians who felt compelled to keep their own distance from its secrets. Elias could not ignore it. The air hummed with the weight of a truth he could feel but couldn’t quite grasp, and as he turned the page of his worn copy of Dante's Inferno,  he knew that the path ahead was shrouded in peril and promise.
