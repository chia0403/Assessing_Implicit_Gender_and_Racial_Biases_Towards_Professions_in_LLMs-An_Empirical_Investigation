## The Last Bell

Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "Just Another Corner Cafe", each drop a tiny hammer striking the glass. Inside, dust motes danced in the single lamplight illuminating Evelyn Blackwood's worn hands as she meticulously scanned a customer's order: a double mocha with extra foam and a blueberry muffin on the side. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and damp cardboard boxes piled in the corner – a symphony for the weary souls who dared enter this forgotten cafe during this relentless downpour. 

Evelyn was used to it.  "Just Another Corner Cafe," her grandmother’s words echoed constantly in her mind, "It's not about the location, Evelyn, it's about the people you serve." She knew the rhythm of the city better than she knew the back of her own hand; a steady beat of hurried footsteps on the cracked pavement outside and the comforting click-clack of cash registers.  

But tonight felt different. Tonight, with each rain drop that pounded against the glass, she wondered if this small cafe was about to drown in its own silence.
