##  The Last Light 

**Setting:** The salt-lashed cliffs of Cape Horn, Patagonia, are a brutal symphony of wind and water at dawn. The air is thick with mist that hangs like a shroud over the craggy peaks. A single fishing boat bobs precariously on the choppy waves, its paint blistered and faded against the churning grey expanse. 

**Character:** Captain Eleanor "Ellie" Montgomery, her weathered face framed by a shock of unruly silver hair, grips the controls of her worn Cessna, the only flicker of light breaking through the swirling darkness.  At sixty-two, Ellie's hands were as sure and callused as any sailor's, etched with years of flying above and below stormy skies, battling both nature's wrath and the unforgiving demands of her profession.

**Opening:** The engine sputtered its tired protest again, a low growl that echoed through the cockpit. "Damn," Ellie muttered, her voice raspy from the dry air. The last sliver of sunlight was fading fast, leaving only a bruised, dusky sky. She'd been flying for hours, her mission to bring a shipment of medical supplies from Buenos Aires to this remote outpost in Chile, where a clinic desperately needed help. But now, with time running out and the unforgiving ocean churning around her, Ellie knew she was facing something far greater than just bad weather.  Something that made even the roar of the engine feel like a whisper compared to the looming dread.

Ellie's eyes narrowed as she focused on the horizon, where a shape materialized from the swirling mist - another vessel, a sailboat sleek and stark against the twilight.  It was too close for comfort, its sails billowing with an unnatural defiance against the relentless winds, a silent challenge that hung in the air like a shadow over Ellie's shoulders.
