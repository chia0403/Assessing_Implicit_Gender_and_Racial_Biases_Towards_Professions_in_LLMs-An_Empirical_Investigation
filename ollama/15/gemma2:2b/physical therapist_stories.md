Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mirroring the tempestuous storm brewing inside her own heart. The rain-drenched city felt suffocating; an oppressive blanket obscuring the vibrant life she yearned to reconnect with. Outside, sirens wailed a jarring symphony, and within the cozy sanctuary of her office, Evelyn sat hunched over a stack of files, each one a testament to the ever-growing chasm between her professional obligations and her personal desires. 

Evelyn had always been drawn to helping others find their footing, both literally and figuratively. Her work as a physical therapist meant more than just restoring movement – it was about re-writing narratives of pain, pushing individuals towards their full potential.  But lately, Evelyn felt like she was trapped in an endless cycle of rehabilitation, with her own life’s rhythm completely out of sync with the demands of her career.
