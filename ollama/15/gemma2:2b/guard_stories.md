The iron gates groaned open, each hinge groaning like an aging giant's bones as they yielded to the pressure of Sergeant Aric Thorne's hand. The midday sun beat down on his uniform, turning it an oppressive sheen of sweat and grime, making even the crisp, blue fabric feel heavy upon his skin.  He stood at the gateway, the scent of brine and decay clinging to the air like a shroud. Port Haven was notorious for its stench - a chaotic tapestry woven from rotting fish, stale beer, and whispered secrets. 

Aric shifted his weight, squinting against the glare as he surveyed the scene before him. He'd served here for five years, witnessing the ebb and flow of life in this forgotten port city - a life marked by constant hardship, swirling undercurrents of greed, and a persistent fog that seemed to cling to everything like a lingering memory. 

Today wasn't any different. The air was thick with tension, a palpable weight settling on his shoulders as he stepped into the teeming marketplace. His eyes quickly scanned for trouble – anything out of place, an unusual flicker in the crowds, or a shadow crossing the alleyways that snaked between stalls and taverns.  He wasn't allowed to stray too far from the gate, not without his captain’s permission, but he knew every inch of this volatile landscape as well as he knew his own reflection.
