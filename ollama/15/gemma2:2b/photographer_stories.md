## Story Opening:

Rain pattered against the windowpane like tiny percussionists trapped in an icy symphony.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of sun peeking through the cloud-choked sky, illuminating the worn, leatherbound photo album clutched tightly within **Amelia Thorne’s** calloused hands. Each image inside held not only a moment frozen in time, but also a ghost of a memory - a kaleidoscope of faces she’d known, loved, and lost. 

Amelia's studio was bathed in the melancholic glow of the setting sun. The city lights outside were starting to flicker on as if waking from a long sleep, their distant hum a counterpoint to the steady drumming of the raindrops against the glass.  She wasn’t sure how many years had passed since she last looked at these photographs, but tonight felt different - a night where grief and nostalgia collided in the quiet of her dimly-lit space. Tonight, Amelia was going to confront the ghosts within the album's pages.


**Setting:** 

A small, cluttered studio nestled on a cobbled street in a seaside town with an air of timeless charm. The rain has been coming down steadily for days and there’s a pervasive quietness in the air.  Outside, the ocean roars against the rocky shore, its salty spray mirroring the melancholy that hangs heavy in the air.
