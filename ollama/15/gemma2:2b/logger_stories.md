The crisp air stung Elias Blackwood's lungs as he stood on the precipice of Thunder Mountain.  Below, the forest floor throbbed with life: sunlight dappling through the towering pines, a symphony of birdsong carried on the wind, and the earthy scent of damp bark clinging to the air.   But for Elias, the mountain held only a haunting familiarity, a silent testament to his father's tragic fate.  Years ago, he too had been felled by a sudden storm that ravaged the very peak, leaving behind just a memory of roaring thunder and blinding snow. 

Elias tightened his grip on his axe, its familiar weight a comfort in this unforgiving wilderness. He was a logger by trade, but a wanderer at heart.   His father's legacy was more than just wood he felled; it was an echo of stories whispered in the wind through the silent trees.  He yearned to carve out his own mark on the mountain â€“ not with axes and chainsaws, but with the memories he carried within. 


**Setting:** A remote corner of the Pacific Northwest. A dense evergreen forest draped in mist, punctuated by towering peaks that pierce the sky. The story takes place during fall, as the trees prepare for winter's grip.
