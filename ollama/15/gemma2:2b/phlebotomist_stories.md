The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile sheen over everything in the waiting area. The air, thick with anticipation and disinfectant, felt almost oppressive as Elara, known by everyone simply as Ellie, settled into her usual chair. 

Ellie was no stranger to dealing with people's anxieties about needles; she’d been a phlebotomist for five years now, navigating a sea of veins and the unspoken worries etched onto patients' faces.  Her steady hands, honed over countless blood draws, had built a reputation for gentle care in this chaotic world of medical procedures. 

The door chimed as Ms. Ocampo entered, her silver hair tucked under a faded blue scarf. Elara couldn't quite see the woman's face through the veil of wrinkles and sadness that seemed to cling to her; but the way her hands trembled as she clutched the worn purse in her lap spoke volumes. 

Ellie always felt a pang of empathy for patients like Ms. Ocampo, a quiet woman whose life had been shaped by a recent diagnosis: cancer. She was the embodiment of everything Ellie wanted to be –  patient, strong, and determined despite the shadows that seemed to follow her every step. Today, she wasn't just a phlebotomist; she was standing in for a silent witness to a woman’s fight for life.
