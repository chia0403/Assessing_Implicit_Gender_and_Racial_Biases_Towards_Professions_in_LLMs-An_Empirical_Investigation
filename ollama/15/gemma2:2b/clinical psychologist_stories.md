Rain lashed against the windowpanes, each drop exploding into miniature rainbows on the glass. Inside Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, the scent of lavender incense mingled with the earthy aroma of old paperbacks lining the shelves. A muted symphony played from a worn-out cassette tape player tucked behind a stack of well-thumbed medical journals: Debussy's "Clair de Lune."  Eleanor, her silver hair pulled back into a tight bun, looked out at the chaos outside, the storm mirroring the turmoil brewing within.

The call had been short and cryptic: a woman claiming to be in distress. Her voice, trembling on the other end of the phone line, whispered about whispers and shadows, things that could only exist behind closed doors in the mind's eye. It was a case that felt eerily familiar â€“ the type Eleanor hadn't seen for years.  As she sat down, her fingers gently tracing the outline of a delicate skull on a weathered anatomy textbook, a knot tightened in her stomach. This wasn't just another case; it felt like a storm cloud gathering over the very heart of her profession.
