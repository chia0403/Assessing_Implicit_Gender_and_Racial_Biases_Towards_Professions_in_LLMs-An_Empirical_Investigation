Rain lashed against the windshield of the Ford pickup, blurring the world outside into streaks of grey and black. The air was thick with the scent of diesel fuel and wet asphalt, each inhale leaving a bitter taste on Elara's already-sour tongue. It had been days since she’d seen her sister – weeks since she’d felt even close to home – and that relentless rain mirrored the turmoil within her. She gripped the worn steering wheel, knuckles white against the cracked leather, as she steered through the deluge toward Highway 74, where the concrete arteries of the American Southwest were churning into life once more after a rare downpour.

Elara, named for the constellation above her own stubborn star – Elara the Weaver – wasn’t built for this kind of world. She found solace in the steady rhythm of the highway work, the quiet satisfaction of mending broken asphalt under the harsh Arizona sun. The endless cycle of paving, reshaping, and repairing was a balm to the turmoil within; the concrete and steel her canvas, a silent ode to the strength she yearned to display.  But even the humdrum routine felt out of sync tonight, the thunder echoing a beat too loud for her tired heart.
