The rain beat against the windowpane like angry drums, each drop echoing Dr. Elias Blackwood's own unease as he stared at the swirling storm outside. He ran his fingers through his neatly combed black hair, his gaze drawn to the worn leather couch in his office. It was a place where vulnerabilities were laid bare and anxieties simmered just below the surface, all under the watchful eye of an empathetic therapist with years of training. But tonight, Elias felt utterly outmatched by the storm raging within himself. 

Elias Blackwood, his name a whisper of old-world elegance, had dedicated his life to helping others navigate their internal storms. He prided himself on his calm demeanor and soothing voice, but tonight, even his practiced empathy seemed to falter under the weight of personal turbulence.  He'd received a call earlier that day - his mother, once a vibrant presence in his life, was struggling with something he didn't yet understand. Now, he stood waiting for her to arrive in his dimly lit office, a storm within him mirroring the one brewing outside. He wondered if it would ever end. 


**Setting:** A modest, albeit well-equipped counseling office nestled on a quiet street near a bustling urban center. The atmosphere is both comforting and slightly somber, with bookshelves filled with ancient texts and modern therapy manuals, a worn fireplace in the corner casting long shadows.
