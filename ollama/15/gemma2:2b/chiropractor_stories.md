Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's office, mimicking the thrumming anxiety in her chest. The scent of eucalyptus oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the chaos brewing outside.  Outside the storm raged on, but inside her small clinic in the heart of a bustling city, the air was thick with unspoken tension. Amy surveyed the cluttered waiting room, a symphony of peeling paint and mismatched furniture. On the worn floorboards, a single patient, Mr. Davis, sat hunched over a magazine, his posture stiff and apologetic.  He tapped at his feet impatiently, every now and then glancing towards her office door like a caged bird expecting its escape. 

Amy took a deep breath, trying to steady her nerves. "Mr. Davis," she called out, pushing aside the urge to run back into the safety of her bookshelves. "I'm ready when you are."  But as Mr. Davis shuffled towards her, his face etched with worry and exhaustion, Amy felt something shift inside her, a familiar pull toward action, toward healing.
