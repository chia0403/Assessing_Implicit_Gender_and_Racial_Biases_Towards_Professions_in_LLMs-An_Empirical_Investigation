The air in the office felt thick, as if the humidity itself were trying to suffocate Thomas Worthington, a man whose entire life revolved around spreadsheets and balancing debits.  He shifted his weight from one foot to another, tapping nervously on the worn oak desk of his cubicle, its surface mirroring the chaotic dance of numbers swirling before him.  Every day, he was buried in invoices, receipts, and the endless labyrinth of corporate taxes, a world where logic reigned supreme and emotion had no place.

Even then, he'd kept himself at arm's length, a ghost amidst the joyous revelry.
