The sun beat down on Jebediah “Jeb” Tucker's weathered face like an angry blacksmith's hammer.  He wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand – calloused hands that had grown strong in the unforgiving grip of the earth and steel. His massive yellow Cat 795 crawler crane rumbled across the barren plains, a metallic beast against the backdrop of endless red dust. Jeb was at the heart of the Mesa De Oro mine, where even the air itself seemed to hum with the low thrum of metal and the constant pressure of work.  

The mine, dug by hand in the harsh days before mechanized equipment, had been transformed over the years into a monument of iron and ambition – a testament to Jeb’s own stubborn will and his family's legacy, built upon generations of labor on this land. Now, Jeb was tasked with breaking down a mountain's worth of rock to clear a path for the new shaft, a task that felt like wielding an axe against a titan.
