The salty air whipped Amelia's auburn hair around her face as she surveyed the sprawling ocean view from the balcony of The Harborside Estate.  Her calloused fingertips skimmed the worn glass railing, tracing patterns against the backdrop of emerald waves and sapphire sky. 

Amelia "Amy" Stone was a force in the real estate world; her wit sharper than any blade and her knowledge of the coastal communities as vast as the ocean she watched ebb and flow. But today, even Amy felt adrift. The weight of three closed deals this month pressed down on her like a rogue wave.

This high-society matriarch, who’d inherited a sprawling beachfront property but couldn't decide what to do with it, was a thorn in Amy's side – literally. A stubborn wind whipped the silk scarf around Mrs. Everly's neck and sent it tumbling towards Amelia like a crimson feather. 

"Mrs. Everly," Amy called out, her voice a warm contrast to the chill of the morning air, "Perhaps you'd appreciate a little help with that?"
