The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of burnt coffee, a signature blend Elara swore she'd never understand. The late-night shift at Mercy General Hospital was usually a symphony of beeping monitors and hushed conversations, but tonight it seemed to hum with an undercurrent of unease.  Elara, her nametag pinned securely to her scrubs, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck – its smooth surface cool against her skin. She had already seen two emergency cases tonight; both resolved, thankfully. Yet, something felt off about the stillness of the hall, a sense of anticipation clinging like a damp fog. 

Elara’s hospital room was on the third floor, tucked away from the bustle of the intensive care unit and main ER, where she usually thrived.  It housed a small collection of chronically ill patients – Mrs. Henderson's chronic bronchitis, Mr. Johnson's recurring seizures – but tonight there was an unsettling quiet in the usual rhythm of their lives. Even the gentle hum of the oxygen machine seemed to falter. 

She walked towards the room she usually treated -  Mrs. Davis's for a third-night stay, who had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and battling pneumonia – and something in her gut told her to get a hold on this silence. This wasn’t just the quiet of the night; it was like a hushed hush before a storm.
