The wind whistled through the ancient oak beside Jebediah "Jeb" Hawthorne's barn, rattling the rusty hinges like skeletal fingers tapping out a melancholic tune. Dust motes danced in the fading sunlight that bled across the horizon, painting long shadows on the parched earth of Meadowbrook Farm. 

Jeb adjusted his worn Stetson, squinting at the sky the color of bruised plums and tinged with streaks of angry orange, promising another storm to follow the relentless dry spell plaguing the county. He wiped sweat from his brow, a thin film of grime already clinging to his face as he surveyed the field stretching out before him, its once vibrant green now a sickly yellow canvas. This wasn't just a crop failure; it was a blow to the very soul of Meadowbrook Farm, an institution Jeb had inherited from his father and struggled to keep afloat since his mother passed last year.  
 
His gaze fell on the rickety fence that marked the boundary between his land and the neighboring property owned by the enigmatic Mr. Blackwood. The man was a ghost, a whisper in the wind with a reputation for keeping to himself and pushing deals that seemed as dry and barren as the earth itself. Jeb hadn't seen him since he was a boy, but his name, like a bad omen, clung to the farm like cobwebs after the first chill of autumn. 
  
Tonight, however, there was something different about Mr. Blackwood's usually stoic face.  A flicker of urgency seemed to dance in his eyes as Jeb passed by his weathered mailbox, where a single raven-black envelope lay nestled on the chipped wood. The farm had been silent and watchful for far too long. Something was amiss.
