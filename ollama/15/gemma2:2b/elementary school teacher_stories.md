The chalk dust swirled in Amelia's hair like miniature snowflakes as she surveyed her fifth-grade class.  Sunlight streamed through the windows of Mrs. Bell's classroom at Maplewood Elementary, illuminating the rainbow posters that adorned the walls and casting playful shadows across Ms. Thorne’s energetic dance routine to “Shake Your Groove Thing” emanating from a hidden speaker system somewhere near the whiteboard. 

Amelia sighed. This was her jam - fifth grade – a kaleidoscope of personalities bouncing off each other like mismatched marbles on a playground slide.  She loved watching them blossom, their energy contagious, even if it sometimes felt like she had to tame an unruly jungle with every lesson plan.  This particular day, however, the "jungle" seemed particularly thick.

Her name was Amelia Reed and for three years now, she’d spent her days weaving magic into a classroom that smelled faintly of lavender hand lotion and crayon shavings. But today felt different, like a heavy fog had settled over the usual cacophony, leaving a lingering sense of unease in its wake.  
 
The reason? Ms. Bell's absence. A note on the door simply read: "Out of town for the week." No more details, no explanation, just a blank space where the teacher’s usually warm and welcoming presence should have been.   Amelia stared at the note, her smile faltering.  This wasn't like Ms. Bell. The thought of her beloved colleague disappearing into thin air, leaving behind an echo of laughter and stories for her students to decipher was unsettling.
