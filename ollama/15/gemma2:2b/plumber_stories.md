The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Plumbing Pros" like tiny fists pounding on an old piano. Inside, Felix Plumb, his thick mustache dripping condensation onto his worn apron, surveyed the mess before him with weary eyes. The smell of mildew and stale beer clung to the air, a familiar scent in this cramped workshop that had been home to more than one family curse.  His grandfather's toolbox, dented and greasy, stood sentinel near the leaky sink, a constant reminder of his legacy - or rather, his inability to escape it. 

Felix was a plumber by trade, but he felt like a clown in a storm, his face covered with grease, his hands stained with water, constantly juggling leaking pipes and frustrated customers. His father had been known for fixing even the most baffling plumbing woes, his fingers seeming to dance over pipe fittings like he was composing a symphony.  But Felix, plagued by self-doubt, just tripped over his own shoelaces. 


Today's call had thrown him off balance: a leaky faucet in a stately manor house, a place with more history than any pipes could hold. A house so old, the rumors whispered of hidden rooms and forgotten stories â€“ stories that always seemed to escape Felix like water seeping through cracks.  He sighed, running his hand over the worn handle of his wrench, a weapon he wielded daily but never truly felt at ease using. 


The storm outside was only beginning to rage, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.
