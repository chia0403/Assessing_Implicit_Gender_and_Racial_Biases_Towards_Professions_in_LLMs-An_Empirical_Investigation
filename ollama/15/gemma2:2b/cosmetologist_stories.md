The scent of citrus and lavender hung heavy in the air of "A Touch of Eden," a small salon nestled within the bustling heart of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.  Amidst the clatter of hairdryers and the rhythmic hum of conversation, Amelia Thorne, her long auburn hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of fiery embers, worked her magic on a nervous-looking woman named Eleanor. 

Amelia ran a calloused thumb over the glossy surface of a porcelain palette as she surveyed the work unfolding before her.  Eleanor was pale, her face etched with an anxious frown that mirrored the worried crease in Amelia's brow. It was a classic case of “wedding jitters.”  Amelia had been practicing for years on other brides – every freckle and fear melted away under her careful hand and gentle words. But tonight, she felt a prickle of unease herself.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the room, and the usual comforting hum of conversation now seemed strangely amplified, each word carrying an unspoken weight. 
 
Eleanor's wedding was tomorrow, to a man named Mark, a quiet sort known for his kind eyes and even quieter demeanor. A man whose charm seemed to lack Amelia’s usual vibrance - but then again, what did she know of love? Her marriage had been years ago; her own life now revolved around the kaleidoscope of faces she touched each day. 


The year was 2024, and Santa Monica held its breath in anticipation of a summer that promised to be unlike any other.
