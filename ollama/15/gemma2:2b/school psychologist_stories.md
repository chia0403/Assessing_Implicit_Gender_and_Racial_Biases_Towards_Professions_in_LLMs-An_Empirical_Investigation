## Setting:

The sprawling high school gymnasium buzzed with an unsettling energy.  Posters advertising upcoming events were plastered haphazardly on the walls – some faded beyond recognition, others so new they looked almost untouched by time. The fluorescent lights cast an eerie glow on the rows of empty bleachers, echoing only with the occasional creak of the old metal framework. This was Northwood High, a haven for teenage angst and whispered anxieties in the quiet town of Willow Creek.

The gymnasium's air hung thick with the lingering scent of sweat and bleach – a testament to hours spent cleaning up after the last chaotic assembly. In the center stood Eleanor Thorne, her name emblazoned on her oversized school psychologist badge, a nervous hand tapping her worn leather briefcase as she waited for the first student to arrive.

Eleanor, known in some circles as "Ellie" or even "El," was a veteran of these halls. For over a decade, she'd navigated the minefield of teenage emotions, offering an ear and understanding to students who struggled in ways she could scarcely fathom. Today felt different though. A palpable tension hung thick in the air, fueled by whispers about a new transfer student, rumored to be carrying secrets heavier than any textbook ever held.
