## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Mildred's small office, blurring the already gloomy cityscape outside. The flickering fluorescent lights hummed like an anxious bee trapped in its hive.  Mildred adjusted her spectacles, pushing back stray strands of fiery red hair that escaped from under the worn-down bun she wore daily. Her fingers tapped rhythmically on the old ledger, each click a hollow echo in the quiet room.  Tonight, the weight felt heavier than usual.

**Name:** Mildred "Millie" Bellweather 
 
**Setting:** Millie's office is tucked away in a cramped corner of the historic downtown district, once bustling with life but now shrouded in an almost forgotten charm. The air is thick with the musty smell of old paper and ink, punctuated by the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea from her neglected kettle.  A worn-out clock on the wall ticked steadily towards midnight, its chime a discordant counterpoint to the storm's fury outside.
