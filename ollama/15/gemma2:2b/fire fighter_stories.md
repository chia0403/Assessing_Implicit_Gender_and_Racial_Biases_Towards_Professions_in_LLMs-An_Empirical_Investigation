The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and smoke, clinging to Captain Elias Thorne like a second skin. It wasn't the smell that bothered him; it was the weight of it all – every ember smoldering in his chest, mirroring the flames licking at the mountainside a mile away.  Elias had seen enough fires to know they weren't just burning wood and fuel; they were lives caught in an inferno of rage. And tonight, the fire threatened to claim more than just forest and property. 

He adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson hat, pulling it down low over his eyes as the wind whipped through the trees around him, rustling the leaves with a mournful sigh.  Elias's boots were soaked from the heavy rain that had finally broken through weeks of summer heat. His firetruck was parked on the edge of a cleared patch, its red paint gleaming against the fading light. It held his world – a lifeline for those caught in the flames - and tonight, it felt like he was at the edge of his own universe.
