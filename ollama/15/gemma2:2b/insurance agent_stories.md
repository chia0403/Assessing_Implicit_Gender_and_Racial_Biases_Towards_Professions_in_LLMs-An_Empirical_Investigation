She wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, watching the afternoon sun cast long shadows across her desk at Bay View Insurance. The chipped paint on the windowpane reflected the sky's fading intensity – a bruised violet bleeding into a deep indigo – mirroring the mood that had settled upon Amelia herself.

A fresh graduate with an MBA and a heart full of ambition, she’d walked through those doors as a newly minted insurance agent with a head brimming with optimism and promises of financial security for her struggling family. Now, the reality was starkly different. The phone remained perpetually silent, its ringing tone a mocking echo of her growing frustration.  Insurance claims seemed to be a neverending stream of grief and loss, each one tugging at Amelia's heartstrings like a phantom thread.

Amelia sighed, the weight of unsold policies pressing down on her shoulders. Today wasn't just about closing deals; it was about proving she belonged here. The air itself seemed to hold a collective sigh as she opened her file folder, filled with blank pages and even more blank stares from families already lost in grief.
