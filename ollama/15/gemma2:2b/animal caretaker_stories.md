## Setting:

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange, fiery red, and bruised purple as Eliza Thorne tended to her charge for the evening. The air held the chill of approaching winter, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  A small, ramshackle cabin nestled into the side of a winding mountain path. 

**Main Character:**

Eliza Thorne. A woman whose hands bore the faint imprint of countless lifetimes, her wrinkles hinting at laughter lines and a life well-lived. Her eyes, the blue of glacial water, held an ancient wisdom that belied her years. For Eliza had spent her life in service to creatures beyond human comprehension.  A wolfâ€™s howl echoed through the valley as she finished brushing Zephyr's fur, a creature so wild yet somehow tamed by her quiet hands and gentle heart.

**Opening:** 

"Howl at the moon, little one," Eliza murmured, tucking a stray feather from Zephyr's coat into his oversized, furry ear.  He nuzzled her palm, a soft rumble vibrating in his chest as he stared out into the darkening valley. The mountains towered over them, their peaks shrouded in an ethereal mist, and the silence was broken only by the distant croak of an owl. It was a silence that spoke volumes, a language she knew like the back of her hand.  Eliza closed her eyes, picturing the stories etched into Zephyr's fur, tales woven from moonlight and wind, of ancient spirits and forgotten prophecies. Tonight, under this canopy of stars, she would hear them again.
