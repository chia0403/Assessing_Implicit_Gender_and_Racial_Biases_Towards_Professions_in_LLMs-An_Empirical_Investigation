The sun was setting like a smear of burnt orange across the canvas of the sky, its glow bleeding into the lavender hues of twilight as Ms. Amelia Alcott ushered her rambunctious class of kindergartners towards their daily adventure â€“ a trip to the "Wonderland" play area.  The air vibrated with anticipatory giggles and squeaks, a chorus of tiny voices blending together like a miniature orchestra. The whimsical world was set within a repurposed storage unit: a wonderland of brightly-painted cubbyholes transformed into castles and forests; cardboard boxes stacked high to form towering structures; and an abandoned swing set that now stood proud as a jungle gym, groaning slightly with the weight of imagination. 

Ms. Alcott, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, beamed down at the children. She adjusted her oversized sweater - "a little extra insulation for these chilly evenings," she thought wryly - and patted one particularly shy boy on his shoulder.  "Ready to build your own magical world?" she asked, her voice soft as a summer breeze.
