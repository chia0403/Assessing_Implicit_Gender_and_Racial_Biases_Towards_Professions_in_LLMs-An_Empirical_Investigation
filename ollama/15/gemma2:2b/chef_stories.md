##  Opening:

The aroma of rosemary and sage hung thick in the air, a fragrant shroud clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like an old sweater. It was the scent of her grandmother's kitchen, the one place where time seemed to flow differently - slower, more deliberate, infused with warmth and laughter. Now, as Amy stood amidst the chaos of "The Copper Kettle," her family's beloved bistro in the heart of London's bustling Covent Garden district, that smell felt like a distant memory. 

The stovetop crackled with life, a frantic symphony of chopping and frying as she worked through the last rush hour of lunchtime service.  A motley crew of patrons rushed to their tables, eager for Amy's famed shepherd's pie and her father's legendary roast chicken – dishes that had sustained generations of Londoners in equal measure. 

Yet tonight, a strange calm settled over Amy as she glanced at the clock. The familiar glow of the golden hour cast long shadows through the windowpanes, turning the cobbled streets outside into a mosaic of light and shadow. Tonight was her father's birthday – a night that should have been marked with joyous fanfare and the comforting hum of family tradition. But tonight, instead, it felt like a heavy cloak draped over Amy's heart.
