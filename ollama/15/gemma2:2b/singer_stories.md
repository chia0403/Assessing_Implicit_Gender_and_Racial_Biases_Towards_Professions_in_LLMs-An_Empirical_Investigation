The humid air clung to Celeste's throat as she perched on the worn velvet stool in the dimly lit dressing room. The stage lights were still hours away, but already the roar of the upcoming show thrummed through the backstage area like an unruly animal. Outside, the city was breathing down her neck, a symphony of honking taxis and late-night sirens. Inside, though, everything was hushed.  

Celeste was all too familiar with this quiet before the storm, the tension that always gripped her as she waited for the spotlight to find her. Her name was Celeste Delacroix, and the voice that flowed from her was a tapestry woven of raw talent and years of yearning to capture the hearts of the crowd. Tonight, she would finally perform her own song at "The Velvet Curtain," a legendary dive bar in the heart of Manhattan's jazz district. 

But as she stared into the mirror, a faint, almost ethereal sadness hung heavy in the air. The stage was more than just a platform; it was a portal, and tonight, there were demons waiting on the other side, whispers from past disappointments echoing in her ears. Would her voice be strong enough to silence the doubts, or would the storm finally break?
