## The Sunken Treasure 

The midday sun beat down on Elara's face as she polished the mahogany table in front of the massive, arched windows of the Grand Mariner's Tavern. Salt spray clung to the air, mingling with the tang of fish and sweat.  Her name was not exactly "Elara" - that was a nickname from the old-timer regulars, one she'd adopted for their amusement. Her real name was Elowen, a whisper from a forgotten Welsh tale whispered only in hushed tones by her grandmother. She wasn’t much of an adventure seeker, preferring the steady rhythm of serving tables to the wild storm brewing on the horizon. 

The tavern was a microcosm of life at sea; worn ropes clinging to cracked walls, chipped china cups overflowing with frothy beer, and salt-crusted faces staring out through smoky windows as they gossiped about ship captains’ wives and buried treasure. This particular afternoon, Elara felt a prickle of something unseen beneath the bustle. A strange quiet had settled over the tavern like a silent fog. Her ears caught snatches of whispered conversations now laced with fear and urgency. 

Tonight, the sea was whispering secrets - secrets that could drown even the bravest sailor.
