The Parisian air was thick with the scent of rain, damp stone, and freshly baked bread.  A crisp autumn breeze ruffled the ivy that crept along the windowpanes of the Chateau de Fleur-de-Lys, where Estelle Moreau, a seasoned concierge with eyes like polished obsidian and a smile as sharp as a well-honed blade, awaited her next visitor. The year was 1925, a time of glittering parties and whispered secrets in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower.  The chateau, built on the foundations of an ancient vineyard, held within its walls a tapestry woven with threads of love, loss, and ambition. It housed not only wealthy patrons but also a simmering intrigue that Estelle knew better than to ignore. 

As her gaze fell on the silver-rimmed clock in the hallway, a familiar tremor ran through her. The arrival of Lady Evelyn Beaumont, known for her fiery temperament and penchant for scandalous affairs, was imminent.  Evelyn's presence at the Chateau de Fleur-de-Lys promised drama, but Estelle had learned to navigate its currents with a calm indifference that belied the storm brewing within.
