## The Whispering Walls

The air in Mrs. Amelia Croft's classroom always felt different. It wasn’t the usual static hum that clung to stuffy classrooms, but something deeper, almost as if the walls themselves held their breath.  Even after thirty years teaching English at Maplewood High, Amelia still found herself drawn to this inexplicable sense of weight. Today was particularly heavy. The school had just gone through a week-long crisis – a series of bizarre and unsettling incidents had plagued the halls, from unexplained flickering lights in the library to whispers echoing down empty corridors. 

The students, normally buzzing with teenage energy, seemed subdued, their eyes wide and watchful.  Amelia herself felt a prickle at the back of her neck as she glanced over the room, observing the vacant stares of her class – their usual vibrant energy replaced by an unsettling stillness. The silence was almost tangible, pressing down on her like a wet blanket. It wasn’t until she caught sight of 18-year-old Kevin Miller, sitting alone at the back, his head bowed over his hands, that Amelia realized the cause. 

He hadn't even spoken a word since the incident with Mr. O'Connell last night.  Mr. O'Connell, who had been absent for the entire week, had returned late yesterday, his face drawn and pale as he whispered about things best left unspoken. Something was wrong, Amelia knew it. And her students were caught in its undertow. 


**Setting:** Maplewood High School in a small, coastal town called Oakhaven, Oregon.  The school is old, with creaky floors and peeling paint, giving it the feel of something both nostalgic and slightly unsettling. The presence of the ocean and the surrounding woods adds a layer of mystery to the atmosphere.
