The sun, already a molten fist on the horizon, hammered down on Elara Bethany Thorne's back as she wrestled with the stubborn plow.  Sweat stung her eyes, but she refused to yield. This field, nestled between the weathered cliffs and the restless sea, was her inheritance, her lifeline. The salty wind whipped at her sun-bleached hair, carrying the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore. 

Elaraâ€™s farm, Thorne's End, lay on a sliver of land jutting out into the churning Atlantic.  The soil here was poor, unforgiving, clinging stubbornly to its secrets. But it was hers, passed down through generations of Thorns, each etching their own story onto its rugged canvas. 


This year, however, felt different. A gnawing unease crept through the fields like a creeping vine, whispering anxieties into Elara's heart. The crops were struggling, stunted and pale against the relentless sun. The sea, usually a source of bounty and tranquility, seemed to seethe with an unsettling energy. Something was amiss, something that went beyond the usual trials of farming life on this windswept coast.
