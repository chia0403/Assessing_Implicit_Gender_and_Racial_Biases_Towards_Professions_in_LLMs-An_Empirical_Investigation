The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical cubicles that constituted her reality.  She ran a hand through her perpetually tangled auburn hair, trying to ignore the scent of stale coffee and desperation that clung to the air like cheap perfume. Her cubicle, number 17B, was decorated with precisely three motivational posters â€“ one featuring a mountain climber reaching for the summit, another depicting a rocket ship blasting off into space, and the third, inexplicably, a smiling cat wearing sunglasses.

Eleanor sighed, squinting at the computer screen that reflected back her own weary expression. It was 9:02 am on Tuesday, which meant two things: the coffee pot had run dry for the fifth time this week, and she hadn't received a single call from a potential client since Monday morning. Selling high-end kitchen appliances wasn't glamorous.  It was a constant battle against apathy and financial insecurity, waged in a sterile office park on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa. But Eleanor had bills to pay, dreams to chase (however distant), and a stubborn refusal to give up without a fight.
