The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and bleach, a familiar perfume to Theodore Jasper Quillfeather, though not one he particularly enjoyed.  He hummed along to the low thrum of the fluorescent lights overhead as he pushed his mop across the polished linoleum floor of the university library. Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the high windows, each one a miniature world reflecting the late afternoon sun. 

Theodore wasn't fond of the quiet that settled over the library after closing time. The hushed reverence of the day gave way to an oppressive stillness, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the ancient building settling and his own rhythmic swish-swash as he cleaned. It was during these solitary hours that Theodore felt most acutely the weight of his name - Theodore Jasper Quillfeather - a moniker too grand for a man who spent his days scrubbing floors and emptying trash bins. 


He paused by a towering bookshelf, its dusty spines whispering forgotten stories. The library held a peculiar magic for him, a world of whispered secrets and untold adventures hidden within the pages of countless books. He longed to explore them, to lose himself in their worlds, but reality always beckoned him back. Reality meant buckets, mops, and the endless cycle of cleaning.
