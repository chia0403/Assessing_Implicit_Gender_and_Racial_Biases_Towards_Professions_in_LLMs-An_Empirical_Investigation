The scent of turpentine hung thick in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's studio, mingling with the dusty aroma of aged canvas. A single shaft of late afternoon sunlight sliced through the grime-coated skylight, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden path. Outside, the bustling city of New Orleans pulsed with a feverish energy, but inside the cramped attic space, time seemed to slow. Amelia, her fingers stained with vibrant hues of crimson and cobalt, stared at the blank canvas before her, frustration gnawing at her resolve. 

She had been commissioned by a renowned collector, a man whispered to be both eccentric and ruthless, to paint a portrait of his late wife. The subject, a woman known for her enigmatic beauty and captivating smile, loomed over Amelia like an unyielding specter. Every brushstroke felt inadequate, every shade too bold or too timid. It was as if the woman's ghost haunted the canvas, demanding perfection, whispering criticisms in Amelia's ear with each stroke of the brush.
