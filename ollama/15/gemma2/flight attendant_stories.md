The stale recirculated air hung heavy in Eleanor Beatrice Finch’s nostrils as she prepped for the 6:00 p.m. departure to Lisbon. A symphony of engine hum and murmured conversations filled the cabin, punctuated by the occasional screech of a baby.  Eleanor, her smile perfectly plastered on despite the familiar fatigue tugging at her eyelids, checked safety pamphlets one last time, the worn edges a testament to countless flights completed. Her reflection in the mirrored galley door showed a woman who looked younger than her thirty-five years – the constant travel and ever-shifting time zones had that effect – but beneath the meticulously applied makeup, she could see the weight of responsibility settling on her shoulders.  

This wasn't just another flight to Lisbon; it was a lifeline for a young girl named Sofia, whom Eleanor felt a strange pull towards, her story a whisper carried through the airport's announcements. Sofia, battling a rare illness, needed specialized treatment available only in Portugal. This flight, this routine job, had become something more – a chance for Eleanor to make a difference, to be more than just a cog in the vast machine of global travel.  



The setting sun cast long shadows across the tarmac as passengers boarded, their anxieties and excitement mingling with the scent of jet fuel and anticipation. Eleanor, her name tag glinting under the airport lights, stood ready – a beacon of calm amidst the chaos, her heart beating a little faster than usual.
