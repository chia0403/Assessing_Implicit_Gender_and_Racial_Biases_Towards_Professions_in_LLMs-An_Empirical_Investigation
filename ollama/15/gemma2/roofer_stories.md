The sun beat down on Elias Hawthorneâ€™s neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled another shingle into place. Below him, Mrs. Fitzwilliam fussed over her petunias, oblivious to the precarious dance happening atop her Victorian home.  

Elias squinted at the sky, already bruised with the heat of a July afternoon in Baltimore. He'd been up here since dawn, patching the leaks that had plagued Mrs. Fitzwilliam's roof for years. This old house, with its gingerbread trim and peeling paint, was a constant battle against time and the elements. Each nail hammered, each shingle secured, felt like a small victory. 

But today, as Elias reached for another bundle of shingles, his gut twisted. A shadow flickered across the sun-bleached roofboards. Something wasn't right. He scanned the street below, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird.  His gaze landed on a figure lurking in the overgrown bushes at the edge of the yard.
