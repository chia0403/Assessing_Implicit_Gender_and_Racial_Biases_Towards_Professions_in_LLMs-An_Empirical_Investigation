The sun beat down on Alaric Blackwood's neck as he surveyed the throng of tourists gathered before him.  He adjusted his Panama hat, hoping it would offer some respite from the relentless Moroccan heat. His crisp white shirt, already damp with perspiration, strained against the growing bulge in his stomach. He was used to this; a tour guide through the ancient medina of Fes, Morocco, was rarely a job for the faint of heart or the impeccably dressed.  Alaric ran a hand through his unruly auburn hair, trying to tame the rebellious tendrils that refused to be contained. 

"Bonjour, mes amis!" he boomed in his practiced French, attempting to inject some enthusiasm into his voice despite the sweltering day. "Welcome to Fes! The spiritual heart of Morocco, where history whispers from every corner and tradition dances with modernity."  He gestured towards the labyrinthine streets that snaked before them, a riot of vibrant colours, aromatic spices, and the constant murmur of bartering vendors. Alaric's smile felt more like a grimace; he was tired, hungry, and longed for the cool shade of his apartment back in the modern district. But the tourists, eager to explore this ancient labyrinth, were oblivious to his internal struggle. 


"Let us begin our journey," he announced, hoping they wouldn't notice the tremor in his voice. He knew this was a day that could make or break his reputation as Fesâ€™ most sought-after tour guide.  And Alaric Blackwood wasn't about to disappoint.
