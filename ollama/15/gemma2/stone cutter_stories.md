The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through Elias Thorne's workshop, a symphony of industry that had been the soundtrack to his life since he was a boy. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the half-finished sculptures scattered across the workbench. The aroma of sawdust mingled with the metallic tang of iron filings, creating a unique scent that Elias found oddly comforting.

His workshop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the bustling port city of Havenwood, was a haven for him - a sanctuary from the chaos and clamor of the wider world. Outside, ships sailed in and out of the harbor, their masts like skeletal fingers reaching towards the grey sky, while merchants hawked their wares and gossiped amongst themselves. But within these four walls, Elias found solace in the tactile satisfaction of shaping stone, his rough hands coaxing beauty from the cold, unyielding medium. 


He was known throughout Havenwood for his craftsmanship, a reputation earned through years of dedication and meticulous attention to detail. His creations, ranging from simple tombstones to intricate statues, were prized possessions, gracing homes, churches, and public spaces alike. Yet, despite his success, Elias remained a solitary figure, finding joy only in the company of his tools and the quiet contemplation that came with his work.
