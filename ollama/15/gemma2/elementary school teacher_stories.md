##  The Fading Crayons

**Setting:** Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood's third-grade classroom at Elmwood Elementary School hummed with the usual pre-lunch chaos. Sunbeams, fractured by the colourful alphabet letters hanging from the ceiling, cast playful patterns on the worn linoleum floor. The air was thick with the scent of crayons, glue sticks, and a hint of something vaguely floral that Mrs. Blackwood suspected came from her neighbour's overly zealous gardening.

**Opening:**

Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood surveyed her classroom with a sigh.  The day had already taken a predictable turn towards pandemonium. A small army of sticky-fingered seven-year-olds clambered over the furniture, their voices rising in a cacophony of squabbling and excited chatter. She glanced at the clock - 11:47 am - precisely two minutes before lunch bell chaos would reach its peak.  But today, something else caught her eye. As she passed by the classroom's colourful art corner, her gaze fell upon an unsettling sight. The box of crayons, usually bursting with vibrant hues, lay forlornly open, its once-bright contents now looking faded and dull. Even the familiar red crayon, which always seemed to defy time, had lost its fiery intensity. 


Mrs. Blackwood frowned. It was as if the very colours themselves were losing their vibrancy, mirroring the weariness in her own soul after a particularly challenging week. Could it be possible that even crayons weren't immune to the dreary effects of everyday life?
