The rain hammered against the cracked windowpane, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the grimy glass. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Jack Alistair Hawthorne's office. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air.  

Jack, his trench coat dripping onto the faded rug, rubbed a hand over his tired eyes. He was used to this – the damp, the gloom, the smell of despair that clung to the city like cheap perfume. He wasn't sure if it was the setting or the clientele, but something about being a private detective in this rain-soaked corner of Chicago just seemed to amplify everything: the sadness, the fear, the grime beneath it all.  

He swiveled in his swivel chair, his gaze falling on the single file resting on his desk. "Missing person," he muttered, picking it up with a sigh. The photo attached showed a young woman with worried eyes and a hesitant smile. Her name was Lily Evans, and someone cared enough to bring her case to him.


Jack Alistair Hawthorne adjusted his collar, knowing that beneath the grime and grit of his office lay the heart of a city yearning for answers – answers he often found, one rain-soaked night at a time.
