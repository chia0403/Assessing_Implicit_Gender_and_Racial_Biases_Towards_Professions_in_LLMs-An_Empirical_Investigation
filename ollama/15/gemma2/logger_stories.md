Elias Thorne, sweat stinging his eyes, swung his axe with practiced ease, each blow splitting the ancient wood with a satisfying crack. The rhythmic thud echoed through the silent grove, a primal symphony punctuated by the occasional caw of a crow or the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.
