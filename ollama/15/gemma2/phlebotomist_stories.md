The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Kensington’s head like a chorus of anxious bees. The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard as she updated patient records.  

Elara, a seasoned phlebotomist at Mercy General Hospital, felt the familiar prickle of anticipation – not fear, exactly – that accompanied each new arrival.  She liked this part, the waiting. It was a quiet moment before the storm of needles and blood draws, a pause in the symphony of chaos that filled the Emergency Room every day. She could almost hear it now, the murmur of worried voices, the frantic beeping of machines, the hushed pronouncements of doctors. 

The door swung open, admitting a gust of cold air and a woman clutching her arm, face pale and contorted in pain. Elara smiled – not a wide, cheerful smile, but a small, comforting one. This was where she belonged, amidst the anxieties and fears, offering a moment of calm and competence in the whirlwind of human suffering.  


"Name?" she asked, her voice soft but firm, ready to usher this new patient into the quiet symphony of blood draws and hope.
