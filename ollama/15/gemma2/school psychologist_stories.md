The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the cramped conference room. The worn floral wallpaper peeled at the seams, revealing damp plaster beneath. Outside, the rhythmic clatter of construction echoed from across the street, the new high school building slowly rising from the earth like some metallic leviathan. 

Eleanor sat rigidly at the table, her notepad open and a pen clutched nervously in her hand. Across from her sat Mr. Henderson, the seventh-grade science teacher, his face etched with worry lines that seemed to deepen with every passing second. He shifted uncomfortably, clearing his throat repeatedly.  His words came out in a rush. "Dr. Vance, I just… I don't know what to do anymore. It's like something's changed in him. He used to be so bright, so engaged…"

Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze steady and encouraging. "Tell me about it, Mr. Henderson. Tell me everything." 


The stale air hung heavy in the room as the construction sounds seemed to press closer, a discordant backdrop to the unfolding story of young Liam Davis, a boy on the precipice of something unknown.
