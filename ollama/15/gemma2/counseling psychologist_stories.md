The rain hammered against the windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming in Dr. Eleanor Blythe’s chest. Her office, normally a haven of calm with its soft lavender walls and the scent of lavender essential oil lingering in the air, felt oppressive tonight. The streetlights outside cast an eerie glow through the blinds, painting dancing shadows on the plush carpet. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock - 8:15 pm.  Her last appointment had been cancelled, leaving her with a gaping hole in her schedule and an unsettling sense of anticipation. It wasn’t uncommon for clients to reschedule, but tonight, the emptiness felt different. The silence was heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties that mirrored her own. She sipped her lukewarm chamomile tea, its soothing warmth doing little to calm the nervous tremor in her hands.  

The weight of a new patient's file rested on her desk, its crisp edges stark against the faded floral wallpaper. A name stared back at her - Liam O'Connell. His referral was vague, "severe anxiety" with no further details. He had requested to meet this evening, which itself felt unusual.  Eleanor wasn't usually this unsettled before a session. Then again, she’d never felt quite so…alone.


**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Blythe’s private counseling office in a quiet suburb just outside of Chicago. It is late autumn, and the first snow of the year has started to fall. The air is heavy with dampness and the scent of rain.
