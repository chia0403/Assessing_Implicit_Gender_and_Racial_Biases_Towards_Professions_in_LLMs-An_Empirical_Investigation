The scent of freshly ground cardamom drifted from the bustling street market below, mingling with the sharp tang of chlorine from the rooftop pool just outside Esmeralda Flores' office window.  She sat hunched over her computer, battling a particularly stubborn spreadsheet of flight cancellations and itinerary adjustments – the bane of every travel agent’s existence in this era of unpredictable weather patterns and global unrest. 

Esmeralda sighed, pushing back the unruly curl that perpetually threatened to fall into her eyes. It was days like these she wished she'd followed her other passion – pottery.  Crafting clay seemed infinitely more peaceful than wrangling frantic customers demanding refunds for their cancelled cruises to the Galapagos Islands or their dream safaris in Kenya. 

But then again, there was something inherently romantic about travel. About opening up worlds for people, even if those worlds sometimes involved volcanic eruptions and political unrest. It was a messy business, but it kept things interesting.  Just as Esmeralda finished recalculating a flight route through the storm-ravaged Atlantic, her phone buzzed with an incoming call.

"Flores Travel," she answered briskly, bracing herself for the inevitable deluge of travel woes. 


The voice on the other end was calm and measured, "This is Mr. Alistair Finch.  I'd like to book a trip. Something… unique."
