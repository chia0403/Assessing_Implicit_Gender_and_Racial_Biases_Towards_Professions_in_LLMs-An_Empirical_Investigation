The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the cluttered reception area of "Dr. Bartholomew's Holistic Health Emporium."  

Lila Amelia Cartwright tapped her pen against the worn laminate countertop, her gaze flitting between the ancient clock on the wall (stuck at 3:17) and the overflowing plant pot next to the phone. She sighed, a delicate puff escaping her lips like a dandelion seed caught in a breeze. The emporium was never particularly bustling, but today felt especially desolate. Even the usual assortment of crystals humming with unseen energy seemed lifeless.  Lila missed the days when Dr. Bartholomew would be there, his booming laugh echoing through the room, his stories about ancient healing rituals captivating her imagination. Heâ€™d retired last year, leaving Lila to navigate the labyrinthine world of alternative medicine alone.

A chime tinkled as the door creaked open, interrupting Lila's melancholy musings.  A tall figure, shrouded in a thick wool coat, stepped into the space, their face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  Lila straightened her cardigan and forced a smile. 


"Welcome to Dr. Bartholomew's Holistic Health Emporium," she chirped, her voice echoing slightly in the quiet room. "Can I help you?"
