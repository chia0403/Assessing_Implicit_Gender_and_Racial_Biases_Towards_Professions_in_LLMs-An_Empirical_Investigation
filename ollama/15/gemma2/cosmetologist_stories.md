The air hung thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and ambition. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "A Cut Above," illuminating motes of glitter that danced alongside stray strands of hair.  

Amara Soleil, master stylist and owner of A Cut Above, adjusted the silver headband holding back her fiery red curls, squinting at the customer in her chair. Mrs. Peabody, a regular who always insisted on perms "just like those fancy movie stars," was currently sporting a look best described as 'molten poodle' with an unfortunate hint of helmet hair. 

Amara sighed. This wasn't what she envisioned for A Cut Above. She dreamt of transforming the rundown salon into a haven of artistic expression, where bold colours and avant-garde styles reigned supreme. But rent was due, Mrs. Peabody was her most reliable client, and sometimes, even the most brilliant dreams had to be tempered with reality. 


Set in:  A small, struggling town on the coast of Maine, the heart of which is a dusty, once-grand street lined with mostly empty storefronts and boarded-up businesses.
