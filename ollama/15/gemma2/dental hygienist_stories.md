The air in Dr. Albright’s office hummed with the familiar symphony of suction whispers and whirring drills.  It wasn't unpleasant, Elara Juniper thought, more like the comforting thrum of a well-oiled machine. She surveyed her station – sterilized instruments gleaming under the overhead lights, the scent of peppermint hand sanitizer hanging in the air, and the ever-present promise of plaque removal filling her with a peculiar sense of satisfaction. Today was particularly busy, patients queuing up for their bi-annual cleanings like clockwork.  Elara ran a gloved hand over the smooth surface of the dental unit, its cool metal grounding her before she greeted her next patient, Mrs. Peterson, who seemed to be perpetually concerned about a cavity that might not exist. 


The story takes place in a bustling suburban dental practice in present-day Ohio, where Elara Juniper navigates the daily routines and occasional dramas of her patients' lives alongside Dr. Albright, the kind but slightly eccentric dentist who treats them all with equal parts professionalism and paternal care.
