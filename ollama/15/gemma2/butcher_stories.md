The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in the back room of "McAllister's Meats," a symphony of musky animal fat and sharp vinegar that was both revolting and strangely comforting to Elias McAllister IV. His calloused hands worked with practiced precision, cleaving through a slab of beef brisket as though it were butter, his movements honed over generations of butchery lineage. Sunlight streamed through the grimy window above the cutting board, casting long shadows across the bloodstained floor, a testament to the day's work. 

Elias McAllister IV, a man who knew the secrets hidden within every muscle and sinew, felt a familiar pang in his chest as he surveyed the carnage. This wasn't just meat; it was life, once vibrant and pulsing, now reduced to raw slabs awaiting transformation. He owed it to them, to this legacy, to honor their sacrifice with respect, with skill, with an understanding that transcended mere commerce. Today, however, something felt different, a disquiet humming beneath the familiar rhythm of his work.  

Elias McAllister IV wasn't just a butcher; he was a custodian of tradition, a link in a chain stretching back to his great-great-grandfather, who first opened these doors over a century ago. But today, the weight of that legacy felt heavier than ever, and the quiet hum of unease whispered a warning: something had changed in the air, in the town of Hollow Creek, and it was about to change him forever.
