The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Thorne like a damp blanket as he crouched beneath the rusted porch swing.  Sweat trickled down his neck, stinging his eyes. He squinted at the tangle of wires under the aging house, their frayed insulation whispering tales of neglect and forgotten dreams. A low drone filled the air – cicadas, buzzing in an almost hypnotic chorus. Elias sighed, wiping his brow with a grimy rag. This wasn't the glamorous life he'd envisioned for himself when he first graduated with his electrical engineering degree.  But bills needed paying, and his landlord wouldn't call anyone else to fix this mess.

Elias Thorne wasn’t your typical electrician. He had an engineer's mind, always dissecting problems into their simplest components. His hands, though roughened by years of work, possessed a deftness that could coax life back into even the most stubborn circuits. Yet, there was a melancholy in his eyes, a weariness that hinted at something deeper, a longing for a purpose beyond fixing flickering lights and dead outlets.  


The porch creaked as Mrs. Henderson shuffled out onto the wooden steps, her gaze fixed on Elias with suspicion. "You're taking your time," she muttered, her voice thin and reedy. 

Elias offered a tired smile. "Almost done, ma'am." He hoped he didn't sound too defeated. He just needed to find the right wire, the one that held the key to restoring power to this crumbling relic of a house, and maybe, just maybe, find a spark of his own in the process.
