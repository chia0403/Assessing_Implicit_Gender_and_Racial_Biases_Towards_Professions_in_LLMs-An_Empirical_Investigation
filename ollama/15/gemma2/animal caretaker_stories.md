The morning mist hung heavy over the sprawling grounds of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, its tendrils snaking between the rows of meticulously painted coops and enclosures. Dewdrops clung to cobwebs spun across the winding paths, reflecting the first shy rays of sunlight filtering through the towering pine trees that gave the sanctuary its name.  A robin perched on a weathered bench, its cheerful chirps mingling with the soft bleating of sheep in the nearby paddock. 

Eleanor Beatrice Finch, her auburn hair pulled back into a messy bun and her jeans dusted with hay, surveyed the scene with a contented sigh. She loved mornings at Whispering Pines; the quiet before the day's flurry of activity, the earthy scent of damp grass and animal musk, and the sense of purpose that pulsed through every corner of this sanctuary she'd poured her heart and soul into. Today, however, felt different. A tremor of unease ran through Eleanor, a subtle shift in the familiar hum of life that sent a prickle of apprehension down her spine. 


What would make this morning feel different for Eleanor? What secret lay hidden within the quietude of Whispering Pines? The answer, perhaps, was waiting to be discovered amongst the whispering pines themselves.
