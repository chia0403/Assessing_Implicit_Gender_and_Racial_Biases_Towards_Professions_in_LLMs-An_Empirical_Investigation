The humid air hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Vance's tiny office, thick with the scent of aged paper and brewing jasmine tea. Outside, the bustling city of New Delhi roared like a caged beast, its cacophony barely penetrating the worn wooden walls that surrounded her. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the lace curtains she’d inherited from her grandmother.  Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a stack of unread student essays and running a hand through her unruly curls. This semester had been particularly brutal - a whirlwind of lectures on ancient Sanskrit texts, frantic research for her upcoming monograph, and the constant pressure to secure funding for her department. 

But none of that mattered right now. A single, thin white envelope lay on her desk, its seal unbroken. It held a letter from an unknown sender, bearing only a cryptic inscription: "The past whispers secrets, Dr. Vance."  Eleanor's heart pounded against her ribs, a thrilling sense of foreboding tightening in her chest. This wasn't just another bureaucratic notice or a grant proposal rejection. This was something… different. Something that promised to unravel the very fabric of her meticulously crafted life.
