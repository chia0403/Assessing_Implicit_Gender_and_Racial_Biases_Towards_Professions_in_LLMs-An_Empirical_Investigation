The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee in Dr. Amelia Croft's cramped office. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the chaotic rhythm of her thoughts.  A crumpled note lay on her desk, its message stark and unsettling: "They know."

Amelia, a cardiothoracic surgeon at St. Jude's Hospital, was used to dealing with life-or-death situations. But this felt different. This wasn't about faulty valves or congenital defects; this was personal. A shadow of fear, unwelcome and unfamiliar, tightened its grip around her chest. 

The clock ticked past midnight, the only sound besides the insistent drumming of the rain.  She stared out at the neon-lit cityscape, a labyrinth of secrets and half-truths, wondering who "they" were and what they knew about her past - a past she had desperately tried to bury beneath layers of dedication and professionalism.
