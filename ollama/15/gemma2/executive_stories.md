The air in Eleanor Vance's office crackled with tension.  Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of her corner suite, illuminating the dust motes swirling lazily in the otherwise sterile space. New York City sprawled beneath her, a concrete jungle pulsating with life she was increasingly disconnected from. A single, wilted orchid sat on the mahogany desk, a pathetic reminder of the celebratory lunch that had devolved into a disaster. 

Eleanor Vance, CEO of Vance Enterprises, leaned back in her ergonomic chair, her gaze fixed on the cityscape.  Just this morning, the company had announced its groundbreaking partnership with Helios Corp, promising to revolutionize solar energy technology. Now, whispers of sabotage and betrayal echoed through the boardroom, threatening to unravel everything she'd painstakingly built over the past decade. 


The setting is a modern high-rise office building in New York City, overlooking the bustling cityscape.
