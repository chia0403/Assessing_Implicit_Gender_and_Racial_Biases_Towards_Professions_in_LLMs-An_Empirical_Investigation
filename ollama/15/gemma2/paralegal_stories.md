The stale air of the law firm clung to Amelia "Amy" Claire Beaumont like a second skin. It wasn't always this way.  Once, she’d been drawn in by the promise of justice, the thrill of fighting for the little guy against faceless corporations. Now, after five years drowning in paperwork and legal jargon at Blackwood & Finch, Amy felt more like a cog in a machine, churning through motions with barely a flicker of passion left.  

Her cubicle, crammed between two towering shelves overflowing with dusty case files, was a testament to her current state. A chipped mug of lukewarm coffee sat beside a crumpled spreadsheet detailing the upcoming deposition for Mrs. Henderson’s negligence suit against the city (a case she’d lost all hope of winning). Outside her window, the Chicago skyline glittered under the afternoon sun, a cruel reminder of the life Amy dreamed of living – one filled with adventure, not dusty documents and endless phone calls to disgruntled clients.  


But for now, it was just another Tuesday at Blackwood & Finch.
