The flickering neon sign outside the "Salty Siren" cast an unsettling green glow across Amelia Beatrice Thorne's face as she hunched over her battered laptop. The air was thick with the mingled scents of salt spray, cheap perfume, and something vaguely fishy that she suspected wasnâ€™t just from the nearby docks. 

Amelia, a reporter for the down-on-its-luck "Harborside Herald," had been chasing this story for weeks - whispers of a mythical sea creature sighted off the coast, said to be as big as a trawler and with eyes like glowing embers. Most dismissed it as drunken ramblings from fishermen, but Amelia sensed something more. Something that gnawed at her journalistic instincts and whispered secrets in the salty wind. 

The "Salty Siren" itself was a relic of a bygone era - a dive bar nestled on the edge of the forgotten docks, frequented by grizzled sailors, shady characters, and anyone desperate for a stiff drink and a hot meal. The faded photographs on the wall told tales of happier times, before the fishing industry collapsed and left the town in a state of perpetual twilight.  Amelia took a long drag from her cigarette, the embers glowing like miniature suns against the gloom. 


She was running out of time.
