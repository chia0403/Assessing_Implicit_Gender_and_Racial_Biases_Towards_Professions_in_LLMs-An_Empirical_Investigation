The humid Florida air hung thick as molasses around Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, clinging to her crisp white blouse and making every step feel like wading through warm syrup. Her sensible wedges sank slightly into the dew-damp grass, leaving tiny prints that vanished almost instantly in the morning light. The sprawling McMansion before her, its pale stucco walls reflecting the rising sun, seemed out of place amidst the lush greenery of St. Augustine's historic district.  

Amelia Hawthorne adjusted the strap of her briefcase and straightened her nametag - "Hawthorne Insurance" - with a sigh. This was not her usual clientele. Most of Amelia's time was spent dealing with leaky roofs, car accidents, and disgruntled policyholders in modest brick bungalows and mobile homes. But Mr. Bartholomew Beaumont, heir to a fortune built on discount lawn ornaments, had requested her services personally. A case involving "unusual circumstances," he had whispered conspiratorially over the phone, leaving Amelia with more questions than answers.  

As she approached the ornate iron gates, a shiver danced down her spine. It wasn't just the Florida humidity. Something about this place felt... off.
