The humid Atlanta air hung heavy, clinging to Dr. Amelia Grace Carter like a damp towel as she stepped out of her clinic. The scent of honeysuckle, always thick this time of year, battled with the exhaust fumes from Peachtree Street, creating a uniquely Southern perfume. 

Amelia sighed, loosening the collar of her crisp white blouse. A swarm of impatient bees buzzed around the geraniums by the front door, their frantic energy mirroring her own. She had seen more patients than usual today â€“ backaches, headaches, that unsettling stiffness that seemed to plague everyone after a long Atlanta summer. Each adjustment, each crack and pop, brought temporary relief, but Amelia knew the root of their problems ran deeper than just pinched nerves. The city itself, with its relentless pace and constant pressure, was slowly grinding them down. 


And Amelia was no exception.
