The scent of lemon polish and beeswax hung thick in the air, clinging to Eleanor Beatrice Finch like a second skin. It was always there, even when she was trying to escape it by hiding behind the linen closet door with her smuggled cigarette.  This grand old house, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic, was as much Eleanor’s lifeblood as the nicotine that fueled her stolen moments of rebellion. The house, named Seahaven Manor, pulsed with a quiet melancholy, its echoing halls whispering secrets only she seemed to hear. 

Eleanor, in her worn floral dress and faded apron, navigated the plush carpets with practiced ease, her gaze flitting over the pristine surfaces she'd meticulously cleaned just hours before. Outside, the storm raged on, wind howling like a banshee and rain lashing against the towering windows, painting a dramatic backdrop to the silent, almost suffocating stillness within Seahaven Manor. 


It was always like this – an oppressive calm punctuated by the occasional outburst of the elements, mirroring the life she lived: carefully controlled, meticulously maintained, yet ultimately empty.
