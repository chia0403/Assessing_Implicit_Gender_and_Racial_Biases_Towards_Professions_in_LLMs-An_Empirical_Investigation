Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Stanley "Stan" Thistlewick's van, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing his current state of mind. He squinted through the windshield at the desolate stretch of highway ahead, swallowed by a thick fog that seemed to suck the light from the world. Stan wasn't known for his stoicism, but even he felt a prickle of unease under the weight of this oppressive gloom. 

He was on his way to Blackwood Manor, a crumbling Victorian mansion perched precariously on the edge of Widow's Creek. The job sounded simple enough - a leaky pipe in the basement, probably just a faulty washer. But Stan had heard whispers about Blackwood Manor. Stories whispered around greasy spoons and crackling fire pits about strange occurrences, sightings of shadowy figures, and an unsettling silence that hung heavy over the abandoned halls. 

Stan wasn't superstitious, not really. He dealt in water pressure, not paranormal phenomena. Still, a shiver snaked down his spine as he turned onto the overgrown lane leading to the manor.  The fog clung thicker here, swirling around the gnarled branches of ancient trees that clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers. Stan gripped the steering wheel tighter, willing his battered van to carry him through this unsettling prelude to what promised to be a long night.
