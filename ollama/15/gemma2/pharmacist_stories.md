The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the neatly arranged shelves of Eleanor Blackwood's pharmacy. Outside, the humid Georgia summer clung to Savannah like a damp blanket, but inside, the air was cool and scented with antiseptic. 

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, meticulously counted out capsules behind the counter. Her movements were precise, efficient, practiced over years of dispensing pills and potions, both mundane and miraculous. The bell above the door tinkled as a new customer entered, breaking the quiet lull of the afternoon. 

Eleanor looked up, her hazel eyes scanning the newcomer. A tall man with shadowed features stood hesitantly in the doorway, clutching a worn leather satchel. He seemed out of place amidst the tidy rows of shelves and cheerful pastel colors - like a crow perched on a porcelain dollhouse.  This wasn't the usual Savannah crowd of retirees and tourists seeking sunburn relief or cough syrup. 


He shuffled forward, his gaze flickering nervously from Eleanor to the shelves behind her. This was no ordinary customer, Eleanor sensed, and she braced herself for whatever secret he might be carrying.
