The flickering neon sign outside cast a sickly green glow across Silas Blackwood's weathered hands as he wiped down the mahogany bar. The air inside "The Drunken Mermaid" was thick with the smell of stale beer, regret, and cheap cologne. It was 2:37 AM on a Tuesday, which meant most patrons were regulars - souls weary from their lives and seeking temporary solace in the bottom of a glass. 

Silas knew them all by name, their stories etched onto his soul like permanent tattoos. There was Maggie, the waitress with eyes that held too much sadness; Benny, the retired boxer who still carried the weight of past victories and losses; and young Timmy, barely legal, seeking escape from the monotony of a life predetermined by circumstance. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A new face sat alone at the end of the bar, shrouded in shadow. His posture was rigid, his gaze fixed on some unseen point beyond the flickering amber lights of the bar. Silas, feeling an inexplicable pull towards the stranger, started to polish a glass, every movement measured and deliberate.  


This is how every shift at The Drunken Mermaid began - with familiar faces and unspoken stories. But tonight, something was brewing beneath the surface, a ripple in the stagnant pond of routine.
