The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets.  Rain threatened to break, casting an ominous grey veil over the wrought-iron balconies and vibrant facades lining Royal Street. Inside the grand, opulent Hotel Monteleone, Edgar "Eddie" Beaumont pushed his trolley cart down a polished marble hallway, the rhythmic click of its wheels echoing against the hushed silence. His faded green uniform felt clammy against his skin, but Eddie pressed on, a practiced smile plastered on his face as he approached a room with a handwritten note taped to the door: "Mr. Alistair Blackwood."  

Eddie's hands trembled slightly as he read the name aloud. He knew Mr. Blackwood was here for a purpose, a reason that transcended simple leisure. A darkness clung to him, a palpable sense of unease that sent chills down Eddie's spine even from across the hallway. This wasn't just another guest; this was a storm brewing in the heart of his usually predictable world.
