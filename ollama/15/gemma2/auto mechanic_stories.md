The air hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and gasoline, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Finch. Grease smeared her knuckles, evidence of a long morning spent wrestling with a stubborn carburetor on a '67 Mustang. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her garage, illuminating the labyrinthine array of tools hanging from the walls and the mismatched collection of vintage cars scattered across the floor.  

Her workshop, nestled in a quiet corner of Willow Creek, was more than just a place to fix machines; it was her sanctuary. A refuge from the noisy chaos of the outside world where she could lose herself in the intricate workings of engines, finding solace in the rhythmic clang of wrenches and the satisfying hum of a perfectly tuned motor. 


The bell above the door jingled, pulling Amy out of her reverie.  A gruff voice barked, "Morning, Finch. You got time to look at my truck?"
