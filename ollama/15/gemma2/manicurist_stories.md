The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and almond oil in "Nails by Nadia," a small storefront tucked between a greasy spoon diner and a dusty secondhand bookstore. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the rows of brightly coloured polishes neatly lined up on a shelf, their reflections dancing across the polished mahogany counter. 

Nadia Petrovna, her name stitched onto a worn denim apron, hummed along to a forgotten 80s pop song playing softly on the radio. She carefully filed down a client's chipped pink nail, her movements precise and practiced after years of wielding the tool like an extension of herself. Nadia loved this space. The familiar scent, the rhythmic click of files against nails, the hushed conversations about everything and nothing â€“ it was her sanctuary, a tiny world where she could transform anxieties into glossy masterpieces one polish stroke at a time. 

But today, something felt different. A tremor of unease rippled through Nadia's calm, like a misplaced nail in her carefully crafted routine.  A new customer stepped into the warm glow of "Nails by Nadia," his face shrouded in shadow. His eyes, sharp and inquisitive, settled on Nadia with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine. 


This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon. This was something... else.
