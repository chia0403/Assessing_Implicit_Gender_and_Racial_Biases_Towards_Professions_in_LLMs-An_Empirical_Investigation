Below, on the dusty scaffolding that encircled the building's third level, stood Elijah "Eli" Beaumont, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead. Eli wasn't born for heights, but he was born for this life - the clang of hammers against steel, the rhythmic whirring of power drills, the camaraderie forged in shared toil and grit. Today, though, a knot of unease twisted in his gut, an unwelcome tremor amidst the familiar symphony of construction. He felt it before he saw it â€“ a shift in the air, a disquiet that settled like a shroud over the usually vibrant worksite. Then, through the haze of dust, Eli saw her.


**Setting:**  New York City, under construction on the site of an ambitious skyscraper.
