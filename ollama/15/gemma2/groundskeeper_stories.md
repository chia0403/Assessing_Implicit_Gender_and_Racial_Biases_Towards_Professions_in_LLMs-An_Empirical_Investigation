The first frost had kissed the azaleas, turning their vibrant blossoms to brittle, frosted sculptures. Bartholomew Finchley adjusted his faded tweed cap, watching the sunrise paint the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple over the sprawling lawns of Ashwood Manor. The air held the crisp scent of fallen leaves and damp earth, a familiar comfort to Bartholomew. He'd spent his entire life tending to these grounds, nurturing each blade of grass, pruning every rose bush with meticulous care. 

Bartholomew wasn’t just a groundskeeper; he was Ashwood Manor's silent guardian. He knew the secrets hidden in its shadows, the whispers carried on the wind through ancient oaks, and the stories etched into the very stones that formed the manor’s weathered walls.  He was a man of few words, his communication with nature more eloquent than any human tongue. But today, something felt different. A shiver ran down Bartholomew's spine, colder than the morning air, as if the familiar tranquility had been pierced by an unseen presence. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across Ashwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian estate built of weathered grey stone and nestled amidst rolling hills that faded into the twilight sky. The manor itself was a labyrinth of twisting corridors and forgotten rooms, its grandeur faded with time. It was a place where secrets lingered like dust motes in the sunlight, waiting to be unearthed.
