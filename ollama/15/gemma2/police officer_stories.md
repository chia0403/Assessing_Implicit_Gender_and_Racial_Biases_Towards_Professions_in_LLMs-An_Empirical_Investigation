The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover Diner" cast an oily sheen across Detective Eleanor Finch's trench coat as she stepped out of the biting December wind.  The diner itself was a haven of warmth and greasy smells, humming with the low murmur of conversation and the clinking of cutlery against ceramic. The scent of coffee hung heavy in the air, mixing with the faint aroma of frying bacon and desperation. 

Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun, pushed through the swinging doors and was instantly enveloped by the familiar chaos.  The diner was mostly empty save for a handful of weary truckers hunched over steaming mugs and a lone woman in a tattered coat, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee at the counter. A bell chimed overhead as she entered, its cheerful jingle clashing with the grim reality that had brought her here.


Eleanor approached the counter, placing her worn badge on the surface, "Coffee, black," she said to the waitress, a plump woman with tired eyes and hair pulled back in a messy bun, "And tell me you saw something."

The waitress sighed, wiping down the counter with a practiced hand, "Honey, everybody's seen something around here. Just depends if it's worth talkin' about."


Eleanor sat down, the vinyl seat cool beneath her backside. This was her fourth stop in as many hours, each diner and roadside bar echoing with the same unsettling silence. Someone had disappeared, vanished without a trace from this small town nestled on the edge of nowhere.  And Eleanor was determined to find them.
