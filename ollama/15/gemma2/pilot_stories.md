The biting desert wind whipped Amelia Celeste Beaumontâ€™s hair across her face as she prepped the old Grumman Goose for takeoff. The twin floats scraped gently against the dusty tarmac of Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, their weathered undersides gleaming faintly in the harsh morning sun.  Amelia squinted at the horizon where the vast Nevada desert stretched out, an endless canvas of ochre and burnt orange punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree like a lone sentinel against the relentless heat.  She adjusted her headset, feeling the familiar thrum of the engine beneath her as she ran through her final checks. Today's flight was unlike any other - no chartered luxury flights to secluded desert resorts or air ambulance missions to overflowing hospitals. This was a ghost run, a clandestine journey into the heart of Area 51, a place where secrets whispered on the wind and truth was a blurry mirage.  


Amelia took a deep breath, tasting the metallic tang of fear mixed with adrenaline. Today, she wasn't just a pilot; she was a key in unlocking a mystery that could change everything.
