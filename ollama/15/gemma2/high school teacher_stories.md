The air in Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne's classroom hung thick with the scent of burnt toast, a casualty of her rushed morning and a too-eager toaster. She glanced at the clock: 7:45 AM. Her first period, Algebra II, was due to begin in fifteen minutes.  

Eleanor adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up her nose. Students would be arriving soon, filling her classroom with their usual cacophony of chatter and rustling papers. The room itself was a testament to years spent nurturing young minds: walls adorned with student artwork, motivational posters that had faded with time, and a chalkboard perpetually covered in colorful equations scribbled in various shades of pink, blue, and green. It was a sanctuary for numbers, logic, and the occasional burst of teenage angst. 


But this morning, Eleanor felt a different kind of tension. A letter sat on her desk, sealed with crimson wax and addressed to "Mrs. E. Hawthorne."  She hadn't received anything like it in years. Ignoring the knot forming in her stomach, she pushed the letter aside, hoping that whatever it held could wait until after class.
