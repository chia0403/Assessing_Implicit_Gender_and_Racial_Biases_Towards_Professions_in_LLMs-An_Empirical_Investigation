The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder to Dr. Amelia Rose Thornton that life and death were eternally intertwined within these walls. The linoleum floor gleamed under the fluorescent lights, reflecting the tired faces of the staff moving through their daily routine. Outside, the San Francisco fog rolled in like a grey blanket, muffling the city's usual cacophony.  But inside the bustling Animal Medical Center, the air crackled with a different kind of energy â€“ the urgent thrum of worried pet owners, the whimpers of anxious animals, and the quiet determination of Amelia and her team. 

Today was no different. A frantic woman clutched a limp chihuahua in her arms, tears streaking her face. A tabby cat hissed from its carrier, claws outstretched. And a large German Shepherd lay on the examination table, whimpering softly as Amelia felt for his swollen leg. Each case brought its own weight of responsibility, its own story unfolding under the watchful eyes of Dr. Thornton.
