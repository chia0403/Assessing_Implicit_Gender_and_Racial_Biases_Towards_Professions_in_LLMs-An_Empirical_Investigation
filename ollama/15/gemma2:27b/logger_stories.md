The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A thin veil of fog clung to the towering redwoods, obscuring their peaks in an ethereal embrace. Sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to pierce through the canopy, casting long, dancing shadows on the forest floor. This was Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's domain, a world he knew intimately, every gnarled root, every whispering breeze.

Eli paused, his calloused hand resting on the rough bark of a giant redwood, its trunk so wide it would take three men to encircle it.  His weathered face, etched with lines from years spent battling the elements, bore an expression of quiet contemplation. Today's work was different. Not the usual felling and sorting. This was a salvage operation. A wildfire had swept through the eastern edge of the forest weeks ago, leaving behind a trail of charred devastation. Eli's task was to clear the fallen giants, reclaim what lumber he could from the blackened landscape. 

He slung his chainsaw over his shoulder and started towards the smoke-stained horizon, where skeletal trees reached for the sky like accusing fingers. The mournful cry of a raven echoed through the silent woods, a reminder of the tragedy that had unfolded here. Eli took a deep breath, steeling himself for the grim task ahead.
