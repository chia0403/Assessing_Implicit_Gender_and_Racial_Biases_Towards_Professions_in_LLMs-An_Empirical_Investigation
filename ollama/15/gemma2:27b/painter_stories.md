The acrid scent of turpentine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Ainsworth. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpanes of her attic studio, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden rays. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Prague hummed with life – trams clanged, vendors hawked their wares, and laughter drifted up from the beer garden below. But here, in Eleanor's world, it was just her, a canvas splashed with vibrant blues and reds, and the relentless thrumming of her own heartbeat.

Eleanor dipped her brush into a pool of cerulean, then hesitated. The cityscape sprawling before her window – a labyrinthine network of terracotta rooftops, Gothic spires piercing the sky, and the Vltava River winding its way like a silver ribbon – refused to translate onto the canvas.  Frustration gnawed at her. For weeks she had been struggling with this piece, her usual fluidity replaced by a stifling sense of inadequacy.
