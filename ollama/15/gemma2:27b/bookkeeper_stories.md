Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously above Benny's Diner. Inside, Esmeralda Finch meticulously tallied figures in her ledger, the rhythmic scrape of her pencil the only sound besides the sizzle of grease on the griddle and the occasional clatter of dishes. The diner was nearly empty; a lone trucker hunched over a plate of fries at the counter, his face obscured by the shadow of a trucker hat.

Esmeralda, with her sensible shoes and hair perpetually wound in a tight bun, wasn't exactly the type you'd expect to find hunched over ledgers at 3 am. But Benny, the diner owner, was Esmeralda's uncle, and she owed him. Big time. Besides, the solitude suited her. Numbers were her refuge, each column and row a sanctuary from the chaos of the world outside.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the back of her neck. Maybe it was the relentless rain, drumming a steady beat of anxiety against the window. Or perhaps it was the trucker's lingering gaze, which seemed to bore into her with unsettling intensity. Whatever it was, Esmeralda couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen â€“ something big.
