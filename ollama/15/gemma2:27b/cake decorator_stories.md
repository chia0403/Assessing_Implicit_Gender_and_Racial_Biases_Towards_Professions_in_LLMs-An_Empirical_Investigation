The air hung thick with the scent of sugar and vanilla, a sweet haze that clung to Rosalind Amelia Cartwright's apron and hair like a second skin.  Rosalind, or Rosie as everyone called her, stood at the center of her tiny bakery, "Sweet Surrender," surrounded by sculpted buttercream roses, fondant lilies, and delicate spun sugar ferns. Her latest creation, a five-tiered wedding cake destined for the grand ballroom of the Blackwood Manor, gleamed under the soft glow of the overhead lamps.

But despite the artistry surrounding her, Rosie's brow was furrowed, and a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Today wasn't just any day. It was the anniversary of her mother's passing, and the bittersweet memories kept swirling around her like the dusting of powdered sugar on the counter. The Blackwood wedding was important, yes, but it felt secondary to the weight she carried within.

Just then, a gust of wind rattled the bakery door, sending a shiver down Rosie's spine. She glanced at the clock â€“ 3:17 pm.  Her mother's favorite time.  A strange unease settled over her, making the hairs on the back of her neck prickle. Something felt...off.
