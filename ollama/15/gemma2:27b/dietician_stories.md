Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the bustling city scene beyond. Amelia Kensington sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed her empty waiting room. It was a Wednesday afternoon, typically one of her busiest times, yet today, not a single client had braved the storm. 

Amelia loved her little haven tucked away on a quiet side street. The walls were painted a calming sage green, and sunlight streamed through the large windows onto rows of potted herbs and vibrant vegetables she used to demonstrate healthy cooking techniques.  The air always smelled faintly of citrus and cinnamon â€“ a blend from the diffuser she swore helped calm anxious clients before consultations.

Despite the cozy atmosphere Amelia carefully cultivated, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. Cancellations were piling up, bills were looming, and the dream she'd poured her heart and soul into seemed to be teetering on the brink.
