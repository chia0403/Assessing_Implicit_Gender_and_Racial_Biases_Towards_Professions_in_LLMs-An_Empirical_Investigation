Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Silas Finch's clinic, blurring the neon glow of "Finch & Sons Medical" into an anemic smear. The stench of antiseptic battled with damp earth and mildew, a potent cocktail that always seemed to permeate the old brick building nestled in the heart of New Orleans' Tremé neighborhood. 

Silas sighed, pushing away from his cluttered desk piled high with patient files and invoices overdue since Katrina. His calloused fingers tightened around his worn leather satchel, the one his grandfather had carried before him. He was a Finch through and through - generations of healers tending to the downtrodden, stitching wounds both physical and emotional.

But tonight felt different. A bone-deep unease gnawed at Silas' gut. The rhythmic thumping of rain mimicking a restless heart, the flickering gaslight casting unsettling shadows across the room – everything conspired to make him feel like he was standing on the precipice of something unknown, something ominous.
