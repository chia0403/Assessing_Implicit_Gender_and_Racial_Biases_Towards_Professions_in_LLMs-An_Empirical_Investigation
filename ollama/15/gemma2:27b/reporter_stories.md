The incessant drone of cicadas filled the humid Louisiana air, thick enough to slice with a knife. Evangeline "Evie" Benoit wiped sweat from her brow, the cheap mascara she'd hastily applied running down her cheeks like black streaks. Her notepad was already damp, the ink smearing as she scribbled furiously. Before her stood the crumbling facade of St. Jude's Orphanage, its peeling paint and boarded-up windows whispering tales of forgotten children. Evie, a reporter for the Baton Rouge Advocate, had been chasing this story for weeks – whispers of strange occurrences, unexplained disappearances, and chilling folklore surrounding the derelict building. Today, she finally had her chance to uncover the truth.

Taking a deep breath, she stepped through the rusted gate, its hinges groaning like a mournful sigh. The overgrown courtyard was eerily silent, save for the chirping crickets and the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. Evie felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck, a sense of being watched, but when she turned, there was nothing there.  She pressed on, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. This wasn't just another story; this felt different, imbued with a palpable sense of mystery that tugged at her reporter’s instincts and something deeper, something ancient and unsettling.
