Rain lashed against the windows of Smiles For Miles Dental Hygiene Clinic, blurring the cheerful cartoon teeth painted on the glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, her brow furrowed as she surveyed the empty waiting room. It was a Tuesday afternoon, prime time for cavity checks and cleanings, yet no patients had graced her chair all morning. The incessant chirping of crickets from the nearby field only amplified the unnerving silence.

Amelia, with her perpetually rosy cheeks and auburn hair always pulled back in a neat bun, normally thrived on the gentle hum of activity that filled the clinic. Today, however, the stillness felt heavy, like an unspoken premonition. She glanced at the overflowing laundry basket of pristine white smocks and wondered if maybe, just maybe, something was amiss.

A sudden crackle from the ancient radio perched on the counter startled her. The local DJ's voice boomed through static, announcing a "severe weather advisory" and urging residents to stay indoors. Amelia's heart skipped a beat. She knew the power lines in their quaint coastal town were notoriously unreliable during storms.
