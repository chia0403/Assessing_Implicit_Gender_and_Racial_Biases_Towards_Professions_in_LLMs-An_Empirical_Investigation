The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer, punctuated by the occasional clinking of glasses and boisterous laughter. Neon signs flickered outside the grimy windows of "The Rusty Tap," casting an ethereal glow over the worn wooden bar top where Elias Finch meticulously polished a glass. Elias, with his salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight ponytail and eyes that held the weary wisdom of someone who'd seen too much, was the undisputed king of The Rusty Tap. He knew every regular by name, their drink order before they even sat down, and had an uncanny knack for dispensing advice alongside shots of whiskey. Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was punctuated by an unsettling quiet. A lone figure sat slumped at the far end of the bar, shrouded in shadow. Elias paused his polishing, a flicker of concern crossing his weathered face. Something about this customer, something in the way they hunched over their drink, told him tonight wouldn't be like any other night at The Rusty Tap.
