The humid Florida air hung thick as Amelia "Amy" Rose wrestled with the stubborn bougainvillea. Its thorny vines snaked through the ancient oak, threatening to engulf the entire backyard in a riot of fuchsia blooms. Amy grunted, her brow furrowed in concentration as she coaxed the plant back into its designated trellis. Sweat dripped down her neck, staining the faded "Rose Gardens" logo on her t-shirt. 

This wasn't exactly the life Amy had envisioned for herself. Fresh out of college with a degree in botany, she'd dreamt of researching rare orchids in some exotic rainforest. But reality, as it often did, had other plans. Student loans loomed large, and so she'd reluctantly joined her father's landscaping business, inheriting not only his trusty rusty truck but also the legacy of tending to the lush gardens of Palm Haven Estates, a sprawling retirement community on the edge of the Gulf Coast.

The scent of salt air mingled with the sweet fragrance of jasmine as Amy stepped back to admire her handiwork.  Despite the heat and the occasional grumpy resident who complained about "those blasted hibiscus," there was something satisfying about transforming neglected landscapes into vibrant havens. It wasn't orchids, but it was a start.
