The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the scuffed linoleum floor.  Edgar Montgomery, his grey hair escaping its bun like wispy cobwebs, meticulously swept a stray popcorn kernel into his dustpan. He'd been the night janitor at the Grand Majestic Theatre for nearly twenty years, witnessing countless premieres and standing ovations from behind the velvet curtain. He knew every creak of the wooden stage, every echo in the cavernous auditorium. 

Tonight, however, was different. A stillness hung heavy in the air, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Edgar's mop against the polished floor. The theatre was empty, eerily so. Even the ghosts seemed to have vanished.  A tremor of unease ran down Edgar's spine. He paused, his weathered face etched with concern. Something wasn't right.
