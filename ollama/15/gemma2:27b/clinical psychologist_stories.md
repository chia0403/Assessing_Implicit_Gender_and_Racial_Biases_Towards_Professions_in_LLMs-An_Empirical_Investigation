Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her patient. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn Persian rug, adding to the already heavy atmosphere. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her leather armchair, watched as Liam, a gaunt young man with haunted eyes, picked nervously at the frayed threads of his denim jacket. 

The air hung thick with unspoken anxieties and the faint scent of lavender from Eleanor's diffuser struggled in vain to mask the metallic tang of fear that permeated the room. Outside, thunder roared, a primal echo of Liam’s inner turmoil. He was here because he couldn't sleep, plagued by nightmares that blurred the lines between reality and hallucination.  Eleanor knew she was facing something more than just insomnia – a darkness lurked beneath Liam’s surface, threatening to consume him.
