The sawdust hung heavy in the air, swirling like miniature tornadoes illuminated by the weak morning sun filtering through the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's workshop. The scent of pine mingled with the sharper tang of linseed oil, creating a heady aroma that Elias had inhaled for decades. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slowly coming to life - the clatter of horseshoes on stone, the distant call of a fishmonger, the murmur of conversation carried on the crisp autumn breeze. But inside his workshop, time seemed to stand still, measured only by the rhythmic rasp of Elias' plane against seasoned oak.

Elias, with his salt-and-pepper beard and hands gnarled like ancient roots, was carving a delicate fleur-de-lis into the leg of a table commissioned by Lord Blackwood himself. Each stroke was precise, imbued with years of experience and an almost reverent respect for the wood. Elias believed that every piece held a story within its grain, waiting to be unveiled. Today, the oak spoke of storms weathered and forests ancient, whispering tales of resilience and enduring beauty.
