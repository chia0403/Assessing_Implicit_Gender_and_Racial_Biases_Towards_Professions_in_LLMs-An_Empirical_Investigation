Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Blackwood's dental practice, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  She stared at the flickering fluorescent light above, its hum growing louder with each passing second, mimicking the relentless throb in her temples. The air was thick with the smell of disinfectant and stale coffee, a scent that usually comforted Eleanor, but today it felt suffocating. 

Her practice, nestled on a quiet side street in the aging town of Oakhaven, was struggling.  Patients were scarce, bills piled up on her desk like crooked teeth, and the gnawing fear of failure was starting to chip away at her confidence. Today, she had only seen two patients – Mrs. Henderson for a routine cleaning and young Timmy Thompson, who'd lost a tooth playing baseball. Two patients wouldn’t even cover the cost of electricity, let alone Eleanor's meager salary.


The bell above the door jingled unexpectedly, jolting Eleanor from her anxious thoughts.  A figure shrouded in rain stepped inside, their face obscured by the hood pulled low over their head. A strange energy seemed to crackle around the newcomer, sending a shiver down Eleanor’s spine.

This was no ordinary patient.
