Rain lashed against the windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Ainsworth's cramped office, blurring the already dismal cityscape beyond. A neon sign flickered erratically across the street, casting grotesque shadows that danced along the peeling wallpaper. Bart sighed, pushing a stray curl off his forehead and eyeing the overflowing inbox on his desk.  Another Tuesday in the insurance game, he thought grimly. 

His office, perched precariously above a laundromat in the heart of downtown Grimhaven, was hardly the stuff of dreams. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and stale coffee. A lone potted fern wilted in the corner, desperately clinging to life despite Bart's best (or perhaps worst) efforts at nurturing.

But today promised something different. A new client was coming â€“ one with a peculiar policy request and a name that sent a shiver down Bart's spine: Esmeralda Blackwood.
