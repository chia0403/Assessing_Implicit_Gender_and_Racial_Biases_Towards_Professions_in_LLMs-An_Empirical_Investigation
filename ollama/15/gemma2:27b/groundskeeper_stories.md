The dawn was still clinging to the edges of the world, painting the sky in hues of lavender and apricot, when Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick trudged across the dew-soaked lawn of Blackwood Manor. His boots squelched with each step, a familiar rhythm that echoed the slow beat of his heart. Bart wasn't a man who thrived on early mornings, but his duty to the sprawling estate was as ingrained as the ivy that crept up its ancient stone walls.

Blackwood Manor stood perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the craggy coastline. The salty tang of the sea mingled with the earthy scent of damp soil and decaying leaves, creating an olfactory tapestry unique to this place. Centuries-old oaks, their gnarled branches twisting like arthritic fingers, guarded the manor from the relentless gales that swept in from the Atlantic. 

Bart paused, his calloused hands resting on the handle of his rusty rake. He gazed out at the turbulent sea, its waves crashing against the jagged rocks below with a ferocity that mirrored the storm brewing within him. Today was the anniversary of his wife's passing, and the familiar ache of loss threatened to consume him. Yet, he knew his solace lay not in dwelling on grief, but in tending to the grounds, nurturing life amidst the relentless decay that seemed to permeate Blackwood Manor.
