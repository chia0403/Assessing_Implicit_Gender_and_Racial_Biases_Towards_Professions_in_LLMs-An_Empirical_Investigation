Three years she'd poured her heart into "Wanderlust Travel," curating dream vacations for people who craved adventure. But lately, it seemed everyone preferred the safe haven of their screens, scrolling through curated travel photos instead of actually experiencing the world.

"Welcome to Wanderlust Travel! How can I help you find your next adventure?" she asked, her voice brimming with enthusiasm. The woman lowered her umbrella, revealing tired eyes and a hesitant smile.
