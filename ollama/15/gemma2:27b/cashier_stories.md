The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Bellweather's head, casting an unsettling pallor over the aisles of discount groceries at "Bargain Barn."  The air hung thick with the scent of stale popcorn and artificial watermelon from the nearby candy display, a pungent cocktail that never failed to make her stomach churn.

Elara sighed, adjusting her nametag which perpetually seemed to be crooked. It was 3:17 pm on a Tuesday, the slowest time of day. The only sound besides the hum of the lights was the monotonous beep of the scanner as she rang up a single can of cat food for an elderly woman with a hunched back and weary eyes. Elara longed for something – anything – to break the monotony.  A robbery, maybe. A celebrity sighting. Even a screaming toddler would be preferable to this suffocating stillness.
