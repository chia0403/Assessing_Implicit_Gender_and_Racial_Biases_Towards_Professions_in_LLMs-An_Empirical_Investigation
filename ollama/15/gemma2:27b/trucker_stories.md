The air hung thick and humid, buzzing with cicadas as Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood wrestled his rig into the dusty truck stop.  Neon signs flickered to life as dusk crept over the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched before him like a shimmering mirage. This stretch of I-40, somewhere in the heart of Oklahoma, was Teddy's least favorite part of his route. It meant another long night hauling cattle to Kansas City, the air thick with the musky scent of manure and anxiety.

He killed the engine with a sigh, the silence momentarily deafening after hours on the road. The chrome grill of his Peterbilt gleamed under the dim sodium lights, its paint chipped and faded from years of sun and salt. Teddy climbed out, stretching his stiff limbs and groaning as his back popped. He needed this haul to be over; he was itching for a week off, for fishing on Lake Texoma and cold beer on the porch with his dog, Rusty. 

But first, another night hauling restless steers.
