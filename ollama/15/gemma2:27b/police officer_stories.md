Rain lashed against the grimy windshield, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign at the Lucky Dragon Diner. Detective Evelyn Rose, her face weary but determined under the harsh fluorescent light inside, stirred her lukewarm coffee, the dregs swirling like the storm raging outside.  The diner was a greasy spoon haven for late-night shift workers and insomniacs – not exactly a place you'd expect to find clues in a double homicide, but Evelyn knew better than to underestimate the whispers of a city that never sleeps.

Her partner, the burly, perpetually jovial Detective Michael "Mac" McArthur, slammed his fist down on the table, startling a young couple sharing fries in the booth next to them.

“Damn it, Ev,” Mac grumbled, “another dead end. The bartender claims he didn't see anything. Says they were just regulars, quiet types.”

Evelyn sighed, pushing aside her untouched plate of eggs and bacon.  Something about this case felt off – too neat, too clean.
