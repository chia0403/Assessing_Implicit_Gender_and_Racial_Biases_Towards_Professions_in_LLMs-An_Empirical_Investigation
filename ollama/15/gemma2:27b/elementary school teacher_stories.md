The bell shrilled, echoing through the sun-drenched hallway of Sunnyside Elementary. Emilia Rose Cartwright sighed, pushing back her unruly auburn curls as she stacked the last few graded math tests on her desk. The smell of crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort after a long day of wrangling second graders. Her classroom, adorned with hand-drawn rainbows and alphabet charts, felt strangely empty now that the boisterous laughter had subsided. 

Emilia glanced at the clock – 3:15 pm. Another exhausting but ultimately rewarding day was done. She loved her students fiercely, their boundless energy and unfiltered curiosity a constant source of inspiration. But today, a knot of anxiety twisted in her stomach. The school board meeting loomed tomorrow night, and with it, a decision that could irrevocably change Sunnyside Elementary – and Emilia's life along with it.
