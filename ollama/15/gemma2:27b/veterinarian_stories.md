Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop sounding like a miniature hammer blow. Inside, Dr. Evelyn Moreau squinted through the steam rising from her mug of lukewarm tea, trying to decipher the blurry form huddled in the corner. It was a young boy, maybe ten years old, clutching a limp bundle wrapped in a worn-out patchwork quilt. His face, streaked with grime and tears, was turned away, hiding his features.

Evelyn sighed, setting down her mug. This wasn't unusual for Oakhaven, a forgotten town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains. People here held onto their animals fiercely, sometimes to the point of neglecting their own needs. It was Evelyn's job to bridge that gap, offering care and compassion to both animal and human alike. 

"Hey there," she said gently, her voice warm despite the chill in the air. "Let me have a look at your friend."


The boy hesitated, then slowly unwrapped the quilt, revealing a scrawny ginger cat with matted fur and a glazed-over stare. Evelyn's heart sank. This wasn't just a case of missed meals; the poor creature was critically ill.  

As she knelt beside the boy, her fingers gently brushing against the cat's cold nose, she knew this would be no ordinary night at Oakhaven Animal Clinic.
