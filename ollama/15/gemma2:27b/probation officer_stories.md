Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Albright's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the stacks of files piled precariously on her desk. Each one represented a life teetering on the edge – individuals she was tasked with guiding back from the precipice of crime. But today, Evelyn felt utterly powerless.

She stared at the file open before her: "Marcus DeLeon, Case # 34782."  His mugshot, taken just weeks ago after a petty theft charge, stared back at her – youthful defiance etched into his features. He was barely eighteen, a kid who'd made some bad choices, but whose eyes held a flicker of something lost and yearning. Evelyn knew she should be objective, that Marcus was just another statistic in her unending workload. Yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that he deserved more than the cycle of poverty and crime that seemed to have consumed him.

The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain against glass was broken by a sharp knock at her door. Evelyn straightened, pushing aside the gnawing doubt that threatened to consume her. It was time for her next appointment – another chance to make a difference, however small it might be.
