The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and something faintly metallic - the unmistakable aroma of freshly sharpened scissors.  Priscilla "Pri" Cartwright adjusted her oversized spectacles, peering into the mirror at the reflection staring back. Today wasn't just any day; today was the day Pri Cartwright Hair Design finally opened its doors to the public.

Sunlight streamed through the shop windows onto the polished wooden floorboards, illuminating the vibrant splashes of colour on the walls: hand-painted murals depicting hairstyles from different eras. A lone jazz saxophone wailed softly from a vintage record player nestled in the corner, adding a touch of melancholy elegance to the atmosphere. 


Pri took a deep breath, trying to quell the butterflies fluttering in her stomach. Years of meticulous planning, late nights, and endless DIY projects had culminated in this moment. Would it all be worth it? Would people like her quirky little salon tucked away on the edge of bustling Market Street? Only time would tell.
