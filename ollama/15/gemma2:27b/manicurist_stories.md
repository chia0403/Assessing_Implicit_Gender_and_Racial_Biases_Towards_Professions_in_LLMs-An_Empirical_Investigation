The neon sign buzzed incessantly, casting an unsettling purple glow across Amelia "Mimi" Dubois' tired face. It was almost midnight, and she was still hunched over her workstation, meticulously painting tiny pink roses onto the nails of Mrs. Hemmingsworth, a regular who insisted on having fresh flowers blooming on her hands every week. Mimi sighed inwardly. She loved making people feel beautiful, but sometimes the endless cycle of filing, buffing, and polishing felt like she was trapped in a never-ending loop.

The salon itself was a relic of a bygone era. Tucked away on a quiet side street in New Orleans' historic French Quarter, "Mimi's Mani Magic" boasted faded velvet chairs, walls adorned with dusty oil paintings of exotic birds, and the faint scent of lavender polish lingering in the air. It was cozy, charming even, but Mimi longed for something more, a spark to ignite her passion again.
