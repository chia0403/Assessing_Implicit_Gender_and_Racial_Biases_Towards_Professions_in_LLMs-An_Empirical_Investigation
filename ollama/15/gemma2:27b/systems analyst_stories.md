Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elsie Moreau's tiny office cubicle, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. The insistent drumming mirrored the anxiety tap-tap-tapping of her manicured nails on her desk. Lines of code scrolled endlessly across her triple monitors, a digital waterfall she couldn't seem to stem. A half-eaten bowl of instant ramen sat beside her keyboard, testament to the hours she’d been pouring over this project – Project Chimera, they called it, a top-secret initiative for a shadowy government agency Elsie knew little about.

Elsie, with her sharp cheekbones and eyes that held the glint of a thousand solved problems, wasn't one to back down from a challenge. But this...this felt different. The code was convoluted, riddled with hidden layers and obfuscated functions. It was like trying to decipher a secret language written in shadows.  She knew something was off, but couldn't pinpoint what. A cold prickle of unease ran down her spine. This wasn't just another software bug; it felt like she was staring into the abyss.
