Smoke snaked through the warped rafters like a living creature, its tendrils reaching for Elijah "Eli" Blackwood as he crawled deeper into the inferno. The roar of the flames drowned out everything else – the panicked shouts of onlookers, the hiss of water from his colleagues’ hoses, even the frantic thumping of Eli's own heart against his ribs.

The derelict warehouse on Mill Street was a tinderbox. Decades of accumulated dust and debris had turned it into a monstrous pyre, spitting sparks and molten metal with each gust of wind. The acrid smell of burning wood choked Eli's lungs, stinging his eyes even through the thick mask he wore. But the adrenaline surging through him drowned out any discomfort. He was here for one thing: to find survivors.

He remembered the frantic call from dispatch – reports of squatters living in the building, a family maybe, with children… Eli wouldn’t leave until every last soul was accounted for. His headlamp sliced through the smoke, revealing twisted girders and charred furniture, the remnants of lives abruptly interrupted. He pressed on, his boots crunching on shards of broken glass, the heat intensifying with each step.
