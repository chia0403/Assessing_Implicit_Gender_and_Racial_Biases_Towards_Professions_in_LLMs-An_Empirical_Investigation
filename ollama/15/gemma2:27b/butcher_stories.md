The rhythmic thud of cleaver on bone was the heartbeat of Greymont Butchery. It pulsed through the chilled air, mingling with the scent of rosemary and iron. Bartholomew "Barty" Fitzwilliam, his apron smeared crimson and dusted white, paused in his work, listening. The bell above the shop door jingled, announcing a customer.

Barty wiped his hands on his apron, leaving streaks like a butcher's hieroglyphs, and strode towards the front, a wide, jovial smile splitting his weathered face. He was a man built for this trade: broad-shouldered, with hands calloused and strong enough to wrestle an ox. His eyes, however, held a surprising gentleness, softened by years of serving his community.

Outside, the cobblestone street buzzed with the usual morning activity of Greymont: housewives gossiping over baskets of fruit, children chasing pigeons, and the rhythmic clanging from the blacksmith's forge down the road. But something felt different today. A chill hung in the air, heavier than the autumn mist. Barty couldn't quite place it, but as he swung open the shop door, a sense of unease prickled his skin.

Standing awkwardly on the threshold was a stranger, shrouded in a heavy cloak that concealed their face. Their gloved hands clutched a small, leather-bound satchel tightly. They seemed hesitant to enter, their eyes darting nervously around the street before finally settling on Barty.
