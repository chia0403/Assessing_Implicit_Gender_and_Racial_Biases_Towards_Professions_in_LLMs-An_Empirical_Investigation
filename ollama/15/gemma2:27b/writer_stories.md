Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the warped glass. Emilia Rosalind Hawthorne, her fingers stained with ink and frustration, glared at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen. The words refused to come, tangled in a knot of self-doubt and the incessant drumming of the rain.

Her attic studio, crammed with dusty bookshelves and overflowing notebooks, felt oppressive tonight. The musty scent of aging paper mingled with the dampness seeping through the cracks in the roof, creating an atmosphere more suited for gothic horror than her intended romantic comedy. Outside, thunder rumbled like a grumpy god, mirroring Emilia's own tempestuous mood.

She needed inspiration, something to spark the sluggish fire of her imagination. But tonight, even the usually comforting sight of rain seemed to mock her creative block. With a sigh, Emilia pushed away from her desk and padded across the worn wooden floor towards the window.  

The view was obscured by the sheets of water cascading down the glass, but she could just make out the gnarled branches of the ancient oak tree in her neighbor's yard swaying violently in the wind. A flash of lightning illuminated the scene for a fleeting moment, revealing a figure huddled beneath the tree, seemingly unfazed by the storm's fury.  

Curiosity piqued, Emilia strained to see better. The figure was cloaked in darkness, their features hidden from view. Who would be out in this weather? And what were they doing under that old oak?
