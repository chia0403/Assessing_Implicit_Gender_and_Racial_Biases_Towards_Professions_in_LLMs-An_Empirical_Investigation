Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety in her chest. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the cluttered desk before her – overflowing inboxes, dog-eared college brochures, and a half-eaten bag of gummy bears that bore witness to many late nights spent poring over transcripts and scholarship applications.  

Eloise, a woman whose empathy was as boundless as her patience, sighed. This wasn't how she envisioned her morning unfolding. Instead of the usual gentle hum of student chatter and the reassuring scent of stale coffee wafting from the breakroom, the air hung heavy with a palpable dread. Today was "Future Friday," the day seniors revealed their college acceptance (or rejection) letters – a ritual Eloise had always found bittersweet.

But today felt different. A storm seemed to be brewing, not just outside, but within the hallowed halls of Northwood High School. Whispers of an unsettling rumor had been circulating for weeks, a secret that threatened to unravel the carefully woven tapestry of dreams and aspirations she'd painstakingly helped her students build.
