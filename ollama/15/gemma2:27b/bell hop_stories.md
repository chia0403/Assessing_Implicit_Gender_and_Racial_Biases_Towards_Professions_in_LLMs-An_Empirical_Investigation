The grand oak doors of the Grand Astoria Hotel swung open with an exhausted groan, mirroring Silas Bartholomew Butterfield III's own weary sigh. The humid Charleston air slapped him in the face like a wet fish as he wrestled a steamer trunk the size of a small car through the entrance. Tourists, sticky with sweat and buzzing with anticipation, surged past him, their eyes wide with the promise of cobblestone streets and antebellum charm. Silas, however, saw only dust bunnies gathering under velvet ropes and the faint scent of mildew lurking in the ornate hallways.

For six years, he'd been a bellhop at the Grand Astoria, his starched uniform a daily reminder of a life he hadn't chosen but couldn't escape. His father, Silas Bartholomew Butterfield Jr., had instilled in him the belief that serving the wealthy was an honorable calling, a stepping stone to something grander. Yet, all Silas felt were aching shoulders and the dull ache of unfulfilled dreams. 


Today, however, promised to be different. A new guest, arriving on the afternoon train, held whispers of intrigue â€“ a reclusive millionaire rumored to be searching for a lost family heirloom hidden somewhere in Charleston's tangled history. Silas, with his nose always buried in dusty local lore and forgotten tales, felt a spark ignite within him. Maybe this time, serving wouldn't just mean hauling luggage; maybe it would mean unearthing a mystery, rewriting his own story along the way.
