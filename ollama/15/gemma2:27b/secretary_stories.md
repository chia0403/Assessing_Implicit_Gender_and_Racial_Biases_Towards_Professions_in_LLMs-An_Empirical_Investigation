The rhythmic click-clack of Elara Beatrice Finch's typewriter filled the otherwise silent office. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Blackwood & Sons, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. Dust motes danced in the pale shaft of sunlight that pierced through a gap in the heavy velvet curtains, illuminating the worn mahogany desk where Elara sat hunched over her work.  

The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco, a constant reminder of Mr. Blackwood's presence, even though he was rarely seen these days. His office door, always closed, remained a tantalizing mystery to Elara. She knew little of the man she worked for, only that he dealt in "matters of discretion" and commanded a healthy respect (mixed with fear) from everyone who crossed his path.

Today, however, a different kind of tension crackled in the air. A telegram had arrived that morning, its crisp edges stark against the faded floral wallpaper. It was addressed to Mr. Blackwood in bold, urgent letters, and Elara couldn't help but feel a shiver of apprehension as she delivered it to his closed door.
