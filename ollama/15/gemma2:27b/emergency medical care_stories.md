Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into halos of shimmering gold.  The siren's wail pierced the night, its urgency echoing Emilia Rose Hawthorne's own pounding heart. She gripped the gurney railing, her knuckles white against the cold metal. Inside the back, a young boy whimpered, clutching his chest, his face pale and slick with sweat.

Emilia had been an EMT for five years, seen enough trauma to fill lifetimes, but this case was different. The boy's terror resonated deep within her, triggering a fierce protectiveness she couldn't explain. She met his wide, frightened eyes in the rearview mirror and offered a reassuring smile. "We're almost there," she promised, her voice calm and steady despite the adrenaline surging through her veins.


The city, normally a vibrant tapestry of light and sound, was now cloaked in an oppressive darkness punctuated by the rhythmic whooshing of wipers and the incessant drone of the siren. The rain seemed to amplify every sound, turning even the faintest rustle into a deafening roar. Emilia knew they were racing against time.
