The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic. Situated on a quiet side street in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina, the building was a charming Victorian with peeling paint and a wraparound porch that groaned under the weight of ancient wicker furniture. Inside, the scent of lavender liniment mingled with the faint aroma of damp plaster, creating an oddly comforting atmosphere. Elias himself sat hunched over his cluttered desk, his brow furrowed in concentration as he scrutinized an X-ray. 

The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence, each click a reminder of the approaching deadline â€“ the annual Charleston Chiropractic Convention. This year's event held particular significance for Elias. He was scheduled to present his groundbreaking research on spinal manipulation and chronic pain, a culmination of years of tireless work.  But as he stared at the X-ray, doubt gnawed at him. Something wasn't right.
