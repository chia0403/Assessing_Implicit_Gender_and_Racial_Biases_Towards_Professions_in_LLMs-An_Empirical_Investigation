Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through Amelia Finch's bones. The smell of wet hay mingled with the earthy scent of anxious animals, a familiar comfort even in this storm's fury.

Amelia crouched beside Daisy, a spindly greyhound rescued from a racing track, her ribs still visible beneath thin fur. The dog trembled, her nose pressed against Amelia's hand, seeking solace. "It's alright, girl," Amelia murmured, stroking the soft velvet of Daisy's ear. "Just a bit of wind and rain. We're safe here."

This was Amelia Finch's world - the ramshackle barn on the edge of Willow Creek, home to a menagerie of rescued animals: misfits, strays, and those deemed unwanted by others.  Each creature had its own story, etched in weary eyes or hesitant movements, and Amelia was their sanctuary. But tonight, with the storm raging outside and a gnawing emptiness in her own stomach, Amelia felt the weight of responsibility pressing down harder than usual.

The vet bill for Buttercup, the orphaned calf, was due tomorrow. And while Amelia poured every ounce of her love and skill into caring for these creatures, she knew that love couldn't always pay the bills.
