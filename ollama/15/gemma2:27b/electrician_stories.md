The flickering fluorescent light above Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's workbench buzzed incessantly, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space.  Grease stains adorned her faded blue overalls, testament to years spent wrestling with stubborn wiring and ancient circuits. Outside, the July sun beat down on the corrugated tin roof of her workshop, turning the air inside into a sauna. A bead of sweat trickled down Amy's temple as she meticulously soldered a loose connection on a vintage radio, the smell of molten solder filling the air. 

Her phone buzzed on the workbench, momentarily jolting her from her focused trance. Glancing at the screen, she saw it was Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman who lived in the rambling Victorian mansion overlooking the town square.  Amy sighed, knowing what this call would be about. The old house had a mind of its own, its wiring as erratic and unpredictable as Mrs. Henderson's memory. "Hang in there, Amy," she muttered to herself, grabbing her tool bag and bracing for another adventure in the labyrinthine electrical system of the Henderson mansion.
