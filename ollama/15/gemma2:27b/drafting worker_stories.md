Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the drafting office, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst against the grime.  The rhythmic drumming echoed the incessant clicking of Elias Blackwood's mechanical pencil as it danced across the vellum sheet before him. The air hung thick with the scent of graphite and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional acrid whiff of burnt solder from the workshop next door.

Elias, a man whose stoic features seemed perpetually etched in lines of concentration, barely registered the storm raging outside.  His world was confined to the gridded surface before him, where lines and curves coalesced into the skeletal framework of a new airship. He squinted through his spectacles, measuring angles with a practiced eye, his brow furrowing slightly as he contemplated the optimal placement of a strut. Every detail mattered in this intricate dance of engineering; a single millimeter misplaced could mean disaster.
