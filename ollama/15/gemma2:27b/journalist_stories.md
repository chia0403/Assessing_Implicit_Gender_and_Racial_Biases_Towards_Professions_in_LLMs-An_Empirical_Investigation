Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Inkwell, a dive bar nestled in the shadow of the crumbling Clock Tower Bridge. Amelia “Amy” Sinclair, her trench coat dripping onto the worn linoleum floor, grimaced as she pushed through the swinging doors. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of stale beer, a familiar comfort in her line of work.  The Inkwell was a haven for down-on-their-luck types, whispered rumors, and often, Amy’s leads. 

Tonight, though, she wasn't here for gossip. A crumpled note tucked inside her pocket burned a hole through the cheap fabric. "Meet me at The Inkwell, midnight sharp. You won't want to miss this."  It was signed simply "M."

Amy took a seat at the sticky bar, scanning the dimly lit room. Who was M? And what story could be so explosive it warranted a clandestine meeting in a place like this? Her journalistic instincts buzzed with anticipation and a healthy dose of trepidation.  She ordered a whiskey neat, knowing she'd need something strong to brace herself for whatever truth lurked behind the cryptic message.
