Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Chez Marcel," the rhythmic drumming punctuated by the occasional clatter of a loose shutter. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions, garlic, and desperation.  Marcel Antoine Dubois, his brow furrowed beneath a toque askew, stared into the depths of a near-empty stockpot. The restaurant was booked solid for the evening – Valentine's Day, no less – and Marcel had just discovered his prized veal demi-glace, lovingly simmered for hours, had inexplicably gone missing. 

Panic clawed at his throat. Without the demi-glace, his signature dish, "Coeur de Veau en Romance" – a delicate veal heart braised in red wine and the aforementioned sauce – would be impossible to create. It was a masterpiece, the dish that had earned Chez Marcel its single Michelin star, and tonight it needed to sing.
