The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s calloused hands as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Sweat stung his eyes, but he didn't dare stop.  He had a deadline to meet – Lord Ashworth’s new mausoleum wouldn’t build itself. Around him, the air buzzed with the rhythmic clang of hammers against chisel and the rasping groans of stone grinding against stone. This was Elias' world, the familiar symphony of his trade echoing through the dusty yard of Thorne & Sons Stone Masonry.

Elias wasn't just chipping away at granite; he was carving a legacy. His father had taught him the secrets of the stone, how to coax beauty from its rugged heart. Now, with his father gone, Elias carried on the family tradition, his hands shaping not only stones but also the memories they would hold.  

But today, something felt different. A shiver ran down Elias' spine despite the heat. He paused, setting down his chisel and staring at the half-formed angel he was carving for the mausoleum's entrance. Its wings were meant to be majestic, soaring towards heaven, but now they seemed heavy, burdened. 

Elias shook off the unsettling feeling, blaming it on fatigue. He picked up his chisel again, the cool metal reassuring in his hand. Yet, the unease lingered, a premonition whispering in the back of his mind. Something was about to change.
