Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, blurring the glittering cityscape into an impressionist painting.  Eleanor, her silver-blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun, stared out at the storm, her reflection superimposed over the city lights. Exhaustion etched lines around her sapphire blue eyes; forty hours on call had left her feeling frayed. 

The rhythmic beeping of her pager snapped her attention back to reality.  She sighed, already knowing what it meant – another emergency surgery. The relentless demands of her job as a cardiothoracic surgeon at Mercy General Hospital were a constant pressure, but Eleanor wouldn't have it any other way. Saving lives was in her blood, a legacy inherited from her grandfather, a renowned heart surgeon who had instilled in her a fierce dedication to the art and science of mending broken hearts.
