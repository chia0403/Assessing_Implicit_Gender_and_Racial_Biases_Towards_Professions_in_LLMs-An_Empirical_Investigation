The sun, a molten fist clenched against the horizon, was just beginning to bleed crimson into the sky when Silas Blackwood trudged out of his farmhouse. Dew clung to the overgrown grass like diamonds, catching the faint light and reflecting it back in a thousand glittering shards. A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, its call sharp and insistent against the lingering stillness of the pre-dawn hours. Silas, weathered face etched with lines as deep as the furrows he plowed, squinted at the sky. Rain was coming. He could smell it on the wind, earthy and thick, promising a deluge that would soak his fields and delay his harvest.  

He sighed, pulling his worn cap further down over his brow. This season had been a hard one, plagued by blight and unseasonal storms. Silas was used to hardship; he'd spent his whole life wrestling the land into submission. But this year felt different, heavier somehow. A gnawing worry pulsed in his chest, a fear that whispered of lean times and empty plates. He needed this harvest.  He needed it badly. 

As he walked towards the barn, its weathered wood groaning under the weight of years, Silas couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a premonition of something both terrifying and exhilarating on the horizon.
