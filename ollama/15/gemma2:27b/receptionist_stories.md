The flickering neon sign outside buzzed like an agitated hornet, casting Amelia Thistlewick's face in alternating washes of sickly green and sickly yellow. It read "Grand Blackwood Hotel" in faded cursive, the "Grand" looking more like "Gran" thanks to a missing bulb. 

Amelia sighed, idly drumming her manicured nails on the ancient oak desk that served as her reception station. The lobby of the Grand Blackwood was a symphony of faded grandeur; threadbare velvet armchairs huddled around a dusty grand piano, its ivory keys cracked and yellowed. A once-ornate chandelier hung precariously from the ceiling, its bulbs casting anemic shadows across the worn Persian rug. Dust motes danced in the shafts of late afternoon sunlight that pierced through the grime-coated windows.

It was hardly the glamorous five-star establishment Amelia had dreamed of working in when she'd first graduated with her hospitality degree. But after months of fruitless job hunting, she'd accepted this position as a receptionist at the Grand Blackwood â€“ a relic from a bygone era clinging desperately to its past glory.

The bell above the entrance chimed, announcing the arrival of a guest. Amelia straightened her posture, plastering on a smile as practiced as it was strained. "Welcome to the Grand Blackwood," she chirped, bracing herself for whatever eccentric character might step through the doorway.
