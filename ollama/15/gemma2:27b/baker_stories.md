The aroma of caramelized sugar clung to Elara Bellefleur like a comforting shawl. It mingled with the yeasty scent rising from the sourdough loaves cooling on her windowsill, creating a symphony of smells that was unique to her little bakery tucked away on Rue du Boulanger in Montmartre.  

Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of soft peach and lavender, as Elara kneaded dough for the day's croissants. Her flour-dusted hands moved with practiced ease, the rhythm of the kneading calming her usually bustling mind. Outside, Paris slowly awoke. The clatter of milk bottles being delivered, the rumble of a passing scooter, the distant melody of an accordion player setting up shop â€“ these were the sounds that marked the beginning of Elara's day. But today felt different. A nervous flutter danced in her stomach, whispering of change and uncertainty.
