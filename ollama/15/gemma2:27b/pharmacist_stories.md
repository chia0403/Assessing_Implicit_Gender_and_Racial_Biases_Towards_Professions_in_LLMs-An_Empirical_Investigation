Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Elmwood Pharmacy, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Cartwright. Her normally meticulously organized shelves were a disaster zone â€“ vials tumbled precariously, boxes lay open spilling their contents, and crumpled prescription slips littered the counter.  

Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its usually neat bun, chewed on the end of a pen, frustration etching lines onto her already weary face. It was almost midnight and she should have been home hours ago, curled up with a good book and a steaming cup of chamomile tea. Instead, she was wrestling with a baffling prescription, one that seemed to defy logic and all known pharmaceutical practices.  

The Elmwood Pharmacy, nestled in the heart of a quiet, aging suburb, was Amelia's sanctuary. Its faded green awning and warm, inviting interior had always been a beacon of comfort for the local community. But tonight, it felt more like a prison cell than a place of healing.
