The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic.  Amelia Rose Cartwright adjusted her straw hat, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped its braid. Sweat prickled on her forehead despite the early hour. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of rose and lavender as she surveyed her group.

Ten pairs of wide eyes stared back at her, a mixture of excitement and apprehension etched on their faces.  They were gathered on the edge of the ancient Mayan ruins of Tikal, Guatemala â€“ a sprawling labyrinth of temples, palaces, and pyramids swallowed by the emerald embrace of the jungle. Amelia took a deep breath, letting the energy of this sacred place fill her lungs. 

"Welcome," she announced, her voice clear and resonant, cutting through the morning stillness. "To Tikal, one of the most important archaeological sites in the Americas. Today, we will walk in the footsteps of kings, explore the mysteries of a lost civilization, and perhaps even glimpse the echoes of their ancient whispers."
