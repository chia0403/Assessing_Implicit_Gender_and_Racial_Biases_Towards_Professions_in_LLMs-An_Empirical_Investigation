The polished marble floor reflected the chandelier's glow in distorted shards, mimicking a fractured sky. Outside, Paris pulsed with the rhythm of late summer - scooters zipped past cafe terraces overflowing with laughter, the Seine shimmered under a bruised sunset, and the scent of roasting chestnuts drifted through the air, a heady perfume mingled with exhaust fumes.

Inside the opulent lobby of the Hôtel de la Lune, however, silence reigned. Only the soft tick of an antique clock punctuated the stillness, its mahogany case gleaming beneath a pool of golden light.  Elodie Moreau, her immaculately coiffed auburn hair mirroring the gleam of the chandelier, stood behind the grand oak desk, her posture as poised as a queen's. Her crisp white uniform, impeccably starched, accentuated her petite frame and sharp green eyes that missed nothing.

A shiver ran down Elodie's spine, despite the warmth radiating from the fireplace across the room. Something felt amiss tonight. The usual hum of anticipation – guests arriving for dinner at the Michelin-starred restaurant, couples returning from a romantic stroll along the Seine – was absent. The silence was unnerving, pregnant with unspoken tension.

Then, the elevator doors pinged open, breaking the spell. A lone figure stepped out, his silhouette shrouded in shadow. Elodie straightened, her hand instinctively reaching for the polished silver bell on her desk. This guest was unlike any she'd seen before.
