Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle glistened like polished onyx, reflecting the faint glow of the city's skyscrapers as they pierced the grey sky. Inside the drab beige walls of Smith & Co., a small firm specializing in financial consulting, receptionist Alexandra Paige Thompson sat hunched over her desk, her fingers flying across the keyboard with practiced ease.

Alexandra had spent the better part of five years navigating the mundane rhythms of this office, greeting clients and answering phones, her mind often wandering to the more exciting, if not always successful, ventures she'd undertaken in her free time. Despite the humdrum nature of her work, Alexandra found a quiet satisfaction in being the glue that held Smith & Co.'s operations together – until today.

As she typed out a routine response to an inquiry from a potential new client, Alexandra's gaze drifted toward the clock on the wall, its steady tick-tock a reminder that she had exactly 17 minutes and 23 seconds before her shift ended for the day. It was just enough time to grab a cup of coffee from the break room before heading home – but little did she know, this ordinary evening would soon become anything but.
