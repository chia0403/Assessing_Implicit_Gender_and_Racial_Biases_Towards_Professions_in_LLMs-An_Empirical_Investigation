Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of Interstate 40, casting a golden glow over the endless stretch of asphalt that stretched out before Highway Worker Edgar Allen "Hawk" Wilson like a shimmering snake through the desert. Hawk stood atop his trusty cherry picker, surveying the scene below as he sipped on a cold can of Mountain Dew, the sweet taste of which was all that could momentarily distract him from the grueling heat and humidity that had been plaguing the southern states for weeks.

As he scanned the horizon, Hawk's trained eye picked out the telltale signs of an impending storm - dark clouds gathering on the horizon, a faint scent of ozone in the air. He knew that if the storm hit too close to the roadwork site, it could spell disaster for the crew he was overseeing today. The highway was scheduled for repaving, and Hawk had been tasked with ensuring that the asphalt was laid down correctly, but the thought of dealing with treacherous weather conditions made his stomach turn.

"Alright, boys, let's get to work," Hawk bellowed into the comms device on his wrist, his voice carrying across the desert landscape. "We've got a lot of ground to cover before this storm hits."

The crew sprang into action, their movements swift and efficient as they began to set up the equipment for the paving operation. Hawk climbed down from the cherry picker and joined them, his boots kicking up clouds of dust as he made his way towards the first section of road.

But as he looked out across the landscape, Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that had been growing in the pit of his stomach all day. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew that when the storm hit, it wouldn't be just the weather that would be testing him...
