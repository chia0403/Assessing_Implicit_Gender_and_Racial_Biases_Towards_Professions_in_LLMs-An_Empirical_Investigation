Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was slowly rising over the rolling hills of Willow Creek Farm, casting a warm golden light over the fields of wheat and corn that stretched out as far as the eye could see. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and new life.

In a small farmhouse at the edge of the farm, Ember Rose Thorne stirred in her bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She lived with her parents, Jasper and Maeve, who had inherited Willow Creek Farm from their own parents when they were young. The land was in good health, thanks to Ember's hard work and dedication.

As she swung her legs over the side of the bed, her foot knocked against a small note on the floor. It was a piece of paper with a few scribbled words: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone." The handwriting looked like it belonged to someone she knew, but Ember had no idea who could have written such a mysterious message.

She stood up, feeling a shiver run down her spine. She had always been curious about the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of Willow Creek Farm, and this message seemed like it might be the key to unlocking one of those secrets. But what did it want from her?
