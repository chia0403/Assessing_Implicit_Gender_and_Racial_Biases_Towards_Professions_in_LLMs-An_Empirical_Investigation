Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain poured down on the crumbling brick streets of Ashwood, casting a gloomy shadow over the once-thriving industrial town. In a small, cluttered office above his plumbing shop, Emilia "Mia" Thompson peered out at the downpour through the grimy window, her eyes squinting against the relentless drizzle.

As she sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee, Mia's mind wandered to the mysterious phone call she'd received earlier that morning. The gruff voice on the other end had claimed it was an old job, one from before she'd joined the family business - her father's plumbing shop, which had been a staple in Ashwood for decades. The caller had hinted at a hidden vault beneath the old factory on the outskirts of town, and the payment would be substantial.

Mia raised an eyebrow as she pondered the offer. She was no amateur treasure hunter, but the prospect of finally taking a break from the usual leaky faucets and clogged drains to dig up something big was too enticing to resist.

Just then, her father, Jack Thompson, poked his head into the office. "Mia, I need you to take a look at that busted pipe in the Wilson's place on Elm Street."

Mia sighed, setting her coffee aside as she stood up, ready to trade her dreams of buried treasure for the humdrum routine of fixing leaky toilets.

But little did she know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would lead her into the unknown - and potentially change the course of her life forever.
