The rain-soaked streets of downtown Manchester seemed to stretch out like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy pallor over the city. It was a fitting backdrop for the miserable job that Probation Officer Emily Julia Taylor trudged through every day.

As a child, she'd spent hours listening to her social worker mother regale her with tales of the city's most hardened offenders, their stories of poverty, addiction, and despair seared into Emily's psyche like scars.

But today, as she gazed into Ryan's desperate eyes, something in her gut told her that this was different. That this was the moment when everything would change.
