Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the Golden Anchor Hotel cast a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. Inside, the lobby was a warm oasis, filled with the sound of jazz drifting from the bar and the soft murmur of hushed conversations. Amidst the hustle and bustle, a lone figure stood out - Elara Louise Baptiste, a bell hop with a weary smile and eyes that seemed to hold a thousand stories.

Elara had been working at the Golden Anchor for five years, ever since she'd left her small town in Louisiana to chase dreams of adventure. She'd seen it all from her perch behind the front desk - the wedding parties, the bachelor bachelors, the screaming children and crying adults. But tonight was different. Tonight, Elara had a feeling that something was off.

As she collected the keys to the guest rooms with a practiced efficiency, Elara's gaze drifted out into the rain-soaked night, her eyes locking onto a figure standing under the awning of the hotel entrance - a tall, dark-haired man with piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into her very soul.
