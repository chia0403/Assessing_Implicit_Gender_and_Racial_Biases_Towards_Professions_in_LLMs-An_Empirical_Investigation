Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the crisp morning air, gazing up at the imposing structure that loomed before her. The Oakwood Rehabilitation Center was a behemoth of a building, its stone façade bearing the weight of countless patients' recoveries and triumphs. As a physical therapist with a specialization in orthopedic rehabilitation, Lexi had spent countless hours within these walls, coaxing her clients back to the activities they loved.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the familiar mix of excitement and trepidation that always accompanied a new day at the clinic. She had just returned to Oakwood after a six-month sabbatical in New Zealand, where she had spent her days hiking through the fjords and recharging her own batteries. But as much as she loved the solitude, Lexi knew she couldn't stay away from her patients forever. And besides, there was something about this place – the camaraderie among the staff, the quiet dedication of the physical therapists – that felt like home.

As she made her way towards the entrance, Lexi's eyes scanned the bustling hallway, taking in the familiar chaos of beeping machines and chatty patients. The waiting room was filled with the sound of murmured conversations and the occasional burst of laughter, while the adjacent hallway was a hive of activity as therapists and nurses rushed to and fro, attending to their respective patients. It was just another typical morning at Oakwood Rehabilitation Center – but for Lexi, there was something about this particular day that felt different.
