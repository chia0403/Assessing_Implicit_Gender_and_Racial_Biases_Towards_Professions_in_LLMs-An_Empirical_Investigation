Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the pier, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist. It was a typical morning in late November, with only a few stragglers venturing out onto the streets before the rain started.

Inside the law office on Main Street, Emily Alexandra Wellesley sat at her desk, staring blankly at the stack of files in front of her. She was a partner at the firm of Wellesley and Associates, specializing in environmental law and having a particular interest in cases involving coastal development. It was a field that had drawn her to Ravenswood ten years ago, when she first started working for the town's planning department.

As she sifted through the latest batch of documents from the state's office of natural resources, Emily's mind began to wander back to the conversation she'd had with her colleague, Jack, earlier that morning. They were working on a new case involving a proposed development project on the outskirts of town, one that threatened to destroy the last remaining habitat of a critically endangered species of seabird.

Emily's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her assistant, Sarah, knocking on the doorframe. "Emily, I have some bad news," Sarah said, looking anxious. "The state office just called again, and they're threatening to deny our permit application unless we can agree to certain... modifications."

Emily's eyes narrowed as she set down her pen. She had a feeling that this was more than just a routine request for concessions. There was something fishy about it, and she was determined to find out what.
