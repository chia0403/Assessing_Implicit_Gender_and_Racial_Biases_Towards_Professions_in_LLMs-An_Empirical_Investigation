Here's a story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights of the hospital's blood bank hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow over the rows of refrigerated shelves lined with bags of donated plasma and whole blood. Phlebotomist Emily Rose Wilson scrubbed in beside her coworker, Rachel, as they prepared for another long shift at St. Michael's Hospital. It was a typical Monday morning at the hospital, with patients streaming in from all corners of the city seeking medical attention.

Emily, a petite woman with short brown hair and hazel eyes, had spent countless hours studying for her phlebotomy certification and working her way up the ranks at the hospital. She took pride in her work, carefully collecting blood samples that would help diagnose and treat diseases across the region. As she reviewed the day's schedule with Rachel, a sense of unease began to creep over her.

"Rachel, have you seen the latest numbers from the OMB?" Emily asked, frowning as she glanced at the screen on her computer.

"What does it say?" Rachel replied, peering over Emily's shoulder.

"It looks like our blood bank is running low. Again," Emily said, her brow furrowing in concern. "If we don't get more donations soon, I'm not sure how we'll keep up with demand."

Little did Emily know, this would be the start of a journey that would test her skills as a phlebotomist and push her to confront the darkest secrets beneath the surface of St. Michael's Hospital.
