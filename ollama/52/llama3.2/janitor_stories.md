Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glow over the worn linoleum floor, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the faint breeze from the air vents. It was 4:45 AM on a chilly winter morning, and the only sound came from the distant hum of the hospital's generators and the soft beeping of monitors in the rooms beyond.

This was the domain of Emily Mayfield, janitor extraordinaire at St. Michael's Hospital. She had spent years perfecting her craft, developing an eye for detail that allowed her to scrub away even the most stubborn stains from the floors. Her hands were stained with a mix of disinfectant and dirt, but she didn't mind - it was a badge of honor, proof that she'd done her job right.

As she pushed her cart through the deserted corridors, Emily's eyes scanned the rows of empty rooms, taking stock of the day ahead. She knew every nook and cranny of this hospital, every hidden corner and secret spot where a lost medical chart might be tucked away. And yet, despite her familiarity with these halls, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was a hunch, a whisper in the back of her mind that she couldn't quite ignore.

And as she stopped to wipe down the counter in room 304, Emily caught sight of a piece of paper on the floor - crumpled and torn, but with a single sentence scrawled across it in hasty handwriting: "They're not what they seem."
