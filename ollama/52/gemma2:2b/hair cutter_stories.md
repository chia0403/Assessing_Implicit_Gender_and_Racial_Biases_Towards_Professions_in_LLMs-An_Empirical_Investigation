Rain hammered against the windowpanes, turning the street outside into a blurry impressionist landscape of charcoal grey and water-slicked neon orange.

This was the world of Edgar Blackwood, otherwise known by his regulars as "Ed" and "Mr. Ed."  He spent most days lost in a whirlwind of clippers and scissors, patiently transforming unruly locks into works of art on his clients' heads. It wasn't easy, not with the city's relentless rhythm pushing at him from all sides, but Edgar knew this was where he belonged, where the rhythmic hum of the trimmer matched the steady beat of his heart.  He had spent years perfecting the art of precision cutting in this cramped corner shop, a haven for lost souls seeking a little solace and a good barber's touch. He was their confidante, their therapist, and their stylist all rolled into one.
