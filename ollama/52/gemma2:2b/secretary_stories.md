Rain hammered against the skylight in Amelia "Amy" Lancaster's office, blurring the neon glow of the city lights onto the mahogany desk like an Impressionist masterpiece gone wrong.  The scent of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amy like a childhood blanket - familiar yet somehow off-putting.  Her worn cardigan, its sheepskin fur barely clinging to life, felt itchy against her skin as she stared out onto the torrent outside. 

It was a Tuesday, a day meant for spreadsheets and phone calls, but today, the storm outside mirrored the unrest in Amy's soul. Her boss, Mr. Thorne, had called it "disruptive" - a rather passive term that, in Amy's opinion, did little to capture the raw energy of his rage. He'd been in a bad mood all day, and the usual quiet click of his heels against the polished tiles echoed with the growing tension like a metronome counting down the seconds until it struck. 

Amy had witnessed too many such Tuesdays - each one bringing a new wave of Mr. Thorne's fury, culminating in that familiar "apology" where he'd say something vague about needing to work through his emotions and then disappear into his office for hours. This time, though, something felt different.  A sense of urgency prickled at the back of her neck like a stray cat's fur.
