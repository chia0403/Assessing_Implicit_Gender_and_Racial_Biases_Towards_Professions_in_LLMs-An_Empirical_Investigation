## Setting: The Shadow of Justice

**Setting:** A decaying Victorian manor nestled deep in the coastal fogs of Cornwall, England. Rain lashed against the stone walls like angry fists, each drop exploding on the windowpanes with a watery hiss. Inside, the once-opulent Grand Hall now echoed with the whispers of forgotten grandeur. Dust motes danced in the feeble light filtering through grimy skylights, illuminating cobwebs strung like macabre curtains from the ornate ceiling. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of aged wood and damp earth, a lingering sense of time lost. 

**Main Character:** Judge Eleanor "Nell" Ashworth. A towering woman with piercing grey eyes that seemed to see right through people's facades, her imposing presence commanded respect like a storm. Her silver hair was always perfectly coiffed, the only hint of age in a face otherwise etched with years of justice served.  Her courtroom wasn't a sanctuary, but a battlefield where she battled for the voiceless, wielding words as weapons and logic as armor against the tide of corruption.

**Story Opening:** 

"It seems we have another case of blatant disregard for the law, your Honor," the young solicitor's voice echoed across the silent hall.  His eyes nervously darted towards Nell, a stark contrast to the stoicism she wielded with such effortless grace. "The evidence, as clear as day, points towards..." he paused, unable to articulate the sheer absurdity of it all.  Nell leaned back in her chair, a silent storm brewing behind her closed eyelids. The silence echoed the storm outside, each gust of wind carrying an unspoken threat.

"And what is this evidence, young Thomas?" Nellâ€™s voice was steady, devoid of the emotion that simmered beneath the surface. "Tell me, where are we hiding from the truth in this manor?"
