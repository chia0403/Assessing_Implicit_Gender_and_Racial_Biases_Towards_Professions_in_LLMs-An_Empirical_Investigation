The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  It clung to Elias Thorne's worn leather jacket like a second skin as he surveyed his domain: the sprawling wilderness of Blackwood Creek. The sun, already dipping towards the horizon, cast long, wavering shadows through the towering redwoods, each tree holding secrets whispered from generations past.  Elias, known by everyone simply as "Eli," was one with the forest â€“ or at least, he tried to be.

He'd learned its rhythms, understood its whispers on the wind, felt the sting of a falling branch, and the warmth of a sun-soaked day through his worn hands.  But lately, a growing unease settled within him. The silence of the forest was punctuated by an unfamiliar tension, like a predator stalking his prey from the shadows.  It wasn't just the dwindling supply of timber. It was in the way the birds chirped differently, in the subtle shifts of the trees, and in the strange, unsettling stillness that seemed to permeate even the most boisterous storms.
