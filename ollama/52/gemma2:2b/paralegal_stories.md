Rain lashed against the windows of Evelyn Thorne's cramped office, each drop like a tiny hammer on the glass. She squinted at the screen, a sea of legal jargon threatening to swallow her whole as she meticulously reviewed the latest draft of her boss's plea agreement.  It was for a case that had already eaten away at her sanity - a corporate conspiracy that stretched back decades and involved something called "The Obsidian Ring," a network so deep-rooted it defied description, let alone any semblance of justice. Evelyn, however, was just another cog in the machine of legal proceedings, diligently plugging away with a quiet desperation that she masked with sardonic humour.  

She glanced out the window again. The downpour seemed to mirror the storm brewing inside her as she struggled with the seemingly insurmountable details - each one more intricate and baffling than the last. Evelyn's life had become one long legal marathon, a relentless pursuit of justice in an increasingly unjust world. It was a path that, like the rain outside, often felt cold and unforgiving, leaving behind only a faint echo of hope.

**Main Character:** Evelyn Thorne, a paralegal who has a sharp wit and an even sharper intellect, but hides her vulnerability beneath a veneer of cynicism and dry humor.
