The air was thick with salt and the promise of rain as Earl "Earp" Montgomery ushered his latest guest from the taxi. The Grand Pacific Hotel loomed in the distance, its Art Deco façade shimmering under the setting sun like a beacon on an endless horizon.  Its ornate balconies cast long, playful shadows against the asphalt streets below. Earp held the door open for Mrs. Eleanor Sterling, a stern-faced woman whose eyes were as hard as polished marble and as sharp as the needle she habitually tapped impatiently on her purse strap. 

“Rooms are ready,” Earp's voice, low and smooth like melted butter, was barely audible over the roar of passing cars. "Anything else you need, ma’am?” He smiled a practiced smile that hid a lifetime of knowing the city’s underbelly better than any map.  Mrs. Sterling simply glanced at him over her thick glasses, eyes unyielding as she held a crumpled photograph in her hand. A single tear traced down her cheek, leaving a glistening path on the crisp white paper.

Earp was used to seeing this kind of sorrow. The Grand Pacific was his domain, its grand halls echoing with tales of love and loss, joy and betrayal. He’d seen it all, from honeymooners' stolen glances behind potted palms to lovers arguing over the last slice of pie at midnight. Now, he knew Mrs. Sterling’s story was a new one, one that even the grand facade of his hotel couldn't hide.
