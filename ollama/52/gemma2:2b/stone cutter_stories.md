The air hung thick with the smell of dust and grit, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, the stone cutter.  He ran his calloused thumb across the smooth, cool surface of a newly-cut slab of marble - a vibrant shade of blue reminiscent of a summer sky that had faded into dusk. The workshop was nestled in the heart of the old city, an echo of its grandeur long since dimmed by time and neglect. Above him, the roof sagged like a tired old man's back, leaving gaps that bled sunlight down onto the worn wooden planks. Elias sighed, his gaze lost on the intricate patterns swirling within the marble, each one a silent testament to years spent chasing beauty in the mundane. 

He was known as "Elias of the Stone Eye" - his skill in seeing hidden potential even within rough blocks earned him more than just respect; it ensured he wouldn't starve for another day.  But tonight, Elias felt different. Tonight, the silence felt heavier, burdened with an unspoken pressure that seemed to emanate from the very stones he worked on. He glanced at the moon, a sliver of silver hanging heavy in the sky like a promise unkept, and knew this was no ordinary night.
