##  The Whispers of Ashlyn

**Setting:**  A small, sun-drenched town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, nestled between rolling green hills and a dense forest. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Ashlyn" Thorne, a clinical psychologist who’d arrived at Pinewood just six months ago with a heart heavy with both hope and dread. Ashlyn had dreamt of building her own practice, a haven for those struggling to find their way in the world. However, she couldn't shake off the unsettling aura that hung over the town - a lingering sense of mystery, whispers carried on the breeze that spoke of secrets buried deep within Pinewood’s history.

**Opening:** 
The first patient was Mrs. Elara Davis, a frail woman with eyes as faded as the moss clinging to the ancient oak tree outside her office. Ashlyn sat across from her, the afternoon light filtering through the dusty windows and illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. "It's your turn," she said gently, offering Mrs. Davis a soothing smile. The woman’s hand trembled as she lifted a worn photo frame.  The picture showed a young woman with wide, captivating eyes staring back at Ashlyn. The woman’s name was whispered: Lily. And the whispers were starting to echo in Ashlyn's own soul. 

**Further notes:**
