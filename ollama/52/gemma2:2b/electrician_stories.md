## The Flickering Flame

**Setting:** A dilapidated Victorian house with peeling paint and ivy-choked windows on the outskirts of a sleepy coastal town in Maine. 

**Main Character:** Edgar "Mac" MacAllister, a man weathered by years of dealing with faulty wiring, stubborn customers, and the unpredictable nature of his trade.  At 52, he carries himself with quiet dignity, his hands calloused and strong despite being adorned with rings and a single, faded tattoo - a lightning bolt tracing the line of his forearm. 

**Story Opening:**

The rain lashed against Mac's worn trench coat as he stepped onto the porch of the Victorian mansion.  Its grand façade had fallen victim to time and neglect, its once-proud windows now cloudy with grime. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and a faint undercurrent of salt. This house belonged to Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, a woman whose wealth was as legendary as her eccentricity. 

She'd hired Mac to fix the wiring in her ancient home after a particularly nasty thunderstorm left a tangle of exposed copper and sparking fuses.  The problem wasn’t just faulty wiring; it was a ghost story waiting to be told. She had called him for an electrician, but she also hoped for something more – someone who could see the past shimmering beneath the surface of her grand abode. 

As Mac stepped deeper into the house, the flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that played tricks on his eyes. A chill wind snagged at his coat, whispering secrets only he seemed to hear.  He couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more than just burnt wires and leaky pipes. And somewhere in this decaying grandeur, a story waited to be told.
