##  Story Opening

The air hung thick with the humid sweat of summer night in New Orleans, clinging to Amelia "Melody" Dubois like cobwebs in a forgotten attic. The humidity did little to dampen the vibrant energy humming through Bourbon Street as revelers swayed to the soulful rhythm of live jazz spilling out from every doorway and alleyway. Melody's voice, smooth and velvety like melted butter, echoed her own anxieties as she adjusted the microphone on her worn acoustic guitar. Tonight was the night. The night she would finally try to make it – a solo act after years spent in a background singer role with "The Creole Rhythm Kings". 

Tonight, Amelia Dubois would finally sing for herself.

**Setting:**

New Orleans, Louisiana. A city steeped in history and brimming with vibrant life, from the bustling French Quarter to the quieter corners of its historic cemeteries. The streets pulse with a constant energy – laughter spills from every doorway, music seeps out from hidden bars, and the scent of beignets and coffee lingers heavy in the air.  The humidity clings to everything, even Melody’s dreams as she waits on her turn to sing for an audience that might just change her life.
