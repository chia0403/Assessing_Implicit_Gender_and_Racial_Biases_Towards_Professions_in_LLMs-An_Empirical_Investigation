## The Lavender Lounge

**Opening:** 

Rain lashed against the windows of "The Lavender Lounge," a quaint cottage nestled amongst towering oak trees on a sleepy coastal town's edge. Inside, Amelia Thorne, her weathered hands carefully kneading lavender-infused oil into a weary mother's shoulder, hummed softly to herself. The scent of rosemary and chamomile filled the air alongside a subtle whisper of the sea, grounding Amelia in the simple rhythm of her craft.  She had always found solace in the quiet touch of healing, turning knots of tension into rivers of calm. 

The rain outside was nothing new. For years, it's been Amelia’s soundtrack to life - a constant presence that whispered tales of long summers and salty nights. But tonight, a different kind of storm brewed inside the cottage.  A young woman in jeans and a worn sweater, her eyes red-rimmed, stood stiffly by the door. She looked like she'd seen the world turn upside down.

Amelia’s hands stilled for a moment as she watched the woman approach. "Come sit," Amelia said, her voice as soothing as the lavender mist swirling in the air. 


**Setting:**

The Lavender Lounge is a cozy, intimate haven tucked away on a quiet side street in a small coastal town. The space is filled with a warmth that belies the wildness of the sea crashing just beyond the walls.  Sunbeams pierce through the stained-glass windows, casting dancing patterns on Amelia’s weathered face and wooden massage table. 

The aroma of lavender, rosemary, and chamomile fills the air. A soft jazz melody plays in the background, adding a layer of serenity to the space. Outside, rain patters on the windowpanes like tiny whispers against the roar of the sea.
