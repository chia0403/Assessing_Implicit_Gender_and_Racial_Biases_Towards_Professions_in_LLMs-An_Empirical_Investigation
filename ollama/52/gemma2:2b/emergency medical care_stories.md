The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the chaos unfolding in Room 12B: a symphony of wheezing breaths, panicked voices, and the sharp clang of metal against metal.  The hospital, normally a bustling hive of activity, felt strangely hollow tonight. The weight of the impending storm hung heavy in Ellie's chest as she rushed to the patient's bedside - a young woman barely past her twenties, face pale and streaked with sweat. The whirring of the oxygen machine was a constant reminder of the fragile dance between life and death, a dance Ellie knew all too well.

Ellie had chosen this path after years of witnessing friends’ and family members’ struggles against disease, a lifetime of knowing the fleeting fragility of human existence.  She felt like a lone sentinel in the face of nature's brutal force - every day a testament to the vulnerability and resilience of her patients. Tonight, however, was a reminder that even in the harshest reality, hope could still flicker. She had to believe it, for herself, for them all.
