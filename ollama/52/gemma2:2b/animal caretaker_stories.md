Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, each drop echoing like tiny explosions in the stillness of the night.  Inside, Amelia Willowbrook sighed, her breath fogging the air as she cleaned out Millie's enclosure. The old grey mare's eyes had been dull for days, and a faint whimper escaping from the shelter was starting to grate on Amelia's nerves.  She ran a hand through Millie's coarse coat, searching for any sign of discomfort. Even though she’d been tending to animals for as long as she could remember – her grandfather was a renowned animal whisperer, after all – the feeling that something wasn't right sent a shiver down her spine. 

The sanctuary wasn't just a place for lost and abandoned creatures; it was Amelia's lifeline, a sanctuary of peace in the increasingly chaotic world beyond its gates. A canvas of weathered wood, brick, and ivy framed by towering oak trees provided both shelter and a sense of belonging to the animals entrusted to her care. But tonight, the setting felt more oppressive, as if even the ancient oaks were holding their breath, waiting for something to break.  The rain kept falling, blurring the already misty twilight outside the windows, leaving Amelia feeling like she was trapped in an unsettling dream.

Amelia knew that there was only one way to find out what was ailing Millie – a trip to the abandoned forest beyond the sanctuary's perimeter. A place even her grandfather hadn’t dared venture into.
