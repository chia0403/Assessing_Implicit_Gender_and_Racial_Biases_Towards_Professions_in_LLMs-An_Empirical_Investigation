He saw The Tower not just as steel and stone but as something more - a legacy to be built upon, a phoenix rising from the ashes of forgotten promises. But as he climbed into his worn-out pickup, the weight of those dreams felt like a millstone around his neck; the reality of the city's unforgiving grind looming large over him.
