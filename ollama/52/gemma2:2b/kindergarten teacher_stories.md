The sun, already a hazy orange disc behind the storm clouds, cast long shadows across Ms. Eleanor Blackwood's classroom. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, whispering secrets only nature seemed to understand.  Inside, twenty-two pairs of wide, curious eyes stared at Ms. Blackwood with an expectant fervor. The air was thick with crayon shavings and sugar cookie dust, a symphony of childhood chaos conducted by a stern, yet kind, woman in navy blue scrubs. 

Ms. Blackwood had been teaching for nearly two decades, and the years hadn't dulled her love for these tiny humans. Each day held an intricate dance between order and discovery, structured routines and unexpected bursts of creativity. She knew their every smile, every sniffle, every mischievous grin that could only belong to a kindergartner. 

Today, however, was different. A storm had swept through the city, leaving the air thick with a strange energy. Ms. Blackwood felt it too â€“ a nervous thrumming in her own veins. The kids were restless, their usual playful chatter replaced by anxious silence. She knew something was amiss. It wasn't just the storm; something else was brewing beneath the surface of their innocent eyes.
