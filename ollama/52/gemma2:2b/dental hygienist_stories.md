The whirring of the high-speed handpiece was Amelia "Amy" Harding's constant companion, a rhythmic hum that matched the throbbing in her temples. It wasn't the drill itself – she knew it well, had perfected its use over years of practice. No, it was the pressure building behind her eyes. This last week, the city had gone silent - not a single patient walked through those doors at Serenity Dental, her usual haven amidst the bustling downtown.

The air hung thick with anticipation and fear in the sterile office. The walls were plastered with the same cheerful floral patterns that always seemed to mock Amy's dwindling hope. Outside, the familiar cacophony of city life was muted; the relentless hum of traffic had been replaced by an unsettling stillness. 

Amy knew it wasn’t a coincidence. It was more than just bad timing; something darker lingered in this sudden silence.  She glanced at the clock – 8:01 am, exactly when her shift was supposed to start. She took a deep breath and steeled herself. This wasn't just a routine cleaning anymore; it was about understanding what had happened in these seemingly quiet streets. A city that was always buzzing now felt like a wound waiting to burst open. 


**Setting:** Serenity Dental, a small dental practice nestled within the heart of a bustling downtown area, with an old-fashioned decor and a calming color scheme.  It's known for its friendly staff and efficient service, yet this week it feels as if the atmosphere has taken on an eerie stillness.
