The morning mist clung to the cobblestones like damp smoke as Bartholomew "Barth" Plumb adjusted his old-fashioned cap, shielding his eyes from the rising sun.  It was June in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, and despite the fresh air whistling through the narrow alleys, Barth's workshop felt thick with the smell of yesterday's rusty pipes and a lingering tension that only he seemed to notice. 

Barth himself wasn't one for brooding. He had an honest grin, broad shoulders, and hands as sure with a wrench as they were with his old dog-eared notebook full of plumbing formulas. His business was "Barth Plumb & Sons," but after the sudden passing of his father three years ago, the only family left to help him keep the legacy alive was himself. Today though, he had an unsettling feeling about the new job at the corner bakery.

**Setting:**  Oakhaven is a quaint coastal town with a historical charm and a hint of mystery. The main street runs along the harbor, dotted with historic houses and shops that whisper tales of past generations.
