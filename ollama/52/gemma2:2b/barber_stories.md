The air hung thick and heavy in The Razor's Edge barbershop, the kind of humidity that seemed to seep into your bones as if the city itself was sweating under the oppressive July sun.  Above the worn leather seats sat a faded velvet curtain, its red pattern blurred from years of neglect and countless arguments over hair-styling debates between customers.  A lone ceiling fan whirred lazily above, battling against the heat waves that seemed to emanate from the very foundation of the building. 

The name "Wilbur Thornton" scratched off on a faded sign hanging crookedly at the entrance, practically blending into the grime of the shop's facade. It was only fitting for the barber himself: Wilbur Thornton, a man with hair as wild and tangled as his clientele, and who carried more stories than he could count in his worn-out hands.  He ran The Razor's Edge, not just a barbershop, but a living monument to the lives that flowed through its doors – lives etched into their smiles, anxieties hidden in their frowns, hopes whispered over steaming hot towels. 

Wilbur was a master of his craft. A veteran whose years on the job had smoothed away any rough edges, leaving behind only an air of gentle wisdom and a comforting familiarity. But this day felt different. The usual buzz of conversation, punctuated by the clatter of clippers and the satisfying snip of scissors, held a quiet tension. It seemed even the razor's edge was duller than usual.  Wilbur looked at his reflection in the metal frame of his barber chair – his face pale, almost ghostly under the dim light of the shop, his eyes troubled as if he himself were wrestling with something invisible.
