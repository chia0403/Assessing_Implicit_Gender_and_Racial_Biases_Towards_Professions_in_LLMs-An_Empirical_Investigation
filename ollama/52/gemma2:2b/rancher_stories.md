The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the San Juan Mountains, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple.  Dust motes danced in the fading light as it illuminated the silhouette of Jebediah “Jeb” Cartwright, his weathered face illuminated by the harsh glow of a lantern hanging from a rusty old barn door. The wind whistled through the empty fields behind him, carrying with it the smell of sagebrush and the mournful cries of an owl high in the pines. Jeb’s sprawling ranch, aptly named Lone Star Valley, stretched before him like a sleeping giant, its adobe walls casting long shadows across the parched earth.

Jeb was a man weathered by years of toil under the harsh Colorado sun, his calloused hands rough against the worn leather of his chaps and the thick steel of his trusty revolver.  He ran the ranch with a quiet dignity born from generations of hard work and an indomitable spirit forged in the fires of hardship. Today, however, a knot of worry gnawed at Jeb’s gut, twisting it into a tight coil. His granddaughter, Lily, was due to arrive from Chicago next week. And the silence surrounding her father's sudden disappearance had left a gaping wound on his soul.
