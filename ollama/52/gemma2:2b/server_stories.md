The clinking of ceramic plates echoed in the cavernous dining room of The Iron Hearth, a restaurant so old its patrons felt like relics themselves.  A heavy oak door swung shut behind Amelia "Amy" Thorne, whose worn apron and gentle smile seemed out of place amidst the roaring fire of rustic stoves and the whispers of patrons engrossed in hushed conversations. The aroma of roasting lamb and simmering gravy hung thick in the air, a comforting yet slightly suffocating embrace that Amy had come to know intimately after eight years serving the hungry souls of Oakhaven's elite. 

It was her nightly ritual, this dance between bustling servers and their discerning patrons.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A nervous flutter stirred in Amy’s stomach as she navigated the tables with practiced ease. It wasn’t just another dinner service; tonight, a storm raged outside, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia's own heart.  Her new assistant, a young man named Elijah, was surprisingly quiet and his eyes held an unsettling intensity, the kind that had the potential to either save or destroy this old establishment she called home.
