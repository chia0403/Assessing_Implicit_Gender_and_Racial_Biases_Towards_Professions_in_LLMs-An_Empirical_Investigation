The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Finch. She loved the hushed reverence of the Blackwood Library, its towering shelves whispering secrets from centuries past.  It wasn't just a job for Amelia; it was her lifeblood. For generations, the library had been her sanctuary, a place where she could lose herself in the whispers of forgotten stories and escape into worlds spun by ink and imagination. Today, however, the usual peace felt strained, like the delicate balance of a well-worn book threatened to shatter. 

Amelia ran a trembling hand over the worn spine of an ancient tome, its leather cover cracked and faded.  The title, "The Codex of Forgotten Tales," whispered on the page in a language she barely understood. The air in the library seemed thick with anticipation, a palpable shift in energy that made even her usually calm demeanor tingle. It was as if the very walls were holding their breath, waiting for something to break free.   She sighed, knowing that tonight was no ordinary night â€“ it promised a story unlike any she'd encountered before.
