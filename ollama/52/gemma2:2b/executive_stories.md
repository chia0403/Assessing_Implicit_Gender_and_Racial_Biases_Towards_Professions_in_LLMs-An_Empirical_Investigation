##  The Glass Palace

**Setting:** The opulent penthouse suite of the 'Grand Elysian,' an exclusive high-rise in Geneva, Switzerland. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered breathtaking panoramas of the snow-dusted Alps and the glittering Lac Leman below. Every inch of the suite was meticulously designed: polished marble floors reflected the golden light from the city lights, a roaring fireplace crackled with embers in its ornate stone mantle, and a vast dining table adorned with hand-painted floral motifs sat ready for intimate gatherings.  

**Character:** 
* **Name:** Evelyn "Eve" Sterling
* **Occupation:** CEO of 'Sterling Holdings,' a global conglomerate specializing in technology, renewable energy, and sustainable infrastructure projects. Eve had built the company from the ground up, becoming one of the youngest billionaires on the planet. Her sharp wit, ambitious nature, and unwavering drive had propelled her to the top of the industry, but it came at a cost – she was isolated, consumed by work and haunted by a past she'd kept tightly sealed away. 

**Opening:**  Eve stood before the expansive window, staring out at the snow-laden peaks that seemed to pierce the very sky. A familiar unease gnawed at her gut, the kind that manifested as a tightening in her chest and a subtle tremor in her hand. It was 4:01 AM. Time for her routine.  The first sip of her 'Zen' tea blend always felt like an act of defiance – a ritualistic escape from the endless demands of life, from the weight of responsibility she had willingly assumed. Tonight, however, something about it felt different. The usual calmness was replaced by a growing sense of urgency. 

Eve knew something was brewing. Something far more significant than the annual board meeting that loomed just days away. She needed to know what lay beneath the surface.  And as her gaze lingered on the rising sun's golden glow, she realized she wouldn't wait for answers – not this time. Today, she would break the silence and face her own demons head-on.
