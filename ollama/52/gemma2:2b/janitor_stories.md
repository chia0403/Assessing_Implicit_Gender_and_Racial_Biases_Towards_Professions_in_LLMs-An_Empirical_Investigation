## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** 
The grimy corridors of Blackwood University are filled with the whispers of forgotten lives – secrets etched into worn staircases, hushed conversations echoing from emptied lecture halls, and the faintest scent of stale coffee clinging to the air. A storm raged outside, rattling the windows of Blackwood Hall, sending shivers through even the most seasoned janitorial staff. 

**Main character:**
Bartholomew "Bart" Finchley is a man who knows more about the inner workings of this grand university than he likes to admit.  For years, Bart has been the unseen guardian of Blackwood's hallways and classrooms. His worn-out mopping bucket and his unyielding sense of duty have made him an almost mythical figure, a silent observer of the world's fleeting joys and its hidden tragedies. At 67 years old, he’s witnessed countless weddings, graduations, and even funerals through the grime-coated windows of the university’s iconic Gothic Hall.

But today, something is different. A chill hangs in the air, a palpable tension that prickles Bart's skin like a swarm of unseen insects. He wipes down a particularly dusty windowpane when his gaze falls upon something startlingly out of place – a single red rose resting on the ground beneath a crumbling gargoyle statue.  He bends to pick it up, feeling an unexpected tingle run down his spine as he brushes the petals with worn-down calloused hands.

**Opening line:** 
"This was never how it was supposed to be," Bart muttered, his voice lost in the wind's howl, a strange dissonance against the symphony of whispers and sighs echoing through the halls of Blackwood University.
