The morning air in Sunnyside, a sleepy coastal town with more charm than it had real estate, was as crisp and blue as Dr. Elias Cartwright’s smile.  His patients lined up outside his quaint office, each one carrying the same unspoken hope for pearly whites and fresh breath - a promise he'd sworn to deliver since he first hung his shingle in 1987.  Elias' white coat, worn but well-maintained, felt like an extension of himself, a testament to his quiet dedication to his craft.

His office door creaked open, revealing the usual symphony of anxieties and excited chatter.  He took a deep breath, calming the nervous flutter in his chest before turning towards his patients with a gentle, reassuring smile. 
"Good morning," he greeted them, his voice like warm honey that could melt even the most stubborn dental fear. "Ready for your routine check-up?"


**Setting:** Sunnyside, Maine - A quaint coastal town with a historic downtown and a close-knit community.  The town has weathered its share of change – from shipbuilding to tourism – but maintains a sense of timeless charm.
