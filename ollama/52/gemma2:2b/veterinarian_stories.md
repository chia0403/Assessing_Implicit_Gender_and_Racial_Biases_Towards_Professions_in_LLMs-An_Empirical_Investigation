The salt spray stung Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne's eyes as she stood at the helm of the small fishing vessel, "Sea Sprite." The wind whipped her long, auburn hair around her face, and the sun, obscured by a thick bank of grey clouds, cast an eerie glow on the choppy water surrounding them.  She was headed towards the tiny, secluded cove where the old fisherman's shack sat nestled amongst the jagged cliffs of Cornwall's rugged coastline, a place that could only be described as desolate beauty. Her patient - Mr. Trelawney, a legendary cod fisherman with a heart as rough as the rocks he’d spent his life battling - was ailing. 

A storm the size of a small island had ravaged the coast last night, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Amelia's call to the lighthouse keeper hadn't been met with pleasantries, only frantic cries for her help.  The old man had sworn he wouldn’t see another human being until she arrived. 

"A man and his sea," Mr. Trelawney used to say as he sipped his whiskey on quiet nights, "But even the ocean needs someone to understand its rhythm."   
Amelia couldn't help but wonder if his words were more than just a fisherman's cliché. Her days usually revolved around the comforting routines of her clinic in Plymouth; an escape from the wild storms and unpredictable tides that seemed to hold sway over Mr. Trelawney’s life.  But as she stared out at the churning sea, Amelia couldn't shake off the feeling that something was deeply amiss.  
 

**Here are some details for further development:** 


* **Amy's personality:** Is she pragmatic and logical? Or is there a hidden depth to her character? Does she fear the ocean or has a deep respect for its power? 
* **Mr. Trelawney's illness:** What kind of ailment does he have, and how severe is it? How does this affect his ability to work or navigate the seas?  
* **The setting's atmosphere:** Is it truly desolate beauty, or is there a hidden undercurrent of something more sinister?
