The rumble of a beat-up '67 Chevy pickup echoed through the cavernous garage, bouncing off the rusted fenders of half-finished projects and the dusty ceiling.  Inside, its owner, Bartholomew “Bart” O'Malley, was knee-deep in engine grease, his calloused hands wielding a wrench like an artist with a paintbrush. The greasy air was thick with the scent of burnt oil and gasoline, a symphony for a man who found solace in the cacophony.

He surveyed the mess – a tangled web of wires, a dislocated crankshaft, and a stubborn fuel line that seemed to mock him with its defiance.  Bart ran a hand through his greying hair, his brow furrowed in concentration as he muttered under his breath, "Just one more turn…" It was a familiar battleground – every time he took apart something, it felt like re-fighting the same war against the stubborn resistance of machines.

Bart's garage wasn't just a place to fix cars; it was a refuge. His customers were as varied as the wrenches in his tool belt – from weary truckers hauling tons of goods across the country to high-school students whose beat-up bikes needed a little TLC.  For Bart, each engine roar held a story, and he knew them all. He felt the history within the steel and metal bones of each vehicle like an old friend.
