The morning mist clung to the grass like a damp shroud, obscuring the usual vibrant green of Franklin's domain. He surveyed the expanse with furrowed brows, his worn baseball cap pulled low over tired eyes. It was another Tuesday, another day tending to Mrs. Henderson's immaculately manicured lawn in the sleepy cul-de-sac, but today felt different. Today, the silence of the early morning hours seemed to crackle with a potent tension, echoing the storm brewing inside Franklin himself. 

His hands, calloused and thick from years of tilling earth, clutched a trowel tightly, his reflection a pale ghost staring back from the mirror in his pickup truck's cab. The weight of Mrs. Henderson's request pressed down on him like an unseen hand: to plant a rose bush at the very spot where their once-beloved dog, Rusty, had taken his final breath under the weeping willow. A tear, hot and stinging, welled up in Franklin's eye. He wiped it away with a roughened fingertip. He was just a landscaper, a caretaker of green. But sometimes, the earth whispered stories too personal to be ignored. 


**Setting:** A quiet cul-de-sac nestled in the heart of suburban Indiana. The air is thick and humid, and morning dew sparkles on the grass like scattered diamonds. Franklin's work truck, adorned with his worn "Franklin's Landscaping" logo, stands beside a towering oak tree under a sky promising rain.
