Rain splattered against the grand, arched windows of Maison Blanc, blurring the Parisian skyline into a watercolour mess. Inside, Eloise de Saint-Germain, her silver bob bouncing as she flitted between a couple arguing over whose turn it was to take the elevator and an impeccably dressed woman who insisted on a proper tea service despite being six months pregnant, felt the city's energy crackle through the ancient floorboards.  Eloise wasn't just another concierge; she was the soul of Maison Blanc. Her eyes, as blue as the sapphire-encrusted clock in the foyer, watched over the luxurious lives of her clients and their intricate dramas unfold like a silent movie.  

This particular storm had brought with it a new resident: Mr. Henri Moreau, an enigmatic art collector who kept to himself more than the silence of the Parisian metro on a Friday evening. His arrival had triggered a flurry of whispers and speculation among Eloiseâ€™s staff. No one knew where he came from or why he'd chosen this particular haven for his temporary retreat.  All that was clear was that within those walls, with their history as old as the Eiffel Tower itself, something extraordinary was brewing.
