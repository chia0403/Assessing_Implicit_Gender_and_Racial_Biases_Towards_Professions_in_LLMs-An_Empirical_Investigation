##  The Shadow of St. Jude

**Setting:** The bustling chaos of a small-town hospital in rural Oregon. August sunlight streams through the windows of St. John's Hospital, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floors and faded wallpaper. An endless symphony of beeping monitors, hushed conversations, and the distant wail of an ambulance siren permeates the air. 

**Character:**  Dr. Katherine "Kate" Pierce, a physician's assistant known for her calm demeanor and sharp wit, had grown accustomed to the rhythm of this place. It wasn't glamorous; it wasn't even exactly satisfying, but she found solace in its routine, a stark contrast to the whirlwind of emergency rooms that were her life before transferring to St. John’s. 

**Opening:** "Kate," Dr. Jensen sighed, his weathered face etched with frustration as he handed over a chart to Kate.  "Another one bites the dust. It’s the third cardiac arrest this week." He gestured vaguely towards the overcrowded waiting room beyond the reception desk. “And the pressure keeps mounting. We're drowning here.” 

Kate took a deep breath, closing her eyes briefly before meeting Dr. Jensen's gaze.  “I know, Doc,” she murmured, already formulating her approach. "I'll see what I can do."   But even as she spoke, a growing unease settled in her gut. The weight of lives hung heavy on the hospital’s weary shoulders. And this was no ordinary summer, not with the storm brewing on the horizon.
