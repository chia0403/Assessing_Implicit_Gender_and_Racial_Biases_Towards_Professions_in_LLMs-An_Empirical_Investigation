## Setting:

The flickering neon sign of "Sunshine Diner" cast an erratic glow across Dr. Elias Blackwood's usually sharp face as he stood outside, staring at the rain-slicked asphalt. The air was thick with the smell of hot oil and burnt rubber, a familiar scent in this small, forgotten corner of Maine. He adjusted his worn Stetson and pulled the collar of his tweed jacket tighter around his throat, trying to ward off the November chill. 

His usual stoicism seemed strained tonight; the relentless drumming of the rain against the diner's roof was a symphony of his growing unease. Inside, he could hear the murmur of tired conversations, punctuated by the clanging of plates and the sizzle of greasy burgers on the griddle.  It was a haven for those who sought solace in routine and comfort, but for Elias, it held only an unsettling premonition. 

## Character:

Dr. Elias Blackwood – a man as stoic and sharp-edged as the instruments he wielded. His life was dedicated to healing, his dedication unwavering despite a recent string of losses that had left him feeling hollowed out. This town, with its secrets whispering on the wind, held a different kind of burden for him - one he hoped to shed once he found answers about his past. 


## Opening:

His phone buzzed in his pocket – another late-night call from his wife, asking for updates on their daughter's upcoming surgery. Elias sighed, pushing a stray strand of hair behind his ear as his eyes drifted towards the flickering streetlight above him. The question echoed in his mind, a persistent hum beneath the rain: was it better to find answers, even if they came at a terrible cost?
