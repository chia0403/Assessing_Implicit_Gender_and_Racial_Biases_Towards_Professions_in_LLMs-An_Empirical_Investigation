The neon "Open" sign flickered its familiar message, the only light against the storm brewing outside.  Rain lashed against the glass windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the once-proud facade into a swirling canvas of grey and white. Inside, the lobby of the hotel was usually abuzz with laughter, hushed conversations, and the gentle clinking of champagne glasses at midnight events. But tonight, it felt hollow, like a dying ember in a storm. 

Esme Blackwood, her name etched onto the worn mahogany desk as prominently as her weary smile, sat amidst the empty chairs and lingering echoes of guests long gone. She was known for her patience, a trait honed to an almost mythical level over twenty years of working at Blackwood Hotel.  Tonight, though, even Esme's calm facade seemed to crack under the weight of the storm and the emptiness that clung to the air like dust motes in the waning light. 

The phone on the desk chimed, a piercing ring that echoed against the silence.  She picked up the receiver, her hands trembling slightly as she met the earpiece's gaze. "Grand Blackwood Reception," she murmured, her voice barely audible over the howling wind. And then came the words that would change everything: "We need you down at the docks."
