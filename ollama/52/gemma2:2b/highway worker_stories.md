Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof, each drop drumming out a staccato rhythm that mirrored the nervous thumping in Samuel "Sam" Thorne's chest.  He tugged his worn flannel tighter, pulling the collar up to his chin as he surveyed the half-completed stretch of I-70. The steel beams that would soon span the yawning chasm of the mountain gorge, a testament to human ingenuity and will, stood stark against the grey sky. 

Sam had been swinging from this very side of the bridge for months now, meticulously hammering away at the final bolts.  He'd moved here after his wife died, leaving him alone with memories he dared not revisit, and a promise to make something of their shared dream: building a life in these wild plains. Building it with concrete, steel, and the sweat of his brow, one bridge at a time. 

The wind howled through the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling diner just beyond the construction site, its neon sign flickering erratically, a beacon lost in the storm's onslaught. The last few customers had left as soon as the rain started, their faces etched with an uneasy mix of resignation and fear.  And now, just Sam and the relentless symphony of rain and wind, his heart pounded against the silence.
