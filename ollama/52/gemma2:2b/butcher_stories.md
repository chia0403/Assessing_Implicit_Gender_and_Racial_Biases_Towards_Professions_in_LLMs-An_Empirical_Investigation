The morning mist clung to Blackwood's Street like a damp shroud, the air thick with the earthy scent of woodsmoke and rotting refuse.  A single streetlamp flickered precariously above Elias Thorne, his shadow stretched long and gaunt against the grimy brick wall of his shop as he sharpened a cleaver with precision honed by years of trade. His calloused hand, worn smooth by decades of work, deftly moved over the steel, the blade catching the meager light like a sliver of moonlight on a tombstone.  Elias Thorne, proprietor of "Thorne's Delicatessen and Butchering," had seen more winters than most folks knew their birth year, but even in this city that breathed grime and rot from every corner, there was something inherently defiant about his shop. 

He wasn’t just a butcher; he was the last thread of tradition in this ever-changing landscape. His grandfather's worn recipe book lay open on his counter, its pages crinkled with age and stained with years spent pouring over them. It held the secrets to turning an ordinary boar into a masterpiece, each page whispering tales of generations past. He looked at the fat slabs of meat hanging from hooks, smelling of the raw life that pulsed within their very marrow. 

The shop was small; walls lined with gleaming silver and copper carcasses of creatures both mundane and monstrous – chickens pecking for scraps on a worn wooden floor - stood in stark contrast to the faded grandeur of his forefathers' butcher shop.
