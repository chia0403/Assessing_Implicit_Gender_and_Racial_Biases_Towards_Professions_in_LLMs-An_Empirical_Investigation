The air hung thick with the scent of lavender oil and aged leather, a familiar fragrance that clung to Elias’ workshop like a second skin. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the weathered wooden shutters of his shop in the heart of Old Town. But inside, everything was still – a canvas upon which Elias could paint his own dreams with thread and needle.

His nimble fingers could coax life into even the most mundane fabric, transforming worn-out garments into something both beautiful and functional. Each stitch he crafted held the weight of countless stories – tales of love lost and found, of triumphs won and battles fought.  But today, Elias' spirit felt as heavy as the leaden sky above. His latest commission - a suit for the Duchess Eleanor, notorious for her capricious whims and sharp tongue - was proving more challenging than anticipated.
