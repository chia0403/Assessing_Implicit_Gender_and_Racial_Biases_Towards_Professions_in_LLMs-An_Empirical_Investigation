The air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and garlic, a familiar comfort to Eloise Beatrice Dupont. Her apron, stained with the ghosts of countless sauces and splattered with vibrant paprika, was practically a second skin. Outside, the Parisian morning pulsed with its usual frenetic energy - horns blaring, vendors hawking their wares, the rhythmic clatter of trams on cobblestones. But within the cozy confines of her tiny bistro, "Le Petit Coin," time seemed to slow, measured only by the hiss of olive oil in a pan and the gentle clinking of Eloise's knives against the chopping board. Today was special; it was Bastille Day, and Eloise had planned a menu fit for a celebration. She hummed along to Edith Piaf drifting from the vintage radio as she kneaded dough for her famous brioche, a secret recipe passed down through generations of Duponts. The anticipation in the air was palpable, a delicious prelude to the symphony of flavors she was about to orchestrate.
