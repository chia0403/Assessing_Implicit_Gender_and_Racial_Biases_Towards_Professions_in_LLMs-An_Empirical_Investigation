The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's weathered neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the endless ribbon of asphalt ahead. He squinted, adjusting his hard hat and wiping his brow with a calloused hand. Dust devils danced in the distance, shimmering mirages against the bleached desert backdrop. Eli sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drone of traffic thundering past him.

He'd been patching potholes on Highway 95 for over a decade, ever since he left his dusty hometown of Nogales after high school. The work was hard, unforgiving, and often monotonous, but it provided a steady paycheck and kept him close to the land he loved. Today, though, Eli felt a restless hum beneath his skin. Something wasn't right.

A glint of metal in the distance caught his eye. At first, he thought it was just another discarded soda can reflecting the harsh sunlight. But as the sun shifted, the glint intensified. It seemed to be buried deeper into the earth, partially obscured by tumbleweeds and dried brush. Curiosity piqued, Eli abandoned his shovel and made his way toward the anomaly.

The air grew cooler as he approached a cluster of mesquite trees, their gnarled branches casting long shadows across the parched ground. The metal glint pulsed closer, revealing itself to be a large, rusted hatch embedded in the earth. It looked ancient, its edges worn smooth by years of wind and sand.  Eli knelt down, his heart pounding with an unfamiliar mix of fear and excitement. What secrets lay hidden beneath this forgotten door?
