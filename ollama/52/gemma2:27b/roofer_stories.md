The midday sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Callahan's neck as he balanced precariously on the edge of Mrs. Henderson's slate roof. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy view of the suburbs stretching out below him. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against the slate was punctuated by the occasional chirp of a robin and the distant whine of a lawnmower. Jazz inhaled deeply, the scent of hot asphalt mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly cut grass.

He loved this feeling - the wind whipping through his hair, the sense of accomplishment as he replaced a damaged slate with a perfectly matched one, the knowledge that he was making someone's home safer and more beautiful. But today, Jazz couldn't shake a nagging unease. 


The old Victorian house creaked and groaned beneath him, its bones weary after a century of weathering storms and sheltering families.  There was a strange stillness to the air, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves in the ancient oak tree that shadowed the back porch. And then there were the whispers. Faint, barely audible, like someone sighing just beyond his hearing range.
