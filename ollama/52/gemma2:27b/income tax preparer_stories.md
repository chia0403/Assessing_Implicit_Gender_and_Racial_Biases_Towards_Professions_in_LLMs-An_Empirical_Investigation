Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Beatrice "Bea" Alcott's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Taxes Done Right" sign hanging precariously above. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation - a potent brew Bea had become intimately familiar with during her 15 years as an income tax preparer in this forgotten corner of Elmwood.

The flickering fluorescent light cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with W-2s, 1099s, and receipts stained with coffee rings. A half-eaten tuna sandwich lay abandoned on a stack of tax forms, testament to Bea's relentless work ethic during this peak season. Outside, thunder grumbled like an angry giant, mirroring the storm brewing in Bea's chest. This year was different. The usual anxieties about deadlines and deductions were overshadowed by a nagging feeling - something wasn't right.
