Rain lashed against the apothecary window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a watery smear. Inside, Amelia Blackwood adjusted her spectacles and sighed. Business had been slow all week, the dreary weather keeping most folks indoors. The only sound was the rhythmic tick of the antique clock above the counter and the soft hiss of the furnace struggling to keep the chill at bay. 

Amelia traced her finger along the worn spines of ancient herbals lining a shelf behind the cash register. They were relics from her grandmother, the original proprietor of Blackwood's Apothecary, filled with handwritten notes and pressed flowers - a testament to a time when pharmacists were more than just dispensers of pills; they were healers, confidantes, weavers of folk remedies and forgotten lore.

A sudden clang from the back room jolted Amelia out of her reverie. She frowned. The storeroom door was supposed to be locked.
