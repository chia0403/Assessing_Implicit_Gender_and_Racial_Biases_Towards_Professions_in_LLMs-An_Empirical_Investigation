The flickering fluorescent lights above cast an anemic glow on the stack of files piled precariously on Penelope Blackwood's desk. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of her cramped office, blurring the cityscape beyond into a watercolor wash of greys and blacks. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Penelope, weary after a long day navigating the labyrinthine world of parole violations and broken promises, sighed and pushed away the file labelled "Martinez, Ricardo." Ricardo's case was a tangled web of petty theft and substance abuse, one she feared wouldn't have a happy ending. Her phone buzzed on her desk, shattering the silence. Glancing at the screen, she saw it was an unknown number. Hesitation warred with duty. Another call could mean another late night, but Penelope knew ignoring it wouldn't make her workload any lighter.

Taking a deep breath, she answered. "Penelope Blackwood speaking." 

A breathless voice crackled through the receiver. "Ms. Blackwood? It's Daniel...Daniel Hayes. I need your help."
