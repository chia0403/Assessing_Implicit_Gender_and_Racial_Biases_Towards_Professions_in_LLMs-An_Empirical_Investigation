The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Blackwood's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the deserted school hallway. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale pizza and disinfectant, a familiar cocktail in Eloise's world. Outside, the storm raged on, wind howling like a banshee and rain lashing against the windows. It was nights like these that Eloise felt most acutely the loneliness of her job.

She pushed her battered mop cart down the corridor, its rusty wheels squeaking in protest. Each classroom she passed was a silent tableau: desks neatly arranged, chairs tucked under tables, textbooks stacked on shelves. A world frozen in time, waiting for the return of life and laughter. Eloise knew every nook and cranny of this building, from the chipped paint in the principal's office to the hidden stash of candy bars in the janitor's closet. This school was her domain, a sanctuary from the chaotic storm outside. But tonight, even its familiar walls couldn't quite banish the shiver that ran down Eloise's spine.

Something wasn't right.
