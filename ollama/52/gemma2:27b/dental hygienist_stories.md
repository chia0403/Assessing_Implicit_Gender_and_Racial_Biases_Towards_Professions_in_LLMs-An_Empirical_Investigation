The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile gleam over the gleaming stainless steel instruments laid out on Eleanor Grace Hawthorne's tray.  The air hung thick with the scent of mint toothpaste and antiseptic, a smell she usually found comforting but today felt cloying. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the mirror above the sink for a fleeting moment before dissolving into nothingness.

It was Tuesday morning at Gentle Smiles Dental, nestled in a quiet suburban strip mall next to a laundromat and a struggling bagel shop. The usual cheerful hum of activity was absent. Dr. Peterson, ever punctual, was late.  Eleanor glanced nervously at the clock; her first patient, Mrs. Henderson, notorious for her punctuality and sharp tongue, was due any minute. A bead of sweat trickled down Eleanor's temple, a stark contrast against her carefully applied crimson lipstick. Today felt different. Something was off.

Maybe it was the unsettling dream she’d had last night, one filled with shadowy figures and whispering voices that echoed long after she awoke. Or perhaps it was the persistent feeling of being watched, a sensation that prickled at the back of her neck every time she turned away from the window. Whatever it was, Eleanor couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that this ordinary Tuesday wouldn’t be so ordinary after all.
