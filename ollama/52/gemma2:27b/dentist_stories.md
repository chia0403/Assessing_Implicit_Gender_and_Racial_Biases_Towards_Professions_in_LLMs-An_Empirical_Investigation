The flickering neon sign outside cast an eerie green glow across Amelia Blackwood's face as she wrestled with her ancient office door. It squeaked like a distressed squirrel, protesting every inch of its reluctant journey upwards.  

Amelia sighed. The old building on Elm Street had charm, sure, but it was slowly crumbling around her. The paint peeled, the floorboards groaned underfoot, and the plumbing had a mind of its own. Still, Amelia couldn't imagine practicing anywhere else. This little corner of Elmwood was home, even if the sign above her door read "Blackwood Family Dentistry" in faded, peeling gold lettering that looked decidedly less than "family" friendly these days. 

Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, a combination Amelia found strangely comforting.  She flipped on the lights, bathing the small waiting room in a sterile white glow. Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating faded posters of smiling families sporting impossibly perfect teeth. A lone patient magazine lay crumpled on the coffee table, its pages yellowed and dog-eared.

Tonight was late shift - Amelia's least favorite time. The quiet always felt unsettling, punctuated only by the distant rumble of a passing bus and the occasional mournful sigh from the ancient air conditioner unit in the corner. But tonight, she had a feeling something unusual was about to happen. The air crackled with anticipation, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that sent goosebumps prickling across her arms.

Just then, the front door creaked open.
