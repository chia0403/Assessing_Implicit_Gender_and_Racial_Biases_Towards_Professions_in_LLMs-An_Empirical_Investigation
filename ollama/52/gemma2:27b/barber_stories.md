The humid New Orleans air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets as Bartholomew "Bart" Toussaint expertly swept stray hairs from the worn checkerboard floor of his barbershop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in its path and casting long shadows across the faded velvet barber chairs.

Bart's shop, nestled on a quiet side street in the Tremé neighborhood, was a haven for stories. The rhythmic snip-snip of his shears blended with the bluesy melodies drifting from an old radio perched precariously on a shelf overflowing with hair tonic bottles and jars of bay rum. Locals gathered, not just for a trim, but for Bart's sage advice, wry humor, and the comforting familiarity that only a true neighborhood institution could offer. 


Today, however, the usual lively banter was replaced by an unsettling silence. A stranger sat slumped in Bart's chair, his face shrouded in shadow, a battered fedora obscuring his features. The man's hands, calloused and scarred, clutched a crumpled photograph – a faded image of a woman with haunting emerald eyes.
