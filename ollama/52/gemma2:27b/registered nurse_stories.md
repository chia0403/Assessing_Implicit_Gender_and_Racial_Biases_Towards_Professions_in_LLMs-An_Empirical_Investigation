Amelia, her navy scrubs clinging damply to her frame, nervously adjusted the stethoscope dangling around her neck.

The pungent scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar olfactory reminder of the countless lives that had passed through these doors - some healed, others lost. Amelia knew she was supposed to be calm, collected, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. Yet, a tremor ran through her hand as she reached for the chart detailing her first patient. A nameless face behind a number - a life waiting for her intervention.
