The insistent trill of the antique telephone on Eloise Beaumont's mahogany desk pierced the hushed serenity of the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby. It was nearing midnight, the hour when even the most demanding guests usually succumbed to exhaustion or the allure of room service champagne. Eloise sighed, smoothing down her impeccable crimson uniform as she picked up the receiver.

"Grand Blackwood concierge," she answered in a voice that could soothe a tempestuous emperor and disarm a disgruntled socialite. "How may I be of service?"


The lobby around her shimmered under the soft glow of crystal chandeliers, reflecting off the polished marble floor. Outside, the Parisian night pulsed with its own rhythm â€“ the distant hum of traffic, the muffled strains of accordion music from a nearby cafe, and the rhythmic click of Eloise's heels as she paced behind her desk. The air was heavy with the scent of lilies and lavender, remnants of the lavish floral arrangement that graced the grand entrance.

Eloise braced herself for whatever request awaited. In her five years at the Grand Blackwood, she had handled everything from procuring a first-edition Flaubert to arranging clandestine meetings between star-crossed lovers. Tonight promised to be no different.
