The neon sign of the "Last Chance Saloon" flickered ominously, casting long, distorted shadows across the dusty street. Evelyn Rose Blackwood, her trench coat pulled tight against the biting desert wind, adjusted her fedora and surveyed the scene. This wasn't exactly the glamorous assignment she'd envisioned when she joined the Phoenix Gazette, but digging into a string of missing persons cases in the forgotten mining town of Dust Devil was all she had right now. 

Dust Devil was a place time forgot. Crumbling wooden buildings huddled together like frightened children, their paint peeling under the relentless sun. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and regret, punctuated by the occasional mournful howl of a coyote echoing from the nearby canyons. Evelyn gripped her notepad tighter, a knot of apprehension forming in her stomach. This town held secrets, she could feel it, secrets whispered on the wind and etched into the weathered faces of its inhabitants.

Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. She had a story to uncover, and Dust Devil wouldn't let go of its ghosts easily.
