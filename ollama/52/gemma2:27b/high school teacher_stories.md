Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Ms. Eloise Cavendish's classroom, mimicking the turbulent storm brewing inside her.  Chalk dust hung in the air, illuminated by the pale yellow glow of the overhead fluorescent lights. A half-erased equation stared accusingly from the blackboard – a symbol of her own mounting frustration.

Eloise, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their usual braid and worry etched on her freckled face, surveyed the chaotic scene before her: crumpled papers strewn across desks, whispers erupting into bursts of laughter, and the incessant tapping of a student's foot against the linoleum floor. 

It was the first day back from spring break, and the energy in Room 207 crackled with a restless anticipation – an anticipation that Eloise desperately wished she could share. Instead, a leaden weight settled in her stomach, threatening to spill over into the controlled calm she'd always prided herself on as a teacher at Oakhaven High.
