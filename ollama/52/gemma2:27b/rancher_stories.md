Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling up withered tumbleweeds and kicking at the rusted fence posts that marked Jasper Thorne's property line.  Jasper himself stood on the porch of his weather-beaten farmhouse, squinting at the horizon where a sliver of sun was struggling to break through the oppressive morning haze. The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and impending rain, a smell he knew well but which always brought a flicker of anxious anticipation.

He'd been battling drought for three years now, his once-lush pastures reduced to cracked earth and brittle grass. His cattle were gaunt, their ribs showing through their hides like stark reminders of the unforgiving landscape. Jasper, with his weathered face etched by sun and worry lines, was starting to feel as parched as his land.

He needed rain. He needed it desperately.
