The air hung thick and sweet with jasmine, a cloying scent that mingled with the ever-present smell of salt from the turquoise Aegean Sea.  Eirini Papadopoulos adjusted her straw hat, pushing back a stray curl as she addressed the eager faces before her. "Welcome, everyone," she said, her voice carrying effortlessly over the murmur of the small crowd gathered on the dusty cobblestone path. "To the ancient ruins of Knossos, birthplace of the Minoan civilization and home to the legendary Labyrinth." 

Eirini, a woman in her late thirties with eyes as bright blue as the Greek sky and a smile that could melt even the iciest heart, was renowned for her captivating tours. She knew every nook and cranny of the sprawling palace complex, from the fresco-adorned walls to the hidden courtyards where ancient sunlight still dappled through crumbling arches. 

Today's group, a motley crew of tourists from all corners of the globe, seemed particularly excited. A young couple giggled nervously, clutching hands. A solitary elderly woman with piercing green eyes stared intently at Eirini, her expression unreadable. And a boisterous group of American teenagers jostled each other, already snapping selfies against the backdrop of crumbling columns. 

Eirini took a deep breath, ready to transport them back in time. But as she gestured towards the imposing entrance gate, a strange unease crept over her. A shadow seemed to flicker at the edge of her vision, and the air grew suddenly colder, despite the Mediterranean sun beating down. The jasmine scent turned acrid, almost metallic.  Something was amiss...
