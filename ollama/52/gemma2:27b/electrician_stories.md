Rain lashed against the warped wooden slats of Ezra Finch's workshop, the drumming a relentless counterpoint to the crackling of the neon sign above: "Finch's Fixes - No Job Too Bright." Ezra himself, face smeared with grease and eyes magnified by thick-rimmed glasses, wrestled with a tangle of wires protruding from an antique gramophone.

This blasted gramophone, a family heirloom entrusted to him by Mrs. Peabody, seemed determined to defy all logic and electrical laws. It hummed, it sputtered, it emitted a series of ear-splitting squawks that sounded more like a distressed goose than music. 


Ezra sighed, wiping his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He needed a breakthrough, something to crack this cryptic code of antique wiring before Mrs. Peabody's patience wore thinner than the insulation on this century-old contraption.
