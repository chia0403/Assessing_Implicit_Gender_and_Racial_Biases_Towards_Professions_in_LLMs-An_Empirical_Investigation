Rain lashed against the greenhouse glass, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of water. Inside, the air hung heavy and humid, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Theodore "Theo" Blackwood, his salt-and-pepper beard speckled with droplets, surveyed the scene with a sigh. The storm had come earlier than predicted, catching him off guard as he was preparing the begonia beds for their spring bloom. Now, instead of coaxing life from the soil, he was fighting a losing battle against the relentless deluge.

Theo, the head groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past thirty years, was no stranger to the capricious nature of weather. Yet, this storm felt different, laced with an unsettling energy that prickled his skin. As thunder boomed overhead, shaking the very foundations of the ancient manor house, he couldn't shake the feeling that something unnatural lurked beneath the raging tempest.
