Rain lashed against the towering obsidian walls of Citadel Umbra, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of black mist. The wind, sharp as a rusted blade, tore at Thaddeus Valerius' cloak, threatening to rip it from his shoulders. He tightened his grip on his halberd, the cold iron biting into his gloved hands. 

Thaddeus, a grizzled veteran with eyes that mirrored the stormy sky above, stood guard at the Citadel's main gate - a yawning maw of obsidian teeth framed by snarling gargoyles. The gate was sealed shut, its massive bars adorned with arcane runes that pulsed with an eerie, emerald light. Beyond lay the sprawling city of Umbra, shrouded in perpetual twilight, its cobbled streets deserted save for the occasional scuttling shadow.

Tonight, a palpable unease hung heavy in the air. Thaddeus could feel it prickling at his skin, a premonition as sharp and cold as the rain. It wasn't just the storm; something else was amiss. A low hum vibrated through the ground beneath his feet, a discordant note in the symphony of the tempest.

Then, he heard it.


A muffled screech, echoing from the depths of the Citadel, followed by the unmistakable thud of heavy footsteps racing towards him.
