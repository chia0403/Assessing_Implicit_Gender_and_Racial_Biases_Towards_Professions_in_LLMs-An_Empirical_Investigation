The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly overhead in Ms. Eleanor Vance's office, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk. Posters promising bright futures and pamphlets detailing college scholarships fought for space with stacks of student files teetering precariously on the edge.  Outside, the autumn wind howled through the branches of ancient oaks lining the quad at Willow Creek High School, sending leaves skittering against the windowpanes like anxious whispers. 

Eleanor sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. The weight of a hundred teenage dreams and anxieties pressed down on her shoulders. Today's lunch period had been particularly challenging - navigating a volatile love triangle, calming a panic attack over SAT scores, and explaining (yet again) the difference between a grant and a loan.  She longed for a moment of peace, a cup of steaming tea, and maybe a chapter or two of her latest mystery novel. But first, she had to face Mrs. Hawthorne's son, Ethan, who was due any minute. She'd heard whispers about him - withdrawn, troubled, with a mysterious glint in his eyes that unnerved even the most seasoned teachers.  Eleanor steeled herself, preparing for whatever storm Ethan might bring.
