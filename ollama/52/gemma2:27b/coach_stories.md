The air hung thick with humidity, even at this early hour. Sweat already beaded on Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne's forehead as he surveyed the dusty baseball diamond. The rising sun cast long shadows from the rickety bleachers and the gnarled oak that stood sentinel beyond the outfield fence. It was the first day of practice for the River Bend Rattlers, and Teddy could already feel a familiar mix of excitement and apprehension bubbling in his gut.

He'd been coaching Little League for ten years now, but this season felt different. This year, he wasn't just dealing with a bunch of eleven-year-olds eager to hit home runs. He was inheriting a team that had lost their last fourteen games, a team demoralized and on the verge of giving up. Could Teddy, a man who lived and breathed baseball but whose own playing career had ended in injury and heartbreak, inspire these young players to rediscover their love for the game?
