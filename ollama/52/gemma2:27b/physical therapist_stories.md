The scent of antiseptic and lavender oil hung heavy in the air, battling for dominance like two warring factions. Amelia Rose Beaumont sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her braid. The afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windowpanes of the small clinic, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. It wasn't glamorous work, treating patients in this rundown corner of the city, but it was honest and necessary.

Charts overflowed from a rickety filing cabinet, a lone plant wilted pathetically in the corner, and the therapy equipment was patched together with duct tape and hope. It wasn't much, but Amelia poured her heart into every session, coaxing strength back into weary limbs and mending shattered spirits along the way.
