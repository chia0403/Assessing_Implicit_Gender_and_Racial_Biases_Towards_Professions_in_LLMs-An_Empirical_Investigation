The salty tang of the sea air whipped Elara Rosalind Bellwether's hair around her face as she stood on the cliff edge, easel abandoned beside her. Below, waves crashed against jagged rocks, sending plumes of white spray skyward. It was a scene begging to be captured on canvas, the raw power and untamed beauty echoing something deep within Elara's own soul.

The Isle of Skye was her refuge, a place where the wind whispered ancient secrets and the landscape itself seemed to breathe with a wild, elemental force. Elara had come seeking inspiration, fleeing the stifling expectations of London's art scene and the ghosts that haunted her studio there. Here, amongst the towering cliffs and mist-shrouded mountains, she hoped to find not only new subject matter but also a sense of peace she hadn't known in years.
