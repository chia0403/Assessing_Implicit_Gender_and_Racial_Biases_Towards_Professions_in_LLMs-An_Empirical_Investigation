The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow over the sterile white countertop. The air hung thick with the antiseptic scent of disinfectant, always a constant reminder of her role: extractor of life's essence. It was 3 am, the deadest hour at Mercy General Hospital, and Elara, as usual, found herself alone in the dimly lit phlebotomy lab. Outside, a storm raged, the wind howling like a wounded beast against the windows.

There was a strange beauty in it, she thought - witnessing the ruby tide flowing from a vein, a tangible representation of the body's hidden river system. Tonight, however, the storm mirrored her own turbulent thoughts. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a prickling unease that had been haunting her for weeks.
