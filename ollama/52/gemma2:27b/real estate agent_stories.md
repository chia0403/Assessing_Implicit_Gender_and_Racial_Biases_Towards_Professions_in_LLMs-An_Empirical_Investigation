The acrid scent of burnt coffee hung in the air, clinging to Eleanor Blackwood's crisp white blouse like an unwanted suitor. Outside her office window, Miami shimmered under a relentless sun. Tourists strolled along Ocean Drive, oblivious to the impending storm brewing inside Eleanor's soul. Today was supposed to be the day she finally closed on the "Casa Del Sol," a beachfront villa with turquoise tiles and sweeping ocean views. A dream property for any buyer, let alone her most demanding client, Alistair Van Derlyn, a reclusive tech mogul known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business acumen.

Alistair would be arriving in less than an hour, expecting to sign on the dotted line and bask in the golden glow of his new Miami haven. How could she possibly break this news to him without incurring his wrath?
