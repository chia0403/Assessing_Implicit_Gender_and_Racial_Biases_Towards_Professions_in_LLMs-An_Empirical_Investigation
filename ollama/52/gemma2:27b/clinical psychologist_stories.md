The rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's office, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her patient. Evelyn, with her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun and spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose, leaned forward, her gaze steady and unwavering. Across from her sat Amelia Hayes, her hands twisting nervously in her lap. The air in the room was thick with unspoken tension, punctuated only by the insistent drumming of the rain and the occasional sniffle from Amelia.

Evelyn's office, nestled on the third floor of a Victorian townhouse overlooking a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town, was a haven of warmth and calm amidst the city's often-grey skies. Bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with tomes on psychology, philosophy, and literature. A worn armchair sat invitingly across from Evelyn's antique mahogany desk, its cushions plumped and ready to cradle weary souls. 

But today, even the comforting ambiance couldn't soothe Amelia's palpable distress. Her eyes darted around the room, unable to meet Evelyn's gaze for more than a fleeting moment.  Something was deeply wrong, something that extended beyond Amelia's usual bouts of anxiety. Evelyn, her intuition tingling, knew this session would be anything but ordinary.

"Amelia," Evelyn began softly, her voice laced with concern, "tell me what's troubling you."
