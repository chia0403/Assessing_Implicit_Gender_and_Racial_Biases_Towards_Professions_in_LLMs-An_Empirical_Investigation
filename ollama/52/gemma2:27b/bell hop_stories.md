The brass gleamed under the dim chandelier light, reflecting back distorted images of the opulent lobby. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins adjusted his scarlet uniform cap with a sigh, wishing he were anywhere but here: the Grand Blackwood Hotel, bastion of wealth and privilege. He hated the smell of lilies that always permeated the air, their cloying sweetness a constant reminder of the gulf between him and the guests who treated him like a shadow, barely acknowledging his presence unless they needed something moved.

Tonight was particularly slow. A light drizzle was keeping the usual flurry of arriving guests at bay, leaving Bart to idly polish the marble counter by the entrance, his gaze drifting towards the rain-streaked windowpanes.  The only sound was the soft tick of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional rustle of a newspaper being read by a lone guest seated near the fireplace.

Suddenly, a gust of wind slammed against the double doors, sending them swinging open with a dramatic whoosh. Bart straightened up, his hand instinctively reaching for the bellhop cart beside him. In walked a figure so striking, so out of place in the hotel's muted elegance, that Bart nearly dropped the polish cloth.

The newcomer was tall and slender, dressed in a long black coat that concealed their features.  A wide-brimmed hat obscured their face, casting a deep shadow over the figure's form.  Bart couldn't tell if they were male or female, but he sensed an air of mystery, perhaps even danger, emanating from them.
