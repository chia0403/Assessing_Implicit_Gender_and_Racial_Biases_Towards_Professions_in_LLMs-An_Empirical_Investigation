The insistent chime of the phone ripped Amelia Winthrop from her daydream, scattering the image of herself on a sun-drenched beach sipping something fruity with an umbrella in it. She sighed, smoothing down her crisp blue blouse and reaching for the receiver.

"Good morning, Zenith Pharmaceuticals," she chirped, plastering on her most professional smile even though no one could see it through the phone line. "This is Amelia speaking, how may I direct your call?"

Zenith Pharmaceuticals wasn't exactly glamorous. Located in a hulking grey office building overlooking a perpetually clogged highway, it was more sterile than inspiring. Yet Amelia had found a strange comfort in its predictable routine. Every day was much the same: answering phones, scheduling meetings, sorting mail. It was a monotonous symphony she knew by heart, punctuated only by the occasional erratic note of an irate client or a bewildered intern. 

But today felt different. A tingling anticipation danced beneath Amelia's skin. Perhaps it was the unusually clear blue sky peeking through the smog-stained window, or maybe the new potted fern her colleague had brought in that morning, its vibrant green leaves a beacon against the drab office walls. Whatever it was, something told Amelia this Tuesday wouldn't be like any other.
