The humid New Orleans air clung to Eloise Bernadette Dupuis like a second skin as she hurried down Bourbon Street, dodging tipsy tourists and boisterous musicians. The scent of beignets and stale beer hung heavy in the air, a familiar olfactory cocktail that usually comforted her. Today, though, it did little to soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.  She clutched the worn leather handle of her styling case tighter, its contents – brushes, combs, potions, and powders – a tangible reminder of what she was risking. Eloise wasn't headed to her usual salon nestled amongst the antique shops on Magazine Street. No, tonight she was venturing into the shadowy heart of the French Quarter for a clandestine appointment.  An appointment with Madame Evangeline, the city’s most infamous voodoo queen.
