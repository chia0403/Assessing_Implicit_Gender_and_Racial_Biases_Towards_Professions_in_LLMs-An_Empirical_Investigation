The acrid smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, stinging Emilia Blackwood's nostrils as she surveyed the skeletal remains of what was once a grand Victorian mansion. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through gaping holes in the roof, illuminating centuries-old wallpaper peeling from damp walls like scabs. The silence was unsettling, broken only by the distant rasp of a crow and the ominous creak of settling timbers.

Emilia, her charcoal grey pencil skirt brushing against the overgrown weeds sprouting through cracks in the pavement, adjusted her hard hat. This derelict beauty on the edge of Edinburgh's historic district was her latest challenge â€“ a testament to both decay and potential. The Blackwood Architectural firm, renowned for its innovative restorations and sustainable designs, had been tasked with breathing life back into this crumbling relic.

Emilia loved these projects, the thrill of unearthing hidden stories within forgotten spaces. But this one felt different. As she stepped cautiously across the threshold, a shiver ran down her spine, an eerie sense that she wasn't alone.
