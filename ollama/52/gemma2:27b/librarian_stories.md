Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, blurring the stained-glass depictions of mythical beasts into swirling watercolor streaks. The scent of damp parchment mingled with woodsmoke from the hearth, creating a uniquely comforting aroma that Amelia Blackwood, head librarian for the past twenty years, had come to associate with solace. 

She straightened a stack of dusty tomes on a rolling cart, her fingers tracing the embossed titles - "The Language of Flowers," "A Treatise on Celestial Mechanics," and "The Art of Falconry." Each book held within it a world waiting to be explored, a silent promise of adventure and knowledge. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, but inside the library, all was calm, save for the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner and the soft murmur of Amelia turning a page in her own well-worn copy of "Wuthering Heights."

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Amelia's spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place. It was as if the library itself held its breath, waiting for something to happen.
