Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Blackwood Manor, blurring the already fading light into an impressionist smear of grey and brown. Inside, Eleanor Cavendish-Davies meticulously polished the silver tea service, each gentle swipe revealing the gleam beneath years of tarnish. The rhythmic clinking was punctuated by the occasional boom of thunder that seemed to shake the very foundations of the sprawling Victorian mansion. Blackwood Manor, with its labyrinthine hallways and shadowed corners, held a peculiar allure for Eleanor. Despite its grandeur, it felt strangely lonely.

Eleanor wasn't just any housekeeper; she was practically a fixture, having served the Blackwood family for over twenty years. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind through the ancient oak trees that lined the driveway. Yet, tonight, something felt different. An uneasy tension hung in the air, thicker than the scent of lavender polish Eleanor favored. The absence of the Blackwood family – away on a rare extended trip – only amplified this unsettling feeling.

Eleanor paused her polishing, listening intently. Had she imagined it, or was there a faint scratching sound coming from the attic door?
