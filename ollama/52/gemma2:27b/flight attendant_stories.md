The stale air hung heavy in the galley, thick with the smell of reheated coffee and anxious sweat. Seraphina "Sera" Dubois tapped her manicured nails on the stainless steel counter, listening to the muffled drone of the engines and the occasional whimper from a restless baby somewhere in economy. 

Outside the tiny window, darkness swallowed the world, punctuated only by the faint glimmering constellations. Sera squinted at them, imagining herself hurtling through space alongside those distant stars, free from the confines of this cramped metal tube hurtling towards Tokyo.

She'd always loved flying – the sensation of weightlessness during takeoff, the breathtaking vistas from above the clouds – but lately, the novelty had worn thin. Three years as a flight attendant for Celestial Airways had dulled the sparkle. The endless cycle of serving lukewarm meals, placating unruly passengers, and navigating cramped aisles was starting to feel like a gilded cage. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hummed through the cabin, a subtle shift in the air that sent goosebumps prickling down Sera's arms. It started with a flicker of the overhead lights, followed by an unsettling silence from the cockpit. Then, the captain’s voice crackled over the intercom, his tone strained and urgent.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Please remain seated and fasten your seatbelts. We are experiencing some minor technical difficulties.”


Sera's heart skipped a beat. Minor technical difficulties? Those words rarely ended well.
