Amelia, toned and tanned in her signature turquoise tank top and leggings, smiled encouragingly.

"One more set, warriors! Push through that burn," she bellowed, her voice carrying a hint of her Cuban heritage â€“ a fiery passion tempered by years of disciplined practice. "Remember what we're fighting for: strength, resilience, and that beach body ready for spring break!"
