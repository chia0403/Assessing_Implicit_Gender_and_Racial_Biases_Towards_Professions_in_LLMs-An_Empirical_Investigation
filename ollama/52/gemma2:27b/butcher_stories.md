The air hung thick with the scent of iron and woodsmoke in Bartholomew "Bart" Grimshaw's shop. Dawn was just breaking, painting the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven Market in shades of dusty rose and bruised lavender. Bart, his apron stained crimson from yesterday's work, wrestled a side of beef onto the butcher block, its marbling gleaming under the weak light filtering through the grimy windowpane. The rhythmic thud of cleaver against bone echoed through the empty shop, a familiar symphony that lulled him into a state of focused calm.

Oakhaven Market was Bart's domain. He knew each stallholder, each cobbled alleyway, every creak and groan of the ancient timber buildings. It had been his grandfather's market before him, passed down through generations like a treasured heirloom. But lately, a shadow had fallen over Oakhaven. Whispers of disappearances haunted the marketplace, leaving a lingering chill in the air even on the warmest days.
