The sun cracked the horizon, spilling orange and pink onto Silas Thaddeus Blackwood's tired face. He blinked, squinting against the rising light, his calloused fingers still wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee. The barn behind him groaned in the breeze, its weathered wood protesting another day's labor. Silas took a long swig, the bitter brew settling warmly in his gut.

His land stretched before him, a tapestry of emerald fields and golden wheat, punctuated by the deep green silhouette of the Blackwood Forest. Generations of Blackwoods had worked this soil, their sweat and toil woven into the very fabric of the land. But lately, the whispers on the wind carried more than just the rustle of leaves â€“ they spoke of change, of something unsettling lurking in the shadows of the forest.
