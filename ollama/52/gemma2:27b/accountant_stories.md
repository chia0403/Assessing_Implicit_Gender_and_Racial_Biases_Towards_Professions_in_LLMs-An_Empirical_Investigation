Rain lashed against the windows of Elias Finch's tiny office, each drop a miniature hammer blow on the warped glass. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, a counterpoint to the frantic buzzing in Elias's chest. Spread out before him on his ancient oak desk were stacks of invoices and receipts, their numbers blurring into an indecipherable mess. Usually, Elias found solace in the logic of ledgers, the comforting certainty of debit equalling credit. But tonight, his usual calm had deserted him.

His client, Mrs. Adelaide Hawthorne, was a formidable woman with a temper as sharp as her tailored suits. She expected perfection, and Elias, despite years of meticulous practice, felt a creeping dread that he wouldn't be able to deliver it. Her late husband's estate was a labyrinthine tangle of offshore accounts, shell companies, and suspiciously large donations to obscure charities. Unraveling it all before the deadline seemed impossible. 

Elias glanced at the antique clock ticking away on the wall, its hands approaching midnight with relentless precision. The rain showed no signs of letting up, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. He had to find a solution, or Mrs. Hawthorne's wrath would be a tempest he wouldn't survive.
