The incessant buzzing of fluorescent lights grated on Dr. Evelyn Pierce's nerves as she adjusted her spectacles and peered at the X-ray glowing on the screen. The patient, a burly construction worker named Earl, shifted uncomfortably on the examination table, his face contorted in pain.  Evelyn sighed.  Another Monday morning in Harmony Creek, Colorado, population 3,482 (according to the last census). A town where everyone knew your name and your aches and pains, often simultaneously.

Harmony Creek was a picturesque mountain town nestled amidst towering pines and rushing rivers. Quaint shops lined Main Street, their windows adorned with colorful quilts and hand-painted pottery. The air smelled of pine needles and freshly brewed coffee, yet beneath the idyllic façade lay a simmering tension. The town's largest employer, the Harmony Creek Lumber Mill, had recently announced layoffs, leaving many residents facing an uncertain future.


Evelyn, having grown up in Harmony Creek herself, knew these anxieties intimately. She had opened her chiropractic practice two years ago, hoping to offer a haven of healing and well-being in a time of uncertainty. But lately, even Evelyn's optimism was waning.  Earl’s injury, a torn rotator cuff from falling off scaffolding, felt like a symptom of something larger, a deeper unease settling upon the town.
