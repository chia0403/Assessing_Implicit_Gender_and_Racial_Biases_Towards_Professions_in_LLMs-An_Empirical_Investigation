Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Sunnyside Daycare, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Amelia Rose Cartwright's already frayed nerves. The storm had rolled in unexpectedly, catching everyone off guard. Parents were scrambling, their faces etched with worry as they tried to navigate flooded streets and downed power lines to reach their children.

Amelia, known affectionately as "Miss Amy" by her little charges, stood at the front of the brightly colored playroom, her heart thudding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. The six toddlers under her care were huddled together on a rainbow-hued rug, eyes wide with apprehension as the wind howled outside. She forced a smile, hoping it didn't look too strained. "Don't worry, little ones," she said in a voice that was far steadier than she felt. "The storm will pass soon, and we'll have lots of fun until your mommies and daddies get here." 

But even as she spoke, a flicker of unease crept through her. The power flickered ominously, plunging the room into momentary darkness before sputtering back to life. Something about this storm felt different, heavier, more ominous than any she'd experienced before.
