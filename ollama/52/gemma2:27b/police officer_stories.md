Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the precinct house, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Detective Elias Thorne. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across his desk, already cluttered with case files, empty coffee cups, and half-eaten donuts. Outside, sirens wailed in the distance, a constant reminder of the city's simmering unrest. 

Tonight, however, Elias wasn't concerned with petty theft or bar brawls. He stared at the photograph pinned to his corkboard - a young woman with eyes the color of spring sky and a smile that could melt glaciers. Amelia Rose Parker. Missing for three days.

The weight of her disappearance pressed down on him like a physical force. Amelia wasn't just another case; she was the daughter of Elias's childhood friend, a woman he'd known since they were kids splashing in the shallows of Lake Michigan. 


He clenched his jaw, frustration and determination battling for dominance within him. He had to find her. The city wouldn't sleep until Amelia Rose Parker came home.
