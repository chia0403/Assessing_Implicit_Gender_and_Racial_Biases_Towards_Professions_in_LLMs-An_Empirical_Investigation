Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' office, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow on the frosted glass. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Higgins & Sons Insurance: Protecting Your Tomorrow," cast a sickly green glow across his cluttered desk. Papers overflowed from overflowing in-trays, insurance policies lay scattered like fallen leaves, and a half-eaten tuna sandwich sat precariously close to a vintage rotary phone. Bart himself, a man whose receding hairline and perpetually rumpled suit mirrored the disarray of his surroundings, stared out at the relentless downpour with an air of weary resignation. 

He was facing a particularly trying week. Claims were piling up faster than he could process them, Mrs. Henderson from down the street had threatened to sue him for misplacing her dog's life insurance policy (the dog, ironically, had passed away peacefully in its sleep), and his boss, Bartholomew Sr., was breathing down his neck about meeting quarterly targets. Bart needed a win, something to break through the monotonous fog of paperwork and disgruntled clients.  Little did he know that this gloomy Wednesday would deliver a case unlike any he'd ever encountered before.
