Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-tinged water. The air hung heavy with the scent of wet asphalt and distant sewage – a familiar perfume for Theodore “Teddy” Bartholomew, master plumber of Elmwood Avenue. His workshop, tucked away behind Mrs. O’Malley's perpetually blooming hydrangeas, was a symphony of clanking pipes, hissing steam, and Teddy’s own gruff humming as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn faucet. 

A harsh buzz from his ancient rotary phone jolted him back to reality. He wiped his grease-stained hands on his overalls before answering, "Bartholomew Plumbing, Teddy speaking."  The voice on the other end was frantic, breathless – a woman clearly in distress.
