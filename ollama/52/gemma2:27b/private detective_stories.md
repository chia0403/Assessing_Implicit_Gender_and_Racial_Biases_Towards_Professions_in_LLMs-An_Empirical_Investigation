The rain hammered against the cracked windowpane of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat echoing his own restless heart.  Smoke curled lazily from the end of his cigarette, twisting in the air like a phantom dancer before disappearing into the gloom. Outside, neon signs flickered through the perpetual drizzle of New Orleans, casting lurid reflections on the greasy cobblestones below.  Thorne's office, tucked away above a dingy jazz bar called "The Rusty Trumpet", wasn't much to look at: threadbare carpet, faded posters peeling from the damp walls, and a desk cluttered with half-empty coffee mugs and stacks of dusty case files. But for Elias Thorne, a man who knew the city's dark underbelly better than most, it was home.

Tonight, however, even the familiar scent of stale whiskey and old paper couldn't quell the unease gnawing at him. He hadn't taken on a new case in weeks, the silence broken only by the insistent drip of a leaky faucet and the distant wail of sirens.  Just as he was about to call it a night, the door creaked open, revealing a silhouette framed against the neon glow of the street below. The figure stepped inside, shedding rain like a dog shaking itself dry, and Elias Thorne's gut twisted with a premonition that this case wouldn't be like any other.
