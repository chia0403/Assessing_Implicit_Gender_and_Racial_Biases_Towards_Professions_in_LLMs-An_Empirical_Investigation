The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort to Elara Blackwood. Her restaurant, "The Crooked Chimney," nestled on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town, buzzed with pre-dinner anticipation. Candlelight flickered off copper pots hanging from the exposed beams, casting dancing shadows on the worn stone walls. 

Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a braid, moved through the kitchen with the grace of a seasoned dancer. Her hands, dusted with flour and flecked with pepper burns, worked with practiced efficiency as she inspected a simmering pot of venison stew. Tonight was Hogmanay, Edinburgh's famed New Year's Eve celebration, and The Crooked Chimney was overflowing with reservations.

A sharp rap on the kitchen door broke Elara's concentration. Before she could answer, it swung open, revealing her sous chef, Iain MacTavish, his face flushed and eyes wide with alarm. "Elara," he stammered, "there's a man asking for you... at the front door." 

Elara paused, her spoon hovering over the stew.  Something about Iain's tone sent a shiver down her spine. "What does he look like?" she asked cautiously.

Iain hesitated. "He's tall," he finally said, "dressed in black, with a...a raven perched on his shoulder."
