Rain lashed against the windows of "Tranquility Touch," the rhythmic drumming mirroring the insistent ache in Eloise Beaumont's shoulders. It was a Thursday, typically her busiest day, but today only two clients had braved the storm. The usually cheerful scent of lavender and sandalwood oil seemed muted by the grey gloom seeping through the glass. 

Eloise sighed, idly watching the water cascade down the pane.  Her phone buzzed on the counter â€“ another cancellation. This relentless drizzle was starting to feel like a personal affront. She'd been looking forward to a full schedule, desperate for the extra income after her car decided to spontaneously combust last week. Now she stared at the empty massage table, its plush linen sheet mockingly inviting, and wondered if maybe she should just call it a day.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing an unexpected arrival. Eloise straightened, forcing a smile onto her face. Perhaps the rain gods weren't entirely against her after all.
