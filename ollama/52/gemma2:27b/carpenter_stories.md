The smell of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elijah Blackwood. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of his workshop, illuminating the fine shavings scattered across the workbench like fallen snow. Outside, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer echoed through the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a melody as constant and reassuring as Elijah's own heartbeat. 

He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth curve of a half-carved oak chair leg, his eyes tracing the delicate swirls he had painstakingly etched into the wood. This commission, for the town magistrate, was proving particularly challenging - the man demanded intricate detailing, a tapestry of leaves and vines interwoven with mythical creatures. Elijah relished the challenge, though. He saw himself not merely as a carpenter, but as an artist who breathed life into inanimate objects. 

But today, his focus wavered. A nagging unease, like a splinter lodged beneath his skin, refused to be dislodged. The whispers circulating through Oakhaven lately - rumors of strange lights in the forest, unsettling animal behavior, and villagers disappearing without a trace - were beginning to gnaw at him.
