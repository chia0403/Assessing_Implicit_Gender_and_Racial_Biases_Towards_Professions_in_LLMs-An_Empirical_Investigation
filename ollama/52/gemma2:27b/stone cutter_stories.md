The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's weathered neck as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Dust danced in the air, catching the golden light and swirling around his calloused hands. He paused, wiping sweat from his brow with a rag already stained grey from years of use. The quarry echoed with the rhythmic clangs of hammers against stone, punctuated by the occasional shouted order or gruff laughter. Elias squinted at the emerging shape â€“ a simple sundial, commissioned by a wealthy merchant for his garden.

His workshop was nestled on the outskirts of Port Azure, a bustling port city known for its sapphire-blue harbor and vibrant trade. The scent of salt air mingled with the earthy aroma of freshly cut stone, creating a unique fragrance that Elias had come to associate with home.
