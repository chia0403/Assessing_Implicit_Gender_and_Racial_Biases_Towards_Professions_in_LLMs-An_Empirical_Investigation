The humid air clung to Elias Finch like a damp shroud as he trudged through the overgrown alleyway. His camera bag thumped against his thigh, each impact sending a tremor up his arm. The stench of rotting refuse mingled with the sweet, cloying scent of jasmine from a nearby window box, creating a uniquely New Orleans olfactory experience. Above, laundry lines crisscrossed the narrow space, festooned with brightly coloured sheets and underwear that fluttered like nervous butterflies in the afternoon breeze.

Elias stopped beneath a rusted fire escape, its metal groaning under the weight of years and neglect. He peered into the shadowed maw of the building opposite, drawn by the play of light and shadow across its peeling facade. This was why he loved New Orleans â€“ every corner held a story, waiting to be captured through his lens.  Today, that story seemed to whisper from the boarded-up windows and crumbling brickwork of this forgotten alleyway.
