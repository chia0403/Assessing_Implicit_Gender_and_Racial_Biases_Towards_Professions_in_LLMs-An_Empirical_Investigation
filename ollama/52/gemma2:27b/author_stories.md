Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming in Eloise Cavendish's chest.  Her fingers hovered over the worn keys of her ancient typewriter, each click echoing like a hammer blow in the cavernous silence. The manuscript lay open before her, its pages filled with neat cursive â€“ a gothic tale woven from shadows and secrets, set in the crumbling manor house she now called home. 

Outside, a gnarled oak tree clawed at the stormy sky, its branches scraping against the roof like skeletal fingers. Eloise shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders. The manor, inherited from a distant aunt she barely knew, was a labyrinth of darkened hallways and echoing rooms, each one whispering with forgotten stories.

It was here, amidst the dust motes dancing in shafts of pale moonlight, that Eloise sought inspiration for her novels. But tonight, the words refused to come, replaced by a gnawing unease that tightened its grip on her heart.  Perhaps it was the howling wind, or the unsettling creaks and groans emanating from the house's depths. Or maybe it was the story itself, bleeding into reality, blurring the lines between fiction and fear.
