The air hung thick with the scent of lavender water and beeswax in Bartholomew Finch's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing above bolts of velvet, silk, and linen. Bartholomew, his silver hair escaping its bun and wrinkles etching deep lines around his kind eyes, hunched over a half-finished doublet, meticulously stitching a pearl button onto its collar. Outside, the cobblestone streets of 17th century London bustled with life â€“ merchants hawking their wares, carriages clattering past, and children chasing pigeons through the square. But in Bartholomew's sanctuary, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic click of his needle against fabric and the soft sigh of thread being pulled taut.


Today was a day for finishing touches. He had promised Lady Winthrop a new gown by nightfall, one fit for a duchess attending the King's masquerade ball. The silk shimmered a deep emerald green, its intricate embroidery depicting mythical creatures intertwined amongst blooming roses. Bartholomew imagined her gliding through the grand ballroom, a vision of elegance and grace, and a small smile touched his lips. He took pride in his work, finding solace in transforming mere cloth into garments that empowered and inspired those who wore them.  

But today, a disquiet gnawed at Bartholomew's heart. A crumpled note lay on his workbench, its words barely legible: "Meet me at the docks tonight. Midnight sharp." The sender was unknown, their intentions unclear. Bartholomew, a man who preferred the quiet order of his workshop to the shadows and whispers of London's underbelly, felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew he should ignore it, but something compelled him forward, a thread of curiosity tangled with a growing sense of dread.
