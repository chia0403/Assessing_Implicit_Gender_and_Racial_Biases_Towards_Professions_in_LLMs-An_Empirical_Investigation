The late September sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Winthrop's kindergarten classroom, casting long shadows across the crayon-splattered tables and alphabet rug. The scent of glue and naptime lingered in the air, a comforting aroma to Eleanor's weary senses. She perched on the edge of her tiny chair, exhaustion tugging at her eyelids as she surveyed the wreckage left behind by twenty five-year-olds. 

Construction paper dinosaurs lay strewn across the floor, their papier-mâché tails drooping forlornly. Glitter, a kindergarten teacher’s eternal nemesis, shimmered ominously on every surface imaginable, even clinging stubbornly to Eleanor's cardigan. Despite the chaos, a smile tugged at her lips. Her little charges had been engrossed in their prehistoric project all afternoon, their imaginations running wild with roars and stomps.  

But now it was time for cleanup, and Eleanor knew the monumental task ahead of her. As she began gathering stray crayons and crumpled construction paper, a sharp rapping on the door startled her. It wasn't time for dismissal yet… who could that be?
