The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer – a peculiar perfume unique to Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the sterile air, casting long shadows across the gleaming exercise equipment. A small vase filled with wilting sunflowers sat on the reception desk, forgotten amidst the flurry of patient appointments that filled Dr. Vance's day.

Eleanor, her name tag pinned neatly to a crisp white blouse, adjusted her stethoscope and ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls. The rhythmic tapping of her keyboard echoed in the otherwise quiet space as she reviewed Mr. Henderson’s MRI results – a fractured femur requiring months of rehabilitation.  He was due in any moment, and Eleanor hoped his spirits wouldn't be dampened by the news. She always found it harder to deliver bad diagnoses than to guide her patients through their recovery. 


This story takes place in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s private physical therapy practice nestled on a quiet suburban street.
