The scent of antiseptic and damp fur hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional mewling cry from a frightened kitten. Dr. Evelyn Rosethorn sighed, leaning against the worn countertop of her small clinic, 'Rosethorn's Animal Hospital'. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was home.  

She ran a hand through her tangled auburn hair, exhaustion pulling at her eyelids. The day had started like any other: a flurry of vaccinations, check-ups, and the occasional emergency. This town, nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont, relied on Evelyn's clinic for all its furry (and scaly) needs. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor as the last patient, Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s pug, Buster, waddled out, his tail wagging apologetically.  Evelyn wiped down the counter one last time, her gaze falling on a faded photograph of her father, Dr. Thomas Rosethorn, hanging above the sink. He had started this clinic decades ago, and Evelyn, ever since she was a child, knew this was where she belonged.


The silence that followed Buster's departure felt heavy, almost expectant.  Evelyn felt it too - a shift in the air, a prickle of unease at the back of her neck.
