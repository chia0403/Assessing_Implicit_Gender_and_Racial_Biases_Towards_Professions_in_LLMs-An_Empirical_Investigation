The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax and lemon polish as Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright meticulously cleaned the antique silver tea set. Sunbeams, fractured by stained glass, painted dancing patterns on the Persian rug beneath her feet.  

Evelyn had worked for the Vanderbilts for twenty years, longer than any other member of their staff, and knew the rhythm of this opulent house like the back of her hand. The grand hall with its sweeping staircase, the sun-drenched conservatory brimming with exotic flowers, even the faint whisper of history that lingered in the shadowed corners – it was all a symphony to Evelyn’s practiced ear. 

Yet, today, something felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the surface of her familiar routine, like a discordant note in an otherwise harmonious melody.  The usually boisterous laughter from the Vanderbilts' weekly Sunday brunch was absent. Even the clinking of teacups, normally a comforting soundtrack to her chores, seemed muted.


As Evelyn placed the last silver spoon back into its velvet-lined case, she noticed a small, unassuming package resting on the mahogany side table. It was addressed simply to "Evelyn" in elegant cursive script and tied with a crimson ribbon. Curiosity tugged at her, a feeling rarely allowed herself within the confines of this perfectly ordered world.  She hesitated, then, unable to resist any longer, reached out and slowly untied the ribbon.
