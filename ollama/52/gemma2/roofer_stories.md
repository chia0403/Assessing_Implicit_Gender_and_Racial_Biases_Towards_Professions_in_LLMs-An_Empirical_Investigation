The sun beat down on Elias Thatcher’s neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging his eyes as he carefully maneuvered another shingle onto the sloping roof. The wind, hot and dry, carried the scent of dust and distant pine needles. Below him, the bustling city of Albuquerque spread out like a dusty patchwork quilt, a vibrant tapestry of terracotta roofs, sun-bleached stucco, and shimmering asphalt stretching towards the hazy blue horizon. 

Elias squinted at the gleaming silver peak of El Capitan rising proudly in the distance, its jagged silhouette an enduring monument to the rugged beauty that surrounded them. The familiar ache in his shoulders was a constant reminder of his trade – a legacy passed down from his grandfather, a weathered and wise old man who'd taught him everything he knew about balancing precariously on rooftops, wielding a hammer with precision, and reading the language of the wind through the swaying branches of piñon pines.  

But today, Elias wasn’t focused on the familiar rhythm of his work. A knot of anxiety tightened in his gut, fueled by the terse phone call he'd received earlier that morning. Something was wrong. Very wrong. His sister, Amelia, had called, her voice trembling with an unfamiliar fear. She needed him, and Elias knew, with a chilling certainty, that this wasn’t just another routine check-in.
