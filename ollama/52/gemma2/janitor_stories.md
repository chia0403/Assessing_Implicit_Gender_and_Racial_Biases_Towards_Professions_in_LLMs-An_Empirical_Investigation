The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in the bowels of the Grandview Tower.  Moonlight sliced through grimy windows, casting elongated shadows across the deserted lobby.  Edgar Bartholomew "Eddie" Finch, mop clutched in his calloused hand, sighed as he surveyed the scene. Empty water bottles littered the floor like fallen soldiers, remnants of hurried meetings and forgotten dreams. The plush carpet, once a vibrant red, now bore the faint imprint of countless hurried footsteps, each one a whispered tale of ambition and failure. Eddie knew these stories better than anyone.  His nightshift at Grandview wasn't just about cleaning; it was about witnessing the quiet dramas that unfolded when everyone else had gone home.  


Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down Eddieâ€™s spine as he neared the elevator bank. He stopped, listening. The usual hum of the city seemed muffled, replaced by a strange, unsettling silence. 


Eddie took a deep breath and stepped towards the elevators, his heart pounding an erratic rhythm against his ribs.  He wasn't afraid, not exactly. Just...uncertain. As if the tower itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
