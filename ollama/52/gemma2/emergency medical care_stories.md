Rain lashed against the windshield of Sergeant Amelia Rose Hawthorne's ambulance, blurring the city lights into shimmering halos.  The siren wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the storm's fury, as she weaved through traffic, her headlights cutting through the deluge like beacons in the swirling chaos. 

Amelia, known affectionately as "Hawthorne" by her colleagues at Station 17, gripped the steering wheel tighter, adrenaline already surging through her veins. The call had come in just minutes ago - a possible cardiac arrest at a crowded concert venue downtown.  A festival celebrating the city's annual arts week, she remembered, buzzing with life until now. 

Amelia glanced at her partner, rookie EMT Kai Miller, his face pale but determined beneath the flashing blue lights. "Ready?" she asked, her voice calm despite the urgency clawing at her gut.

Kai nodded, gripping the medical kit tighter.  "Ready."


The rain seemed to intensify as they skidded to a halt outside the venue, a grand old theatre draped in shadows and soaked with downpour. The crowd had dispersed, leaving behind a scattering of discarded umbrellas and a sense of disquiet.
