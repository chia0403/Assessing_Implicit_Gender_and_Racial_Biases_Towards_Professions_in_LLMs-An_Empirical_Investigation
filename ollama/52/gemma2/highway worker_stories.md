The sunrise bled across the asphalt, painting long streaks of orange and pink across the cracked surface of Highway 78. Dew clung to the grass that stubbornly sprouted through the cracks in the median, each blade glittering like a miniature emerald spear.  

Eleanor "Ellie" Mae Butterfield pulled on her work gloves, the worn leather warm against her calloused hands. She stretched, feeling the familiar ache in her lower back – a testament to years of shoveling gravel and patching potholes. Ellie took a deep breath of the crisp morning air, the smell of pine needles and damp earth grounding her in the rhythm of this life, a life that felt as steady and predictable as the sunrise itself. 


Today, like every other day, she would be part of the invisible force keeping the world moving – patching, smoothing, maintaining the artery of asphalt that carried countless stories, dreams, and lives along its ribboned path.  Ellie knew every bend and bump of Highway 78 like the lines on her own palm, a silent witness to the fleeting dramas that unfolded within its boundaries.
