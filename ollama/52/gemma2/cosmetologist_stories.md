The neon sign buzzed like a disgruntled bee, casting sickly green light across Isabella "Izzy" Beaumont's reflection in the shop window. It was just past midnight, the hour when reality blurred for those left awake, and Izzy felt it humming around her.  Her reflection, usually bright with practiced confidence, seemed faded tonight. The salon, “Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow,” was deserted except for Izzy herself, the faint scent of hairspray lingering like a ghost in the air. 

The humid July night pressed against the glass doors, the city's restless energy echoing through the quiet street.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the overworked air conditioner inside. Izzy sighed, running a hand through her own unruly curls, the ones she couldn't seem to tame no matter how many products she tried.  Tonight was the night she had dreaded for weeks - the salon’s annual "Best of the Year" competition, judged by the notoriously fickle fashion editor, Ms. Vivienne Dubois. 


 Izzy glanced at the door one last time, then turned back to the mess of brushes and curling irons on her station. This wasn't just a competition; it was her chance, her only shot at escaping this endless cycle of late nights and uninspired haircuts. But with each passing minute, her confidence chipped away like plaster under the relentless pressure of Ms. Dubois' scrutiny.
