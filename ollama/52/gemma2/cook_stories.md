The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather like a second skin as she stepped out onto her porch, a steaming pot of tomato basil soup in one hand and a plate piled high with sourdough bread in the other. The sun was beginning its descent, casting long shadows across her meticulously tended vegetable garden, a riot of green and red amidst the dusty browns of the late summer. Crickets chirped their evening chorus, and the scent of honeysuckle hung heavy in the air.

Amy lived in a small, ramshackle cottage on the outskirts of Savannah, a world away from the bustling city centre with its endless stream of tourists and honking cars. She had inherited the house from her eccentric Aunt Millie, who had been a renowned Southern chef known for her secret blend of spices and her legendary pecan pie. Amy, though raised in the concrete jungle of Chicago, had felt an immediate pull to this quiet, sun-drenched corner of the world after Millie's passing. Now, she was determined to honor her aunt's legacy by running the small bed and breakfast nestled within the cottage walls, serving up meals that tasted like home and happiness. 


But tonight, Amy wasn't cooking for her guests. She was cooking for herself, savoring a moment of peace before the evening rush began.  She sat on the porch swing, its rhythmic creaking a soothing lullaby, and took a long sip of her soup. The tangy tomato flavour was balanced perfectly by the sweet basil, each bite a burst of summer sunshine. As she ate, she watched fireflies begin to blink amongst the tall grass, their tiny lights flickering like fallen stars.
