The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewood's head, casting a sterile glare over the rows of gleaming stainless steel appliances in her brightly lit office kitchen. She sighed, smoothing down the crisp white linen of her apron, which felt increasingly out of place amongst the industrial-chic design. Outside, the sun was just beginning to peek over the Brooklyn skyline, painting the windows in warm hues of orange and pink, but inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of yesterday's kale smoothies and unfulfilled potential. 

Amelia, a dietician by trade and a dreamer by heart, had imagined her practice, "Nourish Your Soul," as a vibrant hub of health and community. Instead, it felt more like a lonely outpost in the vast metropolis. The early morning light filtered through the dusty glass of her windowsill herb garden, illuminating the wilting basil and the lone, stubbornly resilient mint plant.  She glanced at the empty waiting area, its sleek leather chairs arranged with sterile precision, yearning for the laughter and chatter that she knew could fill this space. 

Her phone buzzed on the counter, breaking the silence. It was a notification: "No new appointments today." Amelia swallowed her disappointment and turned back to her desk, hoping against hope that today would be different.
