Amelia "Amy" Grace Carter, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously stitched a deep gash above Ethan Hayes' left eye.  Ethan, barely conscious, groaned softly, his pale face contorted in pain. Amy, her hands steady despite the flurry of activity around them, hummed a quiet tune under her breath, a practiced mantra to keep her calm amidst the chaos. The ER was always a whirlwind - broken bones, lacerations, fevers, anxieties all swirling together in a chaotic ballet of suffering and resilience. But tonight, it felt particularly intense, the air crackling with an unspoken tension that had nothing to do with the flu season raging outside.


Amy glanced at the clock. 3:17 AM. It was well past her usual shift end time, but the influx of patients wouldn't let up. The city itself seemed to be on edge, a simmering pot about to boil over. She hoped, for Ethan's sake and everyone else's, that whatever storm was brewing would pass quickly.
