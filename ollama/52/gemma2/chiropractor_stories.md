The flickering neon sign of "Palmer's Spine Alignments" cast a sickly yellow glow on the slick asphalt outside. Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, drumming out a relentless rhythm that mirrored Dr. Eleanor Palmer’s headache. She rubbed her temples, willing the throb to subside as she surveyed the near-empty waiting room. Three thirty on a Tuesday afternoon in Maple Creek was usually a slow time, but even for this sleepy town nestled in the heart of Oregon's Willamette Valley, it felt eerily quiet.

Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the symphony of rain and creaking floorboards.  She glanced at her reflection in the polished glass front door: tired eyes framed by unruly auburn curls, a faint smudge of red lipstick barely visible beneath her mask. She straightened her scrub top, pushing down a wave of self-doubt. It was only a matter of time before Maple Creek realized they didn't need a chiropractor with fancy degrees and questionable business acumen. Maybe she should’ve stayed in Portland, where the competition was fierce but the patients were plentiful. 


But there was something about this town, tucked away amidst rolling hills and whispering pines, that had drawn her in.  Maybe it was the promise of a simpler life, or perhaps the hope of finding a sense of belonging she'd always craved. Either way, Eleanor Palmer was here to stay, even if the only patients right now were the ghosts of missed appointments and dwindling hope.
