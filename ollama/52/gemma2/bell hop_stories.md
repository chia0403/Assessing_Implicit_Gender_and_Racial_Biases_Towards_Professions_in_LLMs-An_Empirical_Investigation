The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel was thick with the scent of jasmine and old money.  It clung to Elias Bartholomew Thistlewick III like a second skin, a comforting reminder that despite his humble position as a bellhop, he was surrounded by lives of unimaginable wealth and extravagance. He polished brass handles until they gleamed like molten gold, his eyes scanning the arriving guests with practiced ease. 

Elias knew each face, each habit, each unspoken desire that flitted across their features. Tonight, though, something felt different. A storm raged outside, lashing the windows with icy rain and rattling the ancient panes. The usual symphony of clinking champagne glasses and murmured conversations was replaced by an eerie silence, punctuated only by the howling wind.  Elias shivered, pulling his threadbare coat tighter around him. This wasn't just a storm; it felt like the calm before somethingâ€¦else.
