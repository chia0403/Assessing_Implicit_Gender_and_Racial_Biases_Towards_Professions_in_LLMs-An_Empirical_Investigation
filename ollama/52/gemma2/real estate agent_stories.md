The humid Florida air clung to Amelia "Amy" Sinclair like a second skin as she surveyed the property. Spanish moss dripped from ancient oaks that cast long, eerie shadows across the overgrown lawn.  The once-grand Victorian mansion stood silent and watchful, its paint peeling like sunburned skin, revealing the bones of a forgotten era beneath.

Amy adjusted the strap of her messenger bag, the weight of brochures and contracts settling against her hip. This wasn't the kind of listing she usually handled.  Her usual clientele were young couples seeking sleek condos with balconies overlooking the shimmering turquoise ocean. But this... this was something different. A fixer-upper, steeped in history and whispers of a past long gone. 

A rusty swing set creaked mournfully in the breeze, its rusted chains singing a discordant tune. The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and damp earth, tinged with a faint sweetness Amy couldn't quite place. She pulled out her notepad, determined to ignore the unsettling feeling that prickled at the back of her neck. 


This was a challenge, she thought, a chance to breathe new life into a forgotten jewel. A chance to make history.
