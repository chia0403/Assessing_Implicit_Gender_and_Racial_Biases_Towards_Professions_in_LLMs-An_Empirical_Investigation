The diesel engine coughed and sputtered, its metallic wheeze echoing in the stillness of the deserted Wyoming desert. The moon hung low and fat in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows from the rusted tumbleweeds that skittered across the cracked asphalt.  

Inside his eighteen-wheeler, Dale Montgomery rubbed his gritty eyes, squinting at the faded map spread across his dashboard. "Sweetwater to Amarillo, another hundred miles," he muttered, his voice raspy from hours of dry desert air and lukewarm coffee. The solitude was a familiar weight on his shoulders, heavier than any load he'd ever hauled. He missed the rhythm of the city, the hum of traffic, the occasional friendly face at the diner down the street. 

Dale had been trucking for years, crisscrossing the country like a restless spirit, always chasing the horizon. It was a lonely life, sure, but it was his. And tonight, under this vast, indifferent sky, he felt that loneliness more acutely than usual. The silence stretched around him, broken only by the mournful whine of the wind through the cracked windshield and the rhythmic pulse of the engine as it chugged along the desolate highway.
