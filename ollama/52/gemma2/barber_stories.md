The bell above the door chimed its familiar jingle as Amelia "Amy" Thorne wiped down her already spotless mirror. Another Tuesday in August, another string of regulars with predictable requests: trim on top, short on the sides for Mr. Henderson, buzz cut for young Tommy, just a tidy-up for Mrs. Davis.  The air was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, familiar comforts in her little corner of downtown Brooklyn. The barbershop, "Thorne's Cuts," had been her grandfather's before him, and now it was hers, a legacy she wore like a well-worn apron. But lately, the rhythm felt different, off-beat somehow. 


The morning light streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the faded photographs of Brooklyn past â€“  her grandfather with a dapper customer in front of a brand new Ford, her mother holding a young Amy on her hip while posing proudly beside a gleaming silver trophy (Best Barber, 1982). The photographs were like whispered memories, reminders of a time when Thorne's Cuts was the heart of the neighborhood. Now, with gentrification creeping in, bringing with it trendy cafes and minimalist condos, the familiar faces seemed fewer and farther between.  The silence after the door chimed felt heavier than usual.
