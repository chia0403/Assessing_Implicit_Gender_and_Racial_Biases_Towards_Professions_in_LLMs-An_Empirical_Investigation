The air hung thick with ozone and the scent of old solder.  Elara Anyaev crouched beside the tangle of wires and vacuum tubes that constituted her workshop, a cramped space wedged between a dusty bakery and a perpetually leaking fishmonger’s stall in Petrograd's oldest district. 

Outside, the city hummed with a nervous energy – the incessant clatter of trams, the shouts of vendors peddling dubious wares, and the ever-present murmur of revolution swirling just beneath the surface. Elara, however, found solace in the predictable hiss of radio waves, the rhythmic pulse of electricity.  Here, amidst the chaos, she could control something, tinker with something, make it sing.

She squinted at the dial on her workbench – a jury-rigged contraption cobbled together from salvaged parts and a healthy dose of ingenuity. This wasn't just any radio; this was "The Nightingale," her pride and joy, capable of picking up whispers from across continents. And right now, it was dead silent.

Elara sighed, her brow furrowed with concern.  A radio technician in Petrograd was more than just a tinkerer; she was a vital lifeline to the world beyond the ever-enclosing borders.  Her silence meant information stalled, stories untold, and potentially, lives unsaved.
