The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of chamomile tea simmering on the stove.  

Eleanor Amelia Brighton, certified nutritionist extraordinaire (at least that's what her business card said), scowled at the blackened bread in the toaster. Another casualty in the ongoing war against breakfast time. She sighed, scraping the charcoal from the slots with a butter knife, her usual cheery disposition momentarily dimmed. 

Her tiny apartment in Brooklyn Heights overlooked the East River. This morning, though, the view was obscured by the dense fog that clung to the cityscape like a shroud. The silence, usually broken by the distant rumble of ferries and the clatter of city life, was almost oppressive. Even the birds seemed to have retreated into their nests, shunning the damp chill. 


Eleanor rubbed her tired eyes, feeling the weight of the impending day settle upon her shoulders.  She had a packed schedule: a morning consultation with a marathon runner struggling with energy levels, a lunch meeting with a publisher to discuss her upcoming cookbook, and an afternoon workshop on mindful eating for stressed-out professionals.  And that was before she even tackled the mountain of administrative tasks waiting on her desk. 


Taking a deep breath, Eleanor pushed aside the burnt toast and poured herself a cup of steaming tea. It was time to face the day, one nourishing bite at a time.
