The biting wind whipped across the barren plains, sending shivers down Elara Wrenâ€™s spine even through her thick woolen cloak. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like angry spirits against the backdrop of the unforgiving sky.  Elara adjusted the worn leather strap holding her chisel and mallet, their familiar weight offering a small comfort amidst the vast emptiness.
