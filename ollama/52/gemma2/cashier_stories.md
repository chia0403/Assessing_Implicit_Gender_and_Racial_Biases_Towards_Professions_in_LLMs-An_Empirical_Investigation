The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a swarm of irritated bees, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of discounted toiletries and forgotten holiday trinkets.  A thin layer of dust coated everything, undisturbed save for the occasional rogue cough from the lone customer rummaging through the clearance bin. This was Beatrice "Bea" Clementine's world – aisle after aisle of faded merchandise and the endless monotony of ringing up purchases at the cash register. 


The bell above the door chimed with a tired clang as a young man stepped in, his eyes wide and hopeful despite the depressing landscape surrounding him. He looked vaguely familiar, like someone Bea had seen before but couldn't quite place.  He approached the counter hesitantly, clutching a single tattered book to his chest. 


Bea forced a smile, her practiced greeting barely reaching her tired eyes. "Afternoon," she mumbled, tapping away at the register with robotic precision. “Anything I can help you find?”
