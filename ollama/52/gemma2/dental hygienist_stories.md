The scent of peppermint toothpaste and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of the cramped Northside Dental Clinic, a familiar aroma that both soothed and unsettled Elara. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window above her, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.

This small world, defined by gleaming metal instruments and the delicate dance of teeth and gums, was her sanctuary.
