The grimy reflection staring back at Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins from the cracked bathroom mirror wasn't exactly what one might call inspiring.  He was still wearing yesterday’s grease-stained overalls, a tangle of dark hair stuck out from under his faded baseball cap, and his eyes held the weary resignation of a man who’d seen too many clogged drains in his lifetime. Bart lived and breathed plumbing; it was more than just a job for him, it was an art form, a battle against entropy waged one leaky faucet at a time.

His current battlefield: Mrs. Peabody’s Victorian mansion in the heart of Maplewood. A town where money trees sprouted alongside oak and elm, and the air always smelled faintly of fresh-baked scones and repressed secrets. Bart knew both Mrs. Peabody and her house intimately - their plumbing had been a constant source of drama for the past fifteen years. This time, it was a full-blown crisis; the main pipe had burst, sending icy water cascading down the grand staircase like a frozen waterfall. 

Bart surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, his heart sinking as he noticed the intricate moldings at risk. Mrs. Peabody’s house wasn't just a home, it was a museum of her family history, and Bart wouldn't dare let his work damage a single delicate carving.  He muttered a curse under his breath – this was going to be a long day.
