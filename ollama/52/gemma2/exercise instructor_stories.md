The thump-thump of bass reverberated through Amelia "Amy" Bellweather's entire body. She could feel it in her teeth, her toes, even the bones in her spine humming with the rhythm.  Sweat beaded on her brow, glistening under the gym's fluorescent lights. Around her, a dozen pairs of bodies moved in synchronized chaos, mimicking her every move. Her signature spin class, "Sweat It Out," was in full swing.

The setting was a cramped basement studio tucked away in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled between rolling hills and a vast expanse of cornfields.  The air hung thick with humidity, a heady mix of exertion, disinfectant, and the sweet, metallic tang of sweat. Posters plastered on the lime-green walls promised sculpted abs, toned thighs, and "Inner Strength." But tonight, Amy wasn't thinking about any of that. 


Her gaze drifted towards the back corner, where a woman sat slumped against a wall, her face pale, breathing heavily. She hadn't moved since the class started half an hour ago.  Amy had sensed something was wrong from the beginning. The woman hadn't joined in with the others, just stood awkwardly by herself, eyes wide and unfocused. 


Something was off. This wasn’t just fatigue; this felt different. A prickle of worry snaked down Amy's spine. She needed to check on her.  Forcing a smile, she paused the music, her voice echoing through the now silent room. "Alright everyone," she said, "quick water break. We'll be back in a minute."


The beat dropped again, but this time, it was not the pulsing rhythm that filled Amy’s mind, but the quiet thud of concern beating in her chest.
