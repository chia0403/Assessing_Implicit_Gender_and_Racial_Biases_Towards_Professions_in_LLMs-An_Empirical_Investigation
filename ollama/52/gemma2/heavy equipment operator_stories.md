The morning mist clung to Caleb Thaddeus Blackwood’s weathered boots like a damp shroud. He squinted through the haze at the pre-dawn sky, the faint blush of sunrise barely pushing back the encroaching darkness.  

Caleb was perched atop his machine, a monstrous Caterpillar D9 bulldozer that dwarfed him in its sheer size. Its steel tracks groaned against the muddy ground, sending tremors up his spine and into his calloused hands gripping the controls. The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel fuel and damp earth, a familiar scent that clung to Caleb like a second skin.

He was on a remote stretch of land in rural Wyoming, miles from civilization, surrounded by rolling hills blanketed in scrub brush and dotted with skeletal wind turbines. A lone hawk circled overhead, its piercing cry echoing across the desolate landscape. This was his world – the raw, unforgiving expanse of the American West, where steel met earth, and men like Caleb carved out their existence with sweat, grit, and a steady hand on the controls.  

Today, he was tasked with clearing a swathe through the scrub for a new pipeline project. A mundane job, but one that fueled the veins of progress – or at least, that's what they told him in the bustling offices far removed from this solitude. As Caleb brought the massive blade down with a deafening crunch, pulverizing the earth before him, he couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction. He was a sculptor of sorts, shaping the land according to the dictates of mankind.  


But something felt different today. A prickling sensation at the back of his neck, an unsettling stillness in the air. Caleb dismissed it as the nerves of starting a new job. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn't alone out here. He glanced around nervously at the empty expanse before him, wondering if the whispers of the wind were carrying more than just the mournful cries of hawks.
