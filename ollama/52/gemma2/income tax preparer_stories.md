The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed in harmony with Agnes Petunia Thistlewick's fingers tapping out a rhythm on her keyboard. Outside, the January wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of "Agnes' Accounting Aces," but inside, it was warm and filled with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Agnes, her frizzy red hair pulled back in a tight bun, squinted at the overflowing filing cabinet labeled "2023 Tax Returns."  The deadline loomed like a hungry beast, its teeth bared just out of sight. Agnes knew she was in for a long night. 


This wasn't just another tax season for her; this year felt different. A new energy crackled beneath the surface, a sense that something big was about to happen. Maybe it was the unusual number of missing receipts, or the frantic whispers from clients about suspicious investments. Whatever it was, Agnes had a feeling she wouldn't be just crunching numbers â€“ she'd be unraveling secrets, and maybe even saving someone's life.
