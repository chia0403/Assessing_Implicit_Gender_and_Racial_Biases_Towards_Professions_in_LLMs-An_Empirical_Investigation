Elena, a reporter with the local rag, the Copper Creek Chronicle, knew this case would be her ticket out of the sleepy town she'd called home since childhood.  

Her fingers tightened around the worn pen, the cheap plastic cold against her skin. It was time to put aside her usual fluff pieces about bake sales and community theater productions and delve into something real, something dangerous.  The abandoned mine shaft loomed over Copper Creek like a forgotten beast, its rusted metal maw gaping open, promising secrets and shadows. Elena took a deep breath, the scent of damp earth and stale coffee filling her nostrils, and steeled herself for the journey ahead.
