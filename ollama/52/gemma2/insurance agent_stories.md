The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne like a damp blanket as she stepped out of her car. Dewdrops glistened on the azalea bushes lining the driveway of the Victorian mansion, and the scent of honeysuckle mingled with the faint smell of rain.  

Amy straightened her navy blue suit jacket, feeling the weight of the manila file folder in her hand. This was it – the biggest policy she’d ever attempted to sell. The late Mr. Bartholomew Hemmingsworth had left a fortune, but also a tangled web of complicated stipulations and beneficiaries. Amy, with her bright smile and even brighter ambition, hoped she could unravel it all and walk away with a hefty commission. 

The imposing oak doors swung open before she could knock, revealing a woman with severe features and eyes like polished obsidian. "You must be Ms. Hawthorne," the woman said, her voice crisp and cool. "I am Penelope Hemmingsworth, Bartholomew’s niece."  

Amy felt a shiver run down her spine. This wasn't going to be an easy sale.
