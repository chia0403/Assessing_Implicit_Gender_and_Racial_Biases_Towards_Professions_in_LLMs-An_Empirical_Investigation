The scent of acetone hung thick in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Esmeralda "Esme" De La Cruz.  But today, it felt like a shroud, suffocating her as she watched Mrs. Periwinkle's perfectly manicured nails transform from a pristine ivory to a shocking neon pink. 

Esme sighed, pushing away the wisps of hair escaping her braid and leaning against the counter of "The Polished Pearl," her tiny nail salon tucked into a forgotten corner of Little Havana. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust and the faded floral wallpaper that adorned the walls. A lone canary perched on its swing in the corner sang a melancholic tune, mirroring Esme's own mood.

Business was slow, even slower than usual.  The vibrant pulse of Little Havana seemed to be elsewhere today, focused on the boisterous street festival just a few blocks away. Esme found herself longing for that energy, for the clatter of voices and the intoxicating rhythm of salsa music. But here she sat, surrounded by rows of neatly labeled nail polishes, feeling as stagnant and forgotten as the chipped paint on her windowsill.
