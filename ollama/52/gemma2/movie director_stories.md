The humid August air clung to Eloise "Ellie" Blackwood like a second skin as she squinted at the crumbling mansion before her. Spanish moss dripped from its eaves, painting the weathered brick with ghostly tendrils. The once grand structure now loomed over the overgrown courtyard like a forgotten sentinel, its windows vacant eyes staring out into the decaying grandeur of Belle Isle Plantation. Ellie ran a hand through her unruly curls, feeling the familiar prickle of anxiety that always accompanied new projects. This one, however, felt different.  This was more than just another period piece; this was the chance to prove herself, to finally break free from the shackles of romantic comedies and secure her place amongst the greats. 

Ellie inhaled deeply, trying to quell the swirling anxieties in her stomach. "This is it," she murmured to herself, her voice barely audible above the rustle of wind through the overgrown garden.  "Your masterpiece." The mansion groaned around her, a sound that echoed the weight of expectation settling on Ellie's shoulders.
