The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Harper's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees.  Dust motes danced in the pale yellow glow, tracing lazy patterns across her cluttered desk. Papers, each bearing a student's messy scrawl and earnest attempt at understanding Shakespeare, formed a precarious tower beside a half-empty coffee mug. Outside, the November wind rattled against the windows of Room 213, a symphony of autumnal restlessness echoing Amelia’s own internal turmoil.

It was Wednesday afternoon, Shakespeare day, and Amelia felt adrift. The play they were studying, "Hamlet," seemed to mock her with its themes of grief, betrayal, and existential angst. She knew she should be passionate, guiding her students through the labyrinthine plot and rich language, but instead, a sense of weary apathy clung to her like a damp coat.  The words felt hollow, the characters distant. Even Hamlet’s famous “To be or not to be” soliloquy seemed less profound and more like an existential groan echoing in an empty classroom. 


Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her bun. Today was just one of those days where everything felt…off. The energy she usually found in teaching had been replaced by a gnawing weariness, a sense of being lost in the familiar routines of high school life.  Maybe it was time for a change. Or maybe, just maybe, "Hamlet" held a deeper lesson she hadn’t yet grasped.
