The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Cicadas thrummed their endless symphony in the oaks lining Maple Street, while  a lone porch swing creaked rhythmically on Mrs. Gable’s veranda. It was the kind of day that felt like being swallowed whole by a blanket of heat and stillness. Inside his beat-up Ford Ranger, Jasper “Jazz” Finley wiped sweat from his brow, squinting at the address scribbled on his worn notepad. 

“127 Maple Street,” he muttered, chewing on a piece of straw as he maneuvered the truck down the dusty driveway.  It was a quaint little bungalow, paint peeling in places, with overgrown hydrangeas choking its porch railing. The power meter hanging on the side flickered erratically, confirming his suspicions. This wasn’t going to be another routine call. 


Jazz Finley, his calloused hands stained with grease and grime, climbed out of the truck, his toolbox thumping against his leg like a reassuring heartbeat. He was used to dealing with wiring nightmares and stubborn circuits, but this one had an unsettling aura about it, like a story waiting to unfold beneath the suffocating Georgia heat.
