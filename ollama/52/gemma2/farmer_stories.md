The sun beat down on Alistair Hawthorne's weathered face as he surveyed his cornfield. Rows upon rows of emerald green stretched out before him, shimmering in the midday heat. A lone hawk circled overhead, its cry a piercing shriek against the otherwise peaceful hum of bees buzzing amongst the ripening tassels. The air was thick with the scent of freshly turned earth and the sweetness of ripening grain, a familiar aroma that Alistair had inhaled since he was a boy helping his father tend these very fields. 

Alistair's small farm, nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont, had been in his family for generations. Its lifeblood was the land itself: fertile soil, clear streams, and the changing seasons that dictated their every move.  This year, however, something felt different. A gnawing anxiety lay beneath Alistair’s usual calm demeanor, a sense that the familiar rhythm of life was about to be disrupted. 


He ran a calloused hand over his jaw, feeling the stubble prickle against his skin. The whispers in town had been growing louder – rumors of strange lights in the night sky, livestock behaving erratically, and an unsettling stillness that settled over the valley after sunset. Alistair tried to dismiss them as superstition, but deep down, a primal fear coiled in his gut. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something was coming.
