The air thrummed with anticipation, a low hum vibrating through Amelia “Ace” Everleigh’s boots as she strapped herself into the cockpit. The pre-flight check list scrolled across her HUD, each item a familiar ritual before venturing into the unpredictable chaos of the Sky Lanes. Outside, the sprawling cityscape of Neo-Babylon pulsed with neon light, a labyrinthine sprawl of holographic billboards and soaring chrome structures that pierced the perpetually twilight sky. 

Ace adjusted her flight helmet, its visor reflecting the flickering lights below. Tonight’s run was different. This wasn't just another delivery of illicit bioluminescent orchids or high-grade synth-spice across the treacherous Sky Lanes –  this shipment held a personal weight. It was a chance to prove herself worthy of joining the prestigious Night Hawks, a squadron known for their daring maneuvers and unwavering loyalty. Their leader, the legendary Captain Vega, had personally requested her presence on this mission, a risky descent into the lawless Undercity where danger lurked around every corner. 


The hum intensified as Ace powered up the engines, the sleek lines of her customized X-78 racer shimmering beneath the artificial moonbeams. This was more than just a delivery; it was a test, a leap into the unknown, and Ace was ready to soar.
