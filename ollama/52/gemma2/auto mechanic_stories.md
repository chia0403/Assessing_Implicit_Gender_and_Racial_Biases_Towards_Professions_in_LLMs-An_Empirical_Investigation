The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and desperation. Grease stained every surface of "Grease Monkey's Garage," from the chipped linoleum floor to the toolbox that rested precariously on its side, spilling wrenches like metallic cockroaches.  Sunlight pierced through grimy windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stale air. 

Jasper “Jax” Montgomery wiped his brow with a greasy rag, his calloused hand leaving an oily smear across his forehead. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, tracing the path of a faded tattoo – a snarling wolf head inked onto his cheekbone during a particularly reckless youth. He sighed, staring at the engine splayed open before him like a metal carcass.  This beat-up '67 Mustang was more trouble than it was worth, but its owner, Mrs. Henderson, had insisted he fix it. She needed it to take her granddaughter to prom. 

Jax wasn't one for sentimentality, but the worried lines etched on Mrs. Henderson's face as she clutched a faded picture of her granddaughter in a sparkling dress tugged at something within him. He might not be a prince charming rescuing damsels in distress, but maybe he could at least salvage this prom dream.


Jax grabbed his wrench, preparing to dive headfirst into the tangled mess of wires and pistons. This Mustang wasn't just another job; it was a chance to bring a little bit of joy back into this dusty, oil-stained world.
