The stale aroma of recycled air mingled with the faint scent of duty-free perfume as Elara Rose Hawthorne surveyed the cabin. It was always the same: a kaleidoscope of humanity packed into metal tubes hurtling through the sky. Some passengers were lost in their screens, others desperately trying to sleep, and some were engaged in the peculiar dance of airplane etiquette – shuffling, sighing, attempting to create personal space where there was none.

Elara, however, felt a familiar thrill at the start of each flight. The world shrinking beneath them, the clouds like fluffy cotton candy against the backdrop of an endless blue canvas – it never ceased to amaze her. It was this feeling, more than anything else, that kept her tethered to this nomadic life. Her home wasn't a house, but the sky itself, and her family, the ever-changing tapestry of passengers she encountered on each journey.  

Today’s flight, a red-eye from London to Tokyo, promised to be particularly interesting. 


Elara adjusted her blue uniform jacket, the airline's logo emblazoned across the chest like a badge of honour, and smiled at the nervous passenger in seat 23A. "Welcome aboard," she chirped, her voice carrying a hint of British lilt despite being born and raised in California.  

This was just another day in the life of Elara Rose Hawthorne, flight attendant extraordinaire.
