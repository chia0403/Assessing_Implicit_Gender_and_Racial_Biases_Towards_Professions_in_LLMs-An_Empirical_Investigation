The air in Eleanor Beaumont's tiny Brooklyn apartment was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and despair. Outside, the city hummed with the chaotic symphony of rush hour traffic, a stark contrast to the silence that had settled over her desk. The manuscript lay open before her, its pages mocking her with their bland prose and predictable plot.  

Eleanor sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. She’d spent the last twelve hours poring over this “epic fantasy” novel, hoping against hope that somewhere within its convoluted narrative and clichéd characters, a spark of originality might ignite. But all she found was a graveyard of uninspired clichés and forced metaphors. It was like reading a particularly dull history textbook disguised as a dragon-slaying adventure.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered apartment, highlighting the stacks of unread manuscripts piled precariously on every surface. Eleanor’s life had become a Sisyphean task –  a constant cycle of sifting through endless submissions, searching for that elusive gem that would make all the drudgery worthwhile.  


But tonight, her heart wasn't in it. Her passion, usually a burning ember within her soul, felt more like a flickering candle about to be extinguished.
