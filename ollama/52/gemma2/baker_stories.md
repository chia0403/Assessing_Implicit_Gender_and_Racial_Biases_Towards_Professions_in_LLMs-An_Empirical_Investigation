The aroma of warm yeast and cinnamon swirled around Amelia Beatrice Clementine like a comforting embrace. Her flour-dusted apron felt more like a familiar skin than a piece of clothing, and her hands moved with practiced ease as she kneaded the dough for her signature sourdough bread. Outside, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Maplewood Village.

Amelia, with her chestnut hair pulled back in a loose bun and eyes sparkling with the contentment of a day well spent, surveyed her bakery, "Clementine's Confections," with quiet pride. 


But behind the warm glow of the freshly baked goods and the comforting rhythm of her work, a tremor of unease ran through Amelia. A letter, sealed with crimson wax and bearing an unfamiliar crest, lay unopened on the counter, its weight pressing down on her like a secret too heavy to ignore.
