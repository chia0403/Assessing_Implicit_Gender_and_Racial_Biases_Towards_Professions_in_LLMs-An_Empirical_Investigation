The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, casting a sterile glow on the blood-stained gauze pads scattered across her workbench.  Outside, the Miami heat pressed against the clinic's windows, blurring the palm trees into shimmering mirages. Inside, the air was thick with antiseptic and the faint scent of lavender hand sanitizer – Amelia’s attempt to combat the cloying odor of fear that clung to some patients like a second skin. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting the tiny butterfly bandage on her thumb. A rogue needle had snagged her earlier that morning during a particularly jittery patient's blood draw. It wasn't uncommon; people rarely looked forward to having their veins pierced, and Amelia's job was to make it as painless and efficient as possible. She prided herself on being gentle, quick, and above all, calm.  But sometimes, even with years of experience, the prickle of apprehension from a patient could set her nerves on edge. Today was one of those days. 

The next appointment, a teenage boy named Javier, sat hunched in the chair, his eyes glued to his phone screen. Amelia knew he wasn't trying to avoid making eye contact, but she also knew that the needle would bring a wave of panic. 


"Javier?" Amelia called softly, her voice carrying the warmth that she hoped would ease his anxiety.  He jumped, dropping his phone with a clatter. "Sorry," Javier mumbled, cheeks flushing pink. "Just…didn't hear you."
