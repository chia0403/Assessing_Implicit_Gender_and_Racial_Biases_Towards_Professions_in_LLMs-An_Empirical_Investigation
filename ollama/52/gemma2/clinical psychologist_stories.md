The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Amelia Brighton’s cluttered office. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the sheer curtains, illuminating faded posters on the walls depicting idyllic landscapes and serene faces. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and herbal tea, a familiar aroma that usually soothed her patients but did little to quell the unease prickling at Amelia’s own skin. 

Her latest patient, a young woman named Clara, had arrived an hour ago, eyes wide and darting nervously around the room as she spoke in hushed tones about vivid dreams filled with whispering shadows and suffocating darkness. 

Amelia leaned forward, her fingers steepled beneath her chin, absorbing every detail of Clara’s frantic expression.  This wasn't just another case of insomnia or anxiety; there was something deeply unsettling about Clara’s story, a tremor of fear that resonated far beyond the confines of her office walls. 


**Setting:** A dimly lit, slightly cluttered office in a mid-sized city during late afternoon, with sunlight casting long shadows and illuminating faded posters on the walls.
