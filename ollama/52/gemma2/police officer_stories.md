The humid August air hung heavy over Port Esperanza, thick with the smell of salt and decaying seaweed. Rain threatened, gathering in bruised purple clouds above the turquoise waters of the bay. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Cortez adjusted her Stetson, pushing a strand of unruly dark hair behind her ear. The neon sign of the Rusty Anchor, usually buzzing with life on a Friday night, flickered ominously, casting an anemic yellow glow across the deserted street. 

This wasn't how Izzy liked to start her weekends.  Usually she'd be enjoying a plate of abuela's mofongo and watching salsa dancing at El Rincón. Instead, here she was, kneeling next to a body sprawled on the cracked asphalt, another unsolved case threatening to stain Port Esperanza's tranquil façade.
