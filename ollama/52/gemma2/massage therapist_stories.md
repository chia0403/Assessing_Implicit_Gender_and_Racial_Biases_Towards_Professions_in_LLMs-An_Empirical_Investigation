The scent of lavender oil and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven with whispers of chamomile and bergamot. Outside, the bustling city of Vancouver roared to life, its symphony of car horns and construction clanging a discordant melody against the tranquil silence within Serenity Massage Therapy. 

Inside, Amelia Rose Dubois, her dark hair pulled back in a loose braid, kneaded the tense knots out of Mr. Henderson's shoulders with practiced ease. His gruff voice rumbled through her fingertips, a familiar complaint about the city's incessant demands. Amelia listened patiently, offering gentle words of reassurance and focusing on the rhythmic pressure of her hands, coaxing his muscles into a state of blissful relaxation. 

The chime above the door tinkled, announcing the arrival of another client. A woman, shrouded in shadow, stepped into the warm light.  Amelia paused, her gaze curious, as the newcomer hesitated at the threshold, her eyes scanning the room with an unsettling intensity.
