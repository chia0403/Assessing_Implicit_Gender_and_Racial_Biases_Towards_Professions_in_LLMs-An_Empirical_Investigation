The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in "Mick's Meats," a small shop nestled on the cobblestone streets of Grimsborough. Sunlight strained through grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above rows of freshly hung carcasses.  Mick O’Malley, his forearms corded from years of wielding cleavers and saws, hummed an Irish tune as he meticulously trimmed fat from a side of beef.  His brow was furrowed in concentration, the sharp lines of his face softened by a faint smile. This wasn't just work for Mick; it was an art form, a dance between man and beast, paying respect to every life that had given itself for Grimsborough’s tables. He prided himself on knowing each cut, its nuances, its best uses. But today, something felt different. A chill snaked through the shop, despite the warmth of the hanging meat, settling in his gut like a leaden weight. It wasn't the usual pre-dawn gloom, nor the murmur of Grimsborough waking up outside.  No, this was something else entirely, an unsettling prickle of foreboding that made Mick want to slam the shop door shut and disappear into the backroom.
