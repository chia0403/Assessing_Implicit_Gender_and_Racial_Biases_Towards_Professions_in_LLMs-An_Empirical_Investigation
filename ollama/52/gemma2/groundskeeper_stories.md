The morning mist clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Thistlewick like a damp shroud as he pushed his wheelbarrow down the overgrown path. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the dense canopy of ancient oaks that cloaked Blackwood Manor, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dew-kissed grass. Barty whistled a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip of condensation from the gnarled branches above. He'd been the groundskeeper at Blackwood for almost thirty years, witnessing the manor's slow decline alongside his own.  

The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, but Barty also detected a faint, metallic tang that pricked his nostrils. It wasn't unusual â€“ rust from forgotten tools, perhaps, or the lingering scent of old ironwork. But this was different, sharper, somehow unsettling. He stopped pushing his wheelbarrow, squinting into the gloom. A chill, unrelated to the morning mist, snaked down his spine.  


Something was amiss at Blackwood Manor.
