The bell above the door to Dr. Bartholomew's office chimed merrily, announcing Amelia Beatrice Finch’s arrival. She adjusted her lilac cardigan, smoothing the wrinkles that had appeared during her brisk walk from the bus stop. The aroma of cinnamon and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that always seemed to permeate Dr. Bartholomew's quaint Victorian practice nestled on the corner of Elm Street. Amelia took a deep breath, inhaling the comforting blend as she straightened the stack of appointment cards on her counter. 

Outside, the autumn wind whipped fallen leaves into swirling patterns across the cobblestone street. The sky above was a bruised canvas of purple and gray, promising an early, unsettling dusk. Inside, however, Dr. Bartholomew's office remained a haven of warmth and order.  The walls were lined with antique bookshelves overflowing with leather-bound volumes, and a crackling fire cast flickering shadows on the faded floral wallpaper. Amelia glanced at the clock above the mantlepiece – 4:57 p.m. - just enough time to settle back into her routine before Dr. Bartholomew emerged from his consultation room for evening appointments.  


She leaned back in her worn leather chair, her gaze drifting towards the antique globe perched on a stand by the window. The brass continents seemed to gleam with untold stories, whispering secrets of faraway lands and forgotten times. A faint smile touched Amelia's lips as she imagined herself exploring those distant shores, escaping the confines of her predictable routine for just a little while.
