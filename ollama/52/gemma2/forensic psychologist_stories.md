The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, each drop exploding like a tiny bomb on the cracked asphalt below.  She watched it from behind her desk, swirling a half-empty cup of lukewarm coffee. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the cluttered space: file folders stacked precariously on shelves, books crammed onto every available surface, and a whiteboard covered in scribbled notes about the case that had become her obsession.

Eleanor Vance wasn't just any forensic psychologist. She was one of the few who specialized in psychopathy, a rare breed even amongst the already specialized field.  She saw the darkness in people, the hidden gears turning beneath the surface, the chilling calculations behind seemingly mundane actions. The case she had now, the brutal murder of a young woman found drained of blood and left in an art gallery – a scene that seemed ripped straight from a gothic horror novel – was unlike anything she'd encountered before.  

The city outside was a tangled mess of grey and shadow, mirroring the storm raging within her. Each clue felt like another puzzle piece, each whisper of information leading to an increasingly unsettling portrait of a killer who was both brilliant and terrifyingly methodical. And Eleanor knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, this case was only just beginning.
