The air hung thick with the scent of chalk dust and stale coffee in the cramped drafting room. Sunlight streamed through grimy windows, illuminating the rows of desks cluttered with blueprints, half-eaten sandwiches, and discarded cigarette butts.  

Elias Thorne adjusted his spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of his nose as he squinted at the blueprint sprawled before him.  It was for a new housing development on the outskirts of the city, a sprawling complex of identical boxy houses designed to cater to the ever-growing population. 

Elias wasn't sure what bothered him more: the utter lack of imagination in the design or the fact that another hundred families would soon be trapped in these lifeless concrete cages.  He sighed, running a weary hand through his thinning hair. His own apartment was barely bigger than one of these proposed units, and he knew firsthand the suffocating feeling of confinement it could breed. 

Elias wished he could design something different, something with soul, something that reflected the vibrancy of the city instead of its sterile expansion. But he was just a draftsman, a cog in a machine churning out blueprints for a future he didn't believe in.
