The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over the cluttered therapy room. Amelia "Amy" Hayes surveyed her domain with practiced disinterest: the wobble board that smelled faintly of sweat, the stacks of colorful sensory toys gathering dust in the corner, and the ever-present scent of hand sanitizer battling the lingering aroma of disinfectant wipes. 

Her gaze landed on the patient chart lying open on a nearby table. Ethan Blackwood, 32 years old, diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after a motorcycle accident six months ago. Amy sighed. Another complex case.  Ethan had been making slow progress, but his frustration was palpable â€“ a tightly wound spring threatening to snap. The hospital had released him into outpatient care, and it was up to Amy to help him navigate the daunting path back to some semblance of normalcy. 


The door creaked open, bringing with it a wave of cold air and the rustling of leaves from an autumnal day just beginning to descend. Ethan stood awkwardly in the doorway, his shoulders slumped, his eyes avoiding hers. He looked like a stray dog, all bruised edges and misplaced confidence.  This was going to be interesting.
