The early morning mist hung heavy over Willow Creek Manor like a shroud, obscuring the manicured lawns and shimmering fountains with a ghostly veil.  Sunlight struggled to pierce the grayness, casting long, distorted shadows that danced playfully on the rose bushes in Mr. Alistair Thorne's meticulously tended garden.

His name was **Alexander Blackwood**, known as simply "Alex" by the staff at Willow Creek Manor, where he had worked for over three decades. The grounds of the sprawling estate were his domain; each fallen leaf and swaying branch a familiar friend. Yet, something felt different this morning. A strange unease lingered in the air, thick and unsettling like the fog that clung to everything. 

Alex shuffled through the damp grass, collecting stray leaves from beneath the ancient oak tree where he spent his mornings reading before work began. He ran a calloused hand over its bark, feeling the rough texture as if etching an imprint of its age into his mind.  It was a silence so profound it felt like a heavy weight settling on his chest. There was something off about Willow Creek today, and Alex felt it acutely in the pit of his stomach. It was as if the very soul of the manor was holding its breath, waiting for something.
