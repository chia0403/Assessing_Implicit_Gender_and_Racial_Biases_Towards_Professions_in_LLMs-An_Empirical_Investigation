The scent of cedar wood and lavender filled Dr. Alistair Finch's office.  Sunlight streamed through the expansive bay window, painting warm rectangles across the worn leather of his chair. It was an image as idyllic as it was deceptively calm. Across from him sat Ms. Evelyn Hawthorne, her face contorted in a grimace that belied the gentle, floral scent emanating from her cardigan. 

Evelyn was a pillar of community; a woman known for her vibrant laughter and meticulously kept rose garden â€“ even if her back pain had begun to dim her usual cheer. Alistair's own chiropractor days were filled with such moments - the initial clink of metal on bone as he adjusted the vertebrae, followed by Evelyn's sigh of pure relief that could only come from a soul finally finding its proper alignment. 

But today was different. As Alistair gently coaxed the tension in her spine, a tremor ran through Evelyn's hands. It wasn't just muscle pain; it felt like fear, like something unseen and unspoken had taken root within her heart, threatening to consume her.  He knew that some moments were not about easing the body's aches, but addressing the subtle tremors of the soul. This was one such time.
