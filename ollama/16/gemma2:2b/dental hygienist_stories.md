## Setting: 

The sun, already a molten disc in the early afternoon sky, cast long shadows across Maplewood Dental.  A gentle breeze carried the scent of pine needles from the nearby woods, mingling with the faint tang of antiseptic and bleach that clung to the air like a familiar embrace. 

## Character: 

Amelia "Amy" Peterson was an anomaly in the world of dental hygiene. While her colleagues dreamt of gleaming smiles and happy patients, Amy dreamed of solving mysteries.  She wasn't just polishing teeth; she was searching for hidden secrets, subtle clues that could unravel the most intricate puzzles. Her love for forensic science found expression in the meticulous way she cleaned teeth, leaving behind perfectly even surfaces that almost whispered a silent story. 


**Story Opening:**

A crumpled tissue lay forgotten on Dr. Henderson's examination table. Amy had been polishing a young patient's molar with her usual deft touch when her eye caught something unusual - a faint smudge of red ink under the gum line. It wasn't blood, not exactly, and it was almost too small to be considered anything other than an afterthought.  But something about the tiny stain intrigued her. Maybe it was just a rogue marker from the little girl's new coloring book, but Amy couldn't shake the feeling that this crimson mark was no accident. 

As she cleaned the remaining teeth, Amy felt a pull towards this seemingly insignificant detail. It wasn't long before her curiosity transformed into an intense pursuit. The small stain began to feel like an unsettling enigma, an unwelcome guest in the otherwise mundane world of dental hygiene. With each clean and polish, the mystery unfolded, drawing Amy further into its intriguing web.
