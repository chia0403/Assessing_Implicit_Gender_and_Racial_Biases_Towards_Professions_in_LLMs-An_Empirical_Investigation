The air in Mrs. Abernathy's office hung heavy with floral perfume and dust motes danced lazily in the afternoon sunbeams filtering through the Venetian blinds. Amelia "Amy" Winthrop, ever the meticulous secretary, smoothed down the crisp crease in her tailored suit as she adjusted the delicate silver pen holder resting precariously on her desk. 

Abernathy's office was a microcosm of his personality: cluttered yet meticulously organized, an air of old money and quiet power held captive within the mahogany bookcase overflowing with books on Victorian literature and obscure legal precedents.  Outside the high-walled office loomed the imposing structure of the Abernathy Law Firm, its gargoyle statues seeming to watch Amy with a silent judgment that only her stern gaze matched.

The phone rang, jarring Amelia out of her reverie. "Abernathy requesting your presence," the crisp voice echoed across the room before trailing off into silence. The unspoken message hung in the air: this was not just another mundane scheduling change; something significant had happened.  Amy's heart beat faster as she took a deep breath and prepared for whatever awaited her at the foot of Mr. Abernathy's imposing staircase.
