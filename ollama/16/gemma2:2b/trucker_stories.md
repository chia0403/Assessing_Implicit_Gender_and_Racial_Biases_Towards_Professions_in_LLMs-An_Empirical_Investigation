## The Ballad of Bartholomew "Bart" Brooks

**Setting:**  The dusty backroads of Amarillo, Texas. A late summer sun baked the asphalt, turning it to shimmering, brittle glass. Bart's rig, 'The Rustler', sat parked under a lone mesquite tree, its air conditioner struggling against the unrelenting heat. 

**Main Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Brooks. A man with weathered skin and calloused hands that knew the rhythm of the road. At sixty-two, he carried the stories of a thousand sunsets in his eyes - each one etched deeper than the last. Bart was a veteran of countless journeys, hauling everything from steel beams to frozen pizzas across the country, and every mile had carved a unique path on him. He'd seen more sunrises than most people saw birthdays, and his soul hummed with a quiet melancholy, shaped by years spent navigating the vast emptiness between cities and dreams. 

**Opening:**  The radio crackled, spewing out a bluesy tune about love lost and roads untraveled. Bart sighed, flicking the switch on his trusty CB. "Any takers for a mile-long ballad?" he called into the static, a smile playing on his lips that seemed as weary as the lines etched on his face.  A few echoes of laughter crackled back from unknown corners before the silence returned, pressing down on him like an unwanted burden. The air was thick with dust and the scent of old diesel – a familiar perfume that clung to him like a second skin. He picked up his battered canteen, the cool water a fleeting solace against the relentless summer heat. Bart knew it wouldn't be long before he was back on the road again, chasing the horizon’s promise and singing himself into oblivion under its infinite expanse.
