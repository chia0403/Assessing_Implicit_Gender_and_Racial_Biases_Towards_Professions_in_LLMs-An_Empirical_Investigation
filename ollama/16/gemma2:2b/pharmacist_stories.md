He was a weaver of forgotten remedies, a chronicler of ancient wisdoms, someone who believed in the power of potions and poultices as much as he did in science.

And tonight, it seemed, he needed more than just his years of experience to understand the strange, insistent call that had lured him away from his counting of vials.
