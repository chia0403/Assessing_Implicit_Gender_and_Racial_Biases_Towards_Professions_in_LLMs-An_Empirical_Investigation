Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Thorne's third-grade classroom, each drop exploding in miniature geysers. The air hung thick with the dampness of a November storm, carrying the scent of petrichor and cinnamon from the afternoon bake sale happening down the hall. Inside the room, however, everything felt oddly sterile, like an empty warehouse waiting for the next wave of life to crash through the doors. Mrs. Thorne paced back and forth, fiddling with a crumpled paper ball in her hand – a test paper that had been graded earlier than expected. 

Her usual smile was gone, replaced by a tight frown.  The students’ lackluster performance on the history test - an area where they usually excelled - had left her feeling deflated.  She knew these children were bright, capable sparks of potential, yet today, their enthusiasm seemed to have fizzled out like a dying fire. 

She glanced at the clock: 3:15 p.m., the last hour before dismissal.  And then she noticed him – Liam O'Connor, usually a picture of boundless energy in a bright yellow shirt with the word "Explorer" emblazoned across the front. He stood by the classroom door, eyes downcast, shoulders slumped like a wilted sunflower. The rain seemed to mirror the dullness in his demeanor.
