The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windowpanes of "Mrs. Hawthorne's Hearth," casting long shadows across the flour-dusted counter where Elara Hawthorne kneaded dough with an almost rhythmic fervor.  Her nimble hands, weathered and strong from years spent crafting bread, coaxed life into a fresh batch of sourdough. The air hung thick with the scent of yeast and warm spices – cinnamon, nutmeg, perhaps even a hint of cardamom – all swirling together in an olfactory masterpiece. Elara sighed contentedly, her eyes crinkled at the edges as she gazed upon the bubbling dough.  This small bakery nestled amidst the bustling streets of Oakhaven was more than just a place to buy bread; it was a refuge for weary travelers and gossiping housewives, a beacon of comfort and warmth in the otherwise indifferent world. But tonight, Elara felt a different kind of unease, her usual calm replaced by a subtle tremor of worry.  Tonight, she knew, wouldn't be like any other night. Tonight, Oakhaven would change forever.
