The late afternoon sun slunk through the blinds of Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office, casting long shadows on the worn carpet. A faint scent of lavender soap lingered in the air, a comforting aroma that was almost as ubiquitous as her own quiet anxieties. She sat at her desk, a mountain of paperwork rising like a jagged crest before her. It wasn't the report-writing she disliked; it was the weight of uncertainty pressing down on her chest like an invisible cloak. 

Amelia’s heart hammered against her ribs as she opened another file, this time featuring a teenage boy named Jason Miller. The recent suicide attempt had left her reeling, and the case files started to feel less like clinical notes and more like heavy chains dragging her down. This was the third incident in as many months at Sunnybrook High, each a grim reminder of the invisible battleground being waged beneath the polished facade of teenage life. 

This town was a perfect storm of privilege and turmoil, with its bustling suburbs concealing a darker underbelly.  Each case brought Amelia closer to her own demons, the ones that whispered in the dead of night about the futility of even fighting for something as ephemeral as sanity. The silence in Sunnybrook was deafening – an echo chamber of secrets, where everyone played their roles while hiding their true face. 

The world outside her office window seemed more a stage than reality. A group of students walked by on their way to detention, their whispers and stares like the harsh pronouncements of fate. This small town held onto its past, clinging to an outdated view of what constitutes normal behavior.  But Amelia was determined to change the script, to be the author who penned a different ending, one where mental health wasn’t just a whisper but a loud roar demanding attention.
