The stale air of the waiting room clung to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather like an unwelcome second skin. Outside, a storm raged, its fury echoing in the rhythmic clatter of rain against the windowpanes. Inside, the muted hues of the waiting area - beige walls adorned with floral prints so faded they looked like ghosts - did little to soothe Amy's frayed nerves. She glanced at her watch, frustration simmering beneath the polite veneer of professional calmness. 

Amy was a skilled occupational therapist, a licensed miracle worker who helped children navigate the complex labyrinth of their lives – from learning to hold a pencil to mastering the art of dressing themselves. But today, she felt utterly out of her element. Not that anything could truly prepare one for the emotional turmoil swirling in this room. 

A young boy sat fidgeting on a plastic chair, his eyes wide with apprehension as he stared at the floor.  He was all of eight years old, dressed in the clothes of a refugee - worn and patched, reflecting the turbulent history they carried. This wasn’t her usual clientele; these children came from an entirely different world than she knew – one marked by displacement, fear, and the weight of unspoken stories.
