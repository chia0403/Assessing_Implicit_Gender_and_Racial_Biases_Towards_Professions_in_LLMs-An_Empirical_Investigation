The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne’s head like trapped bees in a gilded cage. She sat at her tiny desk in the cramped reception area of Dr. Evelyn Reed's Holistic Health Center, the silence punctuated only by the occasional click of the phone or a distant chirp from a frustrated sparrow perched on the window ledge outside. The scent of lavender and essential oils mixed with the faint, floral aroma of cleaning products, a strange yet oddly comforting cocktail for Amy. 

The world outside was bustling with activity - a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and people rushing by - but here, inside the sanctuary of Dr. Reed’s clinic, time seemed to stagnate. The only real movement came from the woman who sat next to Amy on her usual perch at the reception desk, Mrs. Peabody, the stoic and formidable receptionist of a different kind. Mrs. Peabody was an old soul with eyes that held the weight of unspoken secrets, each wrinkle etched by years of unseen hardships. 

Amy took a deep breath and picked up the phone, her fingers hovering over the receiver as if anticipating a storm.  She knew what she was supposed to do -  take appointments, manage emails, soothe distraught clients, all while keeping Dr. Reed’s sanctuary a beacon of calm in the midst of life’s chaos. 

But something felt different today. A sense of unease prickled at the edges of her consciousness. It felt like the air itself was holding its breath.
