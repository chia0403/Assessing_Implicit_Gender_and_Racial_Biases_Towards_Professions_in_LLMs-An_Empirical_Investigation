## Opening

Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Amelia Thorne's office.  The storm felt like it was mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. Outside, the city of Portland hummed with its usual frenetic energy, but within Amelia’s sanctuary, a different kind of storm raged: the weight of betrayal and mounting pressure from her latest case. 

Amelia Thorne, sharp-eyed and razor-witted, had spent years battling against corporate giants for the underdog.  She was the embodiment of grit - fighting tooth and nail for justice and human rights in the face of overwhelming odds. Today, though, she felt like a ship caught in a maelstrom. 

Her client, an immigrant rights activist named Elara Santiago, had gone silent for days after revealing crucial evidence that implicated the city's powerful councilman, Mayor Henderson, in a series of illegal actions.  The threat was real - Amelia could only hope she had enough leverage to force him into talking before the storm broke.


## Setting

**Location:** A small office tucked away on Hawthorne Boulevard, Portland, Oregon. The walls are lined with bookshelves overflowing with legal tomes and family photographs of her late father, a civil rights lawyer who died years ago, inspiring Amelia to fight for justice. 

**Atmosphere:**  The room is dimly lit by a few flickering candles, the air thick with the scent of old paper and rain. A worn-down desk sits center stage, where Amelia is hunched over a stack of files, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the wind howls like a banshee, occasionally shaking the windows with a violent gust.

**Mood:**  Amelia's mind is racing – the evidence against Henderson is strong, but she can't seem to get him to break.  She fears the city councilman has leverage over Elara; he may even have more than just political influence.
