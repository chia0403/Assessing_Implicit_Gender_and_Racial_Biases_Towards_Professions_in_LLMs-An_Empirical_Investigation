The salonâ€™s air hung thick with hairspray and unspoken anxieties.  Lavender scented candles flickered on each table, casting long shadows across the worn mahogany chairs. A gentle jazz tune drifted from the unseen speakers, punctuated by the occasional snap of scissors or whisper of secrets shared over blow-drying sessions. 

This was "The Snip," a haven for locals seeking escape and transformation in equal measure. At its heart sat Amelia Thorne, known to her clientele simply as "Amy."  A woman who could turn heads with a single stroke of her razor-sharp shears or weave dreams into their mane with the confidence born from years spent crafting beauty.

The door creaked open, carrying with it the crisp scent of autumn leaves and the weight of an unspoken worry. Amelia's eyes met the face of Mrs. Peabody - tall and slender like a willow tree in the wind, but etched with deep lines that spoke of countless sleepless nights battling her own anxieties.   "Mrs. Peabody," Amy greeted softly, "you look like you could use a change."
