Rain pattered against the dusty windowpanes of Amelia "Amy" Thornton's studio apartment in Oakland, blurring the lines between reality and her dreamscapes.  The scent of old paper and worn leather hung thick in the air, mingling with the musty aroma of decay from a forgotten antique gramophone she hadn’t dared clean yet. Outside, the fog clung to the city like a shroud, swallowing the familiar streetlights whole. 

Amy was captivated by the swirling chaos outside her window, but it wasn't the storm that held her attention.  It was the image – a fleeting flicker of light through the driving rain, revealing a single red rose clutched tightly in the outstretched hand of a woman shrouded in shadow, her face obscured by the downpour. Amy had captured it just as she swore she’d never been able to - with the perfect composition, the right amount of contrast and blur, all while her camera felt almost alive beneath her grip. 

The photo, a masterpiece in the making, demanded to be seen by the world.  But the woman's face, like the rose itself, was a mystery. Amy had no idea where she came from or why she chose that very moment to surrender herself to the storm. All she knew was that this image, like a silent scream from the heart of Oakland’s fog, beckoned her into its depths.
