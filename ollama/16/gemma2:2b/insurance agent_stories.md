## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the worn awning of Harold Jenkins' office, each drop drumming out like a mournful tattoo on the tin roof. Inside, the smell of stale coffee clung to Harold's floral-patterned suit as he stared at the flickering monitor screen. It displayed a photo of a dilapidated Victorian mansion, its gingerbread trim chipped and faded under a thick layer of mildew. The house belonged to Mrs. Hemlock, a wealthy widow known for her eccentric behavior and even more eccentric insurance claims.

Harold was used to the eccentricities of his clientele, but this one had him stumped. He'd spent the last two weeks deciphering Mrs. Hemlock’s convoluted will, navigating through legal jargon and family feuds. Now, faced with a claim for "emotional distress" caused by the loss of her prized pet parrot – a rare and extremely expensive Amazonian – Harold felt a knot forming in his stomach. 

This wasn't just about money. This was about a woman clinging to memories that seemed to have vanished into thin air, her grief amplified by the lack of tangible proof. And as he looked at Mrs. Hemlock's will again, he couldn’t help but wonder – what exactly was she trying to say?
