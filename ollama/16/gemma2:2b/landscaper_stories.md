The sun, already a bruised orange sinking into the horizon, cast long, gnarled shadows across the manicured lawns.  This was no ordinary day for Henry "Hank" Lawson, the most renowned landscaper in Oakhaven. The annual "Oakhaven Elegance" contest was upon them, and tonight's prize: a shimmering silver trophy awarded to the best-designed landscape in town. 

Hank ran a calloused hand over his already aching back as he surveyed his masterpiece - the sprawling garden of Eleanor Thorne, renowned architect and owner of one of Oakhaven's grandest homes.  The air thrummed with unspoken tension.  It wasn't just the annual rivalry between Hank and his old rival, Thomas "Teddy" Thompson who had taken a rather passive stance on this year's competition - it was something deeper. Eleanor Thorne, once as quiet as the rustling leaves in her garden, had suddenly become a flurry of energy, her eyes burning with an almost desperate passion as she tried to convince Hank to incorporate a single, unique element into his design â€“ a touchstone for a story that neither of them could remember.
