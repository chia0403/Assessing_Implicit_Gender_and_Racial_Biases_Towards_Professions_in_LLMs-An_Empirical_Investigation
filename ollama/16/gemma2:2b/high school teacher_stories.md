## Setting:

**St. Michael's Academy:** A prestigious private school tucked away in the rolling hills of rural Massachusetts. The brick buildings are weathered with age, their gothic arches whispering stories of forgotten history and a strict adherence to tradition. Years of rain and snow leave trails of grime across the slate roofs, and ivy clings desperately to crumbling stone walls, choking out any semblance of life within its cold embrace. 

## Story Opening:

The afternoon air hung thick and heavy with the smell of pine needles and woodsmoke, a scent that always reminded Professor Thomas Blackwood of autumn. But today, as he stood at the edge of his beloved English classroom, staring down the endless expanse of a field where wildflowers dared to blossom in defiance of nature's harsh hand, he felt a chill seep into his bones. It wasn't just the early November wind, but something deeper, more unsettling.  

He was alone, surrounded by years worth of textbooks and worn-out furniture, the only witness to the slow decay of the classroom that had been his home for over two decades. It was a room where he felt both at peace and deeply haunted – a place where memories flowed like the endless stream of the nearby river that meandered past the school's grounds. His students’ laughter, their arguments, their quiet moments of enlightenment - they were all echoes in the air now, gone silent like the last leaves on the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks outside. 

His name was Professor Thomas Blackwood, a man defined by his stoicism and unwavering commitment to literature, but today, even his calm façade felt crumbling. His eyes met a faded photograph tucked away in the corner - a smiling face with mischievous eyes, a young Amelia holding a worn copy of Pride and Prejudice. A faint smile touched his lips; she was already gone, just like so many others who had come and passed through these hallowed halls. It was time to move on. 


But where?
