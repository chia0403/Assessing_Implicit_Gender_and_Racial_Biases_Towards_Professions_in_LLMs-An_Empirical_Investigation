## Story Opening: 

The air hung thick with smoke and the acrid smell of burning timber.  Daniel "Deacon" O'Malley knelt on the porch steps of the abandoned Victorian house, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carefully brushed away the last vestiges of soot from the weathered wood railing. A sigh escaped him, a mixture of fatigue and frustration mingling with the rising heat from the inferno behind him. 

It had been two hours since they'd first breached the front door, two hours of battling flames that seemed to grow more defiant with every passing minute. The old house, rumored to be haunted for decades, was now a twisted skeleton of its former self, groaning under the weight of a raging inferno. As the sun began its descent behind the treeline, casting long shadows across the charred landscape, Deacon's eyes scanned the scene once more, hoping against hope that he’d find something, anything to explain why the fire hadn’t just… died down.
