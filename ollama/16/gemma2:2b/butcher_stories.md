The smell hit Bartholomew "Bart"  Finchley before he even reached the front door. It was the sort of scent that clung to cobblestones and leather-bound books, an aroma woven from blood, fat, and iron. A familiar blend that brought a shiver down his spine – both from childhood memories and the chill autumn wind that had started picking at the leaves outside the shop's battered wooden door. 

Bart was no stranger to blood. His hands were roughened by years of handling meat, calloused like the handle of an old cleaver he used every day.  He ran Finchley's Meats, a small shop nestled on the edge of town where whispers about his skill and unusual clientele mingled with the cries of butchered pork hanging from the rafters. Bart never questioned the murmurs, they were just part of the rhythm he’d woven into his life.   But today, something felt different. There was an almost palpable tension in the air, a prickle on the back of his neck that spoke of secrets and shadows.
