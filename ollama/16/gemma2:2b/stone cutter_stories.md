The midday sun beat down on Arlo Stonehand's back as he surveyed his work. A symphony of chiseling echoed in the cavernous quarry, where the hard granite of the mountain groaned under the relentless assault of Arlo's blade. The air itself vibrated with energy, a tangible testament to the raw power residing within these ancient stones. He was known throughout the valley for his meticulous craftsmanship; his hands were calloused and scarred, each line a reminder of a year spent mastering the secrets of stone. 

Arlo Stonehand, they called him. Not because he wielded strength like a rock-forged titan, but because he saw poetry in the raw earth, turning rough edges into smooth masterpieces.  He had carved figures of mythical beasts that defied gravity, sculpted portraits with eyes that seemed to burn with an inner fire. His work spoke not just of craftsmanship, but of emotion, of yearning, and of a profound connection to the natural world. 

Today, he was working on a commission for the Baron's son. The young lord desired a memorial for his lost father, something majestic and everlasting - a testament to a life well-lived. Arlo understood. He had seen grief consume even the most stoic hearts, leaving behind a raw pain that only time could heal. But he also knew the power of stone; how it held memories, how its very texture whispered stories of the past.  This was no ordinary commission. This was an ode to loss, and Arlo's chisel would sing with grief and hope as he crafted his masterpiece.
