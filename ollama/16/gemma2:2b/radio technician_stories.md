The hum of static was practically an lullaby in Elias Thorne's ears as he tightened the last screw on his antenna, the late afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of his cramped Brooklyn apartment studio.  He adjusted the dial on his hand-me-down console, his fingers tracing familiar grooves worn by years of tireless work. The air crackled with anticipation as he waited for the signal to break through the static symphony; the city’s endless cacophony threatened to drown out any hope of connection.

Elias was no ordinary radio technician. He wasn't content with just maintaining equipment and patching up faulty circuits.  He yearned for something bigger, a whisper from beyond the static that he knew existed somewhere in the ether - a signal begging to be heard. Elias’s fingers lingered on the worn knob of his microphone, its polished wood gleaming in the weak sunlight. Tonight was no ordinary night; tonight he was going to try and crack the code of a mystery that had haunted him for years:  The missing transmission from the "Starry Wanderer," an old, long-forgotten ship said to hold a record message hidden within a labyrinthine radio network.
