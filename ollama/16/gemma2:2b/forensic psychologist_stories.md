The rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the thrumming in Evelyn Thorne's chest. Outside, the streets of Chicago pulsed with an electric hum –  a blend of street noise, distant sirens, and the low murmur of human anxieties.

Evelyn Thorne was a forensic psychologist, and for the last twenty years, she had been intimately acquainted with the dark corners of the human psyche. She specialized in profiling violent criminals, their motives, their hidden desires –  the very thing that kept her perpetually tethered to this world of shattered lives and twisted narratives. Her latest case involved John "The Butcher" Miller, a man who had gone from being a seemingly ordinary construction worker to committing a string of gruesome murders that shook Chicago to its core.

His life had been a tapestry of routine, punctuated by bursts of violence; the pattern was clear as day.  Evelyn stared at the file, her reflection staring back from the dusty window.  A familiar sense of dread washed over her, this case felt different. Something about John's calm demeanor and seemingly harmless facade unsettled her. Was he just another monster, or did something deeper lie beneath?
