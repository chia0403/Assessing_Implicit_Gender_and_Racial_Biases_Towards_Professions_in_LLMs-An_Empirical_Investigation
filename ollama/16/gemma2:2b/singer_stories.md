The air hung thick with anticipation in the dimly lit backstage lounge. A lone spotlight illuminated Elara Celeste's reflection in the mirrored surface of her dressing table - a shimmering pool reflecting her emerald eyes. Her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped hummingbird. Tonight was her first solo performance at The Grand Symphony, a prestigious venue known for fostering the careers of tomorrowâ€™s music legends.  Elara Celeste, whose voice had the power to move mountains and whose stage presence could melt glaciers, felt a tremor course through her as she adjusted her emerald green sequined dress that whispered with every movement.

**Setting:** The backstage lounge of The Grand Symphony - a Victorian-era theatre repurposed into a modern music haven, complete with intricate stained glass windows, polished wood paneling, and plush velvet curtains. 


**Main Character:** Elara Celeste (The singer)
