## Setting:

The quaint seaside town of Oakhaven was nestled against the rugged cliffs of Maine, its houses painted in pastel hues that blended with the salty air. A worn pier jutted out into the churning gray waves, its wood groaning under the weight of years and wind. The smell of salt spray hung heavy, mingled with the aroma of fresh-baked goods wafting from Mrs. O'Malley's bakery across the street.

## Character: 

**Bartholomew "Bart" Hawthorne**, known as "Barnacle Bart" to those who knew him well, was a carpenter whose hands held stories whispered on the grain of wood. His workshop, nestled behind his weather-beaten cabin, smelled of sawdust and leather polish, its walls lined with half-finished projects that hummed with silent promises. 

**Story Opening:**

A storm raged outside, lashing waves against the windows of Bart's workshop, their fury mimicking the churning in his gut. He ran a callused hand over the rough grain of a piece of redwood he was shaping, its smooth surface a stark contrast to the turbulent chaos raging above. The old oak door creaked open, and his wife, Clara, stepped inside, her face etched with worry as she handed him a letter, sealed with the familiar crimson wax seal of the Coast Guard station in town. 

"They say it's worse than usual," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the wind howling outside. "Waves bigger than any I've seen."

Bart's weathered brow creased as he took the letter. The storm wasn't a surprise; the ocean was wild tonight, its moods fickle and dangerous. But thisâ€¦this felt different. A knot tightened in his gut, heavy with a premonition of something far beyond a routine storm. 


He looked down at the rough-hewn wood in his hands.  A piece for a new dock to be built on one of the small fishing boats that frequented the harbor. It was supposed to be a simple job - but tonight, even the wood seemed to hum with a silent warning.
