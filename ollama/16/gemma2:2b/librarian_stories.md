The musty scent of aged paper and leather clung to everything in Miss Amelia Thorne's world. The air vibrated with the gentle rustle of turning pages as she expertly navigated her way through the labyrinthine stacks of the Oakhaven Library, her worn spectacles perched upon her nose like two polished gemstones.  Her fingertips traced the spines of countless volumes, each a silent whisper of forgotten tales and whispered dreams.

The clock on the mantelpiece ticked ominously – each tick resonating like a drumbeat against the silence.
