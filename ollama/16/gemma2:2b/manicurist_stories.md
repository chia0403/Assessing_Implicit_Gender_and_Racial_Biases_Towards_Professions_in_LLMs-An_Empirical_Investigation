The scent of polish and sugared almond wafted through Willow's tiny salon, blending with the hum of the nail dryer just like the notes of a familiar jazz song on the radio. It was Friday night, which meant Willow's usual clientele â€“  the well-dressed ladies of Elmwood who frequented her small salon for their weekly pampering sessions â€“ were out in force. The chrome and velvet chairs gleamed under the warm, yellow light, each one occupied by a woman with a carefully curated look: lips in perfect harmony with their crimson nail polish. 

Willow herself was a whirlwind of energy amidst the calm, meticulously filing a set of acrylics on her tiny client. Her name was Willow Davenport, and her heart hummed with an electric joy that only came from creating something beautiful â€“ even if it was just a temporary canvas for a woman's self-expression.  
But tonight, a new kind of tension hung in the air.
