The sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's neck as he surveyed the sprawling concrete jungle before him. Dust swirled in the air like miniature tornadoes, kicking up from the freshly poured foundation of the new skyscraper.  It was supposed to be an emblem of progress, a shining beacon of modern ambition. But for Elias, it felt more like another cog in a machine fueled by unchecked hunger and greed. The city, he knew, was consuming itself whole, swallowing up its history and dreams like so much wet concrete.

Elias had been born and raised on the edges of this growing beast, his life marked by the steady rhythm of construction work:  the rhythmic clang of steel against steel, the scent of fresh asphalt, the camaraderie forged in sweat and dust. He was as much a part of the city's fabric as the concrete itself, yet he saw himself as an outsider, watching with weary eyes as the dream factory churned out more and more hollow aspirations.  His days were filled with hauling heavy loads, lifting prefabricated steel beams, his hands calloused from years of toil, his spirit aching for something more. He just didn't know what that "something" might be.
