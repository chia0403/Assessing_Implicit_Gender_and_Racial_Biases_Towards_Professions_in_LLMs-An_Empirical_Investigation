The mahogany desk gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the 7th floor office, each reflection casting a distorted image of Elias Thorne's austere face. A single plume of smoke escaped from his designer cigarette holder and curled into the cold air like a phantom. Outside, the Manhattan skyline roared with the lifeblood of another day; the constant hum of honking cars, screeching sirens, and the faint, persistent rhythm of the city's pulse.  Yet within this steel-and-glass cage, Elias felt isolated, adrift in a sea of suits and spreadsheets, his heart as cold and unfeeling as the glass walls surrounding him. His latest acquisition had fallen through, thanks to a rogue investor with an appetite for power, and his once-glowing reputation was now fading like a sunrise behind the steel towers. 

This was Elias Thorne, CEO of Thorne Industries - a titan whose name whispered in the halls of Wall Street, but who, beneath the veneer of success, felt hollow, adrift, and forgotten. The weight of the city pressed down on him, its relentless energy draining his hope like a leaky faucet. A single ray of sunlight hit his desk, momentarily illuminating a photo of Elias as a boy - he was smiling, his eyes bright with ambition, standing next to his father's shoulder, both of them gazing out at a vast ocean. The memories were bittersweet; they were also all he had left.
