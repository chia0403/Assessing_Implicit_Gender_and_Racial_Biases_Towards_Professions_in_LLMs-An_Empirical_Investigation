The neon "Open" sign hummed above Elias Thorne's head, its light casting an oily sheen onto the rain-slicked asphalt outside the bustling diner. Rain hammered against the roof, mimicking the relentless rhythm of his heart as he nervously adjusted his apron.  He was no stranger to chaos. Since he landed this waitstaff position at the Golden Spoon Diner just six months ago, he'd navigated a million sticky situations, from grumpy patrons with greasy spoons and sharper tongues, to runaway children in matching red gingham dresses who tripped over their own feet and ended up spilling milkshakes on unsuspecting tourists. 

Elias was a man born of chaos, yet somehow still managed to bring order to the storm. His name, as ironic as it seemed, whispered through the diners like a calm breeze. It wasn't his father's last name, not entirely.  He'd chosen to keep "Thorne," for a long time he'd considered changing his birth name, but something about it stuck; a quiet defiance against any expectations of who he should be. His small tattoo on his left forearm whispered a different story though: a stylized bird in flight, its wings tipped with fiery red and orange. 


**Setting:** A classic 1950s-style diner, serving up hearty American food and endless coffee. The diner is bustling at lunch time, families clamoring over booths, old men arguing about the stock market, teenagers whispering secrets and giggling at each other.
