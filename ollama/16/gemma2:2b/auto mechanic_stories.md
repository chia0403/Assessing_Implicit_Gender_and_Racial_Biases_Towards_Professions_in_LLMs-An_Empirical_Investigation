Rain hammered against the garage roof like a thousand tiny fists, each one determined to crack the flimsy metal shield protecting the workshop within.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Reyes huddled over a sputtering 1970s Mustang, her brow furrowed with concentration. The engine’s guttural cough echoed through the space, punctuated by bursts of noxious fumes that seemed to cling to Amy like a second skin. This wasn’t just another day for the young mechanic; this was “The Big One” - the annual Bay City Auto Show and Amelia's chance at a shot at winning Best in Class.  

But even amidst the greasy allure of motor oil and the whirring symphony of machines, Amy felt a growing unease. The show wouldn’t be complete without her prized ‘67 Mustang, “Scarlett,” meticulously restored to its former glory. But lately, Scarlett had been spitting sparks, coughing like a smoker, refusing to run even at the gentle hand of a mechanic.  The storm outside seemed to mirror the turmoil inside Amy; it wasn’t just the weather that was threatening her chance at glory. Something felt amiss, off-kilter in the way Scarlett's engine refused to cooperate.
