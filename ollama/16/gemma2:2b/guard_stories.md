Sergeant Valerius Thorne, known for his stoicism and unwavering gaze, stood at the outer wall of Auberon's Keep, a fortress built on fearsome cliffs overlooking the desolate Sea of Whispers. The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the distant rasping of waves against the jagged coastline.

His duty went far beyond mere protection; it was a silent vow to uphold the honor and safety of the man who was both their king and their protector.
