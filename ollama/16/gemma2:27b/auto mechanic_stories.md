The grease under Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s fingernails wasn't just grime; it was a badge of honor.  A testament to years spent wrestling with temperamental engines, coaxing life back into rusted carcasses, and understanding the symphony of pops, whirs, and groans that made up the language of machines.  Her garage, "Rodriguez Rides" nestled in the heart of Albuquerque's historic Old Town, was a haven for forgotten classics and sputtering jalopies. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows, illuminating a chaotic tableau of tools, engine parts, and half-dismantled vehicles. 

Today, however, Amy wasn't focused on her usual clientele of dented pick-ups and sputtering sedans.  A sleek, midnight black 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500 sat proudly in the center bay, its polished chrome glinting under the fluorescent lights. It was a rare beauty, brought in by a mysterious stranger with piercing blue eyes and a voice as smooth as engine oil. He'd simply said, "Make her purr again," and left Amy with a wad of cash thicker than any she'd seen before. 


The challenge sparked something deep within Amy - a hunger to prove herself worthy of this mechanical masterpiece. But as she began digging into the Mustang’s innards, she uncovered a secret, hidden beneath layers of chrome and horsepower – a secret that threatened to unravel everything she thought she knew about cars, trust, and the shadows that lurked in the heart of Albuquerque's sun-drenched streets.
