Eliza "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted the delicate sugar rosebud on the tiered lavender cake, her brow furrowed in concentration. Sunlight streamed through the window of her cozy bakery, "Sugar & Spice," illuminating swirls of flour dust dancing in the air. Outside, the quaint cobblestone streets of Willow Creek bustled with Saturday morning shoppers, but Ellie was lost in her own world – a world of buttercream blossoms, fondant filigree, and edible glitter.

Today's commission was for Mrs. Hawthorne's granddaughter's quinceañera. The cake needed to be both elegant and whimsical, reflecting the young girl's dreams of becoming a ballerina. Ellie had spent days meticulously crafting sugar pointe shoes and a miniature tutu, carefully assembling them atop a cascade of lavender buttercream.

But as she stepped back to admire her work, a jarring chime cut through the tranquil atmosphere. Her phone vibrated on the counter, displaying a number she didn't recognize. Hesitantly, Ellie answered.
