Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already muted colours of the autumn afternoon. Leaves, once vibrant shades of crimson and gold, were now sodden brown masses tumbling along the sidewalk outside Westbridge High. Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a pile of college brochures she'd meant to alphabetize weeks ago. Her normally tidy desk was cluttered with student files â€“ a testament to the mounting pressure of college applications season.

The bell signaling the end of classes reverberated through the halls, followed by a wave of adolescent chatter and shuffling feet. Soon, her office door would be flung open by students seeking last-minute advice, panicked pleas for help deciphering SAT scores, and the occasional tearful confession of existential dread. Eleanor braced herself. It was going to be a long afternoon.
