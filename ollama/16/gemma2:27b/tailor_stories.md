Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thornbridge's shop, blurring the already indistinct view of cobblestone alleyway below. The scent of wet wool and dust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of lavender from the sachet tucked between bolts of emerald green silk. Elias, his silver hair escaping its usual bun and plastered to his forehead, sighed as he surveyed the empty shop.

His needle lay abandoned on a half-finished doublet, the crimson velvet shimmering dully under the weak gaslight. The bell above the door hadn't chimed in days, a silence that echoed the emptiness gnawing at Elias's heart. Times were hard, and the once-bustling port city of Saltwind seemed to be losing its vibrancy thread by thread, leaving behind only frayed ends and unanswered prayers.
