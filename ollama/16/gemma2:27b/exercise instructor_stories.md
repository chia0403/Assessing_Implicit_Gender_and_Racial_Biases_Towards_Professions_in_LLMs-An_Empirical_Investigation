Sweat beaded on Elara "Ellie" Solstice's brow as she barked instructions through the thumping bassline of the workout playlist. "One more set! You got this, warriors!" Her voice echoed through the cavernous studio, bouncing off exposed brick walls and mirrored panels. Outside, the Miami sun beat down relentlessly, casting long shadows from the palm trees lining Ocean Drive. But in here, under the kaleidoscopic glow of the disco ball, it was a different world. A world where Ellie, with her toned physique and infectious enthusiasm, reigned supreme as Queen of Cardio Blast.

Today's class was packed, bodies pushing and pulsing to the rhythm. Tourists and locals alike had flocked to Ellie's high-energy session, drawn by her reputation for delivering an exhilarating workout disguised as pure fun. But even as she grinned and motivated the crowd, a nagging unease tugged at Ellie's heart. A feeling that something wasn't quite right.
