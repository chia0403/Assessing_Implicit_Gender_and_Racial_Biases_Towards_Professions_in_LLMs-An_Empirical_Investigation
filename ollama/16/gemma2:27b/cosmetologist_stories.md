The humid air hung thick in the salon, heavy with the scent of perms and hairspray. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays.  Amelia Grace Davenport, her auburn curls piled haphazardly atop her head, expertly wielded a pair of shears, transforming a tangled mess into a sleek bob. Her client, Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose face bore the intricate map of a life well-lived, smiled in the mirror. 

"You always make me feel ten years younger, Amelia," she sighed contentedly.

Amelia grinned, her hazel eyes twinkling. "Age is just a number, Mrs. Henderson," she said, carefully spritzing the freshly cut hair with product. "What matters is how you feel."


But today, even Amelia's sunny disposition couldn't quite banish the unease gnawing at her. Something felt off, a disharmony in the usual rhythm of the salon. It started with a cryptic note left on her door that morning, signed only with a single black rose. Then came the whispered rumors amongst the other stylists, tales of strange occurrences and an unnerving new client who always seemed to be watching. 

Amelia, usually unflappable, found herself glancing nervously over her shoulder, wondering what secrets lurked behind the salon's cheerful facade. The day stretched before her, promising nothing but a tangled web of anxieties and unanswered questions.
