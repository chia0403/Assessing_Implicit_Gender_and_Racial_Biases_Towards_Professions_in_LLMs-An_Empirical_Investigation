The greasy wrench slipped in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' calloused hand, sending a spray of rusty water across his face. He swore under his breath, spitting out a mouthful of grit as he surveyed the mangled mess beneath Mrs. O'Malley's sink. It looked like a family of raccoons had decided to throw a wild party down there.  

Bart sighed, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. This was supposed to be a simple faucet replacement. Now, he was staring at a tangled nest of ancient pipes, each one seemingly more corroded than the last. Mrs. O'Malley's Victorian home, charming as it was, seemed determined to test his plumbing skills to their limit. The scent of lavender and old books hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the musty aroma rising from the depths of the sinkhole. Sunlight streamed through the kitchen window, illuminating dust motes dancing in a lazy waltz. Bart knew he'd be here for a while.
