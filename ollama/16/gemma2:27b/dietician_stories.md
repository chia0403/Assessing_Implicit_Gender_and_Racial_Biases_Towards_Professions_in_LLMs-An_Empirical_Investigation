It spoke of whispered rumors and shadowy figures, urging Eloise to dig deeper. The sender remained anonymous, their motives unclear. 


Eloise hesitated, torn between her professional duty and the unsettling curiosity ignited by the email. Should she dismiss it as a cruel prank? Or was there something truly sinister lurking beneath the surface of Liam's seemingly straightforward recovery?
