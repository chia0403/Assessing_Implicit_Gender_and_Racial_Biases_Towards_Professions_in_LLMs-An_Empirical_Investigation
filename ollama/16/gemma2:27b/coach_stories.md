The rusty squeak of the gym door echoed through the cavernous space, its sound swallowed by the dusty silence that clung to the peeling paint and warped floorboards. Eliza Jane "EJ" McKinley surveyed the scene with a sigh. Sunlight streamed through grimy windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in lazy patterns. It was 6 am, the usual hour she'd find herself surrounded by the cacophony of dribbling basketballs, the sharp thwack of volleyballs, and the rhythmic thud of running shoes. But today, the gym was as empty and forlorn as a ghost town.

EJ tugged at her worn whistle necklace, its brass gleaming dimly in the weak light. The silence pressed down on her, amplifying the weight of the decision that had brought her here. After fifteen years coaching at Willow Creek High, EJ was facing a crossroads â€“ the school board's budget cuts had eliminated her position, leaving her with a choice: walk away from the only life she knew or fight for what she loved.
