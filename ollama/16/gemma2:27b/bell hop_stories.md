The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hummed with the quiet symphony of opulence: the gentle clink of silverware from the afternoon tea service, the rustle of silk gowns gliding across polished marble floors, and the low murmur of conversations conducted in hushed tones befitting the establishment's clientele. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a bellhop with hair the color of tarnished copper and eyes perpetually squinting against the shimmering chandeliers, navigated this world with practiced ease. He knew every creak of the antique grandfather clock by the entrance, the precise angle at which to bow his head when addressing a Countess, and the secret passageways leading to the staff quarters where he could escape the suffocating grandeur for a moment's respite.

But today was different. Today, Bart felt a tremor in the air, a discordant note amidst the usual symphony. A hush had fallen over the lobby as guests craned their necks towards the grand double doors, anticipation hanging thick like the scent of lilies from the towering floral arrangements. Bart, instinctively sensing something momentous was about to unfold, straightened his uniform and prepared himself for whatever guest might walk through those imposing doors.
