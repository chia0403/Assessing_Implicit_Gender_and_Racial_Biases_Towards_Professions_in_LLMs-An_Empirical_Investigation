The midday sun beat down on the dusty courtyard of Silas Hawthorne's workshop, turning the air thick and hazy. Sweat trickled down Silas's weathered face, stinging his eyes as he chipped away at a block of rough-hewn granite. The rhythmic clang of his hammer against the stone was a familiar symphony, one that had echoed through this space for decades. 

Silas' workshop wasn't grand â€“ just a modest courtyard tucked away in a quiet corner of the bustling market district. Walls built from sun-baked bricks enclosed a space filled with tools and half-finished projects. Chisels gleamed under a flickering oil lamp, and mounds of stone dust lay like miniature mountains, testament to Silas's tireless work.

Today, he was carving a gargoyle for the cathedral, its wings outstretched, ready to ward off evil spirits. It was a challenging commission, one that demanded precision and artistry. But Silas relished the challenge. He saw himself not just as a stone cutter, but as a sculptor, breathing life into inert matter. 

As he hammered away, a shadow fell across his work. Glancing up, Silas saw a young woman standing in the doorway, her face obscured by a hooded cloak.  Her presence was unexpected and unnerving, bringing with it an unsettling stillness that disrupted the rhythm of Silas's work.
