The air in the studio hung thick with the scent of turpentine and regret.  A lone shaft of sunlight pierced through the grimy skylight, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its beam. Emilia Rose Blackwood stared at the canvas before her, a once-vibrant landscape now marred by streaks of muddy brown where she'd tried, and failed, to capture the essence of a Tuscan sunset. Her brush lay abandoned on the palette, bristles stiff with dried paint, mirroring the frustration hardening within her.

Emilia had dreamt of this studio since she was a child, sketching portraits of stray cats in her bedroom using crayons pilfered from her younger brother. Now, at 28, she finally occupied a space all her own - a cramped attic room overlooking a cobbled alleyway in Prague's Old Town. The city, with its gothic spires and cobblestone streets, was supposed to be her muse. But the inspiration seemed elusive, hidden behind a veil of self-doubt and creative block.
