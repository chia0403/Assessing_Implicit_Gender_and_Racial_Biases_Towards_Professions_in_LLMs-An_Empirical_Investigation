The late afternoon sun, filtering through dusty blinds, cast long shadows across Judge Alistair Cavendish's mahogany desk. Papers stacked precariously threatened to topple over with every rustle of his robes as he reviewed the case file. A sense of unease gnawed at him, something he rarely felt after years on the bench. This wasn't just another petty theft or breach of contract. This was a murder trial, and the evidence, while circumstantial, pointed towards a man Cavendish knew personally - Councilman Edgar Thornton. 


The courtroom itself, usually abuzz with hushed whispers and nervous shuffling, lay silent except for the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock on the wall. It felt heavy, oppressive, mirroring the weight bearing down on Cavendish's conscience. He had known Thornton for years, shared drinks and dinners with him at various social gatherings. Could this polished, affable man truly be capable of such a heinous act? Doubt, a venomous serpent, coiled in his gut.
