The greasy spoon diner hummed with the tired energy of pre-dawn regulars. Outside, the sky was still the bruised purple of a fading dream, streetlights casting long shadows on the slick asphalt. Officer Eliza Mae "Lizzie" Ramirez hunched over her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring the sourness twisting in her gut. Another night, another unsolved case. This one, a young woman found strangled in an alleyway behind the Grand Theatre, felt different. The victim's vacant eyes seemed to pierce through Lizzie, accusing her of failing.  

Lizzie pushed away the plate with its sad remnants of bacon and eggs, the grease reflecting the neon glow from the diner sign. She needed fresh air, needed to shake off this gnawing sense of defeat. Pulling on her worn leather jacket, she stepped out into the damp chill, the city slowly awakening around her.
