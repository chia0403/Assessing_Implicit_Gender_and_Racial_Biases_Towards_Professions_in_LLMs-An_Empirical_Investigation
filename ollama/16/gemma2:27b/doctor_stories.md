The acrid smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of jasmine from the wilting bouquet on Dr. Elara Vance's desk. Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond into an Impressionist painting of smeared color. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the deserted hospital corridor, a sound that usually soothed Elara but tonight only amplified her unease. 

The waiting room was empty, chairs pushed haphazardly aside, echoing the turmoil in her own mind. She rubbed her temples, trying to banish the image seared into her memory â€“ the lifeless eyes of young Daniel, staring vacantly at the ceiling just moments before his heart had faltered for good.
