The sun beat down on Silas Bartholomew Finnigan's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with the rusted bolt holding the guardrail in place. Highway 23 stretched endlessly before him, a ribbon of asphalt baking under the relentless July heat.

Silas wasn't sure why they called it "Highway" 23 anymore. The once bustling artery connecting two small towns had become more of a forgotten backroad, choked with weeds and dotted with faded "Welcome to..." signs that seemed to whisper tales of bygone days.  It was lonely work, tending to this neglected stretch of asphalt, but Silas found a strange comfort in its solitude.  He knew every dip and curve, every pothole and patch of wildflowers clinging to life along the dusty shoulder.

Today, however, felt different. A tension pulsed beneath the surface of the quiet, a feeling that something was about to change. As Silas finally wrenched the stubborn bolt free, he swore he heard the faint hum of an engine in the distance, breaking the monotonous silence for the first time all day.
