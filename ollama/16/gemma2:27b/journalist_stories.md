Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the derelict diner, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood, her trench coat still dripping despite being hastily shed at the entrance, hunched over a chipped Formica table, scribbling furiously into her notebook. The air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying grease, a greasy film coating everything within reach.

Outside, the neon sign flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across the deserted highway stretching out before them. Amy's eyes darted between the blurred figures passing by through the rain-streaked glass and the cryptic message scrawled on the back of a napkin in front of her: "They're watching. The lighthouse knows."

She had been following this story for months â€“ whispers of a shadowy organization operating within the sleepy coastal town of Havenwood, their motives shrouded in secrecy. The tip about the lighthouse had come from an anonymous source, a voice barely audible through the static on the other end of the line. Amy knew it was risky, venturing into this unknown territory alone, but something about the urgency in the voice, the desperation clinging to every word, compelled her forward.

Tonight, under the relentless downpour and the flickering neon glow of the deserted diner, she felt closer than ever to uncovering the truth. But as a pair of headlights sliced through the darkness outside, stopping abruptly across the street, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.  The message on the napkin suddenly seemed less like a clue and more like a warning.
