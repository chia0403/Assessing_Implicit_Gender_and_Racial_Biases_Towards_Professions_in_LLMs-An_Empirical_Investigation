Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, blurring the streetlights into halos of gold. The usual bustle of Elm Street had dwindled to a hushed murmur punctuated by the rhythmic drumming of water on pavement. Inside, the waiting room was deserted, the plush armchairs sitting empty like forgotten dreams.

Elias himself perched precariously on the edge of his own dental chair, flipping through a well-worn copy of "The Count of Monte Cristo," but his mind wasn't on Edmond Dantes' quest for vengeance. His gaze kept drifting towards the storm raging outside, a reflection perhaps of the tempest brewing within him. A letter lay unopened on his desk, its crisp white envelope mocking him with unspoken anxieties. It was an invitation, a summons he couldn't refuse â€“ to return to the town he'd sworn never to see again, Willow Creek.
