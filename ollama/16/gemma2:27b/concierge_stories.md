The polished marble floor gleamed under the opulent chandelier, reflecting a thousand fractured rainbows onto the tapestry-laden walls.  Eloise Marchand, her crisp black uniform immaculate despite the incessant stream of demanding guests, sighed inwardly as she adjusted the silk scarf at her throat. The Grand Palais Hotel was abuzz with activity: businessmen in tailored suits barking into phones, giggling socialites sipping champagne, and harried families attempting to wrangle over-excited children. 

Eloise loved the grandeur, the whispers of history echoing through the ornate hallways, but she longed for a break from the endless requests. Finding the rarest vintage wine, securing last-minute tickets to the opera, locating a lost poodle â€“ these were just a few of the oddities Eloise navigated daily as the concierge of the Grand Palais. Today promised more of the same. 

As if summoned by her thoughts, the brass bell at the concierge desk chimed, announcing a new arrival. Eloise plastered on her practiced smile and prepared to face whatever extraordinary whim awaited her.
