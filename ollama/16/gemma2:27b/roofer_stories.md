The midday sun beat down on Ezekiel "Zeke" Moreau's neck as he hammered in another shingle, sweat stinging his eyes. Below him, the city stretched out like a rumpled tapestry – grey rooftops interspersed with splashes of green from neglected gardens and the occasional defiant splash of vibrant bougainvillea climbing a brick wall. Zeke was perched precariously on the steep roof of Mrs. Petrov's Victorian townhouse, the scent of her lavender bushes wafting up to him along with the distant rumble of a passing bus.

He paused, wiping his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, and gazed out over the cityscape. It wasn't much, but from up here, Zeke could almost forget the aching in his knees and the constant fear of a misplaced step sending him tumbling into oblivion. For a few fleeting moments, he felt free – a solitary figure against a backdrop of sprawling urban chaos. 

But then Mrs. Petrov's voice, sharp as a bird's call, pierced through his reverie. "Ezekiel! Are you almost done with that roof? My grandson is coming for tea and I need the porch clear!" Zeke sighed, knowing that even his brief moment of solitude was over. Back to work, he thought grimly, the rhythm of hammer against nail echoing once more in the humid air.
