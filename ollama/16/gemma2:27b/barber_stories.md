The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma that Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins had inhaled every day for the past forty years. His shop, Higgins' Barber Shop, was a haven from the bustling world outside. Nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Willow Creek, its window displayed faded photographs of pompadours and crew cuts, relics of a bygone era when men took pride in their appearance.

Bart stood behind his worn leather chair, the afternoon sun casting long shadows across the checkered linoleum floor. His reflection stared back from the mirror: a man etched with time, his silver hair neatly combed, his eyes crinkling at the corners with a lifetime of smiles. Today, however, the smile didn't quite reach his eyes. A familiar unease gnawed at him â€“ a feeling that something was amiss in Willow Creek, something darker than the approaching storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
