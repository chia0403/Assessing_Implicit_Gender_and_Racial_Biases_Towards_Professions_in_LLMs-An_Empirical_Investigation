The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's head, casting an unsettling green tinge over everything in the cramped examination room. The smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of bubblegum toothpaste. Esme sighed, adjusting her loupes and peering into the cavernous maw of Mrs. Henderson, whose anxieties about root canals were reaching operatic levels. 

Outside, the bustling streets of New Orleans pulsed with life – jazz music drifting from nearby bars, the rhythmic clatter of streetcars, and the intoxicating aroma of beignets wafting through the humid air. But inside this sterile haven, Esme felt a million miles away from the vibrant city she called home.  The monotony of plaque removal and periodontal charting was starting to wear on her soul. Today, more than ever, she longed for something…more.

Something beyond the endless stream of molars and premolars.
