The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to pierce through the ancient oak trees that lined the periphery of Whispering Pines Estate when Theodore Bartholomew Finchley began his rounds. The dew clung heavy to the manicured lawns, sparkling like a million tiny diamonds under the nascent light. Theo, as everyone called him, inhaled deeply, savouring the crisp air laced with the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth.

Whispering Pines was more than just his place of work; it was a sanctuary, a sprawling tapestry woven from emerald lawns, vibrant flowerbeds bursting with colour, and winding pathways that beckoned exploration. For decades, Theo had tended to this estate with meticulous care, nurturing the land like a beloved child. He knew every nook and cranny, every whispering secret held by the ancient trees.

But today, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, a dissonance that clashed with the usual symphony of birdsong. As Theo rounded the corner leading to the rose garden, he noticed it: a single crimson rose lying on the cobblestone path, its petals still unfurled, as if freshly plucked. There was no wind to carry it there, and the other roses in the meticulously pruned beds stood proud and untouched. This rose was a jarring anomaly, a silent scream amidst the tranquil beauty of Whispering Pines.
