The flickering neon sign of "Lucky's Liquor" cast an anemic glow on Edgar Bartholomew Finnegan III's wrinkled face as he trudged through the slush.  He adjusted the battered briefcase slung across his shoulder, its worn leather groaning in protest. A bitter wind whipped down Elm Street, gnawing at Edgar's already threadbare coat. Elmwood, Ohio wasn't exactly known for its balmy winters.

Edgar sighed. He hadn't closed a sale in weeks. The relentless pessimism of the times – economic downturn, global uncertainty, rampant bad luck – had people clinging tighter to their dwindling savings than ever before. They saw insurance as a luxury they couldn't afford, not a lifeline against the inevitable storms life threw their way.

Tonight, though, he felt a sliver of hope. He was meeting Mrs. Beatrice Henderson, a recently widowed woman who owned a quaint little bakery just down the street from Lucky's. Her husband had been one of Edgar's clients, and she'd reached out, expressing interest in continuing his policy. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the break he desperately needed.  

As Edgar approached Beatrice’s Bakery, the aroma of warm cinnamon and fresh bread wafted through the frigid air, a welcome contrast to the harshness of the night. He straightened his tie, hoping it wouldn't come undone again, and pushed open the heavy wooden door.
