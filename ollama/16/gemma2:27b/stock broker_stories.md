The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Eldridge's office was thick with the scent of old money â€“ mahogany, leather, and something vaguely metallic, like freshly minted coins. Outside his window, the glittering spires of Wall Street reflected the setting sun, casting long shadows across the concrete canyons below. Bart himself was a study in contrasts: impeccably tailored in a bespoke charcoal suit, yet with a restless energy humming beneath his surface. His fingers tapped a complex rhythm on his antique mahogany desk, each tap punctuated by the sharp click of the vintage Montblanc pen he idly twirled.

Today was different. The usual hum of the trading floor had been replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the frantic whispers exchanged between brokers and the occasional shrill ring of a phone. Bart's stomach churned with a mixture of apprehension and exhilaration. He'd spent years building his reputation as a fearless risk-taker, but even he couldn't ignore the ominous tremor running through the market. Something was brewing, something big enough to shake the foundations of Wall Street.
