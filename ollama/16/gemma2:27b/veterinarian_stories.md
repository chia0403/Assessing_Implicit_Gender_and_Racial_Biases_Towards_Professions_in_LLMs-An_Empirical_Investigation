The insistent chirping of crickets filled the humid Alabama air as Dr. Amelia Blackwood wrestled a wriggling German Shepherd puppy onto the examination table. The scent of pine needles and damp earth wafted through the open windows of her mobile clinic, "Paws on Wheels," parked precariously on the edge of an overgrown field.  A rusted pickup truck sat nearby, its driver, a burly man with a weathered face and calloused hands, nervously paced while Amelia checked the pup's heart rate.

"Don't worry, Mr. Henderson," Amelia reassured him, her voice calm despite the puppy's determined wiggles. "Little Duke is just full of energy. He'll be right as rain after his vaccinations." 


The sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the field. A chorus of cicadas rose in the air, their buzzing a constant reminder of the encroaching twilight. Amelia knew she had to wrap things up soon if she wanted to get back to her clinic before dark.  But as she glanced at Mr. Henderson's worried face, she couldn't help but linger a little longer. There was something about his apprehension that tugged at her heartstrings.

What secrets did this small Alabama town hold? What hidden stories lay beneath the surface of its sleepy charm? And what awaited Amelia Blackwood in the deepening shadows?
