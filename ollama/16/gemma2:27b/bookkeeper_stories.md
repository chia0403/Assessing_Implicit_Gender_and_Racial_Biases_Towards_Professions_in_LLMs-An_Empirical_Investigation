Rain hammered against the warped glass pane of Eloise Blackwood's office window, blurring the already indistinct view of the alleyway below. The rhythmic drumming echoed the dull throb in her temple. A stack of invoices sat precariously on her desk, each one a testament to the ever-increasing chaos of Mr. Finchley's import business. Numbers danced before her eyes, refusing to settle into coherent columns.

Eloise, with her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose and her greying bun threatening to unravel, sighed. The air in the cramped office was thick with the scent of mildew and old paper. A lone gas lamp flickered weakly, casting elongated shadows that seemed to writhe like tormented souls.

She longed for the quiet sanctuary of her own home, a cozy nook nestled above Mrs. Higgins' bakery. There, amidst the comforting aroma of freshly baked bread and the gentle ticking of her grandfather clock, she could lose herself in the intricate world of figures and ledgers. But duty called, and Mr. Finchley, with his flamboyant personality and penchant for questionable dealings, expected his books balanced by nightfall.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Eloise's spine, a sense of unease that transcended the usual anxieties of her work. It was as if the rain itself carried whispers of danger, swirling around the dusty windowpane like unseen spectres.
