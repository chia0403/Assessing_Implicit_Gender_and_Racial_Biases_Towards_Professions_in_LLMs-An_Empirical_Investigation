The wind whipped across the dusty plains, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and distant rain. Silas Jeremiah Blackwood squinted at the horizon, his weathered face etched with worry lines deeper than the arroyos carving their way through his land. The sun beat down relentlessly, turning the scrubland into a shimmering mirage. For weeks, it hadn't rained, and the once vibrant green pastures were now brittle brown skeletons, the thirsty earth cracking beneath Silasâ€™s heavy boots. 

Silas adjusted the brim of his Stetson hat, shielding his eyes from the glare. His calloused hands tightened on the reins of his trusty mare, Buttercup, as he scanned the herd grazing listlessly in the distance. They were thin, their ribs showing through their patchy hides. He needed rain, and he needed it soon.
