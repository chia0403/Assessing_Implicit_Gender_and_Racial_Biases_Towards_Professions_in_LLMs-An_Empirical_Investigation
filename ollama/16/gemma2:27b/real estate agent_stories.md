The humid Charleston air clung to Eloise Beaumont like a damp shawl as she navigated the cobblestone streets towards 18 Anson Street. Sunlight glinted off the pastel-colored houses, their ornate balconies overflowing with fragrant jasmine and bougainvillea. Tourists, cameras in hand, jostled for space on the sidewalks, their excited chatter adding to the already cacophonous symphony of the city. Eloise, however, was immune to the charm offensive.

She'd seen enough charming streets and crumbling mansions to last a lifetime. 18 Anson Street held no allure for her, just another listing in a long string of disappointments. The client, a wealthy recluse named Alistair Hawthorne, had been notoriously difficult, demanding unreasonable renovations and threatening lawsuits at the drop of a hat. Eloise braced herself. Selling a house was supposed to be about dreams and new beginnings, but today, it felt more like navigating a minefield.
