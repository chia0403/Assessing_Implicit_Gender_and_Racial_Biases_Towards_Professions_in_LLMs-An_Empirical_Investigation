Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm raging inside her own mind. The cluttered space, usually filled with the comforting scent of lavender candles and the faint hum of her antique gramophone, felt suffocating tonight. Papers lay scattered across her desk - patient files, research notes, unfinished grant proposals. Each one a reminder of the overwhelming pressure she was under.

Eleanor sank deeper into her leather armchair, its familiar embrace offering little solace. The case that had been consuming her for weeks weighed heavy on her conscience. Daniel Hawthorne, a young artist plagued by vivid nightmares and crippling anxiety, had become an enigma. His symptoms defied easy diagnosis, his subconscious whispering of hidden traumas Eleanor couldn't decipher.

The insistent buzz of her phone jolted her back to reality.  It was Daniel, his voice trembling as he begged for an emergency session. Eleanor hesitated, glancing at the clock - it was nearly midnight. Yet, something in his voice compelled her. Closing the file on her desk with a decisive snap, she knew what she had to do.
