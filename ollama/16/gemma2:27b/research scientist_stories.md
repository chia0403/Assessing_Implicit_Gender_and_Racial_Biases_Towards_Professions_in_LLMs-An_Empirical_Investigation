The acrid smell of ozone stung Dr. Evelyn Ainsworth's nostrils as she adjusted the dial on the Tesla coil, its humming filling the cavernous laboratory with an eerie vibration. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned observatory perched atop Mount Aethelred, mirroring the turbulent storm brewing inside her.  Evelyn was close, she could feel it. Years of relentless research, fueled by caffeine and obsession, were culminating in this moment.

The air shimmered around the central apparatus, a towering brass sphere inscribed with arcane symbols gleaned from ancient texts. Tonight, Evelyn Ainsworth intended to pierce the veil between worlds, to unlock the secrets hidden in the whispers of the quantum foam.
