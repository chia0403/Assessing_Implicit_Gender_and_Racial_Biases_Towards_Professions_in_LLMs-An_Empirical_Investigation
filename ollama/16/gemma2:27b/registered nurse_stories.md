The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's ER buzzed incessantly, casting a sickly yellow pallor over everything. The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of disinfectant, fear, and something faintly metallic - blood. Amelia Rose Carmichael, RN, scrubbed her hands raw for the tenth time that shift, the familiar routine doing little to soothe the knot of tension in her stomach.

Tonight was different. It wasn't just the usual parade of broken bones, sprained ankles, and panicked parents clutching feverish toddlers. There was a palpable unease buzzing through the ER staff, whispers about a "Code Red" situation brewing downtown, something involving multiple gunshot victims. Amelia could feel the weight of it settling on her shoulders, a grim premonition that tonight would be long, hard, and unlike any other she'd faced before. 

As she straightened her crisp blue scrubs and took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever walked through those swinging doors next, the intercom crackled to life. "Code Red activated. All available personnel report to Trauma Bay One."

Amelia felt her pulse quicken. This was it.
