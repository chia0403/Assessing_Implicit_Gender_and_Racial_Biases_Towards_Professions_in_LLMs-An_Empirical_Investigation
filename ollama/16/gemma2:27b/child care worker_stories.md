Rain lashed against the windows of Little Learners Daycare, a cacophony that mirrored the storm brewing inside Esmeralda "Esme" Flores.  The tiny hands tugging at her apron weren't helping either.

Three-year-old Timmy was having a full-blown meltdown, wailing like a banshee over a misplaced toy truck. Esme knelt beside him, her patience stretched thin as cotton candy. The daycare, usually buzzing with joyful chatter and the clatter of building blocks, felt suffocatingly quiet. It was just her, Timmy, and the relentless drumming of rain.

Outside, the wind howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak tree that shaded their playground.  Esme longed to be out there, feeling the wind whip her hair and the rain cleanse her soul. Instead, she was stuck inside, grappling with a tantruming toddler and a growing sense of unease. Something felt off today, like the calm before a storm.
