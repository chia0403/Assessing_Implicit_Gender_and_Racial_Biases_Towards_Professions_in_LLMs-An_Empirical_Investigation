The neon sign outside The Rusty Microphone flickered erratically, casting an oily purple glow across Eliza "Echo" Beaumont's face as she nervously adjusted the strap of her battered guitar case. Rain lashed down, turning the alleyway into a slick, greasy mirror reflecting the city's chaotic heart above. Inside, the bar pulsed with life - a heady mix of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and anticipation for the night's performance. Eliza swallowed hard, pushing aside the tendrils of doubt that threatened to tangle her voice. Tonight was her chance. A scout from a major label was rumoured to be in the audience, and if she could wow them with her soulful voice and gritty lyrics, it could be the ticket out of this dingy existence. But the weight of expectation pressed down on her chest, making her lungs feel tight. Taking a deep breath, Eliza squared her shoulders, the neon light glinting off the silver ring piercing her eyebrow. Tonight, she would sing like her life depended on it.
