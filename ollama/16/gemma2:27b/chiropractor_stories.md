The incessant whirring of the ceiling fan did little to combat the oppressive Louisiana humidity clinging to Dr. Elias Moreau like a second skin.  His clinic, nestled in the heart of New Orleans' vibrant French Quarter, was a sanctuary from the bustling street outside, but even here, the heat seemed to permeate everything.

Elias leaned back in his chair, massaging his temples with weary fingers. A symphony of creaks and groans echoed around him as his aging bones protested against another long day spent adjusting spines and alleviating aches. He'd been practicing chiropractic medicine for nearly two decades, and though he loved helping people find relief from their pain, lately, a nagging sense of discontent had begun to fester within him. 


He glanced at the ornate clock ticking away on the wall - almost closing time. Elias sighed, wondering if this was all there was: endless adjustments, repetitive routines, and the same weary faces staring up at him from his treatment table. Perhaps it was time for a change.

But what? That question hung heavy in the air, unanswered.
