The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like agitated bees, amplifying the sterile quiet of Dr. Amelia Rosalind Croft's office. Sunlight, weak and watery after days of relentless rain, struggled through the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across the worn, floral carpet. Amelia sat at her desk, a mountain of student files threatening to spill onto the floor. Each file represented a life, a tapestry woven with hopes, anxieties, and struggles she sought to untangle. 

Today's case loomed large: Ethan Blackwood, a quiet, withdrawn boy from Mrs. Hawthorne's fifth-grade class. His teacher had reported sudden, inexplicable changes in his behavior: nightmares, aggressive outbursts, and an unsettling fascination with the woods behind the school. Amelia knew she needed to tread carefully; Ethan was just twelve, on the cusp of adolescence, when childhood fantasies blurred with reality.  

Taking a deep breath, Amelia reached for Ethan's file, her fingers tracing the embossed lettering. The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a reminder of the weight of responsibility she carried. Today, she wasn't just a school psychologist; she was Ethan Blackwood's lifeline, a beacon in the storm raging within him.
