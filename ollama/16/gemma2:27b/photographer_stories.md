The biting wind whipped off the Baltic Sea, stinging Elara Vashti's exposed cheeks even through her thick wool scarf. The sky above Riga was the color of pewter, heavy with the threat of snow. Elara clutched her camera tighter, its weight a reassuring presence in the chill. She wasn't here for the idyllic postcard views of Latvia's capital; she sought something rawer, more authentic.

Her gaze swept across the decaying grandeur of the abandoned shipyard. Rusted hulks of ships sat like skeletal beasts against the grey horizon, their once-proud hulls now scarred and pitted. Graffiti adorned the crumbling brick buildings, splashes of vibrant color against the monochrome landscape. This was Elara's playground - a world of forgotten beauty and haunting stillness.
