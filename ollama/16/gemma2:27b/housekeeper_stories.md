Rain lashed against the ornate stained-glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust rattling the ancient panes in their frames. The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows that danced with the flames, making the already imposing hallway seem even more cavernous. Emilia Cavendish, her hands gnarled and weathered from years of scrubbing and polishing, adjusted the heavy shawl around her shoulders. She'd been housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for nearly twenty years, witnessing generations of the Blackwood family come and go. Tonight, however, a sense of unease hung in the air thicker than the dampness that clung to everything.

The Master, Lord Frederick Blackwood, had returned from a long voyage with whispers of strange occurrences following him â€“ tales of forgotten languages, ancient artifacts, and unsettling dreams. Emilia, a woman of practicality and faith, dismissed them as sailor's fancies. Yet, something about his hollow eyes and the tension that clung to him like cobwebs unsettled her deeply.

As she ascended the grand staircase, its polished mahogany gleaming dully in the dim light, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss at Blackwood Manor. Something ancient and unsettling had awakened with Lord Frederick's return, and she feared it would soon cast a shadow over everything she held dear.
