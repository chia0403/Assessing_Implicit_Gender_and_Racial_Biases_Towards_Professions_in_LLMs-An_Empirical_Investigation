The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung thick in the air, battling for dominance with the faint whiff of lavender disinfectant. Eleanor Rosewick, her fingers already tingling with anticipation, adjusted the silk scarf draped over the antique brass lamp. The soft glow it cast illuminated the cluttered shelves lined with bottles of essential oils, crystals humming with supposed energy, and stacks of well-thumbed anatomy books. Outside, the relentless Seattle drizzle hammered against the windowpane, a familiar symphony to Eleanor's ears. Her sanctuary, nestled in the heart of Ballard, was a haven from the city's grey chill, a place where knotted muscles surrendered to her touch and weary souls found solace.

Tonight, however, a knot of anxiety twisted in Eleanor's own stomach. A new client was scheduled â€“ a man named Mr. Hawthorne who had requested the "Deep Release" massage, a treatment she rarely offered due to its intensity. He'd been vague on the phone, his voice low and gravelly, hinting at deep-seated pain both physical and emotional. As Eleanor heard the bell above the door chime, she took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever awaited her behind that oak door.
