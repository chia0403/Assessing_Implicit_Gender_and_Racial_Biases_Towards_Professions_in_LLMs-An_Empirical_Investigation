The sawdust hung in the air like a pale, shimmering fog, catching the weak morning sunbeams that slanted through the grimy windows of Silas Blackwood's workshop.  He ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished table leg, his mind already picturing the intricate carvings he planned to add. The scent of pine and cedar filled the small space, a familiar and comforting aroma that Silas associated with home more than any dwelling ever could. His workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the bustling port city of Oakhaven, was his sanctuary, a place where wood transformed under his skilled hands into objects of beauty and utility.

Today, however, a sense of unease prickled beneath Silas's usual calm. The air felt heavy, pregnant with something unspoken. He chalked it up to nerves â€“ he was due to deliver the intricately carved chest of drawers to Lord Hawthorne that afternoon, a commission that could make or break his fledgling business. Still, as Silas picked up his carving knife and began carefully outlining the delicate floral pattern on the table leg, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in Oakhaven.
