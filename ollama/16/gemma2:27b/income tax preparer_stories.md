The air conditioner wheezed its tired protest against the late April heat, sending a thin stream of lukewarm air across Esmeralda "Esme" Delgado's desk. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song, oblivious to the stress mounting within the cramped office. Stacks of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts threatened to topple over, a testament to Esme's dwindling hope that she'd ever see sunlight again before April 15th. She massaged her temples, wishing for a double espresso and a vacation somewhere with actual trees and less paperwork.

Esme's office wasn't much to look at – a cramped space above a laundromat on the less glamorous side of Albuquerque. The walls were a sickly shade of yellow that seemed to amplify the fluorescent lights overhead. But despite its humble appearance, it was Esme's sanctuary. For six months out of the year, she was the queen of deductions, the mistress of marginal rates, the savior of those who couldn't decipher the labyrinthine language of the IRS.

This year, though, felt different. A strange case had landed on her desk – a file labeled simply "The Blackwood Estate" that promised to be anything but ordinary.
