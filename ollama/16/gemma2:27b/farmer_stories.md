The rooster's crow sliced through the pre-dawn gloom, startling Elias Finch awake. He grumbled, pulling the scratchy wool blanket tighter around his thin frame. The chill of early autumn had already seeped into the farmhouse, and Elias knew it wouldn't be long before frost settled upon the pumpkin patch. He sighed, pushing aside the covers and swinging his legs onto the cold wooden floor.

Elias lived alone on a sprawling farm nestled in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains. The land had been in his family for generations, passed down from father to son like a precious heirloom. It was rugged and unforgiving, but Elias knew every inch of it as intimately as he knew his own face. He could smell the damp earth after a rain shower, hear the whisper of the wind through the ancient maple trees, and feel the pulse of life in the soil beneath his calloused hands.

Today promised to be a busy one. The harvest was nearing its peak, and Elias had fields of pumpkins, squash, and corn begging to be gathered. He could already picture the vibrant orange orbs piled high in the barn, ready for market.
