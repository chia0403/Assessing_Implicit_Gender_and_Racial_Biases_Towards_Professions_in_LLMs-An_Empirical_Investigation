The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she unlocked the door to her office. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into hazy orbs. It was one of those nights in Seattle where the city seemed to exhale a collective sigh of dampness and melancholy. Eleanor sighed too, but hers was laced with a different kind of weariness. Sheâ€™d been seeing patients non-stop for the past twelve hours, their anxieties and sorrows clinging to her like the persistent drizzle. 

Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street in Ballard, was a sanctuary from the storm raging outside. Softly lit by lamps casting warm pools of light, it smelled faintly of lavender and chamomile tea. Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with well-thumbed psychology texts and novels that Eleanor turned to for solace. A plush armchair sat opposite her desk, inviting vulnerability and confessions whispered in hushed tones. 

Tonight, however, the chair remained empty.  Eleanor had cancelled her last appointment, a young woman struggling with severe social anxiety, knowing she couldn't offer the empathy and support she usually prided herself on. Eleanor needed to confront her own demons before attempting to guide others through theirs.
