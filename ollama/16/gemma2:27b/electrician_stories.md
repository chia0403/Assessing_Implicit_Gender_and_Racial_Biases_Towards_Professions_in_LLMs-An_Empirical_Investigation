Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, each drop a tiny explosion in the relentless downpour. Theodore "Teddy" Albright squinted through the greasy windowpane, watching the storm rage over the rusted junkyard beyond. The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of ozone and the damp smell of earth. 

His calloused hands tightened around a half-eaten sandwich, the cheap bread already soggy from the humidity. He'd been waiting for hours, hoping the downpour would relent long enough for him to make it to Mrs. Gable's farmhouse on the other side of town. Her ancient wiring was giving her trouble again â€“ something about flickering lights and a humming fuse box that sounded like a disgruntled badger.

Teddy sighed, knowing he wouldn't be getting much sleep tonight. He hated leaving jobs unfinished, especially when they involved elderly folks who relied on him for their safety and comfort. He pulled his greasy cap further down over his brow and grabbed his battered toolbox, the familiar weight comforting in his palm.  It was time to brave the storm.
