Rain lashed against the glass doors of The Obsidian Tower, blurring the city lights into a shimmering watercolour mess. Eloise Cartwright, perched on her ergonomically questionable swivel chair, sighed as she watched another pedestrian scurry past, their umbrella struggling valiantly against the wind. 

The lobby of The Obsidian Tower was a study in stark contrasts: polished granite floors reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights overhead, plush velvet armchairs nestled against brutalist concrete columns, and Eloise herself, clad in a cheery sunflower-yellow blouse that clashed spectacularly with the building's sombre aesthetic.  

Eloise tapped her manicured nails on the sleek black countertop, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain. It was past 7pm, well beyond her usual shift end time, and yet there she remained, the sole occupant of this corporate monolith save for the occasional security guard making his rounds.  

Tonight, however, something felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a sense of anticipation that prickled at Eloise's skin. She couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
