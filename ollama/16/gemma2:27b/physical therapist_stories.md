Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Kettle Cafe, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow in the cavernous space. The scent of burnt coffee mingled with cinnamon and damp wool, painting a familiar picture for Amelia Rose Cartwright. She sat hunched over her lukewarm latte, the steam no longer rising but clinging to the surface like a ghostly shroud. Outside, the old oak tree swayed precariously, its branches scraping against the windowpane in a mournful symphony.

Amelia wasn't one for dramatic weather. In fact, she preferred sunshine and the crisp air of autumn mornings. But today, the relentless downpour mirrored her own mood – heavy, dreary, and tinged with a growing sense of unease.  She was due to start at The Summit Rehabilitation Center tomorrow, a sprawling facility nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, miles from her familiar cityscape. Leaving behind the comfort of her established practice had been a difficult decision, but the allure of helping athletes regain their peak performance after injury proved too tempting to resist.

Now, on the eve of this new chapter, doubt gnawed at Amelia's usually confident demeanor. The Summit was known for its demanding clientele – elite climbers, skiers, and cyclists pushing the boundaries of human endurance. Could she handle the pressure? Was she good enough?
