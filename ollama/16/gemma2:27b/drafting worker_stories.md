The rhythmic whirring of the drafting table fan mingled with the distant clatter of machinery from the factory floor below. Elias Hawthorne squinted at the blueprint spread before him, tracing the lines of a new gear assembly with his calloused fingertip. The fluorescent lights overhead cast a sterile white glow on the cluttered workspace: pencils sharpened to needle points lay scattered amongst crumpled paper scraps and half-empty coffee mugs. Outside the grimy windowpane, rain lashed against the brick facade of the old manufacturing plant, mirroring the persistent ache in Elias's shoulder. He longed for the days when his hands crafted intricate wooden toys instead of cold, impersonal machine parts. 

But those days were long gone, casualties of a changing world where efficiency trumped artistry. Now, Elias was just another cog in the industrial machine, meticulously translating engineers' visions into precise drawings that would soon be churned out by automated presses.
