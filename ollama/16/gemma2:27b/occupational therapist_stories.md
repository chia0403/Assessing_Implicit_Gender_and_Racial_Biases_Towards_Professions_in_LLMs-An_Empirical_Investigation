Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already drab view of the industrial park beyond. Amelia Cartwright sighed, pushing away a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her braid. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the waiting room where she sat. Amelia loved helping people regain their independence after injury or illness, but today, Sunnyside felt more like a prison than a sanctuary.

The silence was broken by the insistent beeping of the door buzzer. A harried-looking nurse appeared, her face etched with worry. "Amelia," she said breathlessly, "Mr. Davies is having a meltdown again." Amelia's stomach clenched.  Harold Davies, a retired carpenter who had suffered a stroke, was notorious for his stubborn resistance to therapy. She knew this session wouldn't be easy. 

Gathering her tools – a colorful set of adaptive utensils, a ball designed for hand strengthening, and a stack of motivational cards – Amelia rose to meet the challenge. "Show me what you can do, Harold," she thought, steeling herself for the battle ahead.
