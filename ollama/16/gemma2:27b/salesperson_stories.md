Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont. He stared at his reflection – tired eyes framed by unruly brown hair, a tie askew like his hopes. The cramped office, smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation, amplified Teddy's despair. 

He was a salesman for Zenith Appliances, peddling second-rate blenders and toasters in a city where every corner seemed occupied by a gleaming new electronics store. Today, however, marked a turning point.  His manager, Mr. Grimshaw, a man whose personality resembled a rusted cog, had delivered the ultimatum: double his sales this month or face termination.

Teddy chewed on his thumbnail, glancing at the overflowing "leads" folder on his desk. Each name represented a potential lifeline, a chance to prove himself and avoid being tossed onto the scrap heap of unemployed salesmen. But how could he possibly convince people to buy subpar appliances when superior models glittered just down the street? 

As the storm raged outside, Teddy knew he had to find a way to turn his own luck around. He just needed a spark – an idea as revolutionary as a self-cleaning toaster oven.
