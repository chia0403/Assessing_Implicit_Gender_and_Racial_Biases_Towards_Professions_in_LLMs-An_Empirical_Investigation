Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation, punctuated by the occasional wheeze from Teddy's ancient radiator. He sat hunched over his desk, a half-empty bottle of bourbon sweating beside him, its amber liquid mirroring the gloom settling in his gut.

The case files lay scattered around him like fallen leaves, each one whispering tales of infidelity, missing persons, and shady dealings. But none had sparked his interest in weeks. The phone, usually his lifeline to trouble, remained stubbornly silent. 


Teddy ran a hand through his thinning hair, the weight of his own past failures settling heavy on his shoulders. He was a man haunted by choices, a detective who'd seen too much and done even more. Now, he awaited the next case, the next chance to redeem himself, all while fighting the encroaching shadows of his own demons.
