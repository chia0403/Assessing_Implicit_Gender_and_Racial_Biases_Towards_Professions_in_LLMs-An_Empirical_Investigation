The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the cluttered shelves crammed with pamphlets promoting colleges both prestigious and obscure.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag pinned awkwardly to her blouse, sighed and smoothed down the wrinkles in her skirt. The air in Ms. Vance's office at Northwood High hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and unfulfilled dreams.

This year's graduating class seemed particularly adrift, their faces etched with worry lines that belied their youthful features. The college application process had become a battlefield, where standardized test scores, GPA averages, and extracurricular achievements were weighed like precious metals on an unseen scale. 

Eleanor watched the clock tick by, each second another reminder of her own mounting frustration. She longed to help these students navigate this chaotic landscape, to guide them towards their passions and purpose. But sometimes, she felt like a lighthouse keeper shouting into the storm, her voice lost amidst the cacophony of anxieties and uncertainties.
