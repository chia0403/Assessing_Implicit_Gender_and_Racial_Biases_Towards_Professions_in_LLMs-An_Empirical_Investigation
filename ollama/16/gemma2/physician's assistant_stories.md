The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and despair in Mercy General's ER.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the city lights into hazy streaks of orange and purple. Amelia "Amy" Davenport, PA-C, squinted at the gurney before her. The young man, no older than twenty, lay pale and still, his chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. A thin line of blood traced a path down his temple, stark against his sun-kissed skin. He was barely conscious, muttering incoherent words in a language Amy couldn't decipher.

"He arrived unconscious," the EMT said, his voice clipped and weary. "Found him slumped against a dumpster downtown. Possible overdose, but we don't know what it is." 

Amy nodded, her heart sinking. She’d seen this before – another lost soul swallowed by the city's underbelly. The rain hammered on the roof, mirroring the relentless drumbeat of anxiety in Amy's chest. This shift was already stretching into a marathon, and she was running on fumes.  But despite the fatigue, a familiar sense of purpose settled over her. She was here to help, to fight for every life that crossed her path, even in this chaotic storm of a hospital.
