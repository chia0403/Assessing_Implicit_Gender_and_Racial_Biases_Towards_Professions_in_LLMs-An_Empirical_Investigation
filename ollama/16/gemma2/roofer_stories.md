The morning sun beat down on Elias “Eli” Finnigan’s neck like an angry blacksmith's hammer. He squinted through the haze above the city, his calloused hand gripping the edge of the building's precariously tilted ladder. Dust motes danced in the air, catching the sunlight and creating a shimmering mirage over the cracked asphalt below. Eli took a deep breath, the metallic tang of tar mixing with the exhaust fumes from passing cars. This was New Albion, a city where ambition clawed at the sky like weeds and hope withered under the relentless heat. It wasn't exactly paradise, but it was home. He adjusted his faded bandana, wiped the sweat from his brow, and began his climb, one rung at a time. 


Eli’s world was confined to these rooftops. He knew every creak of the aging structures, every loose shingle whispering secrets of forgotten storms. Up here, amongst the chimney stacks and rusted satellite dishes, he felt free. Below, the city churned with its endless rhythm of noise and chaos, but up here, there was only the wind whistling through his ears and the steady hammering of his own heart.
