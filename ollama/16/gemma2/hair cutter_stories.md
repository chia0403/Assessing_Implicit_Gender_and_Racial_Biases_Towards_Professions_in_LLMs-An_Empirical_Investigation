The scent of peppermint shampoo and bay rum clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He knew every corner of his shop, "Thorne & Company," the way one knows their own heartbeat - the smooth worn surface of the mahogany counter, the familiar clink of shears against steel, the comforting hum of the vintage hair dryer that seemed to sigh with age. 

Elias ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper beard, checking his reflection in the dusty mirror behind the counter. His once vibrant auburn hair was now streaked with grey, mirroring the silver lining on his shop's window frame. The street outside was a kaleidoscope of bustling activity - vendors hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons, and horse-drawn carriages clomping over cobblestone streets. But inside Thorne & Company, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. It was a haven of quiet contemplation amidst the chaos of 19th century London.
