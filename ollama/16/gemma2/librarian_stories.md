The scent of aged paper and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eloise Amelia Thistlewick.  She loved the hushed symphony of her library: the rustling of turning pages, the gentle click of worn wooden floors beneath hesitant feet, the occasional soft sigh of a reader lost in their world. The afternoon sunlight slanted through the tall arched windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting long shadows on the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that lined the walls like silent sentinels. Eloise adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she surveyed the scene.  

The Grand Blackwood Library was a haven for lost souls and curious minds alike. It held centuries of stories within its weathered walls, whispered secrets in its leather-bound volumes, and offered sanctuary from the clamoring world outside. Today, however, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. A chill, unrelated to the autumnal breeze seeping through the gaps around the windows, prickled at Eloise's spine. 


This was no ordinary Tuesday afternoon. Something was amiss.
