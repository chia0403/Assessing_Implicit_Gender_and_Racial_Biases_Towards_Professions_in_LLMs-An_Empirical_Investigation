The humid air hung thick in the New Orleans alleyway, smelling faintly of stale beignets and damp concrete. Dew clung to the rusty fire escapes that clawed their way up the brick walls, casting elongated shadows from the flickering streetlight above. 

Elisha Mae "Ellie" Dubois, her name as vibrant and brassy as her hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped sweat from her brow with a grimy rag.  She squinted at the tangle of exposed wires dangling precariously from the facade of Le Chat Noir, the city's oldest jazz club, its windows boarded shut for repairs after a late-night brawl that left more than a few patrons nursing bruised egos and broken guitars. 

Ellie was New Orleans' most sought-after electrician, known for her lightning-fast reflexes and uncanny ability to decipher even the most chaotic wiring nightmares. But tonight, something about this job felt different.  The silence of the alley, usually buzzing with late-night revelers and stray cats, pressed against her like a heavy blanket. 

A shiver ran down Ellie's spine, but she pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. A faulty wire was nothing to be afraid of. Especially not in a city where ghosts were more common than potholes.  She reached for her toolkit, its worn leather holster familiar against her hip, and began to climb the rickety ladder towards the darkened windows of Le Chat Noir.
