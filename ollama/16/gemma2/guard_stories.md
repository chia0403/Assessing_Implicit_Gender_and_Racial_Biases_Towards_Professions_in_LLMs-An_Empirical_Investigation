The wind whipped across the rusted iron gates, rattling them like skeletal fingers on a tomb. The chill seeped through Sergeant Elara Valerius's worn leather armor, leaving a trail of goosebumps on her exposed skin.  She stood watch atop the crumbling bastion of Castle Aethelred, its once-grand façade now scarred with the ravages of time and neglect. Below, the sprawling city of Veridian lay shrouded in an eerie silence broken only by the mournful howl of the wind and the distant cries of scavengers venturing into the abandoned sectors. 

Elara tightened her grip on her spear, its metal head gleaming faintly in the waning light. Her gaze swept across the desolate landscape, searching for any sign of movement – a flicker of shadow, a stray glow from a torch, anything that might betray an intruder seeking to exploit Veridian's vulnerability. But tonight, the city held its breath, a silent testament to the fear that had gripped its inhabitants since the cataclysm. 


It had been three years since the Great Sundering, when the once-powerful mages had unleashed their forbidden magic, leaving behind a shattered world and an agonizing silence where vibrant magic once pulsed. The few remaining mages, branded as abominations by the populace, were hunted mercilessly. Veridian, once a bustling hub of trade and learning, was now a hollow shell, its streets deserted save for whispers and shadows.

Elara, however, remained steadfast in her duty, a lone sentinel against the encroaching darkness. For she knew that hope, however fragile, still flickered within these desolate walls.
