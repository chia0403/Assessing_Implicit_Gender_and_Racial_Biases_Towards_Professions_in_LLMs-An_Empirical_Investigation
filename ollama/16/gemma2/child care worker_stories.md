The pungent aroma of hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of spilled juice boxes and crayons.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of Mrs. Beatrice "Bea" Willowbrook's Daycare Center, casting long shadows across the scattered toys and half-finished fingerpaint masterpieces. Bea watched from her perch behind the snack table, a mug of lukewarm coffee cradled in her hand, as chaos unfolded with the charming unpredictability only found in a room full of four-year-olds.  


Bea sighed, her eyes lingering on tiny Maya Rodriguez, who was currently engaged in a heated tug-of-war with Thomas Johnson over a lopsided dinosaur figurine. A familiar wave of weariness washed over her. It wasn't always easy, being the caretaker for twenty rambunctious little humans, but there were moments like this, amidst the sticky fingers and shrieks of laughter, that made it all worthwhile. Today, though, Bea had a feeling something was different. The air felt thick with unspoken tension, and even the normally boisterous children seemed subdued, their eyes darting around nervously. 


A low rumble echoed from outside, followed by an insistent banging on the daycare's front door.  Bea's heart skipped a beat. Nobody ever came to the daycare unannounced. This was something...else.
