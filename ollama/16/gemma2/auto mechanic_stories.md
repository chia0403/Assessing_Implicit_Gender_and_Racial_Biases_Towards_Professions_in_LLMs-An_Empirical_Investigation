The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt oil, punctuated by the occasional hiss of escaping steam. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the grease-stained concrete floor of "Earl's Engine Emporium." Earl himself, a mountain of a man named Earlington "Earl" McTavish, wiped his brow with a grimy rag, leaving an oily streak across his forehead. His calloused fingers fiddled with a wrench, attempting to loosen a stubborn bolt on a 1967 Mustang fastback that was sprawled across the worn lift.  

The engine's purr had been more of a wheeze lately, and its owner, a nervous young woman named Sarah Jenkins, had brought it in, her eyes wide with worry. Earl knew Mustangs like he knew his own children â€“ their quirks, their groans, the symphony of sounds they made when running right. This one just wasn't singing.
