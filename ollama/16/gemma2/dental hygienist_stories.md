The air hung thick with the antiseptic scent of mint and fear.  Evelyn Beatrice Finch, her name echoing a bit too loudly in the sterile silence, meticulously wiped down the tray of instruments with practiced precision. She watched the young man hunched in the chair before her, his knuckles white against the vinyl armrests. His eyes darted nervously around the brightly lit room, avoiding her gaze like a trapped animal. This wasn't unusual; Evelyn dealt with anxiety on a daily basis. Her job as a dental hygienist involved far more than just scraping plaque. It was about creating a space of trust and calm, coaxing hesitant smiles from apprehensive mouths. 

The waiting area outside the clinic buzzed with hushed conversations, the rhythmic ticking of a wall clock the only other sound punctuating the air. A faint melody drifted in from the hallway â€“ Adele belting out a power ballad. It was all very ordinary, Evelyn thought, the kind of mundane reality she had come to accept. But today, something felt different.  A prickle of anticipation, like the start of a long-forgotten dream, ran down her spine. Today, the air didn't just smell like mint and fear. It smelled... different. A hint of mystery, perhaps?
