The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of acetone and the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea brewing on the stove behind the counter. Tiny iridescent glitter danced in the afternoon sun that streamed through the window of "Nails by Natalia," casting shimmering rainbows across the plush pink carpet.

Natalia Petrovna carefully painted a client’s nails, her movements precise and practiced, her eyes focused on the task at hand. Her brow furrowed ever so slightly as she applied a layer of crimson gloss, ensuring every line was perfect, every edge smooth. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she dabbed the nail with a final touch of top coat.

Natalia had always found solace in the quiet rhythm of manicures. It was more than just applying polish; it was a ritual, a conversation without words. The gentle hum of the electric file, the rhythmic clicking of brushes, the soft murmur of her client’s voice – these were the sounds that calmed her soul, a symphony only she truly appreciated. 


But today, something felt different. A persistent tightness in Natalia's chest, a prickling at the back of her neck.  A sense of impending change hung in the air, as thick and heavy as the scent of the lavender polish.
