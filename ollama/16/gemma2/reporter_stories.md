The flickering neon sign outside "Rosie's Diner" cast an oily sheen on Amelia Beatrice Croft's trench coat as she huddled beneath its meager warmth. The humid August air clung to her like a damp shroud, each breath tasting of stale grease and exhaust fumes. Rain, the kind that came sideways and bit at exposed skin, threatened to unleash itself on the already drenched city streets of New Orleans. 

Amelia, a reporter for the struggling "New Orleans Advocate," clutched a crumpled note in her hand, its ink smeared by rain and nervous sweat.  It was the anonymous tip that had dragged her into this late-night foray â€“ a whisper about corruption so deep it reached the very heart of the city's power structure. A story that could make her name, or break her. 


Amelia glanced at the shadowy figures huddled inside Rosie's, their faces illuminated by the warm glow emanating from within. She adjusted the worn fedora perched on her head and pulled her collar tighter against the chill.  This was where she had to be, in this greasy spoon, surrounded by whispers and secrets, if she wanted answers.
