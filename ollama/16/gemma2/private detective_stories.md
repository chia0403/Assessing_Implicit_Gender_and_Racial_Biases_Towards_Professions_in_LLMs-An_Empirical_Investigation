The acrid scent of stale cigarette smoke clung to the threadbare armchair like a desperate plea for attention. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood adjusted her magnifying glass, its brass rim glinting under the flickering gaslight that cast long, dancing shadows across Detective Harding's cluttered office. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, a steady drumbeat accompanying the incessant ticking of an antique clock on the mantelpiece. 

Harding himself was a study in contrasts: a wiry man with sharp eyes set deep beneath a bushy brow, his rumpled tweed suit and perpetually furrowed face spoke of long nights and endless cases. Yet, there was a flicker of wry amusement in those eyes as he watched Amy sift through the scattered photographs on his desk - faded Polaroids of a glamorous woman, her smile both alluring and unsettling.

"So," Harding rasped, his voice rough like sandpaper, "You're here about Miss Genevieve Delacroix, then?"

Amy nodded, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. "Yes, Mr. Harding. My client claims she vanished without a trace three weeks ago." She paused, letting the weight of the missing woman's name settle in the heavy air.  "And that Miss Delacroix was last seen at this very address." 


This dilapidated office on a rain-soaked backstreet in downtown Chicago was far from Amy’s usual haunts – she preferred the gilded cages of the wealthy elite, not the shadowy underbelly of the city. But Genevieve Delacroix's disappearance had stirred something within her, a spark of curiosity that she couldn't ignore.  And with Harding as her guide through this labyrinthine world of secrets and lies, Amy was ready to unravel them, no matter how dangerous the truth might be.
