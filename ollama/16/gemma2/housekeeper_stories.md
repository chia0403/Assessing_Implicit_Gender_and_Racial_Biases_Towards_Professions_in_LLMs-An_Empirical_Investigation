The scent of beeswax and lemon hung heavy in the air, a fragrant curtain shielding Elara Rosethorn from the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the grand manor, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the ancient glass. Elara hummed softly to herself as she moved through the cavernous drawing room, her hands flitting across surfaces with practiced grace. She dusted the intricate silver tea set, polished the mahogany table until it gleamed like dark water, and straightened the embroidered cushions on the velvet-covered chaise lounge. 

This was a familiar routine, one that had become as comforting as the worn cotton of her apron. Elara wasn't just a housekeeper at Blackwood Manor; she was its heart. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every hidden draft, and the precise angle at which to adjust the sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows to illuminate the dusty portraits lining the walls. But tonight, as the wind howled like a banshee and thunder growled ominously in the distance, Elara couldn't shake a feeling of unease. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, whispering that something was amiss within the manor's hallowed halls.
