The air in Beatrice Henrietta Featherstone's office smelled faintly of lavender and burnt toast. A thin film of dust coated everything - the ancient ledger books perched precariously on her groaning desk, the chipped porcelain cat figurines lining the windowsill, and even Beatrice herself, a fine layer settling like powdered sugar on her unruly auburn curls. Outside, London thrummed with its usual chaotic symphony: horse-drawn carriages clattering over cobblestones, vendors hawking their wares in a cacophony of voices, and the ever-present drone of industry echoing from the nearby docks. But within Beatrice's cluttered sanctuary, time seemed to move at a slower pace, dictated by the rhythmic scratch of her quill against parchment as she painstakingly balanced the accounts for Mr. Bartholomew's haberdashery.  

Beatrice was a creature of habit and routine, finding solace in the predictable dance of debits and credits. Her world was one of meticulous order, where every penny had its place, and every transaction was recorded with unwavering accuracy. But lately, that meticulously constructed world felt...off. As if an unnoticed crack had appeared in her carefully crafted facade, threatening to unravel everything she held dear.
