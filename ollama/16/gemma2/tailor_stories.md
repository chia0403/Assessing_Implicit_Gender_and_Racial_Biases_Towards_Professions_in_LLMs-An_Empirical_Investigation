The humid air clung to Elias Thornwood like a second skin as he stepped out into the bustling marketplace. Beads of sweat trickled down his temple, despite the shade offered by the awning strung across his shopfront.  Elias adjusted his spectacles and sighed. A day in August in Seville was a trial for even the most seasoned tailor. But Elias didn't mind the heat; it was the incessant chatter that truly wore him down. 

His shop, "Thornwood's Tailors," nestled amongst a riot of stalls selling everything from fiery peppers to handcrafted guitars, was a quiet haven amidst the chaos. Inside, the scent of fresh linen and lavender hung heavy in the air, a calming counterpoint to the cacophony outside. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating rows of bolts of vibrant silk and wool, each carefully labelled with its origin and texture. 

Elias ran a calloused thumb over a bolt of deep crimson velvet, imagining it draped on a proud flamenco dancer. He was known throughout Seville for his exquisite craftsmanship, capable of conjuring bespoke garments that flattered every figure and whispered tales of elegance and artistry. But today, Elias felt the weight of a different kind of pressure.  A commission unlike any he had ever received lay waiting on his workbench, demanding his full attention and threatening to unravel his carefully curated world.
