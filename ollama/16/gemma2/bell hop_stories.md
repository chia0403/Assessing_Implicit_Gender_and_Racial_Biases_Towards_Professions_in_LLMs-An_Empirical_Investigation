The flickering neon sign of the Grand Emerald Hotel cast a lurid green light across Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's weary face. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, the red leather suitcase strap digging into his shoulder with every movement.  Rain hammered against the awning above him, blurring the already hazy cityscape of New Hope City.

Barty wasn't a man who enjoyed the rain. It seeped into everything – his shoes, his collar, even his bones. But tonight, the storm felt particularly oppressive, mirroring the weight in his chest that had nothing to do with the hefty suitcase he was hauling. He glanced at the ornate brass handle and sighed. Inside lay his past – a life he was desperately trying to leave behind.

Its towering skyscrapers scraped the storm-laden sky, their windows reflecting the city's chaotic symphony of car horns, sirens, and distant laughter. The Grand Emerald Hotel, once a symbol of opulence, now stood as a faded monument to bygone eras, its golden facade dulled by time and neglect.
