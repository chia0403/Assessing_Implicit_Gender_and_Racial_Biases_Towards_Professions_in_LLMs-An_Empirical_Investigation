The scent of lavender shampoo and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Seraphina Rose Blackwood as she weaved her fingers through Ms. Evangeline Dubois's silver hair. The salon, "Blush & Bloom," was tucked away on a quaint, tree-lined street in Greenwich Village, a world away from the clamor of Times Square just a few blocks north.  

Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, casting warm hues across the eclectic mix of vintage furniture and modern accents that gave the space its unique charm. 

Seraphina hummed softly, her attention focused on Evangeline's thinning crown. She knew this was more than just a trim for her long-time client; it was about preserving a sense of youthfulness, of control, in a world that seemed to be slipping away from her. As she snipped carefully, Seraphina listened to Evangeline recount the latest drama unfolding with her grandson and his penchant for rock bands named after obscure constellations. 


The gentle lull of conversation, punctuated by the clinking of scissors against shears, was shattered by the shrill ring of the shop's vintage telephone.  Seraphina paused, a question blooming in her eyes as she glanced at Evangeline, "I wonder who that could be."
