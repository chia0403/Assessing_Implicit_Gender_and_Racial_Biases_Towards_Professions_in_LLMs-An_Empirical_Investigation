Rain lashed against the tall windows of Dr. Amelia Vance’s office, each drop drumming a steady rhythm against the glass like an anxious heart.  The city outside was shrouded in mist, blurring the skyscrapers into hazy silhouettes. Inside, her office felt strangely sterile, the scent of disinfectant mingling with the faint aroma of chamomile tea from the mug she hadn't touched. 

Amelia stared at the blank page on her notepad, its emptiness mirroring the hollowness gnawing at her.  She’d been seeing a new patient for weeks, a young woman named Chloe with crippling anxiety. Amelia had tried every technique in her arsenal – cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness exercises, even guided meditations – but nothing seemed to penetrate Chloe’s suffocating fear. 

The problem wasn't simply Chloe's anxieties; it was the unsettling feeling that something deeper, something darker, lurked beneath her surface.  Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that she was standing on the precipice of something truly terrifying, a truth hidden just out of reach. A truth that might consume both them.


This story takes place in present-day Seattle, where Amelia Vance works as a clinical psychologist at her own private practice.
