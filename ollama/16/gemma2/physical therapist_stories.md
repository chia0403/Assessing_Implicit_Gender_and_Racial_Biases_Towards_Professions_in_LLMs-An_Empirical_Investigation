The scent of antiseptic mingled with chamomile tea hung heavy in Amelia Rose Thornton's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air, but casting long shadows across the worn Persian rug. Outside, birdsong filled the crisp autumn air, a stark contrast to the groan that emanated from the treatment table in front of her. 

Amelia sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles on her pale blue scrubs. "Just one more rep, Mr. Davis," she said, her voice gentle but firm. The retired carpenter, his face creased with years of laughter and toil, winced as he slowly lifted a fifteen-pound weight. His knee, ravaged by arthritis, protested with a dull ache. 


Amelia watched him carefully, her trained eyes analyzing his posture and movement.  She'd spent the last five years helping people like Mr. Davis reclaim their mobility, finding joy in the small victories: a wider stride, less pain, a renewed sense of independence. But lately, she felt a growing weariness, a creeping sense that she wasn't just treating bodies, but also unseen shadows lurking within them.
