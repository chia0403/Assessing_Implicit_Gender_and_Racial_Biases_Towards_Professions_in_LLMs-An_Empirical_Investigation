The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the chaos that was ER room three.  Sarah Elizabeth "Ellie" Carter, her brown hair pulled back in a tight braid, navigated the flurry of activity with practiced ease. A patient screamed across the room, another coughed violently into a paper bag, and a doctor barked orders at a harried intern. Ellie, however, remained calm, her movements swift and precise as she prepared an IV line for a young boy who'd tripped and fallen off his bike, leaving a jagged gash on his forehead. 

The ER of Mercy General Hospital was a place where life hung in the balance, where laughter and fear collided in equal measure. It was Ellieâ€™s battlefield, her sanctuary, and the only place she truly felt at home. Tonight, though, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a hushed tension that even the constant din of beeping machines couldn't mask.  Ellie glanced at the clock - 10:47 pm. The night was young, but already it had a heavy feel to it, like a storm brewing on the horizon.
