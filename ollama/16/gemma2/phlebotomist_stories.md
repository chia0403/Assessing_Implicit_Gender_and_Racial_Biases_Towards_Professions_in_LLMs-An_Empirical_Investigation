The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Everly's head, casting a sterile glow over the vials of crimson lined up on her tray.  Each one held a tiny universe of potential—a snapshot of health, or sometimes, illness. The antiseptic smell clung to the air, a familiar scent that usually brought Amy comfort. Today, though, it felt heavy, oppressive.  She adjusted the lavender gloves she wore, their smooth surface cold against her skin. 

The waiting room at Mercy General Hospital was buzzing with its usual symphony of coughs and whispered anxieties. Children tugged at their parents' hands, fidgeting in anticipation. Elderly patients sat ramrod straight, eyes fixed on a worn magazine page. Amy knew their stories before she even met them—the anxiety of the first-time patient, the weary resignation of the chronic sufferer, the desperate hope for a cure.  

But today, Amy had her own story to navigate. A story that began not with blood, but with a whispered rumor. A story that threatened to bleed into her carefully constructed world.
