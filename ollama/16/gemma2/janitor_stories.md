The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten dreams in the cavernous hall. Moonlight sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating swirling dust motes that danced like spectral fireflies.  

Elias Thorne adjusted his fluorescent-green cleaning gloves, his worn canvas shoes squeaking softly on the linoleum floor. He’d been the night janitor at the Grand Blackwood Theater for ten years, a silent witness to countless whispered romances, raucous laughter, and dramatic tears shed under the warm glow of the stage lights.  Now, the only sound was the rhythmic whir of his industrial vacuum cleaner, sucking up the debris left behind by the day's hurried exodus. 

Elias wasn't just a janitor; he was the custodian of stories. He knew every creaking floorboard, every loose stair tread, every secret nook and cranny of this grand old dame.  He’d cleaned up after broken hearts and spilled dreams, listened to the echoes of applause and the hushed whispers of stage fright. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine as he rounded a corner into the darkened wings. The air was suddenly colder, charged with a palpable tension that had nothing to do with the drafty old building. Elias paused, listening intently. He could have sworn he heard a faint, disembodied sigh echoing through the silent theater.
