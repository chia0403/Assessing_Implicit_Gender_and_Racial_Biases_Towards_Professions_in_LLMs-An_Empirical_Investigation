The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thornewood as he surveyed his workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty attic window, illuminating motes dancing like miniature galaxies. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Fairhaven were already bustling with the day's energy – merchants hawking wares, children chasing pigeons, and the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages. But inside Elias's haven, time seemed to move at a slower pace, dictated by the rasp of his saw and the steady thud of his hammer. 

Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished rocking horse, its carved mane still awaiting paint. He took pride in his work, each piece imbued with a touch of magic born from wood and imagination. His grandfather had taught him the craft, whispering secrets passed down through generations, urging him to listen to the wood's stories, to feel its pulse beneath his fingertips. Now, Elias carried on that legacy, crafting furniture, toys, and intricate carvings that brought joy to the town he called home. 


But today, a restlessness gnawed at him. A commission awaited – a grand armoire for the newly appointed mayor – but something felt off. A low hum vibrated beneath his skin, a disquiet that refused to be ignored. Elias shook his head, attributing it to nerves. Perhaps it was the whispers circulating about a mysterious stranger who had arrived in Fairhaven, someone said to possess powers beyond understanding.
