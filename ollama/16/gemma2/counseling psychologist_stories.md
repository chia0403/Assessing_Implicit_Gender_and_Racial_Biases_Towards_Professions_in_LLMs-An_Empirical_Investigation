The air in Dr. Eleanor Katherine Albright's office was thick with the scent of lavender essential oil, a poor attempt to mask the stale anxiety that clung to the room like morning mist. Outside, rain lashed against the panoramic window, blurring the city skyline into an impressionistic watercolor. Inside, Eleanor sat perched on the edge of her leather armchair, its cushions worn smooth from years of bearing the weight of countless confessions. 

She was waiting for Thomas Blackwood, a man who claimed to see ghosts, but whose eyes held a more unsettling emptiness than any spectral presence could conjure. The rain hammered relentlessly, mirroring the drumbeat in Eleanor's chest â€“ a familiar rhythm that always accompanied the anticipation of a case that threatened to unravel her carefully constructed world view.
