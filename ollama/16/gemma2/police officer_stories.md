The scent of salt and brine hung heavy in the air, clinging to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez's damp uniform like an unwelcome perfume. The sea breeze whipped her dark hair across her face as she surveyed the scene: a weathered pier, half-obscured by the swirling grey mist that rolled in off the Pacific.  The rhythmic crash of waves against pilings provided a constant backdrop to the cries of gulls and the low murmur of police chatter.  

Izzy gripped her notepad tighter, its worn leather cold under her gloved hand. The body lay sprawled on the wooden planks, barely visible through the encroaching fog. A young man, by the looks of it, his face already beginning to lose its color in the unforgiving chill of the early morning air. He wore a tattered fisherman's jacket and his once vibrant red beanie now lay askew, revealing a patch of pale blonde hair tangled with seaweed. The pier, usually bustling with life at this hour, was eerily deserted, save for the lone figure of Izzy and her partner, Detective Miller, who stood beside the body, his face grim beneath his thick, salt-and-pepper beard.


This wasn't just another drowning case. There was something off about it, something that sent a shiver down Izzy's spine. A feeling she couldn't quite place, but one she knew wouldn't leave her until she had answers.  The fog seemed to swirl with its own secrets, and the dead manâ€™s eyes stared accusingly at the swirling grey, as if pleading for justice in the quiet silence of the pier.
