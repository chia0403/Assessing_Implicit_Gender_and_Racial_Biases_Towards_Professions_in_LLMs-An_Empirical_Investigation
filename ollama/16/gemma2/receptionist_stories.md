The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Finch's head, their pale glow reflecting off the polished surface of the reception desk. It was 8:02 AM, two minutes past her designated start time, and the silence in Dr. Alistair Hawthorne’s eclectic therapy practice was deafening. The only other sound besides the hum came from the distant clinking of teacups as Dr. Hawthorne himself tinkered with his morning ritual in his sun-drenched office at the back of the building. 

Elara smoothed down the wrinkles on her crisp white blouse, a habit she’d developed to combat the jitters that always accompanied the first hour of her workday.  She adjusted the silver name tag pinned to her chest – 'Elara Finch, Receptionist' - and gazed out at the bustling city street through the large glass windows.

It was going to be one of those days. She could feel it in the way the sunlight seemed to cast long, accusatory shadows across the worn carpet and the subtle tremor in her hand as she reached for a stray pen. 


This wasn’t just any day, though. Today was Elara's first day at Dr. Hawthorne’s practice, a new chapter in a life that had been marked by unexpected turns and faded dreams. It was a chance to escape the monotony of the call center and finally work somewhere that felt… meaningful.
