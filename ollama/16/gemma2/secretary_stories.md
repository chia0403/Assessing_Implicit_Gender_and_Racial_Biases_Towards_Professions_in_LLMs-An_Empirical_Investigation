The rhythmic click-clack of Beatrice Evelyn Cartwright’s heels on the linoleum floor was the only sound in the otherwise silent office. Her reflection in the mirrored wall showed a woman dressed for success: navy blue skirt suit, pearl earrings nestled discreetly behind her ears, and a smile that could melt butter – though she wasn't smiling now.  

Beatrice stared at the crumpled note on Mr. Henderson's desk. "Urgent meeting with potential investors," it read in his hurried scrawl. “Cancel everything else.” The note lacked the usual, polite closing he reserved for Beatrice. Instead, it ended abruptly, leaving a cold space where warmth and consideration should be.  

She sighed, her breath fogging the polished surface of the desk. It was 4:57 pm on a Friday. Her own plans – dinner with friends, followed by a much-needed visit to the vintage bookstore she adored – were now dashed against the rocks of Mr. Henderson's last-minute whims. The office, usually abuzz with activity at this hour, felt desolate and oppressive.  

Beatrice ran her fingers over the worn surface of Mr. Henderson's desk, her mind already churning through the mess he’d undoubtedly left behind. This new venture, shrouded in secrecy, had consumed him for weeks. His usual jovial demeanour had been replaced by a grim determination that bordered on obsession. 


The setting was Mr. Henderson's office in a mid-sized corporation.  It was a stark contrast to the vibrant life Beatrice led outside work – a small, dimly lit room with grey walls and faded floral wallpaper, dominated by Mr. Henderson's large mahogany desk and the imposing stack of files he always seemed to be wrestling with.
