The sun beat down on Clementine "Clem" Beaumont's back, sweat stinging her eyes as she gripped the hot metal shovel. Gravel crunched under her boots, kicked up by the whirring grader ahead of her. Around her, the endless expanse of asphalt stretched like a shimmering ribbon, disappearing into the hazy horizon. Clem squinted at the shimmering heat rising from the road.  It was the kind of day that made even the most seasoned highway worker long for the cool comfort of their truck's AC. 

She wiped her brow with the back of her gloved hand, leaving a streak of grime across her forehead. Another scorching August afternoon in West Texas. The air smelled of dust and diesel fuel, punctuated by the occasional screech of tires on asphalt from the long-haul trucks thundering past. Clem sighed, feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest. 


The setting is a desolate stretch of highway 380, somewhere between Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas. The landscape is flat and featureless, baking under the relentless summer sun. Dusty plains stretch out as far as the eye can see, punctuated only by the occasional roadside diner or abandoned gas station.
