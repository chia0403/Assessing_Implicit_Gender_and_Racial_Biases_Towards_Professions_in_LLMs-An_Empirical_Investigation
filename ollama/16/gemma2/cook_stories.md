The steam billowed from the worn copper pots like phantoms, swirling around Eliza Beatrice Montgomery as she wrestled with a stubborn leg of lamb. The air in the kitchen of "Montgomery's," her family's ramshackle seaside diner, hung thick with the aroma of rosemary, garlic, and sizzling meat. It was always warmest in here, even when the November wind whipped icy rain against the warped windows, howling like a banshee outside the worn wooden walls. 

Eliza, known to most as Eliza "Liz" Montgomery, wasn't built for harsh winters. She preferred the balmy heat of July, when tourists flocked to the little town of Saltwind Cove, their tanned skin and sun-bleached hair blurring in the summer haze. But tonight, even the prospect of a roaring fire couldn't chase away the chill that had settled deep into her bones. It wasn't just the weather; it was the way the diner felt eerily empty, the silence broken only by the clanging of pots and pans as she worked.


Tonight was different. Tonight, something was amiss.
