The clacking of Eleanor Beatrice Cavendish's typewriter keys echoed in the silence of her attic study. Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes, blurring the view of the windswept Scottish moorland beyond.  Eleanor, bundled in a thick woolen cardigan and fuzzy slippers, hunched over her desk, the pale glow of an oil lamp casting dancing shadows across her face. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco, remnants of her late grandfather, a renowned antiquarian who had bequeathed her this rambling Victorian manor and his vast, chaotic library.

Eleanor, however, cared little for dusty tomes and forgotten history. Her passion lay in weaving fictional worlds, crafting intricate tales that sprang from the wellspring of her imagination. Tonight, she was wrestling with a particularly troublesome scene, a tangled knot of dialogue and action that refused to yield to her will. The deadline for her second novel loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon, and Eleanor felt the familiar gnawing anxiety begin to take hold.
