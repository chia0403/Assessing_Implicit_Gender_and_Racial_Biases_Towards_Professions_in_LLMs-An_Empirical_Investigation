Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the sprawling high school campus into an impressionist painting of muted greens and grays. It was the kind of afternoon that felt heavy with unspoken anxieties, the air thick with the scent of damp wool and teenage angst.

She was the school psychologist at Westbridge High, a labyrinthine institution crammed with over 1,500 students, each carrying their own unique burdens and traumas. Today, she felt particularly burdened herself. The recent string of student suicides had left an indelible scar on the staff and the community, casting a pall over even the brightest days.

As Eleanor stared out into the storm, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was brewing beneath the surface, a new wave of despair threatening to engulf them all.
