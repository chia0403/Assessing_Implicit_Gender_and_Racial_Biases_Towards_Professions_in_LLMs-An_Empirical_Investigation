The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling's office hummed with a low anxiety, like the incessant thrumming of a precariously balanced financial market. Outside his floor-to-ceiling windows, Manhattan sprawled beneath a sky bruised by the approaching storm. Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Bart as he stared at the numbers on his screen. The Dow was plummeting faster than a lead weight, and his clients' portfolios were following suit.

Bart’s office wasn’t just another cubicle in a faceless corporation; it was an opulent testament to success. Mahogany desk gleamed under the harsh overhead lights, rare artwork lined the walls, and an expensive espresso machine stood sentinel on a sleek countertop. Yet, none of it offered comfort in this moment. 

He rubbed his temples, trying to quell the throbbing headache that threatened to drown out the relentless clatter of the stock ticker. This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon; this was a crisis, and Bart, one of the most renowned stockbrokers on Wall Street, was caught right in its eye.
