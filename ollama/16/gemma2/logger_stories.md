The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Jeremiah "Bear" Blackwood as he swung his axe with practiced ease. Sunlight filtered through the canopy of towering Douglas firs, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor where fallen branches lay like skeletal remains. The rhythmic thud of his axe echoed through the stillness, punctuated by the occasional screech of a startled crow.

Jeremiah was a logger through and through, born and raised in this remote corner of Oregon. His calloused hands and weather-beaten face spoke of years spent wrestling with nature's giants, carving paths through the ancient forest and coaxing life from its heartwood. He knew every creak of the trees, every whisper of the wind, every secret hidden within the tangled undergrowth.  But lately, a shadow had fallen over this familiar landscape.
