The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Persephone Thorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the neatly-stacked shelves of her family pharmacy. Outside, the humid Florida air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and approaching thunderstorms. It was the kind of day that made Amelia want to curl up with a good book and a cup of chamomile tea – but as the owner of Thorne's Apothecary, nestled on the sleepy outskirts of Palm Haven, "curl up" wasn't in her vocabulary. 

The bell above the door chimed, jarring Amelia from her thoughts. A young man, his face obscured by a baseball cap pulled low over his brow, shuffled into the shop. He clutched a crumpled prescription, his hands trembling slightly. This was the last thing Amelia needed – another stressed-out customer on a Friday afternoon.
