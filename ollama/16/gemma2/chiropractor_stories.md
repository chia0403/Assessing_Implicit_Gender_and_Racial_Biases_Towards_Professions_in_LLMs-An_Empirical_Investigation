The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, earthy aroma of cedarwood from the diffuser beside Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s mahogany desk. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the pale wood floors of her small office nestled in the heart of Willow Creek. 

Willow Creek was a town that clung to its traditions, where time seemed to move at a gentler pace than the bustling cities just beyond its borders. Nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering willow trees, it held onto a sense of timeless serenity. Dr. Vance, with her warm smile and gentle hands, embodied this spirit.  She wasn't just a chiropractor; she was a pillar of the community, known for her unwavering kindness and uncanny ability to ease both physical pain and emotional burdens.


Today, however, a tension thrummed beneath the surface of the usual tranquility. The air seemed thick with anticipation, a palpable shift that even Dr. Vance couldn't ignore. A shadow had fallen over Willow Creek, whispering of secrets and unsettling truths.
