The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Claire Beaumont, Occupational Therapist extraordinaire.  Her office at Sunshine Rehabilitation Center was bathed in the pale glow of late afternoon sun filtering through frosted glass. The room was small, but meticulously organized – colourful therapy balls stacked neatly by the door, a whiteboard plastered with inspirational quotes and patient progress charts, and shelves lined with adaptive aids: weighted blankets, ergonomic utensils, puzzle boxes designed to challenge even the most nimble fingers. 

Amelia ran a hand over a smooth wooden box containing a complex assortment of interlocking gears and levers. This wasn't your average puzzle; it was designed for patients recovering from strokes, helping them regain fine motor control. She smiled. Every piece in this office had a story, a journey of healing woven into its fabric. 

Today, Amelia’s attention was focused on the woman sitting across from her, shrouded in shadows: Eleanor Cartwright, a former artist now battling Parkinson's disease.  Eleanor's eyes, though clouded by tremor, held a spark that refused to be dimmed. Amelia knew this meeting would be about more than just exercises; it was about rekindling a flame, a passion for life that even the cruel grip of illness couldn’t entirely extinguish.
