The air hung thick with the smell of sewage and regret in Bartholomew "Barty" Plumberton's cramped van. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon signs advertising cheap motels and greasy diners that lined Highway 49. Barty drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, a gnawing anxiety twisting in his gut. He wasn't exactly thrilled about taking this late-night call – plumbing emergencies rarely came with pleasantries.  

His current assignment: "Urgent plumbing crisis at The Flamingo Motel." It sounded like something out of a bad B-movie, and Barty was starting to feel like he was living in one. Rain slicked the asphalt, reflecting the dim glow of the motel's faded pink sign – a single neon flamingo, its wing drooping precariously, seemed to mirror Barty's own mood. He parked his van beneath the flickering light of a flickering "Vacancy" sign and braced himself for whatever awaited him.  


The Flamingo Motel itself was a tired relic of the 1960s, its once vibrant pink paint faded to a sickly salmon hue, its air thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and regret. Barty trudged across the cracked asphalt, his heavy toolbox clanking against his leg, each step echoing ominously in the deserted parking lot. He was ready for anything: burst pipes, overflowing toilets, maybe even a rogue alligator (it wouldn't be the craziest thing he'd encountered on this stretch of highway).
