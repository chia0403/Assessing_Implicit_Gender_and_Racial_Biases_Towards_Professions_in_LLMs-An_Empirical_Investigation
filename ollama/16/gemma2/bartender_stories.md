The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic green glow across Amelia Josephine Thorne's perpetually damp apron. It wasn't rain; it was the perpetual steam rising from the well-worn copper pot she used for brewing her famous "Midnight Storm" – a potent concoction of whiskey, absinthe, and blackberry liqueur that lured weary souls into The Last Chance Saloon like moths to a flame. 

The saloon itself was a time capsule of forgotten grandeur, its mahogany bar scarred with years of spilled drinks and whispered secrets. Dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through grimy windows, illuminating faded portraits of long-gone cowboys and poker players frozen mid-laugh or grim scowl. Amelia swiped at a stray fly buzzing around a half-empty bottle of rye, her gaze lingering on the worn roulette wheel that sat forgotten in the corner, a testament to past nights filled with both luck and despair.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer, sawdust, and something faintly metallic – a subtle reminder that The Last Chance Saloon wasn't just about finding solace; it was a place where people often came to escape their realities, for better or worse.   


As Amelia reached for another bottle of bourbon, the swinging saloon doors creaked open, letting in a gust of desert wind and a stranger cloaked in shadow.  His arrival sent a ripple of anticipation through the room – every eye turned to the newcomer, waiting to see what story he would bring with him.
