The midday sun beat down on Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's shoulders as she squinted at the ancient stone carving before her. Sweat beaded on her brow, mingling with the dust kicked up by the throngs of tourists shuffling behind her.  Amelia adjusted the strap of her straw hat, a valiant attempt to shield herself from the relentless Arizona heat.

"And this, ladies and gentlemen," Amelia announced in her practiced, enthusiastic tone, "is the Sun Serpent Moai. One of the oldest carvings in all of Petra, dating back over 2,000 years." Her voice echoed across the desolate canyon floor, swallowed by the swirling desert wind.  

The tourists, a gaggle of middle-aged Americans with cameras perpetually at the ready, shuffled closer, their faces a mixture of boredom and awe. Amelia could see the glazed-over expressions, hear the whispered complaints about the heat and the long walk. But she knew her job wasn't just to impart facts; it was to ignite a spark of wonder in even the most jaded tourist heart. 

She had been guiding tours through Petra for ten years now, each day a new adventure, a fresh opportunity to share the beauty and history of this ancient Nabataean city carved into sandstone cliffs. Yet, today felt different. Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a prickling at the back of her neck as if she were being watched. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the dusty ruins, deepening the mystery already woven into the fabric of Petra.
