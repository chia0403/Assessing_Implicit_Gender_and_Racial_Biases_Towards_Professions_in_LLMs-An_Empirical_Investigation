The rusted antenna groaned against the backdrop of a howling wind, mimicking the discontent churning in Amelia Beatrice Blackwood’s stomach. She tightened the bolts securing the aerial to its mast with calloused fingers, her breath misting in the frigid air. A biting wind whipped across the desolate prairie, carrying with it the scent of dry earth and distant snowmelt. The old radio station, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the vast expanse, felt like a lonely lighthouse amidst a sea of swirling yellow grass.

Amelia had inherited this ramshackle tower from her grandfather, a man who’d believed in the power of radio to connect even the most isolated corners of the world. Now, at 27, Amelia wasn't sure if she believed the same. The station, aptly named “The Voice of Dusty Prairie,” barely scraped by on donations and occasional emergency broadcasts. But it was her legacy, a tangible link to a man she’d adored but barely known.  

As dusk painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, Amelia finished her repairs and retreated into the cluttered control room. She flicked the switch powering up the aging console, its green glow casting long shadows across dusty maps and faded photographs pinned to the corkboard. A familiar crackle filled the airwaves, a sound that both comforted and unnerved her. 


The Voice of Dusty Prairie was about to come alive again.
