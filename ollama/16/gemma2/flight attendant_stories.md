The stale scent of recycled air hung heavy in the cabin as Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously straightened the throw pillows on seat 32B.  She'd been on this route, Chicago to London, countless times, and each time the routine felt like a comforting lullaby: announcing service details, refilling water glasses, navigating the maze of carry-on luggage with practiced ease.

But today felt different. The usual hum of anticipation in the air was replaced by an almost palpable tension. Passengers whispered nervously into their phones, eyes glued to screens flashing breaking news headlines about a storm brewing over the Atlantic. Amelia tried not to let it worry her. She'd weathered storms before, both literal and figurative. But the gnawing unease in her stomach couldn't be ignored.


The setting:

* **A Boeing 747:**  Mid-flight, cruising at 35,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.
* **Time:** Late afternoon, approaching sunset.
* **Weather:** A looming storm system is gathering force, creating a turbulent environment. 



 Amelia Rose Hawthorne knew this flight could turn into anything from routine to harrowing in the blink of an eye.
