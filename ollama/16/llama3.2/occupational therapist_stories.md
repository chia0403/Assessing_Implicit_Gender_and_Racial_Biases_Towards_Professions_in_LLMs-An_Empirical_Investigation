Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished gemstones as occupational therapist Dr. Emily J. Wynter stepped out of her apartment building, umbrella in hand. The gray mist that clung to the city was a fitting backdrop for her own mood - melancholy and introspective. As she walked towards the bus stop, the sound of raindrops pattering against her umbrella's metal ribs seemed to echo the turmoil brewing inside her.

Emily had spent the past eight months working with clients at Harborview Hospital, helping them overcome physical and cognitive challenges that had been imposed upon them by traumatic injuries or illnesses. She took pride in her work, watching as patients learned to adapt to their new realities and regain control over their lives. But despite the sense of satisfaction she felt when a client finally mastered a difficult task, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing.

As she waited for the bus, Emily's gaze drifted out towards the Olympic Mountains rising above the cityscape. The rugged beauty of the natural world had always been a source of comfort and inspiration for her, but lately, even its majesty seemed to feel distant and unattainable. It was as if the weight of her own emotions had become too much to bear.

The bus rumbled up to the curb, and Emily swung open the door, stepping inside just as the rain intensified, drumming against the roof like a relentless heartbeat. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar scent of damp earth and ozone fill her lungs. It was going to be one of those days.
