Here's a potential story opening:

It was a chilly autumn evening in New York City, and the streets of Manhattan were alive with the sound of car horns and chatter. The luxurious penthouse apartment of Reginald Thornton-Fiennes, a renowned socialite and collector of rare artifacts, stood tall above the bustling streets, its sleek glass facade reflecting the vibrant lights of the city below.

Inside, concierge extraordinaire Étienne LeFleur moved with precision, his tailored suit and impeccable manners allowing him to navigate the apartment's labyrinthine corridors with ease. With years of experience at Reginald's side, Étienne had become an indispensable part of the estate, handling everything from catering requests to secret societies' clandestine meetings.

As he expertly juggled a tray of chilled champagne glasses and hors d'oeuvres, his eyes swept across the room, taking in the assembled guests. There was Lady Catherine, Reginald's mother, resplendent in her diamond tiara; Dr. Nathaniel Lee, an archaeologist with a penchant for the occult; and Victor LaGraine, a suave French businessman with connections to the underworld.

Just as Étienne was about to refill the champagne glasses, his phone buzzed discreetly in his pocket. A message from an unknown number flashed on the screen: "Meet me at the garden level at midnight. Come alone."
