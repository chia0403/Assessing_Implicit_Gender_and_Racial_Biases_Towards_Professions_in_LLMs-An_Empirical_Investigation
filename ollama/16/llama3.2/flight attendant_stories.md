Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of fog lifted off the San Francisco Bay, Captain Emily Jane Thompson gazed out at the breathtaking view from the cockpit window of Flight 121. She took a deep breath, feeling the crisp morning air fill her lungs, and began to survey the city below. The Golden Gate Bridge stretched like a golden serpent across the water, its towers disappearing into the foggy horizon.

Emily, a seasoned flight attendant with over five years of experience under her belt, had been flying for Delta Airlines since 2015. She had seen it all - from turbulent skies to screaming babies, and from joyride passengers to medical emergencies on board. But as she banked the plane to the left, heading south towards Los Angeles, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in her stomach.

It was a typical morning flight, with only a handful of passengers on board, but something about this trip felt different. Perhaps it was the eerie calmness that hung over the city like a veil, or maybe it was the sense of foreboding that lingered in the back of her mind, waiting to pounce.

Whatever it was, Emily knew she had to focus on the job at hand - ensuring the safety and comfort of her passengers. She checked the navigation system for what felt like the hundredth time, her eyes scanning the screens with a practiced intensity. As the plane leveled out at cruising altitude, Emily took a moment to collect her thoughts, preparing herself for the long haul ahead.

Little did she know, this flight would be one unlike any other...
