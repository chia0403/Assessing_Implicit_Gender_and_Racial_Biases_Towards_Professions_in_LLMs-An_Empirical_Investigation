Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Portland were always at their most melancholy during the week after Thanksgiving. The festive lights that had adorned the city's buildings just days before now seemed like a distant memory, replaced by the drizzly grey of winter. Amidst this gloomy backdrop, Aurora "Rory" Wynter trudged through the downpour, her feet squelching in her worn-out sneakers as she made her way to her small studio apartment.

As a graphic designer, Rory had grown accustomed to spending long hours alone, lost in her own world of color and texture. But there was something about this particular evening that felt different - perhaps it was the nagging sense of unease that had been building in her stomach all day, or maybe it was the way the rain seemed to be drumming out a rhythm on the pavement, like some sort of morbid beat.

Whatever it was, Rory knew she needed to get out of her apartment and lose herself in something creative. She pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside, shaking the water from her jacket as she made her way to the kitchen. Her eyes landed on a half-finished design project on her laptop, a graphic novel concept that had been sitting on the backburner for months. With a surge of determination, Rory sat down at her desk and began to tap out the first notes for her latest masterpiece.

Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a very different story - one that would take her on a journey through the city's hidden corners, into a world of mystery and intrigue that would challenge everything she thought she knew about herself.
