Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The neon sign above the bar creaked in the gentle ocean breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the small, cluttered space. Inside, the sounds of seagulls and the distant hum of the highway mingled with the murmur of hushed conversations and the occasional clink of glasses. It was just after closing time on a drizzly autumn evening in coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea.

Behind the bar, Elenore "Ellie" Thompson polished a mug with a dirty rag, her eyes fixed on the clock ticking away the final minutes of her shift at McGillicuddy's Pub. At 27, Ellie had been tending bar for five years, and she knew every regular by name - from the retired fisherman who always ordered a whiskey on the rocks to the young couple who sipped champagne cocktails by the window.

As the clock struck midnight, the door swung open and a lone figure strode in, shaking the rain from their coat. The dim light of the bar illuminated the sharp lines of their face, and Ellie's instincts told her that this one was trouble. But it was the look in their eyes - a mixture of desperation and longing - that really caught her attention.

"Welcome to McGillicuddy's," Ellie said with a warm smile, wiping her hands on her apron. "What can I get you?"

The stranger's gaze locked onto hers, and for a moment, it was like the whole bar had melted away, leaving only the two of them suspended in a sea of possibility.
