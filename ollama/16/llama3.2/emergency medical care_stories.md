Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

**Story Opening**

As she rushed out of the hospital's ER doors, Dr. Emily Alexandra "Evie" Thompson felt the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins. Another long night had just come to an end, but the weight of the day's cases lingered in her mind. The beeping of monitors, the scent of disinfectant, and the anguished cries of patients still echoed in her ears.

Evie took a deep breath, feeling the cool morning air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the city skyline. The early sunlight cast a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers, but it couldn't penetrate the exhaustion that had taken up residence in her chest.

She checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time â€“ 6:47 AM. She was already running late for her shift at New Haven Community Hospital's emergency department.

**Setting**

New Haven City, USA

The city was a diverse and vibrant metropolis, with a population of over 700,000 people. The hospital, New Haven Community Hospital, was one of the largest in the city, serving as a major referral center for the surrounding suburbs. Evie worked on the ED floor, where she had been an intern for three years, working her way up to become a respected and skilled ER physician.

The hospital itself was a labyrinthine complex, with narrow corridors and rooms that seemed to stretch on forever. The ED was a hive of activity, with patients being wheeled in on stretchers, medical staff rushing to and fro, and the constant din of sirens and beeping equipment providing a cacophony of noise.

As Evie made her way through the hospital's entrance, she nodded curtly at the security guard, who recognized her from past shifts. "Hey, Doc," he said with a grin. "Good morning."

Evie flashed him a tired smile and continued on to the elevator, her eyes fixed on the clock as it ticked closer to her shift starting time.
