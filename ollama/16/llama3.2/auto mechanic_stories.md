Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Red Rock, Arizona, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty Main Street. The smell of grease and gasoline hung heavy in the air as Asher "Ash" Jackson wiped the sweat from his forehead with a dirty rag. His garage, Jackson's Auto Repair, was quiet for the evening, except for the occasional rumble of a passing car on the highway outside.

Ash, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, looked up from the engine he was working on to gaze out at the street. He took a moment to appreciate the peacefulness of the night, before turning back to the task at hand. The old Ford F-150 he had been tinkering with earlier needed some attention, and Ash was determined to get it running smoothly.

As he began to tinker with the engine once again, the phone on his workbench rang, shrill in the silence of the garage. Ash hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering who could be calling at such a late hour. Little did he know, this call would set off a chain of events that would change his life forever.

How's this?
