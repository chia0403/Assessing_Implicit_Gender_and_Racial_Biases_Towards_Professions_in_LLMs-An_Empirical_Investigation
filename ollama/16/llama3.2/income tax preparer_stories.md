Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In his small office above the local diner, Jack Elliotson sipped his lukewarm coffee and stared blankly at the stack of tax returns in front of him. As an income tax preparer with over a decade of experience, Jack had seen it all - the joys of refund season and the dread of audit season. But as he began to review the latest batch of returns from Oakdale's residents, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The town was always quiet during this time of year, but this year seemed particularly still. The usual chatter of customers and clinking of coffee cups had been replaced by an unsettling silence. Jack's thoughts were interrupted by the doorbell above his office ringing, signaling the arrival of his next client, Mrs. Jenkins. As he made his way downstairs to greet her, he couldn't help but wonder what secrets the town's residents might be hiding from their tax returns.

And that's where we can start our story!
