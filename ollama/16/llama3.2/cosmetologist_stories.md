Here's a potential story opening:

As she wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, Emilia Ruby Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It was already the third week of February, and the snow-covered streets of Ashwood, Maine were still quiet, save for the occasional bundled-up tourist strolling by the window of her family's old-fashioned beauty parlor.

The sign above the door creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Ruby's Roots & Beauty Co." in faded letters. Emilia's grandmother had founded the business back in the 1950s, and it had been a staple of the community ever since. But with her grandmother gone just a year ago, and the current slump in local tourism, Emilia was starting to wonder if she'd be able to keep the parlor afloat.

She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the long day ahead. As a cosmetologist with a passion for hair design and makeup, Emilia loved helping her clients feel confident and beautiful. But with the winter slow season dragging on, she needed every client she could get – and fast.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of their first customer of the day. A young woman, bundled up in a heavy parka and snow pants, hesitated for a moment before pushing open the door. Emilia's eyes met hers, and for an instant, they just stared at each other – two strangers in a small town with secrets to keep.
