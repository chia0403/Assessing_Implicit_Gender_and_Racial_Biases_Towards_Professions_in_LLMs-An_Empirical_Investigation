As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, a lone figure emerged from the mist-shrouded streets. Emrys Fawcett, a ruggedly handsome carpenter with hands that had spent years shaping wood and nails into beautiful structures, stepped out of his small, weathered cabin on Elm Street. The scent of freshly cut cedar wafted through the crisp morning air as Emrys breathed in deeply, feeling the weight of another long day ahead.

Ravenswood, a town of about 2,000 people, had changed little since its founding in the late 19th century. The main street was lined with old-fashioned general stores, a post office, and the local diner, where Emrys often stopped for breakfast before heading to his workshop on the outskirts of town. The sound of hammering and sawing echoed through the morning stillness as Emrys made his way towards the town square, where he would meet with the local builder's association to discuss a new project.

Emrys had always been proud of his work as a carpenter, taking great care in every detail to ensure that each building was not only functional but also beautiful. His passion for woodworking was inherited from his father, who had taught him the trade when Emrys was just a young boy. Over the years, Emrys had honed his skills and built a reputation as one of the best carpenters in Ravenswood.

As he walked into town, Emrys couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. The townspeople seemed quieter than usual, and there were whispers of strange occurrences in the woods just outside the town limits. Emrys had always been skeptical of rumors and superstitions, but the air felt thick with unease.

Little did he know, this day would be one like no other.
