Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a chilly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to get home from their late-night shift at the local diner or factory. The only sound was the distant hum of a coal mine's machinery and the occasional bark of a dog.

In a small police station on Main Street, Officer Ethan August Blackwood sat sipping his lukewarm coffee, staring out the window at the darkening landscape. A veteran of the force with over ten years of service under his belt, Ethan had seen it all - from the petty thefts to the gruesome murders that still haunted his dreams.

Born and raised in Ravenswood, Ethan knew every nook and cranny of this tight-knit community. He was a favorite among the locals, who appreciated his fair but firm hand as a cop. But with the changing times and the influx of outsiders, Ethan couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss in Ravenswood.

As he gazed out into the night, his mind began to wander to the peculiar incident that had occurred earlier that day - a cryptic 911 call from an unknown number, reporting a mysterious figure lurking around the old Miller place on the outskirts of town. The caller had hung up before Ethan could even respond, leaving him with more questions than answers.

With a sigh, Ethan stood up and began to pace around his small office, lost in thought as the darkness outside seemed to seep into his very bones. Little did he know, tonight was just the beginning of a case that would test his skills, push him to his limits, and force him to confront the darker side of Ravenswood...
