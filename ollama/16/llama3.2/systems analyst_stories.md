Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Portland, Oregon, and Dr. Elliot Thompson, a systems analyst at a mid-sized tech firm, trudged through the mist-shrouded streets, her eyes fixed on the pavement ahead. She had just left a long day of meetings with the company's IT department, where she'd spent hours trying to troubleshoot a pesky database issue that was holding up their latest software rollout.

As she turned the corner onto Hawthorne Boulevard, Elliot couldn't shake off the feeling of frustration that had been building all day. She loved her job – there was something satisfying about figuring out complex technical problems and watching them disappear into the ether – but lately, it felt like the company's growth had come at a cost. The office was becoming increasingly crowded and impersonal, with new hires and mergers throwing everyone for a loop.

Elliot sighed and quickened her pace, dodging pedestrians on their way to and from the evening commute. She worked in a small, cramped office space near the river, where she spent most of her time staring at screens and trying to make sense of the data that swirled around her like a digital maelstrom.

As she approached her apartment building, Elliot's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Rachel. "Hey girl! Want to grab dinner tonight? I just got tickets to see 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee' at the theater downtown." The mention of the show brought a small smile to Elliot's face – she loved musicals almost as much as she loved solving puzzles.

But as she swiped open her phone, Elliot noticed something strange. A text from an unknown number had popped up on her screen: "Meet me at 5pm sharp at the old clock tower if you want to know what's really going on in Portland."
