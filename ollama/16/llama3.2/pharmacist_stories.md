Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the sleepy coastal town of Tidestone, casting a warm orange glow over the small streets and homes that lined its quaint Main Street. Inside his pharmacy, Apothecary and Son, pharmacists Everett Wystan Fletcher busied himself restocking shelves with jars of dried herbs and bottles of pills, his mind already focused on the challenges of the coming week.

Everett, a man in his late thirties with a kind face and gentle eyes, had lived in Tidestone all his life. He took pride in running the family pharmacy, which had been in operation since 1850, when his great-grandfather, Silas Fletcher, first opened its doors to the community. The smell of old books and medicine wafted through the air as Everett worked, mingling with the scent of fresh coffee and baked goods from the bakery next door.

As the evening wore on, a knock at the door interrupted Everett's thoughts. It was his friend and neighbor, Dr. Sophia Patel, who had just finished a long shift at the hospital and was stopping by to pick up some prescriptions for her patients. "Evening, Everett," she said with a smile, as she rummaged through her bag for her wallet. "How's business been?"

Everett smiled back, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Quiet so far. Just the usual: flu shots, colds, and a few new medications for our summer tourists." He handed Sophia her prescriptions and added, "But I did have an interesting request from the local health department earlier today..."

As they chatted, Everett couldn't shake the feeling that something was off in Tidestone. It wasn't just the usual small-town worries - people were generally friendly and looked out for one another - but a sense of unease had begun to simmer beneath the surface. And with Dr. Patel's departure back to the hospital, the silence that followed made Everett feel like he was the only person left in town...
