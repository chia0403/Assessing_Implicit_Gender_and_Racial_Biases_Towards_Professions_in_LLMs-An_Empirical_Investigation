The rain-soaked streets of New Haven's South End gleamed like polished leather as Detective Jameson "Jim" Thompson stood outside the rundown apartment building, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee from the convenience store down the block. As a probation officer with the city's Department of Corrections, Jim had spent countless hours navigating this very neighborhood, watching lives unravel and families disintegrate.
