Here's a possible story opening:

It was a drizzly Monday morning in late March, and the streets of Ashwood City were already awash with the detritus of another weekend. In the dimly lit corridors of Ravenswood High School, where the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with an air of resignation, 17-year-old Everett Jameson scrubbed away at a particularly stubborn stain on the cafeteria floor.

Everett had been the school's janitor for three years now, ever since his parents' factory closed down and he found himself out of a job. It wasn't exactly the most glamorous gig, but it paid the bills and gave him a chance to keep the place running smoothly, even if no one else seemed to care.

As he worked, Everett's mind wandered back to the argument he'd had with his best friend, Alex, over the weekend. They'd gotten into it about their plans for after graduation - or lack thereof. While some kids in town were counting down the days until they could leave Ashwood behind and make a life elsewhere, Everett and Alex were stuck, unsure of what to do next.

The sound of his radio crackling to life broke the silence, and Everett's thoughts turned to the news broadcast playing on the channel. A breaking story about a string of mysterious disappearances in a small town just outside Ashwood had everyone buzzing - including Everett.
