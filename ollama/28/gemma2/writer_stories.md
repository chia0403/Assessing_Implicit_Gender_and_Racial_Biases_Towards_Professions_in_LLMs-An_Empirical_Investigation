The Parisian air hung thick with the scent of rain and freshly baked bread as Eloise Dubois tapped her pen against the worn leather of her notebook. Her tiny apartment, nestled above a bustling boulangerie on a cobbled street in Montmartre, was bathed in the golden light of the late afternoon sun.

Inside, silence reigned except for the rhythmic scratching of her pen and the occasional hum from the ancient radiator. 

Eloise had been staring at the blank page for hours, struggling to find the words that would breathe life into her latest story. The muse, it seemed, had taken a holiday, leaving Eloise feeling like a ship adrift, with no wind in its sails. She sighed, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped her braid.
