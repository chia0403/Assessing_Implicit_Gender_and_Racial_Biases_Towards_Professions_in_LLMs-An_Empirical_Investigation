The sawdust danced in the afternoon sunbeams that sliced through the open workshop door, illuminating motes of wood and the rhythmic rasp of Elias Blackwood's saw. His calloused hands moved with practiced ease, shaping the oak into the curve of a handrail, his brow furrowed in concentration. The air hummed with the scent of fresh pine and cedar, a comforting familiarity that had always grounded Elias.

His workshop, nestled on the edge of Havenwood, was a sanctuary built from reclaimed timber and time-worn stone. Ivy clung to the weathered walls, weaving its green tapestry around the faded sign hanging above the entrance: "Blackwood Carpentry - Where Dreams Take Shape."  Havenwood itself was a small, secluded town tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a place where life moved at a slower pace and secrets whispered through the rustling leaves. Elias knew every creak of his workshop, every twist of the mountain paths, every face that walked under the pale glow of Havenwood's lone street lamp. But something felt different this time. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he paused, listening to the wind sighing through the pines outside.  The peace of his sanctuary had been shattered.
