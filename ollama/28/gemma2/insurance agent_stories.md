Rain lashed against the windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Kensington's office, blurring the neon cityscape into an impressionist painting of swirling greens and reds. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old building’s bones and sending shivers down Bart’s spine. He wasn't one for dramatic weather, preferring his days to be as predictable and sanitized as his meticulously arranged desk – stacks of file folders labelled with crisp, black marker, each containing the hopes and anxieties of another soul seeking financial security in a world that seemed increasingly chaotic.

Bart sighed, pushing aside a stray strand of his salt-and-pepper hair.  The phone on his desk buzzed, breaking the silence. It was a new client, someone named Amelia Hayes, requesting an immediate meeting. Something about her voice – a tremor of fear tinged with desperation – told Bart this wouldn't be your average homeowners insurance claim. 


This wasn’t just another Tuesday night in bustling Chicago. This was the beginning of something… different.
