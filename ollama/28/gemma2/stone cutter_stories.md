The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and granite dust in Jasper Thorne's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the intricate carvings he was meticulously etching into a slab of grey Welsh slate. Each stroke of his chisel resonated with the rhythmic pulse of the ancient stone, its cool surface yielding to his touch like clay under a sculptor’s hand. 

Jasper, with his calloused fingers stained ochre from years of working with earth and rock, was more than just a craftsman; he was a whisperer of stone. He could coax untold stories from the heart of each boulder, revealing hidden narratives in its veins and folds. His workshop, nestled on the outskirts of the bustling port city of Havenwood, was a sanctuary where the relentless clamour of the world faded into the soothing rasp of chisels against granite. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the workbench, highlighting the intricate patterns Jasper was crafting - swirling waves that seemed to ripple with life, hinting at a storm brewing beyond the workshop walls.  A storm that threatened not just the city, but Jasper’s own carefully constructed world.
