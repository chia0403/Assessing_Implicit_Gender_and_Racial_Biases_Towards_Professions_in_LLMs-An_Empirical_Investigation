The scent of rain-soaked earth clung to Dr. Amelia Grace Everett's cashmere coat as she stepped into her office building. It was the kind of grey afternoon that mirrored the storm brewing inside her - a mix of exhaustion and gnawing worry. The flickering fluorescent lights in the lobby cast long, distorted shadows on the worn-out carpet, each step echoing like a hammer blow against the quiet hum of the city outside.  

Amelia's practice, nestled within a forgotten wing of an old Art Deco building, was usually a sanctuary - a place where she could shed the weight of the world and help others navigate their own inner storms. But today, even the familiar scent of sandalwood incense couldn't quite mask the pervasive sense of unease that clung to her.  Her next appointment, with a young woman named Lily, was already running late. Amelia wasn't usually one for superstition, but something about the delayed meeting felt off, like a misplaced piece in a puzzle she couldn't quite solve.
