The morning sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's back as he wrestled with an unruly rose bush. The thorny vines clawed at his worn gardening gloves, their thorns finding purchase in even the thickest leather. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes, but Bart didn't flinch. He was a landscaper through and through, born and bred in the bustling heart of Oakhaven, where manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds were as prized as gold. 

The setting: Oakhaven is a quaint town nestled in a valley surrounded by rolling hills, perpetually bathed in golden sunlight. Victorian houses with sprawling gardens line the cobblestone streets, each vying for the coveted "Best Lawn" award bestowed annually at the Oakhaven Fall Festival.  Bart's clientele consisted of the town's elite - retired lawyers, successful merchants, and even the reclusive Countess Willowbrook who lived in a gothic mansion overlooking the town square. This morning, however, he was working on Mrs. Pettigrew's garden, a riot of color bordering on chaotic. It was always a challenge, but Bart relished the opportunity to tame the wildness and bring order to its beautiful mess. 


As Bart reached for his trusty shears, a glint in the distance caught his eye - a flash of silver disappearing behind Mrs. Pettigrew's ancient oak tree. He paused, the familiar scent of roses suddenly overtaken by something... different. A hint of smoke, and something else he couldn't quite place.
