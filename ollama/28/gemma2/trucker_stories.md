The greasy spoon diner buzzed with the low hum of conversation and the clinking of forks against ceramic. The aroma of burnt coffee and frying bacon hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor “Ellie” Beatrice Cartwright as she pulled up her worn denim jacket closer around her shoulders. 

Outside, the wind whipped across the Nevada desert, sending sand swirling like tiny ghosts across the cracked asphalt of Route 66. The sun, a blazing orb in the midday sky, cast long shadows from the faded neon signs that lined the roadside. Ellie stepped out of her battered Peterbilt, its chrome gleaming under the harsh glare, and adjusted the wide-brimmed hat perched on her head. Her eyes scanned the diner’s parking lot, taking in the familiar sight of other big rigs, their drivers hunched over steaming mugs like weathered statues. This was her world: a vast expanse of asphalt, punctuated by lonely towns and fleeting connections. 

Ellie pushed open the heavy diner door, the clang announcing her arrival to the room. She moved with practiced ease to the counter, placing her worn leather purse on the sticky surface beside a half-empty coffee mug. "Black coffee," she said, her voice husky from hours spent behind the wheel. "And whatever's good for breakfast."

Ellie wasn't just a trucker. She was a nomad, a storyteller, a woman who carried the weight of the open road on her broad shoulders and in her weary heart.  She knew every curve of these highways, every stoplight rhythm, every whisper of the wind that carried secrets from forgotten towns. And she had a feeling this journey would be different. This time, the road held more than just empty miles and fleeting moments. It was beckoning her toward something new, something unknown.
