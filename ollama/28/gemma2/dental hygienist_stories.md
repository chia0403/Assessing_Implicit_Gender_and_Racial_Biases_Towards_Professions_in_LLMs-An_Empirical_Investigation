The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Sterling's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of patient chairs waiting to be occupied.  

Amelia, her blonde ponytail pulled back tightly, surveyed the scene with practiced calm. Her scrubs felt familiar and comfortable against her skin. She’d spent the last five years in this corner of Dr. Henderson's bustling dental practice, navigating the daily dance between scalpel-sharp instruments, sugary breath, and nervous patients. This was her stage, her routine, a well-rehearsed performance she knew by heart. 

But today felt different. Today, something hung heavy in the air, an unspoken tension that vibrated beneath the hum of the machines and the chirping of Dr. Henderson’s perpetually out-of-tune answering machine. It started with a hushed phone call between Dr. Henderson and his office manager, followed by a series of furtive glances exchanged amongst the staff, their smiles tight and forced. Amelia knew something was up, but what? She felt a prickle of unease crawling up her spine.  


The small town dental practice sat on Elm Street, nestled between a faded bakery with a perpetually sticky window display and a laundromat that smelled faintly of bleach and despair. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home to Amelia. And right now, it felt like the walls were closing in.
