The stale air of the waiting room felt thick with anxiety, punctuated by the rhythmic clicking of Amelia Beaumont's pen against her clipboard. Outside, the Seattle drizzle painted the city in shades of grey, mirroring the dullness settling over her usually vibrant clinic. 

Amelia, her bright green eyes hidden behind wire-rimmed glasses, sighed.  It had been a particularly tough week.  A string of demanding clients, budget cuts threatening to decimate their meager supplies, and an ongoing battle with the insurance company that seemed determined to deny coverage for anything remotely beneficial.  Today's appointment, a young woman named Sarah struggling with disordered eating, felt like another weight on her already burdened shoulders. 

Amelia longed for sunshine and simplicity, a far cry from the complexities of navigating the world of nutrition in a city obsessed with fad diets and quick fixes. Yet, despite the weariness, she knew she wouldn't trade this work for anything. Every time she helped someone reclaim their health, every time she saw a flicker of hope ignite in their eyes, it reminded her why she dedicated her life to nourishing both bodies and souls. 


Amelia adjusted her lilac scarf, a splash of color amidst the greyness, and straightened her posture. It was time for Sarah's appointment. Time to be Amelia Beaumont, dietician, warrior against hunger and champion of wholeness.
