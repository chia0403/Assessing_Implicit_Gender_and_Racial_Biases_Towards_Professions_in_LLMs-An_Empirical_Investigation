The first chill of autumn settled over Maple Creek Farm like a damp blanket. Leaves, once vibrant emerald and fiery crimson, now rustled mournfully in the wind, their descent mirroring Silas Hawthorne’s weary heart. He stood at the edge of his barley field, its golden stalks bent under the weight of the coming frost. For generations, his family had toiled this land, nurturing it with sweat and prayers, but this year, the harvest promised little solace.

Silas ran a calloused hand over his grizzled beard, the stubble scratching against his weathered skin.  He’d inherited this farm from his father, who’d inherited it from his, and so on, a chain stretching back to their pioneer ancestors who carved out this life from the untamed wilderness.  But now, Silas felt like that chain was fraying, each link weakening under the pressure of drought, dwindling markets, and an encroaching world that seemed to have no room for small farms anymore.


The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the field. A lone crow called out, its mournful cry echoing Silas’s own sense of impending loss. He turned away from the field, his boots sinking into the muddy path leading back to the farmhouse, a looming silhouette against the fading light.  He had decisions to make, and time was running out.
