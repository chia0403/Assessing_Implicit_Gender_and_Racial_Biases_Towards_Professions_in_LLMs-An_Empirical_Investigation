The air in Amelia Josephine Davies’ office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the Chicago skyline into an impressionistic canvas of greys and yellows. Papers piled precariously high on her desk threatened to avalanche at any moment, each sheet a silent testament to the relentless churn of legal drama. Amelia, perched on the edge of her ergonomic chair, was fighting a losing battle.

A particularly demanding case – a multi-million dollar lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant – had stretched her thin, demanding tireless research, meticulous document organization, and unwavering adherence to deadlines that seemed perpetually shifting like sand dunes in a desert windstorm.  

The clock on the wall ticked with mocking regularity, each second another reminder of the ever-approaching deadline for the defendant’s response.  Amelia rubbed her temples, trying to massage away the throbbing headache that mirrored the tension knotting her stomach. She needed a miracle, and fast.
