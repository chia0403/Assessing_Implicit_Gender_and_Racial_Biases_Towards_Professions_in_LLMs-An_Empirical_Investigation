The air in "Shear Madness" was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and nervous anticipation.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty front window, illuminating strands of stray hair caught in the cobwebs clinging to the corners. Beatrice Clementine Perkins, known affectionately (or sometimes sarcastically) as Bea, perched on a stool behind the counter, meticulously filing her shears. 

Bea's shop wasn't exactly bustling. In fact, Tuesdays were typically slower than a sloth in hibernation. But today was different. Today, Mrs. Gertrude Humperdink, the most notoriously judgmental woman in Maple Creek, had scheduled an appointment. Her silver bob, usually as crisp and severe as her stare, looked more like a tangled bird's nest this morning.  Bea felt a familiar thrill course through her â€“ the challenge of transforming even the most stubborn locks into something beautiful was what she lived for. 


Setting: A small, slightly run-down hair salon called "Shear Madness" located on a quiet, dusty street in Maple Creek, a sleepy town somewhere in the American Midwest.
