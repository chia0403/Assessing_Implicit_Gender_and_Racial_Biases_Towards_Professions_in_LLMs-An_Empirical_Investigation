The rusted wingspan of the Valkyrie loomed over Captain Evelyn "Val" Vance like a weathered guardian angel. Its hull bore the scars of countless battles – gouges from stray blaster fire, scorch marks from atmospheric re-entry, and a dent that looked suspiciously like it had been made by a particularly aggressive asteroid. It was a testament to its age and resilience, just like Val herself.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across the sprawling junkyard of Derelict Station IV, where salvaged starships lay scattered amidst piles of scrap metal and twisted machinery. The air hummed with the drone of repair droids and the occasional hiss of escaping coolant. The stench of burnt circuitry mingled with the acrid tang of ozone, a familiar perfume to anyone who’d spent time among the fallen giants of space travel. 


Val ran a calloused hand over the Valkyrie's chipped paint, tracing the faded emblem of her squadron – the Red Hawks – on its nose. A knot of anticipation tightened in her chest. Tomorrow, she was taking this battered vessel and its motley crew on their most dangerous mission yet: infiltrating the notorious Black Nebula to recover a stolen prototype weapon. It was a suicide run, everyone said, but Val had never been one to shy away from a challenge, especially when it came to protecting the innocent. The fate of countless lives rested on her shoulders, and she wouldn't let them down.
