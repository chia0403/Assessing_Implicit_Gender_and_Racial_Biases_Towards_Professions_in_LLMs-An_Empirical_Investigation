Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already dimly lit city streets of Seattle into an impressionist painting of gray and yellow.  Inside the ambulance, Amelia "Amy" Hayes tapped her foot impatiently, her eyes flicking between the flashing lights and the cracked screen of her phone.  Another call, another delayed response time. It was becoming a familiar song in Amy's life, a jarring symphony of sirens and city grime punctuated by moments of quiet desperation. 

She adjusted her stethoscope, the cool metal a grounding sensation against her chest. The rhythmic beeping of the monitor provided a counterpoint to the chaotic rhythm of the city outside.  A new call crackled over the radio: "Possible heart attack, 14th and Pike. Dispatching Medic Unit Two." 

Amy tightened the straps on her backpack, its weight familiar and comforting. She grabbed her emergency kit, checking for the essentials - bandages, needles, oxygen mask - a silent prayer escaping her lips that this wouldn't be another night spent battling against time, against fate.  


This was just another night for Amy Hayes, an EMT in the heart of Seattle.
