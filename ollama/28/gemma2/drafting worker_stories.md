The air hung thick with the smell of graphite and stale sweat in the Drafting Department at Zenith Industries. Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne hunched over her drafting board, her brow furrowed as she wrestled with a complex set of blueprints for the new Aurora Engine prototype. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the cluttered workspace.  

The year was 2047, and while sleek autonomous drones flitted through the skies above, here in the bowels of Zenith Industries, things were still done the old-fashioned way: pencils sharpened to a razor point, precise lines drawn with unwavering certainty, and blueprints meticulously amended until they reflected the ever-shifting whims of the engineers.  

Amy hated Tuesdays. They were always the busiest days, crammed with last-minute revisions and frantic requests from the engine development team.  Today was no exception. A new set of specs had arrived, demanding a complete overhaul of the cooling system for the Aurora Engine, due to be unveiled at the annual Aerospace Expo in just three weeks. 

As Amy chewed on the end of her pencil, staring at the jumbled mess on her board, she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another Tuesday.  There was a sense of urgency, an undercurrent of tension that hummed beneath the surface of the usual office din. Something big was brewing, and Amy had a feeling she was about to be caught in the middle of it.
