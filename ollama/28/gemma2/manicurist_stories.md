The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Clementine Beauregard's station, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the rows of neatly filed nails that lay in wait for their transformations. The scent of acetone and jasmine hung heavy in the air, a sweet perfume masking the underlying aroma of anxiety and desperation that permeated Madame Evangeline's Salon.  

Amelia, her name echoing through the salon like a forgotten hymn, meticulously cleaned each cuticle with a gentle touch. Her movements were precise, efficient, a counterpoint to the whirlwind of emotions swirling within her. Today was the day she would finally unveil her latest creation - a revolutionary new line of nail polishes infused with pheromones, designed to manipulate moods and desires. 


Outside, the Parisian afternoon swirled with vibrant life: bustling cafes, lovers whispering sweet nothings, children chasing pigeons through the cobblestone streets. But inside Madame Evangeline's, time seemed to stand still. The only sounds were the rhythmic scraping of files, the clinking of bottles, and the hushed murmurings of women hoping to find solace in a little bit of beauty.
