The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and regret in The Rusty Nail, a dive bar tucked away on a forgotten side street in Savannah, Georgia.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon sign proclaiming "Coldest Drinks This Side of Hell" into an iridescent smear.  Behind the sticky counter, Elara Mae Davenport expertly swirled a cocktail, her movements as practiced and precise as a seasoned surgeon's. 

Elara had seen it all behind this bar - drunken brawls, tearful confessions, even the occasional proposal gone wrong. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck told her trouble was brewing, a storm about to break, and Elara Mae Davenport, queen of The Rusty Nail, wasn't about to be caught in the crossfire.
