The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt wiring, a familiar scent to  Elias Vance as he crouched inside the cramped attic of Mrs. Peabody's Victorian home. Dust motes danced in the single beam of his flashlight, illuminating cobwebs that draped like ghostly curtains from every rafter. Elias sighed, feeling the familiar tug of apprehension that always came with these old houses. They had a way of hiding their problems until they decided to reveal them with a sudden, dramatic crackle or flash. 

This one seemed particularly mischievous. He'd been called in because Mrs. Peabody, a woman whose age was as mysterious as her collection of antique porcelain cats, claimed the lights were flickering in an unsettling pattern. Elias suspected something more sinister than faulty wiring was at play. There was a palpable tension in the air, a humming energy that prickled his skin. He gripped his toolbox tighter, feeling a surge of both excitement and trepidation. 


**Setting:**

A cramped attic in a dusty Victorian home in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The house is old and creaky, with exposed beams and cobwebs draped everywhere. A single beam of light from Elias' flashlight cuts through the darkness, illuminating swirling dust motes and antique furniture covered in sheets. Outside, the wind howls ominously, rattling the windows and adding to the eerie atmosphere.
