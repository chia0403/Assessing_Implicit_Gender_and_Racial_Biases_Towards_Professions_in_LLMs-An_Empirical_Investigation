The stale scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer that Amelia "Amy" Brightwell spritzed liberally after each patient.  Her small private practice, tucked away on a quiet side street in Denver, Colorado, was bathed in the warm glow of afternoon sun streaming through the south-facing windows. A lone fern in the corner cast feathery shadows across the worn hardwood floor, its green fronds a vibrant contrast to the pale yellow walls.

Amy sat at her desk, meticulously reviewing patient charts and scribbling notes on the margins. The gentle clinking of mugs from the nearby coffee shop down the street punctuated the quiet hum of the air conditioner. Outside, the late summer heat was starting to settle in, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. A lone car passed by, its engine rumbling like a sleepy bear waking from hibernation.  

Today’s schedule was packed, with a mix of familiar faces and new patients seeking relief from various ailments – a runner with a nagging Achilles tendon issue, an elderly woman recovering from hip surgery, and a young musician struggling with carpal tunnel syndrome. Amy took a deep breath, her heart swelling with a familiar sense of purpose. Helping people regain their mobility and independence was what fueled her passion. She smoothed down the wrinkles on her crisp white blouse and leaned back in her chair, ready to face another day filled with both challenges and triumphs.
