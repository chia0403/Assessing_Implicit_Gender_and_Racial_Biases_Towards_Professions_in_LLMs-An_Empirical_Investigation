The scent of stale crayons and peanut butter sandwiches hung heavy in the air, mingling with the cheerful cacophony of squawking laughter and clanging plastic toys. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Room 204 at Sunnyside Daycare, illuminating the chaotic tableau before Amelia Beatrice "Millie" Harper.  

Millie, a young woman with perpetually wind-blown auburn hair and eyes that crinkled at the corners when she smiled, surveyed her domain. Five-year-old Toby was building a precarious tower out of blocks, his tongue poking out in concentration. Three boisterous toddlers, Maya, Leo, and Finn, were engaged in a spirited game of "tag" around the miniature jungle gym, their tiny limbs flailing with reckless abandon. 

Millie sighed contentedly. This was her happy place, this messy, noisy world where she could make a difference, one sticky finger painting session and misplaced sippy cup at a time. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Millie's spine, a sense that something wasn't quite right. The usual hum of activity seemed to be humming just a little too loudly, a touch too frantically.  


As she reached for the stack of picture books on the shelf, a piercing scream shattered the morning calm.
