The sunrise was a bruised purple smear across the horizon, barely illuminating the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched before him like a concrete serpent.  

Darius "Daz" Hawthorne squinted, adjusting his mirrored sunglasses against the glare. It wasn't much sun yet, but it would be scorching soon enough, just another day in the hellfire furnace of the Nevada desert. Daz ran a calloused hand over his beard, already prickling with sweat. He checked his thermos â€“ lukewarm coffee and half-eaten granola bar. Not exactly gourmet, but fuel for this monstrous machine he called a life.

Daz was a highway worker, one of those anonymous cogs keeping America connected.  His days were spent battling dust devils, wrestling with potholes the size of swimming pools, and dodging careless motorists who thought a speed limit was merely a suggestion. He wasn't complaining; it was honest work. But sometimes, staring out at that endless expanse of road, Daz wished for something more, something beyond the rumble of machinery and the whine of passing trucks. Something...different. 


**Setting:** A desolate stretch of highway in the Nevada desert, early morning.  The air is dry and hot, even before the sun has fully risen. The landscape is flat and unforgiving, punctuated by occasional scrub bushes and the rusted hulks of abandoned vehicles.
