The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Amelia Beatrice Everly's cluttered writing desk. Papers overflowing with half-formed sentences and discarded plot points littered the surface like fallen autumn leaves. A lone candle, perched precariously on a stack of worn novels, sputtered in the draft that snaked through the narrow window of her attic room. Outside, London slumbered beneath a blanket of fog, its muffled sounds barely reaching Amelia's ears as she wrestled with the latest dilemma facing her protagonist, a dashing archaeologist named Alistair Thorne. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. The story, set amidst the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, seemed to have stalled at an impasse.  The Peruvian sun, she knew, wouldn't wait for inspiration to strike, and neither would her editor, Mr. Cartwright, whose patience was as thin as parchment paper. 


Her deadline loomed, a menacing spectre whispering in her ear. Perhaps a change of scenery was needed. Perhaps Alistair Thorne simply needed to be abandoned, replaced with a more pliable character, less burdened by the weight of historical accuracy.   

Suddenly, a loud thud from downstairs jolted Amelia from her thoughts. She froze, every muscle tense, listening for any further sound. The silence that followed was heavy and unsettling. 


Amelia clutched her quill tighter, her imagination running wild. Was it just the wind playing tricks on her? Or was something, or someone, lurking in the shadows of her darkened London home?
