The air in the grand Victorian manor hung thick with dust motes dancing in the morning sunbeams that slanted through the high windows. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously dusted a delicate porcelain figurine, her movements as practiced and precise as a surgeon’s. She ran a feather duster over its intricately carved surface, whispering a silent apology for the decades of neglect that had accumulated on the family's once-pristine collection. 

Amelia was the last bastion of order in this crumbling monument to faded glory. The wealthy Blackwood family, long absent from their ancestral home, only visited during summer months, leaving Amelia to tend to their sprawling estate like a lonely shepherd guarding a flock of forgotten dreams. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every sigh of the ancient plumbing, and every shadow cast by the fading grandeur that clung to the house like cobwebs. 

Today, though, felt different. A nervous energy buzzed beneath Amelia's usual calm. The Blackwoods were returning sooner than expected, and a letter hinting at change had arrived last week.  The air in the manor crackled with anticipation – a storm brewing not just within its walls, but within Amelia herself.
