The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation in the cramped office at 427 Elm Street. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled like a wounded beast, rattling the brittle panes of the second-story window where Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Cartwright sat hunched over her desk. Her reflection stared back, eyes red-rimmed from late nights poring over sales figures and caffeine jitters. 

The numbers were grim. Amy had been struggling to make quota ever since the new marketing campaign fizzled out, leaving a trail of disappointed clients and dwindling commissions in its wake.  She knew the boss, Mr. Henderson, would be breathing down her neck soon, his perpetually furrowed brow deepening with each missed target. 

Amy sighed, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped its ponytail. It was going to be another long day. A knock on the door startled her, bringing her focus back to the task at hand. She squared her shoulders, plastered on a smile, and braced herself for whatever storm Mr. Henderson had brewing.
