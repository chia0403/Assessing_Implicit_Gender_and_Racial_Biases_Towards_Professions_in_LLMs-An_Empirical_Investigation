Rain hammered against Detective Alistair Finch's office window, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of urban misery playing out on the slick streets below. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma to Finch, who had spent more nights than he cared to remember chasing shadows in this city's underbelly. His own office, tucked away on the third floor of a forgotten building overlooking a perpetually fog-choked alley, felt as grimy and desolate as the world outside.

Finch sat hunched over his desk, a half-empty bottle of whiskey warming his hand. The phone hadn't rung all evening, a rare occurrence in this line of work. It usually meant either good luck or bad; tonight, he wasn't sure which.  He was about to pour himself another drink when the chime above the door tinkled, announcing a visitor. 

A woman stood on his threshold, her face half-hidden in the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat. Her trench coat, dark as the coming night, clung to her slender frame, and she carried herself with a nervous energy that hinted at a story far more complex than simply needing directions.  


"Mr. Finch?" she asked, her voice a husky whisper that cut through the silence like a shard of glass.

Finch pushed himself back from his desk, his gaze settling on her face. "Depends," he said, raising an eyebrow. "Who's asking?"
