The Chicago skyline glittered like a frozen waterfall, each skyscraper reflecting the harsh glare of the November sun. The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of lake water and chimney smoke. Inside his glass-walled office on the 67th floor of the Zenith Tower, Alistair Beaumont adjusted his silver tie and surveyed the city below. He wasn't a man who enjoyed looking at the pretty view – he preferred to keep his gaze focused on the numbers scrolling across his multiple monitors. Alistair was CEO of Beaumont Industries, a construction behemoth that had grown from his grandfather’s single-man operation into a global empire.  His phone buzzed, interrupting his contemplation. It was Sarah, his assistant. "Sir," her voice was brisk and efficient, "We have a situation with the Zenith One project." 


Alistair straightened, a flicker of interest in his usually stoic eyes.  The Zenith One was his latest grand project – a revolutionary mixed-use development that would redefine Chicago’s skyline. It was also proving to be a nightmare.
