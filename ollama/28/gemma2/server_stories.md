The aroma of sizzling garlic butter and caramelized onions hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that always calmed Amelia Rose Brighton’s nerves.  Even after five years serving at The Twisted Spoon, a cozy Italian bistro tucked into a bustling side street in downtown Boston, the clatter of dishes and murmur of conversations still sent a flutter of anticipation through her. Tonight, however, the usual hum was tinged with an undercurrent of nervous energy. The annual Mayor’s Charity Gala was taking place across the street, drawing crowds of influential Bostonians to the grand ballroom at the historic Parker House Hotel. It meant a packed house for Amelia and her fellow servers, who had been prepping all day for the influx of hungry patrons.  She straightened the starched white cloth of her apron, smoothed down her black dress, and glanced at the clock above the counter: 6:45 PM.  Showtime was fast approaching.   


Amelia took a deep breath, ready to navigate the whirlwind of orders, requests, and spilled wine that always accompanied their busy nights. But tonight, there was something different in the air. A sense of possibility, perhaps. Or maybe it was just the anticipation of a good tip from someone celebrating at the gala who couldn’t resist indulging in The Twisted Spoon’s legendary spaghetti carbonara.  Either way, Amelia felt a surge of excitement as she approached the bustling dining room, her smile ready and her notepad in hand.
