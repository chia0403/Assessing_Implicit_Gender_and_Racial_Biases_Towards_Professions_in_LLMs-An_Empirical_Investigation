The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's back like an angry blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped into his eyes, stinging them, but he kept working. The shingles beneath his gloved hands felt rough and unforgiving, as always.  He was replacing the damaged sections of Mrs. Periwinkle's roof in Oakhaven, a town where ambition died young and dreams went to rust like old cars on Main Street. Elias knew that feeling all too well. He yearned for something more than this endless cycle of fixing leaky roofs and chasing fading sunbeams across dusty streets.

Oakhaven was nestled between rolling hills and a lazy river that meandered through the town, its surface shimmering like a forgotten promise under the relentless summer sky.  The houses, mostly quaint two-story structures with paint peeling like scabs, lined the narrow streets, each one bearing the weight of generations past. The air hummed with the drone of cicadas and the distant rumble of Mrs. Periwinkle's grumpy cat, Clementine, who never seemed to approve of Elias' presence on her roof. 


Elias paused, wiping his brow with a grimy rag. From this vantage point, he could see the whole town spread out before him like a faded tapestry. He wondered if anyone else felt the way he did: trapped in a life that didnâ€™t quite fit, longing for something just beyond their grasp.  Then, a glint of sunlight caught his eye, reflecting off something unusual on the far side of town. A flicker of hope sparked within him, fragile and quick-burning like a candle flame in a gusty wind.
