The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and decaying magnolia blossoms.  Cicadas thrummed their incessant summer song from the oak trees lining Maple Street, while inside Dr. Bartholomew’s clinic, Amelia “Amy” Grace Harper tried to drown out the noise with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against her clipboard. The waiting room was a tableau of restless impatience; a young mother bounced her teething infant on her knee, an elderly gentleman dozed fitfully in his worn armchair, and a gaggle of teenagers whispered behind their hands, giggling over a shared phone screen.

Amy, a physician's assistant with a kind smile and tired eyes, sighed. It was always like this on Thursdays. Dr. Bartholomew, despite his years of practice and growing reputation, still drew a crowd that relied more on his grandfatherly demeanor than the efficacy of his treatments.  She glanced at the clock - 9:45 am. Almost time for Dr. B to make his grand entrance, apron dusted with flour from his homemade biscuits, and dispense a combination of medical advice and good-natured teasing. It was chaos, but Amy wouldn’t trade it for anything. This small clinic on the outskirts of New Orleans felt like home.
