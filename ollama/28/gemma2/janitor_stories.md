The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the linoleum floor. Agnes Periwinkle meticulously swabbed at a coffee stain, her movements practiced and efficient after years spent in this particular purgatory. The Grand Majestic Theater was a faded echo of its former glory, its velvet seats ripped and dusty, the once vibrant murals on the walls now chipped and faded like old photographs.  

Agnes had worked here since she was eighteen, back when the place still throbbed with life, filled with laughter and applause. Now, only the ghosts of performances past lingered in the stale air, and Agnes, their sole companion. Each night, after the last employee locked up and slipped away into the city's glittering embrace, Agnes would become the caretaker of this crumbling monument to dreams, her mop a silent wand against the encroaching darkness.
