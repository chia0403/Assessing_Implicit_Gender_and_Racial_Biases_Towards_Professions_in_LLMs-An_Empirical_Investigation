The air hung thick with the smell of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar perfume to Elara Briarwood. Her studio, tucked away on the third floor of an old Victorian house overlooking the bustling port of Dunhaven, was bathed in the soft glow of late afternoon sunlight filtering through dusty windows.  

Elara squinted at her canvas, a riot of crimson and gold swirling across its surface. It was meant to be a depiction of the sunset over Dunhaven Harbour, but it feltâ€¦off. The usual vibrancy that pulsed from her brushstrokes seemed muted, replaced by a dull ache she couldn't quite place.  A wave of frustration washed over her, leaving a bitter taste on her tongue. She tossed her brush onto a cluttered palette and paced the length of her studio, the worn floorboards creaking beneath her feet. The rhythmic clang of shipbells echoing from the harbour below seemed to mock her creative block.

Elara needed inspiration. But where could she find it in this city choked by smoke and shadowed secrets?
