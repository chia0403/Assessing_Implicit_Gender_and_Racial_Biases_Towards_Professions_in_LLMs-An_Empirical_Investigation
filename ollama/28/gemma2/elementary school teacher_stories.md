The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Beatrice Everly's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over her classroom. Crayons lay scattered across the worn linoleum floor like fallen soldiers after a fierce battle.  A half-eaten bag of goldfish crackers perched precariously on the edge of a desk, its contents whispering promises of lunchtime chaos to come. The air hung heavy with the scent of chalk dust and spilled juice boxes â€“ the unmistakable aroma of second grade.

Beatrice sighed, smoothing down her slightly-too-tight cardigan as she surveyed the aftermath of another "creative" art project. Today's lesson had been inspired by the ocean, but somewhere along the way, a rogue bottle of glitter glue had transformed the classroom into an abstract expressionist nightmare. 

She glanced at the clock. Almost time for dismissal. Just four more minutes until the joyful cacophony of little voices faded and she could reclaim her own space.  


Beatrice Everly preferred quiet. And order. Her second grade class, however, possessed neither in abundance.
