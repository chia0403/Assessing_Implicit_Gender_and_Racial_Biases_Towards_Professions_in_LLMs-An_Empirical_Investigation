The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Mae Thorntonâ€™s head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor of her office. The scent of stale coffee mingled with the faintest hint of desperation, a familiar aroma in this corner of Northwood High School. 

Elara leaned back in her creaky chair, pushing her glasses up her nose as she stared at the crumpled paper ball nestled in the overflowing wastebasket.  Another anxious student had left without finding solace, leaving behind only their anxieties and a tangible representation of their emotional turmoil. Elara sighed. This wasn't how she envisioned guiding young minds towards fulfilling futures. It was a constant battle against teenage angst, parental pressure, and the crushing weight of expectations, all amplified by the looming specter of college applications.

The bell shrieked, signaling the end of lunch and the start of another chaotic afternoon.  Elara knew the next few hours would be a whirlwind of tearful confessions, panicked pleas, and existential questions. She braced herself, smoothing down her floral print dress and taking a deep breath. This was her life, helping these lost souls navigate the choppy waters of adolescence, one crumpled paper ball at a time.
