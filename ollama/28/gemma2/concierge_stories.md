The plush velvet carpet muffled Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's steps as she glided through the opulent lobby of The Grand Blackwood Hotel.  Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, painting kaleidoscopic patterns on the marble floor. A symphony of soft clinking – champagne flutes, ice in glasses, silverware against china – filled the air, a soundtrack to the effortless elegance that was Amelia's domain. She paused, her gaze sweeping over the scene: honeymooners blushing under the chandeliers, business executives barking orders into their phones, and a group of elderly ladies gossiping over steaming cups of tea. A symphony of human needs, desires, and anxieties – all neatly orchestrated by Amelia, The Grand Blackwood's concierge extraordinaire. 


But this morning, something was amiss. 

The air hummed with an unusual tension, a barely perceptible prickle that ran beneath the surface of normalcy. A new arrival had just checked in, and his aura was…unsettling.  His eyes, dark and fathomless, seemed to absorb the light around him, leaving Amelia with a chilling sense of foreboding. This wasn't your average businessman or vacationer seeking respite. Something about this guest felt different, dangerous even, and Amelia knew her carefully curated world was on the verge of being irrevocably altered.
