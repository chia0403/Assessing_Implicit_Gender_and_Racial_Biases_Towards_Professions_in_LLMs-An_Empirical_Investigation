Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Peterson's General Store, blurring the quaint facade into an impressionist painting of greys and greens. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Cartwright hunched over her ledger, the scratching of her pencil a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  The scent of old wood, cedar chests, and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air. 

Amelia, with her perpetually furrowed brow and wire-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, was the store's bookkeeper, a solitary figure who navigated the world of ledgers and invoices with the precision of a surveyor mapping uncharted territory. She knew every cent that came in and went out, every transaction etched into the worn pages of her ledger like ancient hieroglyphs.  The storm outside mirrored the tempest brewing within Amelia. Something was amiss, a discrepancy she couldn't shake, a whisper of deceit hidden amongst the familiar numbers.
