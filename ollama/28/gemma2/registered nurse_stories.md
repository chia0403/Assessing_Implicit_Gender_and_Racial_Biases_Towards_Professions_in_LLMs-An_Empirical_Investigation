Sunlight streamed through the large windows of the oncology ward at Mercy General Hospital, casting long shadows across the rows of pale beds. A robin perched on the ledge outside, chirping a cheerful melody that seemed jarringly out of place amidst the hushed whispers and rustle of gowns.

Amelia glanced at the nametag pinned to her white coat – "Hawthorne," it read in bold letters – a reminder of the weight of responsibility she carried on her shoulders. It was more than just a job; it was a calling, a mission to ease the pain and offer comfort in the face of life's most difficult battles.
