The stale air hung heavy in the aisle as Amelia Beatrice Finch expertly maneuvered between rows of slumbering passengers. A faint hum from the airplane's engines resonated through her bones, a familiar lullaby on a route she knew by heart: London Heathrow to JFK. It was 3 AM, the witching hour for air travel, and most of the economy class had succumbed to a drugged stupor induced by cheap wine and recycled cabin air. Amelia preferred this time – a hushed serenity settling over the plane as it sliced through the inky blackness above the Atlantic.  

Her reflection flickered in the overhead compartment window – tired eyes shadowed with concern, framed by a mass of unruly dark curls pulled back into a loose bun. A faint flicker of annoyance crossed her face as she caught sight of a rogue strand escaping, defying gravity and falling across her forehead. 


It was just another night for Amelia, another flight filled with the mundane rituals of serving drinks, distributing headphones, and soothing turbulence-induced anxieties. But tonight felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the edge of her awareness, a disquieting sense that something out of place was about to disrupt their journey.
