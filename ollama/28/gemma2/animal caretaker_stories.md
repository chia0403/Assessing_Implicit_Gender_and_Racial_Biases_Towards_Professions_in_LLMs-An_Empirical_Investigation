The sun was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dew-kissed grass of Willow Creek Sanctuary.  Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, her worn brown boots squelching on the damp earth, stretched and yawned as she surveyed the sprawling landscape. Her breath caught in her throat; a lone fox cub whimpered softly from its makeshift nest beneath a towering oak. A familiar pang tugged at Eleanor's heart. 

Willow Creek wasn't just her job - it was her sanctuary, a haven for injured and abandoned creatures where she poured every ounce of her love and expertise into their care. But lately, the sanctuary felt heavier than usual, burdened by the silence of missing voices â€“ the comforting chatter of rescued parrots, the playful squeaks of guinea pigs, the gentle moos of orphaned calves. A recent outbreak of a strange illness had swept through the animals, leaving empty cages and echoing halls in its wake. 


Eleanor, her brow creased with worry, knelt beside the fox cub, its tiny paws trembling against her outstretched hand. "Don't you worry, little one," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "We'll get through this. We always do."
