The cobblestones of Old Quarter were slick with a recent drizzle, mirroring the sheen of sweat beading on Seraphina Thornwoodâ€™s brow. The air hung thick with the smell of brine and fish from the harbor nearby, mingling with the sweet tang of overripe fruit from stalls lining the narrow streets. Above, the sky was a bruised purple, promising a storm that would rival the turmoil brewing within the city walls. 

Seraphina tugged her worn leather jerkin tighter, trying to ignore the chill that seeped through despite the layers. She adjusted the weight of her sword on her hip, its familiar heft a comfort in this increasingly unsettling world. As Head Guard of Old Quarter, she was responsible for the safety of hundreds, but tonight, even the well-worn paths felt treacherous, every shadow holding a potential threat. 


The rhythmic clang of the city bell resonated through the air, signaling the curfew. Most citizens had retreated indoors, leaving Seraphina to patrol the deserted streets alone, her lantern casting an unsteady light on the grime and secrets hidden beneath the cobblestones.
