The stale scent of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, mingling with the damp chill that always seemed to permeate the office. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her brown hair pulled back in a tight braid that refused to escape its confines even after an eight-hour shift, stared at the paperwork strewn across her desk. It was 6:35 PM, twenty minutes past closing time, and she was still wrestling with case files for the dozen parolees under her supervision.  

Ellie worked in the sprawling, dimly lit Probation Department of Seattle's King County courthouse. It wasn’t glamorous; the fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly, the beige walls were stained with years of spilled coffee and unidentifiable stains, and the air conditioning perpetually battled a losing war against the summer heat. But despite its less-than-appealing aesthetic, Ellie found solace in the rhythm of her work. She felt a deep responsibility to help those struggling to navigate the murky waters of reintegration after serving their sentences. 


The clanging sound of the heavy metal door resonating through the silent hallway startled her. A figure loomed at the doorway, backlit by the dim streetlight filtering through the grimy windows. It was late. Too late. Ellie braced herself for another night of unexpected visits and last-minute paperwork requests. This time, though, she couldn't shake the feeling that this visit would be different. Something about the figure’s hesitant step and the way their shoulders seemed to hunch under the weight of a heavy secret sent a shiver down her spine.
