The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Evelyn Albright's cluttered office. Papers spilled from overflowing file drawers, threatening to engulf stray crayons and half-finished coloring books.  Through the rain-streaked window, the grey November sky mirrored the somber mood in her heart.  Evelyn, usually a beacon of calm amidst the storm of childhood anxieties, felt adrift. She'd been called into yet another crisis meeting, this time regarding a student who had threatened violence. The familiar knot of dread tightened in her stomach. 

She ran a hand over the worn surface of her desk, remembering its previous occupants – therapists, guidance counselors, even a temporary social worker who'd only lasted two weeks before succumbing to the emotional drain. This small office at Willow Creek Elementary had become a graveyard for good intentions.  It wasn't just the caseload; it was the feeling that she wasn't making a dent in the larger tide of mental health struggles engulfing her young students. They came with their backpacks packed full of anxieties, traumas, and a gnawing loneliness that echoed through the sterile hallways of the school. 


Evelyn took a deep breath, attempting to center herself.  She knew she couldn’t afford to crumble now. There were still children who needed her, who depended on her for a semblance of hope in a world that often felt too dark and unforgiving.  Her gaze fell upon a half-finished drawing tucked under a stack of files: a brightly colored sun with rays reaching out like hopeful arms. It was a reminder that even in the darkest storms, there was always light waiting to break through.
