The fluorescent lights hummed over Beatrice “Bea” Clementine’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of crumpled receipts and wadded up 1099 forms that threatened to engulf her desk. Tax season was in full swing, a frenzy of numbers, deductions, and panicked phone calls that left Bea feeling perpetually drained. Her small office, tucked away in a strip mall on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa, reeked faintly of stale coffee and desperation – a perfect reflection of the state of her clients' finances. 


Bea herself was a whirlwind of efficiency. A sharp woman with hair pulled back in a tight bun and glasses perpetually perched on her nose, she navigated the labyrinthine world of tax law with the ease of a chess grandmaster. But even Bea felt a twinge of pity for some of her clients – struggling single mothers, elderly couples living on fixed incomes, small business owners clinging to hope. Their stories painted a stark picture of life outside her tidy office walls, a reminder that numbers weren't just abstract figures; they represented real people and their dreams.
