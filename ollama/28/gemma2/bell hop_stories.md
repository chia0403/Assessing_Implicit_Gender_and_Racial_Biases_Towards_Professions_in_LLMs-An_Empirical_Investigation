The Grand Magnolia Hotel shimmered under the humid August sun. Its white façade, once pristine, now bore the etchings of time –  faded gold trim around the arched doorways and the faint outline of where a gargoyle's wing had succumbed to decades of relentless weather. The air hung thick with the scent of magnolia blossoms and forgotten dreams, a perfume peculiar to grand old hotels clinging desperately to their past glories.

Within its echoing halls, amidst polished mahogany and threadbare carpets, worked Thaddeus “Tad” Winthrop Bellweather III, bellhop extraordinaire. Tad wasn’t born into the life of service; his aristocratic lineage whispered tales of ancestral wealth and sprawling estates in more prosperous eras. But fate, it seemed, had other plans. A series of unfortunate events – a disastrous inheritance dispute, a gambling scandal involving a prized poodle named Duchess – had landed him here, amongst the forgotten luggage and hushed whispers of long-stay residents. 


Tad carried himself with a stoic air, his once neatly pressed uniform now bearing the faint stains of spilled cocktails and hurried journeys between rooms. His eyes, however, held a spark – a flicker of longing for something more, a yearning to escape the confines of the Grand Magnolia’s gilded cage.
