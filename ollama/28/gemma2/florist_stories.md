The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's apron like a second skin. Her fingers, stained with pollen from countless roses and dusted with the remnants of dried lavender, delicately arranged a bouquet of blushing peonies in a crystal vase. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Hawthorne's Blooms," casting long shadows across the mismatched collection of vintage furniture and overflowing flower boxes that cluttered her shop. The air hummed with a quiet energy, the sort that existed in places where life bloomed and wilted in equal measure. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek were bustling with activity, but inside Hawthorne's Blooms, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. 

Amelia Rose was used to it.  The shop, inherited from her grandmother, had been a sanctuary for her since she was a child, a place where the mundane anxieties of life melted away beneath the weight of fragrant blossoms and vibrant colors. Today, however, even the comforting familiarity couldn't quite mask the tension knotting in Amelia Roseâ€™s stomach. A storm was brewing both outside and within the walls of her beloved shop.
