Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing within her own mind. The sterile white walls, usually comforting in their neutrality, seemed to press in on her today, suffocating any semblance of peace. Outside, the city lights blurred into a watercolor mess, reflecting the chaos that had become her life since her husband’s sudden death six months ago.

Eleanor was renowned in her field for her calm demeanor and incisive insights, guiding her patients through their darkest hours with unwavering empathy. Yet, she felt utterly adrift now, grappling with grief that threatened to consume her whole. Her sessions were becoming a struggle, her own well-being hanging precariously by a thread.

Her office, perched on the tenth floor of a high-rise overlooking the bustling heart of Chicago, was normally a sanctuary, a place where she could shed the weight of the world and focus on helping others. But today, it felt more like a prison, the city’s incessant hum a painful reminder of her solitude. 


The sound of a phone ringing pierced through the gloom, snapping Eleanor back to reality. It was probably another frantic patient seeking solace from their own demons, a familiar plea that once filled her with purpose now left her feeling hollow.  She took a deep breath, willing herself to rise above the maelstrom within, and reached for the receiver.
