The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear in the cramped emergency room. Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted her surgical mask, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The relentless wail of a heart monitor punctuated the hushed murmurs of nurses rushing between beds. A young woman lay pale and still on the gurney before her, a gash across her forehead stark against the white sheets. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock – 3:17 AM. This was usually the quiet time, the lull between the late-night shift’s frenzy and the morning chaos. But tonight, the stillness felt different, heavy with an unspoken tension. A storm raged outside, wind whipping against the windows and rain lashing down in sheets. 

Eleanor knew this night wouldn't be like any other. She could feel it in her bones, a premonition as unsettling as the patient’s unblinking eyes.  


**Setting:**

A small, rural emergency room nestled in the heart of Maine.
