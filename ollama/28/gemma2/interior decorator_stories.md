The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint aroma of stale cigarettes and desperation. Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Beaumont surveyed the scene before her: a dusty Victorian mansion on the precipice of decay. Sunlight streamed through grimy windows, illuminating cobwebs that draped like macabre tapestries and peeling wallpaper that revealed faded floral patterns. This wasn't the usual chic penthouse or modern townhouse Ellie was accustomed to transforming. This was...different.

Ellie adjusted her designer sunglasses, their sleek frames doing little to disguise the apprehension gnawing at her. She hadn't expected this when she answered the call from the enigmatic Mr. Alistair Thorne. He'd promised a "unique project," and "creative freedom." Now, standing in the heart of his crumbling estate, Ellie wasn't sure if he meant dilapidated or deeply unsettling.

Outside, the wind whispered through the overgrown rose bushes, their thorns like grasping fingers against the aged stone. It was the kind of place where secrets festered, where shadows held more substance than light. 


Ellie took a deep breath and smoothed down her crisp linen blouse. "Well," she murmured to herself, "time to dust off my creativity."  She wasn't sure what awaited her within these crumbling walls, but Ellie Beatrice Beaumont was a woman of action, not fear. She wouldn't let this Victorian behemoth break her spirit. It would be transformed, even if it took every ounce of her being.
