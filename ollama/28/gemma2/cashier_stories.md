The fluorescent hum above buzzed like a hive of agitated bees, casting a sterile glow over the cluttered aisles of "Everything's A Dollar," a discount haven in the heart of Little Elm, Texas. 

Behind the dusty glass counter, Beatrice Penelope Buttercup sighed, her breath fogging the air momentarily.  It was Tuesday afternoon, and the usual slow drizzle of customers had morphed into a full-blown downpour. Every register line snaked out like a greasy, fluorescent serpent. Bea watched a particularly agitated woman in a purple tracksuit try to barter for a discounted pack of ramen with the assistant manager, a teenager named Jimmy who looked about as thrilled as she felt.

Bea was starting to regret her decision to work the afternoon shift. Maybe if she’d just stayed home and finally tackled that pile of laundry…  But then again, what else would she do? Sit around watching reruns of "Law & Order: SVU" in her faded floral pajamas? 


The bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of a new customer. Bea plastered a smile on her face as she straightened a loose strand of auburn hair, hoping this wouldn't be another negotiation over the price of discounted bath towels.
