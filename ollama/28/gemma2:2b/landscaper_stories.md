The early morning sun, a pale yellow smear through the thickening haze of smog, struggled to pierce the dense canopy of leaves overhead.  Elias Thorne, known throughout his little corner of Brooklyn as "Eli" - a moniker earned after years of wielding clippers with reckless abandon and creating wilder landscapes than any other landscaper in the five boroughs - crouched beneath the gnarled branches of a sycamore, his brow creased with concentration.  The air was thick with the promise of rain; a downpour, if it came as expected, would wash away weeks' worth of sweat and grime from the back alleys, his worn-out boots, and the stubborn weeds that clung stubbornly to the cracked pavement like moss on old bark.  His hands were rough against the cool bark of the sycamore, tracing the outline of a leaf he'd been studying with meticulous care.  He was trying to create something beautiful - a haven for the birds, a refuge from the concrete jungle, even if his own heart remained buried deep within it. 


**Setting:** Brooklyn, New York City. A decaying yet vibrant neighborhood on the cusp of gentrification where green spaces are often hard to come by and urban renewal comes in the form of graffiti-covered walls and overgrown vines.
