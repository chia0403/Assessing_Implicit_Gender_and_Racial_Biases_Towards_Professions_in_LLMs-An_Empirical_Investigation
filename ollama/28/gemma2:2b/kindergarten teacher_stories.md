## The Whispering Classroom

**Setting:** A quaint, historic one-room schoolhouse in a sleepy New England town nestled amongst rolling green hills.  The building has a timeless elegance – exposed brick walls, stained glass windows, and worn wooden desks clustered around the center of the room. Sunlight streams through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

**Character:** Miss Evelyn Thorne, affectionately known as "Auntie Eve" by her students, is a kindergarten teacher who breathes life into every lesson with her infectious enthusiasm and endless tales from childhood.  She's seen it all, from messy art projects to first-time steps on the playground – each year bringing fresh memories that linger in the creaky old walls of the schoolhouse. 

**Opening:** The morning air was crisp, carrying a hint of autumn leaves as Miss Evelyn Thorne opened the classroom door to greet her charges.  "Good morning, my little explorers!" she chirped, her smile widening with an air of joyful anticipation.  "Today we'll be building our very own miniature worlds! I have a feeling this might just be one of your most adventurous days yet." 


The children, buzzing with excitement and clad in bright, mismatched clothes, burst through the doors like a flock of feathered butterflies. Their laughter mingled with the clatter of small feet as they scrambled onto their designated spots around the large wooden table that served as the classroom's centerpiece. A hush fell over the group as Miss Evelyn unveiled a map spread out on the table, each corner marked with colorful markers and miniature trees.  "Now," she announced, her eyes twinkling, "Who wants to be the architect of this very special world?"
