The wind whipped across the craggy cliffs, carrying with it the scent of salt and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead.  Rain lashed down on Amelia "Amy" Thorne's canvas, an unforgiving sheet she had set out in a makeshift studio overlooking the churning grey sea. The storm raged around her, mirroring the tumultuous storm raging within her own heart. 

Amy was a sculptor, but lately, the rough hewn stone and clay had felt as foreign as a forgotten language. Her hands, usually steady and sure, trembled on the palette before her.  For weeks, she'd been struggling to create something truly expressive, something that captured the raw emotion of this life-changing change in her small coastal town. The once familiar faces had begun to blur, their lives merging with the ever-present grey sky. 


The wind howled a tune as Amy stared at the canvas. She needed more than just storm clouds and crashing waves; she yearned for something real, something that pulsed with life. Her eyes drifted towards the crashing waves below, searching for inspiration amongst the chaos.
