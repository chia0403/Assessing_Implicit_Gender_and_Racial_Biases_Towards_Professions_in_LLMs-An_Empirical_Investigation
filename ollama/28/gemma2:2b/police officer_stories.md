Rain lashed against the window of Officer Amelia Thorneâ€™s office, mirroring the turmoil within her chest. Outside, Seattle was a symphony of grey; the sky choked on itself, its weeping mimicking her own anxiety. She stared at the file in front of her, each photo of the victim's face, each detail of the crime scene, each word of the police report, like a brick thrown against the dam of her sanity. 

Amelia was known for two things: her piercing gaze and unwavering dedication to justice. But today, even her years of experience felt inadequate, as she navigated the murky waters of this case - the murder of Elias Thorne, her father.  The police station was stiflingly quiet, the air thick with a lingering scent of old coffee and despair. 

**Setting:** A small, cluttered office in the Seattle Police Department's precinct. The walls were painted the blandest shade of blue imaginable, and the only splashes of colour came from Amelia's neatly stacked file folders, each labelled with its corresponding case. 
**Main Character:** Amelia Thorne, a seasoned police officer known for her sharp intellect and unwavering commitment to justice, yet struggling with the weight of an unsolved murder case that threatens to unravel everything she holds dear.
