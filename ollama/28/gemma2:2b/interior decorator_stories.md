## The Scent of Dust Mists

Rain drummed a constant rhythm against the stained glass windows of the grand Victorian mansion, its symphony muted by the hushed whispers of old secrets trapped within the walls. Eleanor Beaumont, her emerald eyes mirroring the storm brewing outside, surveyed the chaos.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through grimy panes, revealing intricate carvings on a mahogany chest she'd just finished restoring. 

Eleanor was known for breathing life back into forgotten spaces, coaxing beauty from the mundane. Her clients sought her out, drawn to her ability to transform a room, even a house, into a canvas of warmth and grace.  But this mansion... this one felt different. It thrummed with an undercurrent of melancholy, like ghosts lingered in its cavernous halls. 

The scent of lavender wax mingled with the dampness clinging to the air, creating a thick tapestry woven with both serenity and sorrow.  She could almost hear the echoes of laughter from years gone by, or perhaps just the rustle of forgotten linens. Eleanor took a deep breath, her fingers tightening around the worn leather handle of a paintbrush. This wasn't just about furniture; this was about understanding the spirit of a place, before it surrendered to time and decay.  Tonight, she would listen to its whispers.
