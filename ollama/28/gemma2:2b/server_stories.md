The clattering of dishes against porcelain plates was Amelia "Amy" Rose's lullaby. The hum of conversation, rising with each clinking glass and boisterous laugh, was her soundtrack to a life spent in the service industry. It wasn’t the most glamorous occupation, but for Amy, serving at “The Harborside” – a charming yet slightly worn waterfront restaurant where every table had a view of the shimmering bay – was all she knew. 

Tonight, a storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Amy's heart.  She hadn't dared to speak about it with her co-workers, their lives perpetually spinning on a tightrope between tips and tears. Tonight, the usual chaos felt amplified, each gust of wind sending shivers down her spine as she hovered amidst the tables, tending to a boisterous birthday party for a particularly demanding man known only as Mr. Blackwood.  Amy’s gaze drifted towards the storm-tossed ocean, its turbulent waves mirroring the unease in her stomach - a turmoil that promised more than just spilled drinks and frayed tablecloths.
