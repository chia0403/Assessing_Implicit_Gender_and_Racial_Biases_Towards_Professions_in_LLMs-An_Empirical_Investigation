The rain hammered against the glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the cityscape into a watercolor wash of greys and blues. It was almost poetic, considering the storm raging inside her. The phone on her desk buzzed, an insistent, jarring chime. It was Mrs. Peters again, the one with the recurring nightmares, the ones that made the neighbours whisper about her strange dreams of flying through the city's night sky, clinging to a single, flickering streetlamp. 

Eleanor sighed. Another sleepless night for Mrs. Peters, and yet another layer of emotional fatigue weighing down on her own. The constant cycle of unraveling anxieties and buried trauma was taking its toll. As she glanced at the clock, its blinking red light seemed mockingly accusatory, mirroring the feeling in her chest. "Just one more session," she muttered, a familiar pang of resignation gripping her heart.  

The setting is that of Eleanor Vance’s small practice nestled on the edge of a bustling city. The once-cozy office now felt like an echo chamber of unvoiced fears and suppressed dreams – its faded floral wallpaper struggling to hold against the emotional pressure emanating from the woman in the waiting room.
