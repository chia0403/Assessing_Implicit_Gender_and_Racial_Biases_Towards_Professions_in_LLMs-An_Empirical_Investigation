The moon hung like a bruised plum in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobbled streets of Veridia. Its pale light barely pierced the haze that clung to the city walls, making everything look both ghostly and strangely dreamlike.  Garion Blackwood, sworn protector of the Grand Temple and tonight's lone watchtower sentinel, shivered despite the warm cloak slung over his shoulders.  A biting wind whipped through the narrow streets, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something else – a faint, metallic tang that pricked at Garion’s nostrils. It was enough to set his hackles up; tonight felt different, charged with an undercurrent of unease he couldn't quite place.  

Garion surveyed the city from his perch atop the watchtower. The Temple of Everflame stood silhouetted against the moon's dim glow, its ornate carvings seeming to mock him with their beauty, a stark contrast to the city's decaying edges.  Veridia was a bustling city – at least it had been for centuries, before whispers of a plague swept through its populace, leaving its streets eerily deserted and its citizens shrouded in fear. Tonight felt like a turning point. The silence felt heavy, almost tangible, punctuated only by the distant groan of the wind and the creaking of old bones beneath his feet.
