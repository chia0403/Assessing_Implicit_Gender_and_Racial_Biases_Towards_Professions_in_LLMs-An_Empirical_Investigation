The fluorescent hum of the supermarket lights buzzed like a swarm of agitated bees in Evelyn's ears. Her fingers nervously tapped against the register keypad as she scanned another bag of frozen lasagna – an odd choice for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon, even by her standards. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale bread and overripe bananas, a perfume that usually calmed her nerves, but today it felt suffocating, mirroring the knot in her stomach. 

Evelyn's name was pronounced "E-lie-ven," which she’d always found amusingly ironic for someone so clumsy at life. She worked as a cashier at “Best Value Grocer,” a small chain store tucked away on a side street in a perpetually gray, forgotten part of the city. It wasn't glamorous; her colleagues were mostly middle-aged and weary, the customers largely indifferent shoppers looking to avoid a human confrontation. But to Evelyn, it held a strange beauty – a quiet, routine existence that allowed her to blend into the background, almost unnoticed.

Yet tonight felt different. Tonight, the air thrummed with an unspoken tension that clung to the aisles like a wet blanket.  Evelyn scanned a carton of milk as Mrs. Henderson, the store's grumpy manager, walked past with the unmistakable air of imminent judgement. "Evelyn," he rumbled, his voice rough and gravelly as if trying to dislodge decades of dust from his throat. “You haven’t filled out that form yet."  He gestured towards a stack of paperwork on her register, each sheet an unwelcome reminder of another deadline she hadn't quite met.
