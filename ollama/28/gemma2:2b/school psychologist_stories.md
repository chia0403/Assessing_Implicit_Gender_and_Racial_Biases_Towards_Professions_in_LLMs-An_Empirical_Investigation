Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Hayes' office at Willow Creek High School, blurring the world outside into a watercolour mess of grays and greens.  Inside, her mahogany desk creaked softly in rhythm with the storm, its surface cluttered with stacks of reports and sticky notes bearing scrawled anxieties. The air was thick with an odd blend of teenage angst and peppermint oil – the lingering scent of another student's anxiety meltdown. Her own thoughts drifted away from the pile of forms waiting for attention to something far more personal: her late husband's birthday.  

Eleanor Hayes, a school psychologist who had spent years trying to understand the tangled mess of adolescent minds, felt adrift in her own. The only light flickered from a single desk lamp casting long, skeletal shadows on the walls.  The door creaked open with an almost imperceptible rustle. In walked Liam, his face etched with worry and shoulders slumped under the weight of another student's crisis. "Mrs. Hayes," he began, his voice tight. “I don't know what to do."
