The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia "Amy" Sterling's head, casting an almost unsettling blue glow on the faces in her chair.  She had always liked this office – it was clean, modern, and felt like a refuge from the chaos of the city outside.  But today, even the sterile white walls seemed to press against Amy's chest, each tick of the clock in the corner mirroring the escalating tension in the room.

He was a nervous wreck, struggling to keep his mouth firmly shut as he spoke in hushed whispers.

The city felt miles away when she stepped behind this door, each chair and gleaming instrument a silent testament to her years of service and expertise.  But even in this haven, Amy found herself battling an overwhelming sense of unease as she gazed at the man sitting before her: a young man named Ethan, his face etched with worry lines far too deep for someone barely out of his teens.
