The wind bit at Elias Thorne's face, whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient redwoods that clawed at the unforgiving sky.  He was crouched low in the shadow of one such behemoth, his worn boots leaving black prints on the damp earth floor beneath him. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and the earthy musk of decaying leaves – a smell he'd known intimately since childhood. He was a man forged by this forest, his weathered hands stained brown from years spent wrestling trees to submission. Elias Thorne, woodsman, logger, husband, father – the weight of these roles sat heavy on him as he checked his axe for its usual sharp edge. 

The year was 1987. The air in the Pacific Northwest held an autumnal chill that seeped deeper than winter's icy grip.  The forest floor, a patchwork of moss and decay, yielded to Elias' boots as he approached the clearing. Here, amidst the towering redwoods and their gnarled roots, lay his latest work – the felled timber destined for the sawmill just beyond the treeline. 

His thoughts, however, were elsewhere. He was thinking of Martha, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at him from the porch swing, a silent plea for him to be careful etched on her face. This wasn't like her - always bright, always ready with a smile and a warm cup of tea. The forest held its breath in this moment too, waiting for Elias’ every move.
