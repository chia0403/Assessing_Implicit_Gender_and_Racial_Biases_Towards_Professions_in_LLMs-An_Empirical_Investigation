Rain lashed against the cracked windshield of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carter's ambulance, blurring the already-dim cityscape of New Orleans into streaks of color and shadow.  The air hung heavy with humidity, thick with the scent of damp earth, and something vaguely metallic that Amy couldn't quite place. Her heart pounded in her chest, a drum against her ribs, as she navigated through the flooded streets, their usual charm replaced by an unsettling sense of urgency. Tonight felt different – like the city itself was holding its breath. 

The address on her scanner displayed a rundown apartment complex, nestled between a pawn shop that hummed with late-night activity and a gas station whose neon sign cast a sickly green glow over the street.  The flashing red light in her rig's dashboard reflected off Amy’s anxious eyes as she scanned the street for any movement – for any clue about the reason behind the frantic 911 call. The air, thick with the scent of decay and rain, seemed to whisper a secret, one that made Amy feel deeply uneasy.  

Amy was no stranger to danger, but tonight felt different.  Tonight, the city whispered not just secrets, but a feeling of something…imminent.
