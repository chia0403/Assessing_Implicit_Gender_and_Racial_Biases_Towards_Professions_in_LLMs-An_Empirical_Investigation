## The Nightingale's Lament

**Setting:**  St. Agnes Hospital, late 1950s, Chicago

The humid air hung heavy over the bustling city, clinging to the steel-and-brick facade of St. Agnes hospital like an unwelcome guest. Rain lashed against the windows, casting fleeting shadows across the sterile white walls of the emergency room where **Evelyn Thorne**, RN, worked tirelessly. Her worn leather satchel lay beside her on the stainless steel table – a repository for countless pills and syringes, each one a tiny testament to life’s fragility. Evelyn was no stranger to the grim symphony of medical emergencies playing out around her, but tonight, a discordant note echoed through the chaos - the melody of fear, of loss, of a whispered hope that never quite materialized.  

The emergency room doors swung open, ushering in another storm of humanity: a young man, his face a mask of pain and confusion, clutching a bloodied handkerchief. Evelyn’s practiced gaze settled on him – the frantic beat of her pulse matching the rhythm of his shallow breaths. This was no ordinary case; something about the way his eyes darted around the room, searching for solace amidst the turmoil, sent a shiver down her spine.
