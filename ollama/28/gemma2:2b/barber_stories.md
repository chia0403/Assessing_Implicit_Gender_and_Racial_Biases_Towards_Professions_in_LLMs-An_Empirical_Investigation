The steam from the old boiler hissed in the air like ghosts, leaving wispy trails that danced with the flickering glow of the gaslights outside. The scent of sawdust mingled with lavender and cologne as Theodore "Theo" Cartwright, owner of the "Cut Above Barber Shop," expertly honed his curved razor over a worn leather strop. 

The year was 1929, and the air in New Orleans buzzed with an intoxicating blend of jazz, prosperity, and a quiet simmering undercurrent of tension. Prohibition ran its course like spilled bourbon; speakeasies overflowed, their doors guarded by men who whispered more than they spoke. Theo knew this city better than he knew his own hands. He'd learned the language of swagger in the smoky air of the bars, and the subtle shift in a customer's posture that indicated trouble before it even came to words. 

Theo had a reputation as good with shears as with people; his clientele were drawn from the city’s elite and its underbelly – from dapper gents who wanted a new cut for their upcoming tango nights to men like old Johnny “Black Hand” Mahoney, whose past was as murky as the Bayou. Theo understood that a man's confidence was tied to his appearance, just as it was tied to his story, and he was always ready with a trim, a shave, or a listening ear – depending on which side of the razor the customer chose to swing.
