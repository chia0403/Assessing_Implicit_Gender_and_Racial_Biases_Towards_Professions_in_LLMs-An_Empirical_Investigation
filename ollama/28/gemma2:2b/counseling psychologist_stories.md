Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Croft's office, mimicking the tumultuous emotions swirling within her own chest. Outside, the world was in grey, but inside, the air crackled with the familiar scent of burnt coffee and old paper, a comforting yet melancholic aroma that always clung to her days spent amongst troubled souls.  She took a deep breath, her mind replaying the last few hours, each scene a flash of color in the otherwise monochrome backdrop of her life.

For Amelia, it was more than just counseling; it was navigating the labyrinthine corridors of human despair, attempting to weave a path back towards understanding and hope for those who were lost. The weight of countless lives weighed down on her shoulders as she started writing notes – each one a tiny rebellion against the tide of helplessness that threatened to drown her in the endless night.  The setting was a quaint private practice office nestled in the heart of Boston, its warm ambiance a stark contrast to the icy grip of the storm raging outside.
