## Story Opening:

**Setting:** The dusty corner of "The Wandering Lantern," a dimly lit dive bar in the heart of Portland's Chinatown. 

**Main Character:**  Name: **Elias Kairos**. He's lean and wiry, with eyes that hold the weight of too many stories. His worn, leather apron hangs loosely around his frame like a faded shroud as he cleans glasses at The Lantern's grimy counter, humming a melancholic blues tune under his breath. 

**Opening:** 

The rain hammered against the windows, each drop echoing like tiny fists against glass. Elias ran a hand through his unruly black hair, feeling the sting of the chill that seeped into the worn wood floorboards. He glanced at the clock on the wall – 3:17 am. Another shift down, another round of weary souls and faded dreams washed over him by the steady rhythm of the rain. 

He caught a flicker of movement in the corner of his eye. A woman, clad in a sleek black coat that clung to her form like a second skin, sat hunched on one of the bar stools. Her face was obscured by the shadows, but he could see the sharp edges of her jaw and the way her lips tightened when she spoke. Elias knew this look – the kind that whispered of secrets hidden beneath layers of composure. 

"Whiskey," she said in a voice as cold as the steel countertop.  "The one with the orange peel." 
 
The bar was quiet, save for the clinking of ice and the murmur of conversations veiled behind thick smoke rings. Elias knew this woman wouldn't leave until she had her drink – or until Elias knew what she wanted.
