The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Sinclair's head like a chorus of anxious buzzing bees. The clinic was a symphony of hushed whispers, rhythmic beeps from machines in the corner, and the occasional guttural groan of an exhausted patient. It felt less like a sterile sanctuary and more like a battlefield where hope was a casualty of routine. Today's battleground was Room 302. 

Amy adjusted her thick black gloves, feeling a familiar pang of unease as she prepared to meet the newest resident -  a young woman named Evelyn Miller whose anxieties seemed to have seeped into the very floorboards. Amy knew this particular anxiety well; it was the kind that clung to you like a damp sheet on a cold morning. The kind that made even the simplest tasks, like drawing blood, feel monumental. 

The setting was her hometown clinic in rural Ohio, nestled between rolling fields of corn and whispering shadows of an ancient forest. A place where life moved at its own pace, punctuated by long winters and short summers. Amy had grown up here, learning the art of patience under the watchful eyes of Mrs. Evans, her mentor and a master of calming anxieties with a warm smile and a gentle touch. But even she couldn't conquer the weight of Evelyn’s apprehension that hung thick as the humidity of a summer afternoon. 


The door to Room 302 creaked open, releasing a wave of cool evening air laden with a scent of peppermint – a telltale sign of a hurried goodbye from Evelyn's mother. Amy waited patiently, letting the weight of unspoken anxieties settle in her chest like a forgotten storm cloud.
