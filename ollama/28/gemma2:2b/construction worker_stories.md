The rusty clang of metal on metal was an almost hypnotic soundtrack to Thomas "Tommy" O'Connell's life. The sun beat down mercilessly upon the steel skeleton of the new skyscraper in the heart of Chicago, its progress stark against the muted gray clouds that seemed determined to engulf the city entirely. As Tommy swung his powerful hammer, he felt a familiar sense of purpose, of making something tangible out of nothing.  The air hung thick with sweat and the scent of welding fumes, but Tommy didn't mind. He was building something bigger than himself, something to last generations. 

His boots crunched on the concrete platform as he walked towards the foreman, a burly man named Sal, his voice as gruff as the wind in Chicago's canyons.  "Tommy," Sal barked, his eyes narrowed, "We got a problem. Another crane just went down." The air crackled with tension.
