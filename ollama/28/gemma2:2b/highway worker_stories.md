The dust devils danced across the endless expanse of asphalt, swirling miniature tornadoes in a sea of sunbaked concrete.  A heat shimmered off the highway, turning it into an undulating mirage that reflected the harsh glare of the midday sun. It was one such day, and Elias “Elroy” Carter wasn’t even sure if he remembered what shade of sweat actually covered his forehead anymore - just layers upon layers of it. 

He adjusted the brim of his battered hat, pushing back a stray strand of greasy blond hair as a low rumble echoed from the distance. Another wave rolled over the asphalt expanse, this time carrying the promise of change, of an imminent arrival in the form of another storm.  The wind whipped through Elroy’s weathered clothes, carrying with it the scent of freshly-cut grass and something else he couldn't quite place - diesel fumes and a faint sweetness that reminded him of his grandma's apple pie.


Elroy was one of those people who thrived in the chaos, in the constant hum of industry and change that made up the rhythm of life on the highway.  His job wasn’t glamorous; it was grueling, repetitive work. But for Elroy, there was a quiet kind of satisfaction in the knowledge he played a vital role in keeping the wheels of this vast country turning. 

The storm rolled in with a fury that would have left most people cowering in fear.  But not Elroy. His weathered face, creased like the map he’d carried since childhood, showed only an unreadable expression as he stood firm against the onslaught of wind and rain, his trusty toolbox clenched tightly in his calloused hand.
