The air in the Grand Astoria Hotel hummed with a subtle tension that only came from a hundred whispered anxieties and hushed phone calls.  Lily "Lillie" Bellweather, petite and precise with her floral-print blouse, sat behind the reception desk like a quiet sentinel guarding the secrets of those who entered and left its doors. She'd been the receptionist here for five years, her smile as familiar to every guest and employee alike as the worn carpet beneath her feet. 

Today was unlike any other day. A storm had rolled in overnight, turning the usually pristine lobby into a swirling kaleidoscope of rain and wind, blurring the already faded marble of the entrance way into an abstract mess. The usual bustling energy of the hotel, with its guests, staff, and occasional tour group, had been replaced by an unsettling quiet that amplified each rustle of leaves against the glass windows. 
 
A single, ornate door stood ajar at the far end of the lobby -  the only visible indication of any kind of guest arrival other than the faint hum of a lone air conditioning unit struggling to fight off the coming night's chill. Lillie's eyes flickered towards it, her gaze lingering on the shadow cast by the door as it swung slightly in the wind, and a wave of unease washed over her.
