## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Plaza Grand Hotel, each drop blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. Inside, amidst the swirling storm and the murmur of hushed whispers between guests, stood Elroy "Ellie" Montgomery, his signature green beret tilted low over his brow, a worn canvas bag clutched tight in one hand.  He was a beacon of stoicism, even against the chaotic symphony that echoed around him - the clattering of silverware, the echoing footsteps of weary travelers, the hum of the ancient elevator. Ellie's world was a tapestry of hushed hallways, creaking floors, and the scent of stale cigarettes and lavender soap lingering in every room he cleaned.

**Setting:** The Plaza Grand Hotel. A grand dame of the late 1920s, the hotel boasted lavish suites, opulent ballrooms, and a silent history etched into its marble corridors and stained-glass windows. But like all grand things, it held secrets tucked away in its shadows – whispers of scandals, hushed confessions made under the cloak of moonlight, and promises whispered during stolen moments with a silver cigarette case. Ellie's job was to clean up the remnants of these fleeting moments, to keep the hotel’s façade pristine even as the city around it crumbled down around them. 


**Main Character:** Elroy "Ellie" Montgomery
