## Opening: 

The scent of burnt coffee clung to the air like an unwelcome guest in Amelia Sterling's office.  Rain lashed against the windows of the high-rise building, mimicking the turmoil churning inside her as she reviewed another batch of legal documents for Mr. Henderson's contentious divorce case. This wasn't just any divorce – it involved a tech mogul and his estranged wife, both billionaires with a history more complicated than a tangled web of software code. Amelia felt like a fly caught in a spiderweb; every movement only tightened the suffocating grip of this case on her. 

The only break from the storm outside came from the quiet hum of the old, clunky computer fan struggling against the endless torrent of files – and Amelia's own dwindling sanity.  She was supposed to be an oasis of order in this whirlwind of legal chaos, but even she felt like a rogue wave threatening to swallow her whole.
