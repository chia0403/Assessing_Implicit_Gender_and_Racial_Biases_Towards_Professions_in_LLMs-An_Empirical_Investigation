The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air like a forgotten dream.  Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood, her apron stained with more than just grease from years spent slinging dishes at The Rusty Kettle, surveyed the carnage she'd wrought within the kitchen. It wasn't supposed to be this way; tonight was the annual town festival and Ellie had poured every ounce of her skill – and some sanity-saving amounts of whiskey – into perfecting the famous apple cobbler for the judges’ table. 

The festival itself was a tapestry of chaos, vibrant colours bursting forth from the booths that lined Maplewood's main street, each vying to attract attention with their unique concoctions of food and fun. The clatter of plates, the boisterous laughter echoing through the night, and the constant buzz of activity - it all felt like something out of a fairytale – except for Ellie’s kitchen.  Tonight, the kitchen was a battlefield, a place where ambition collided with frustration, leaving only an acrid taste of regret in its wake. The cobbler was still a blackened mass of sugar-soaked sorrow on the counter, mocking her with its failure.
