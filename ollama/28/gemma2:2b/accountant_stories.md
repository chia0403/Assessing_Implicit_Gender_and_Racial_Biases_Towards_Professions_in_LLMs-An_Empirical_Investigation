The fluorescent lights hummed in an almost mockingly cheerful way as Arthur Cavendish meticulously counted the envelopes on his desk.  His meticulous nature was both a source of pride and, for some colleagues, unbearable tedium.  He was known as “Mr. Precise,” a nickname borne out of his unwavering adherence to accounting rules and a near-obsessive focus on every decimal point. 

Arthur lived in a world defined by numbers: invoices, balance sheets, income statements. It was a place where the weight of responsibility rested heavily on his shoulders – especially today.  Today was the day he'd tackle the infamous "Phoenix Project," a series of complex audits for the struggling tech firm known as Apex Technologies. The company’s survival depended on it, and Arthur felt every ounce of pressure. 

His cramped apartment looked out onto a bustling city street that never seemed to sleep.  Outside, neon lights pulsed like beating hearts in the dark night, while within his walls, the air hung heavy with the weight of deadlines, coffee-stained pages, and an ever-present gnawing anxiety – all intertwined with Arthur's carefully structured spreadsheet life.

It’s filled with stacks of books on accounting and tax regulations, his computer screen casting a glow onto the walls, while an ancient, dusty record player hums faintly from the corner. The overall feeling is one of neat order and focused precision, but there's a faint sense of unease creeping in.
