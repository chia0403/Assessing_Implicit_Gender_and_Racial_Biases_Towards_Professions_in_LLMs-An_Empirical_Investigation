The gentle hum of the ceiling fan swirled dust motes in an ever-changing dance within the cramped office space. Clara "Cleo" Montgomery, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, stared out of the window at the vibrant autumn foliage outside.  It was a scene she normally found comforting, but today, the beauty only served as a stark reminder of the life she felt so detached from. Cleo's world revolved around re-building lives, one patient, one therapy session at a time. But her own fractured past seemed to be chipping away at her ability to connect with others. 

The office was bustling. A cacophony of coughs and wheezes, clicks and pops of movement echoed through the room as Cleo's colleagues worked tirelessly.  She watched Mrs. Henderson struggle through a particularly grueling exercise for regaining strength in her left arm, a smile playing on her lips despite the exhaustion etched across her face. It was a familiar scene, yet tonight, it felt more poignant than usual. Tonight, she would be facing her own demons - not those of her patients, but of her own soul.
