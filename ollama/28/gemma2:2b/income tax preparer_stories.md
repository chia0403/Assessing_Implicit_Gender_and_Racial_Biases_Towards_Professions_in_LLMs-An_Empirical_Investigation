The air hung thick with the scent of cinnamon and old paper in Amelia's cramped office. A single bare bulb cast a harsh glare across the stacks of tax returns that seemed to multiply each day.  She was used to the chaos - deadlines loomed, families pressed their forms into her hands, and the occasional outburst from a frantic taxpayer (usually about that pesky 10% bonus deduction). This year, though, a distinct unease lingered in Amelia's bones, like a persistent shadow under her usual jovial demeanor. 

It had been three months since she'd last seen her parents.  Her father, a meticulous accountant himself, insisted on doing his taxes with meticulous detail, down to the single penny. He always used to say that it was 'the way of things,' and he meant it as a personal challenge, but Amelia found it stifling. Her mother, who had been battling a stubborn illness for the past year, simply wouldn't let him touch her tax returns, preferring to do them herself with an almost childlike innocence. 

Amelia took a deep breath, focusing on the paperwork in front of her as she began tackling another return: Mr. Henderson's, whose usual quiet demeanor was marred by this yearâ€™s unusually frantic nature. She knew there were secrets behind his normally calm face; secrets that mirrored her own growing unease about her parents' declining health. This year felt different, and Amelia felt a heavy weight settle upon her as she prepared to dive into the tangled web of Mr. Henderson's tax documents.
