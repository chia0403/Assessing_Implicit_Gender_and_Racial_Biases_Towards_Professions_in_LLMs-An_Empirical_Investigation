The late afternoon sun slanted through the window, painting streaks of orange across Dr. Amelia Grace's worn therapy table. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and old wood as she glanced at her latest patient, Mr. Henderson. His weathered face was etched with frustration - not from pain, but from the sheer stubbornness of his refusal to engage.  

Mr. Henderson had been a retired postal worker, proud of his hands, calloused and scarred like an old map. He'd spent his life navigating city streets, always on time, never missing a delivery. Now, years later, after a debilitating stroke, he was confined to this room, the physical therapist in charge of bringing back some semblance of normalcy, some sense of purpose. 

Amelia had been called to help him regain control over his movements â€“ even if it meant fighting against his ingrained will. She adjusted her glasses and looked across the table. "Mr. Henderson, I know you're struggling with this," she said softly, placing a hand on the worn leather seat where he sat, his gaze fixed on some point beyond Amelia's eyes. 

The setting was a small private practice in the heart of a bustling city - quiet and hidden amidst towering office buildings and roaring streets. A weathered antique clock ticked away the minutes in the corner, its rhythmic clang echoing through the space. The air, thick with tension and anticipation, seemed to hold its breath until the first act of resistance began.
