## Story Opening:

**Setting:** The cobbled streets of Blackwood, Maine hummed with early autumn energy. Leaves, ablaze with reds and yellows, drifted lazily down from the towering pines that bordered the town square. A crisp October wind whipped around Elara Thorne's weathered face as she walked, her worn leather boots crunching on the remaining gravel paths. The aroma of woodsmoke and apple pies wafted from the small bakery at the corner of Maple and Main, a familiar comfort in this ever-changing world. 

**Name:** Elara Thorne - A name whispered with respect in every lumberyard and workshop in Blackwood. Not just for her skill as a carpenter, but also because she was known to speak truth to power, even when it meant facing down the gruff sheriff himself.  

Elara stopped in front of her shop, 'Thorne's Timber,' its faded paint struggling to hold onto the vibrant blue of the door trim. The scent of pine and sawdust filled the air as she entered, a stark contrast to the sweet aroma that wafted from the bakery. Her tools lay neatly in order on her workbench – their worn wood slick with years of use, each tool whispering stories of past projects: a hand-crafted wooden birdcage for a young bride; a sturdy table for the mayor's daughter’s tenth birthday party; and countless other pieces of life woven into wood by Elara's hands. 

But today was different. Today, a knot of unease tightened in her chest as she looked at the unfinished door to the back room, its hinges still unlatched after months of contemplation and procrastination. The project, simple in form, yet filled with intricate carvings that spoke of her own personal battles, was almost complete. Yet, standing before it, Elara found herself facing an internal dilemma.
