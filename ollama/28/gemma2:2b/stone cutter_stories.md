The air hung thick with the smell of granite dust and iron, clinging to Elias’ worn leather apron like a second skin. The sun, already sinking towards the horizon, cast long, dancing shadows across his workshop. It was here, in this small stone shop tucked away on the edge of the bustling city of Veridian, that Elias honed his craft, shaping dreams from granite and marble.  

His hands, calloused and scarred like ancient riverbeds, moved with practiced ease as he measured a slab of jade – a cool, emerald green against the warm sun-bleached stone surrounding him. He was working on a commission: a statue for the city’s newly elected mayor, who had envisioned a monument to peace and prosperity. But Elias wasn't sure if the piece could capture the essence of the man’s aspirations. The mayor, known only as "Lord Blackwood" due to his fondness for dark velvet suits and a brooding silence that unnerved even the most seasoned courtiers, was a man shrouded in mystery. 

Elias sighed, dropping the measuring rod onto the workbench with a soft thud. The granite felt heavy in his hands; the stone held not just the weight of years but also the weight of expectation.  The city's hopes rested on this statue, and Elias could feel the pressure bearing down on him as he stared at the blank canvas before him – a silent, waiting witness to history being written. 


**Setting:** A small, cramped stone workshop in Veridian City, nestled between a bustling market and a grand, imposing cathedral. The workshop is filled with dusty tools, rough-hewn blocks of granite, and the scent of sweat and dust.  

**Main Character:** Elias Thorne - a stoic and solitary man with calloused hands and an artist's heart. He’s skilled and efficient, but he longs for more than just crafting simple statues.
