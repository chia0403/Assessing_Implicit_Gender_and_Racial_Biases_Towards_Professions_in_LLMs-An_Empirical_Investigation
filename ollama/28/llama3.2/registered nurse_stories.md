Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Emma Elizabeth Thompson, RN, trudged wearily through the crowded hospital corridors. She had been on her feet for hours, and the long shift at Mercy Hospital was finally coming to an end. As she changed out of her scrubs in the quiet staff lounge, Emma's mind began to wander to the cryptic message she'd received that morning from her old friend and fellow nurse, Dr. Sophia Patel.

"Meet me at the coffee shop on 1st and Main," the note had read. "Come alone. It's about Alex."

Alex was a former patient of Emma's who had been transferred to Mercy after being released from the psychiatric ward where he'd spent several months recovering from a traumatic event. He had been doing well, but Emma had always felt a twinge of guilt for having left him in someone else's care.

As she poured herself a cup of lukewarm coffee, Emma couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about Sophia's message. What could her friend possibly want to talk to her about? And why was it so important to have this conversation in private?

With a sigh, Emma grabbed her coat and headed out into the drizzly evening, wondering what lay ahead.

Setting: Mercy Hospital, Seattle
