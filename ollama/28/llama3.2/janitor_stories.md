Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted hallways of Ravenswood High School. It was 2:47 AM on a Tuesday, and the only sound was the soft hum of the heating system and the creaks and groans of the old building settling into its foundations.

In one of those forgotten corners of the school, janitor Emilia "Mia" Rodriguez swept her broom methodically across the worn linoleum floor of room 217. She had been working at Ravenswood for over a decade, and knew every inch of this place like the back of her hand. From the dusty corners where the old radiators leaked steam to the cramped storage closet behind the stage doors, Mia had seen it all.

As she worked, her mind wandered back to the argument she'd had with her younger brother, Juan, that morning. He was always pushing her to do more with his life - get a "real job", finish college, you name it - but Mia knew what she wanted: to stay in this school, keep its secrets, and make sure no one ever got hurt again.

The broom's bristles scratched against the floor as Mia moved into a slow circle around the room, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape of chalk-scraped lockers and worn desks. Something didn't feel right tonight, though. A shiver ran down her spine as she caught sight of something out of place - a window that was always locked, now open a crack.

Mia's heart quickened as she approached the window cautiously, her hand reaching for the fire extinguisher on the wall behind her. What was going on in Ravenswood High School at 2:47 AM?
