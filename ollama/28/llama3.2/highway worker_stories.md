Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Oklahoma's Route 66, casting a warm orange glow over the desolate stretch of asphalt that stretched out before Emily May Wilson like an endless serpent. As she sipped her lukewarm coffee from the thermos in her truck's cup holder, Emily gazed out at the rust-colored hills and scrubby mesquite trees that seemed to be swallowing the road whole.

At 32 years old, Emily had spent half her life working on this very stretch of highway, repairing potholes, clearing debris, and generally keeping the artery of America's heartland open for the countless trucks, cars, and RVs that thundered down its center every day. She took pride in her work, even if it was a far cry from the white-collar job she'd left behind after high school to pursue a career in engineering.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, Emily's mind began to wander back to the mysterious letter she'd received a week ago - a cryptic message scrawled on a crumpled up receipt from a diner 50 miles back: "Meet me at the old windmill on Highway 66. Come alone." The note was unsigned, but there was something about it that had stirred up a sense of restlessness in Emily, something that made her want to ditch her carefully laid plans and hit the road for who-knew-where.

And now, as she stood at the edge of this desert highway, Emily felt an inexplicable urge to follow that hunch - no matter where it might lead.
