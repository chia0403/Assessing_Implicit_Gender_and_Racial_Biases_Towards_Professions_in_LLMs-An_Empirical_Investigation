Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery novel:

**Opening Scene:**

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The neon signs of the city's bars and clubs cast a gaudy glow over the pavement, making it seem like the entire town was one big, flashing mirage. I stood outside my office, a cramped little room above a pawn shop in the seedier part of town, watching as the droplets slid down the windowpane like tears.

I was Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, private investigator and sometime-sleuth. My eyes scanned the crowded street, searching for any sign of trouble - or, more likely, trouble with the kind of trouble that paid the bills. That's when I saw her: a petite blonde with piercing green eyes and a look on her face that said she was running out of options fast.

**Setting:**

New Haven was a city of contrasts. On one hand, it had all the trappings of success - sleek skyscrapers, upscale boutiques, and some of the best restaurants in the country. But scratch beneath the surface, and you'd find a whole different story. Poverty, crime, and corruption lurked around every corner, waiting to pounce on the unwary.

My office was located above a pawn shop called "Midnight's Deals." The sign creaked in the wind, reading like a warning from some long-forgotten siren: "Beware of Midnight's Deals - they'll take your money and leave you for dead." I liked that. It suited my business.

The streets were narrow and winding, lined with old buildings that seemed to lean in on each other like old friends sharing a secret. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven, and the streetlights cast long shadows across the pavement. New Haven was a city that loved its secrets - and it had plenty of them.

I lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar tug of nicotine as I watched my mark walk away into the darkness. This one looked like trouble with a capital T.
