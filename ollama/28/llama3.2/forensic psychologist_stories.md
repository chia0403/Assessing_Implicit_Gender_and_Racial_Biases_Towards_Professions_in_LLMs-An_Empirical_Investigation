Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished obsidian as Dr. Alexander "Alex" Thompson stepped out of the gloomy office building and into the gray mist that clung to the city like a damp shroud. It was 5:45 PM on a drizzly Wednesday, and the mist-shrouded buildings seemed to whisper secrets to each other as Alex made her way down the sidewalk.

As she hailed a taxi, Alex couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been building all day. Her latest case - a young woman with no memory of who she was or how she'd ended up in the psychiatric ward - still lingered in her mind like an open wound. The patient's eyes had seemed to hold a spark of recognition when Alex had first met her, but now they were empty, devoid of any hint of familiarity.

Alex took a deep breath as the taxi pulled away from the curb and headed into the heart of the city. She was a forensic psychologist, with a specialization in treating patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID). Her work had taken her to some of the darkest corners of the human psyche, but she'd never lost sight of what drove her: understanding the depths of the human mind and helping those who were struggling to find their way back.

As the taxi splashed through puddles on 5th Avenue, Alex gazed out the window at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. It was a city of contrasts - gleaming glass towers and dark alleyways, hope and despair coexisting in a delicate balance. And it was here, among the steel canyons and rain-soaked streets, that Alex would find her next challenge.

"Where to?" she asked the driver, already knowing she didn't care where they were going as long as it got her out of this gray, unsettling city.

"Just take me home," she said with a sigh.
