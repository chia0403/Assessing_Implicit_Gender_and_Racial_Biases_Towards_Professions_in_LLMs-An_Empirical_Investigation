Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the playground, watching as the sun began to set over the small town of Oakdale. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar mix of stress and excitement that came with her job as a school psychologist. The sound of children's laughter carried on the breeze, mingling with the clang of swings and the creak of the monkey bars.

Lexi had always loved this time of day, when the chaos of the school day began to wind down and the students' worries about standardized tests and homework seemed to fade into the background. As she scanned the playground, her eyes landed on a familiar figure - 12-year-old Jake Jenkins, sitting alone on a bench and staring intently at his phone.

Lexi's instincts prickled with concern. She had known Jake since he started at Oakdale Middle School a few years ago, when he was struggling to connect with his classmates after being transferred from a different district. Over the past year, she had watched him slowly begin to open up, but today there was something about his expression that seemed...off.

As she walked over to join him on the bench, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that Jake's troubles were only just beginning to surface. Little did she know, this was going to be a summer like no other for her and the students of Oakdale Middle School.
