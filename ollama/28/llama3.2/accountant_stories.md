Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Thames, shrouding the small town of Ravenscar in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp blanket. It was a typical November morning in this sleepy coastal village, where the only sound was the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore and the creaking of old wooden signs.

Inside the offices of Hawkins & Co., Accountants, Emily Victoria Windsor hunched over her desk, her eyes bloodshot from a long night spent pouring over financial records. A petite, 28-year-old woman with curly brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses, Emily was the newest member of the firm's accounting team. She had graduated at the top of her class from university just six months ago, and had already made a name for herself as a meticulous and detail-oriented number-cruncher.

As she worked, Emily's mind wandered to the strange letter she had received earlier that morning. The handwriting was unfamiliar, but the words sent a shiver down her spine: "The books don't add up, Emily. Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight if you want to know the truth."
