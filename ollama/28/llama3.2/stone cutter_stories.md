Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was alive with the sound of merchants hawking their wares and the smell of fresh bread wafting from the nearby ovens.

In a small workshop nestled between two towering cliffs, Aziz ibn Malik al-Rashid carefully selected a piece of limestone for his latest commission. As a stone cutter, Aziz had spent years honing his craft, learning the intricacies of the ancient art from his father and grandfather before him. He took pride in creating beautiful and intricate designs that told stories of the city's rich history.

As he worked, Aziz couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The Siq seemed quieter than usual, with fewer tourists wandering through the narrow passageways. And yet, despite the sense of unease, Aziz felt a thrill of excitement. He had received a mysterious commission from a wealthy patron, one that promised a handsome sum of gold in exchange for a single, flawless piece of stone.

The catch was that the patron wanted the stone carved into a specific design - one that seemed to hold secrets and symbols that only the most skilled artisans could decipher. Aziz's curiosity was piqued, and he couldn't wait to get his hands on the mysterious stone and unlock its secrets.

Little did Aziz know, this commission would lead him down a path of discovery, danger, and intrigue, one that would challenge everything he thought he knew about his city, his art, and himself.
