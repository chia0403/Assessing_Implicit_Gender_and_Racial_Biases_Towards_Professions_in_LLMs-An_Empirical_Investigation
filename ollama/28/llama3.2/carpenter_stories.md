Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Ravenswood, shrouding its quaint streets in a damp, grey veil. In a small workshop on Main Street, surrounded by worn wooden beams and the scent of sawdust, Emilia "Mia" Thompson stirred the embers of last night's fire into a warm glow.

As a skilled carpenter with hands that moved with the precision of a surgeon, Mia had spent countless hours in this very shop, bringing old houses back to life one plank at a time. Her eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed almost like dark chocolate, twinkled as she surveyed her tools: the trusty tape measure coiled on its hook, the hammer hung by its leather thong, and the workbench scarred from years of holding together dreams.

Outside, the mist grew thicker, casting an eerie gloom over the town's narrow streets. The residents of Ravenswood were still abuzz with the news that had shaken them to their cores: the mysterious letter, delivered to every household but one, which spoke of secrets long buried and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. As Mia's hands moved through her morning routine, a sense of restlessness stirred within her - a feeling that today would bring more than just another day of hammering nails into wood.

But little did she know, the quiet dawn was about to give way to a storm of secrets, lies, and revelations that would shake the very foundations of Ravenswood.
