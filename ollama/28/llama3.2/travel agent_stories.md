Here's a story opening and setting for you:

As she sipped her coffee and gazed out at the bustling streets of Tokyo, Emiko Nakahara, founder of Sakura Travel Co., felt a sense of restlessness wash over her. The neon lights of Shinjuku reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the rain-soaked sidewalks. It was moments like these that reminded Emiko why she loved being a travel agent – there was always something new to discover, some hidden gem waiting to be uncovered.

Emiko's own travels had taken her to every corner of Japan, from the snow-capped peaks of Hokkaido to the ancient temples of Kyoto. She knew its secrets and was passionate about sharing them with others. But as she stood at her desk, surrounded by maps and brochures, Emiko couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

Her phone rang, shrill in the quiet morning air. It was a potential client, inquiring about a customized itinerary for a special celebration. Emiko's mind began to whirl with possibilities – would she recommend the cherry blossom festival in March, or perhaps the tranquil gardens of Nikko? The possibilities were endless, and Emiko's excitement grew as she picked up the receiver.

"Good morning," she said, her voice bright and professional. "Sakura Travel Co., how can I help you today?"
