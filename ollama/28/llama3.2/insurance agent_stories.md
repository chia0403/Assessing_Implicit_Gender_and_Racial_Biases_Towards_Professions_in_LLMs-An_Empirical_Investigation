Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring an insurance agent as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Emily Anne Wellesley stared out the rain-soaked window of her office, watching the droplets slide down the pane like tears. It was going to be one of those days. The kind where everything seemed to be falling apart, and she wasn't sure how to put the pieces back together.

**Setting:**

Emily Anne Wellesley's insurance agency, "Wellesley & Associates," was nestled in a small strip mall on the outskirts of Oakwood, Illinois. The sign above the door creaked gently in the breeze, reading "Home and Auto Insurance" in bold letters. Inside, the walls were adorned with faded photographs of Emily Anne's family - her parents, her grandparents, and her beloved great-grandmother, who had started the agency from scratch over 50 years ago.

The office itself was a cozy, if slightly dated, space that seemed frozen in time. The carpet was a deep brown that had seen better days, and the fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow on the worn leather chairs. Emily Anne's desk, a vintage number she'd inherited from her great-grandmother, sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork, client files, and the occasional souvenir from a failed business venture.

As the rain drummed against the roof, Emily Anne couldn't shake the feeling that this was just the beginning of a long, difficult day. And she wasn't sure if her agency was ready to face whatever challenges came its way.

**About Emily Anne Wellesley:**

Emily Anne Wellesley is a 35-year-old insurance agent who has been running her family's agency for five years. She's fiercely dedicated to her work and her clients, but the weight of responsibility is starting to take its toll. With a quick wit, sharp instincts, and an unwavering commitment to fairness, Emily Anne navigates the complex world of insurance with ease - most days, anyway.
