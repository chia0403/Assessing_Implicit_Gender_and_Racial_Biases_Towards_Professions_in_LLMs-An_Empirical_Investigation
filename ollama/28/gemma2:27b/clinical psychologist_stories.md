Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already muted city lights into an impressionist smear. The rhythmic drumming was punctuated by the occasional guttural groan of thunder, echoing Eleanor's own turmoil. She stared at the patient file spread across her desk, a thick sheaf of paper chronicling years of suffering.

Her name was Amelia Thorne, and her case had haunted Eleanor since it landed on her desk six months ago. Amelia, a gifted musician plagued by debilitating anxiety, was convinced she was cursed. Her symptoms defied traditional explanations, manifesting in bizarre physical sensations and terrifying hallucinations. Eleanor, despite her years of training and experience, felt an unsettling knot of uncertainty tighten in her chest.

Was there a rational explanation for Amelia's distress, or was she facing something truly beyond the realm of psychology? The city outside seemed to mirror her inner storm: dark, chaotic, and full of unknown threats. As Eleanor reached for Amelia's file, the phone on her desk jolted her from her reverie with a sharp, insistent ring.
