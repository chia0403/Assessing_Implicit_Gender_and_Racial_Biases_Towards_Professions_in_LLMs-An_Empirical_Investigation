The bell above the shop door chimed with a melancholic sweetness, a sound Elara Rose always found both welcoming and slightly unsettling.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, casting long shadows across the overflowing baskets of lilies and peonies.

Elara paused in her task of weaving lavender into a bridal bouquet, her fingers instinctively tightening around the delicate stems. She peered through the tangle of blooms towards the entrance. A man stood awkwardly framed by the doorway, his silhouette shrouded in the late afternoon light. He seemed hesitant, his shoulders slumped slightly under the weight of some unseen burden.

Elara smoothed down the front of her apron and offered a tentative smile. "Good afternoon," she called out, her voice lilting with the gentle rhythm sheâ€™d learned from years of whispering to her blossoms. "Can I help you find something?"
