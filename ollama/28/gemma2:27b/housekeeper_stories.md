The scent of lavender polish hung thick in the air, clinging to Eloise Amelia Cartwright's worn cotton dress like a ghost. Dawn was just breaking, painting streaks of rose and gold across the high windows of Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the pale light as Eloise moved through the grand hall, her trusty bucket and mop trailing behind her. The silence of the manor was immense, broken only by the soft squeak of her shoes on the polished marble floor.  

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept moor, held secrets as old as its crumbling stone walls. Eloise had been the housekeeper for nearly twenty years, and in that time she'd seen generations of Blackwoods come and go. Yet, despite her familiarity with every creaking floorboard and shadowed alcove, the manor still held an air of mystery, a sense that something unseen lurked just beyond the veil of reality.


This morning, however, felt different. The usual stillness seemed charged with anticipation, a subtle hum vibrating beneath the surface. Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that today would be anything but ordinary.
