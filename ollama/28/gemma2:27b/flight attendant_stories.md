The recycled air hung heavy with the cloying scent of airplane peanuts and desperation. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted her scarlet scarf, hoping to mask the faint tremor in her hands as she surveyed the packed Boeing 747.  Sunbeams sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating a sea of restless faces – families squabbling over armrests, businessmen glued to their laptops, and honeymooners desperately trying to appear nonchalant. Ellie knew this flight, Tokyo to Los Angeles, was going to be a long one. It always was. 

Her gaze drifted towards the cockpit door, remembering the reassuring presence of Captain Sato, whose calm demeanor had once soothed her pre-flight jitters. But Sato wasn't flying today. In his place was a young, ambitious pilot she hadn't met before – his nametag read "Captain Lee". Ellie felt a flicker of unease. She couldn't shake the feeling that this flight wouldn't be routine.
