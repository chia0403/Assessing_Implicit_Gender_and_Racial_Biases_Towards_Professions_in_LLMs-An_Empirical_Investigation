The humid air clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Alvarez like a second skin as she surveyed the park.  It was 6:30 AM, the sky barely hinting at dawn over the jagged silhouette of the San Gabriel Mountains. Dew sparkled on the emerald grass, and a chorus of chirping birds filled the air. Esme took a deep breath, inhaling the earthy scent of eucalyptus and damp soil. Today was the day she launched "Sunrise Sculpt," her brand-new outdoor fitness class in Echo Park. 

She adjusted the bright pink tank top emblazoned with her company logo, "Fit Fiesta" â€“ a playful nod to her vibrant Cuban heritage and her infectious enthusiasm for all things fitness.  A colorful array of yoga mats lay scattered across the grassy clearing, waiting for the early-bird exercisers she hoped would soon arrive. Esme's heart thumped a mix of excitement and nerves. This was it. A chance to build something new, something hers.
