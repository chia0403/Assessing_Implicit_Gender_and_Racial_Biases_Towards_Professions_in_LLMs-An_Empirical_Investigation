The air in Henrietta "Hetty" Price's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Sunlight streamed through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. Hetty, her round spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, chewed nervously on the end of a pencil as she surveyed the mountain of tax forms piled high on her desk. April 15th loomed like a guillotine, and her clients – a motley crew of artists, freelancers, and small-business owners – seemed perpetually on the verge of panic.

This year was proving particularly challenging. A new, bewildering tax code had been implemented, leaving even seasoned professionals scratching their heads. Hetty, though meticulous and dedicated, felt the weight of everyone's anxieties pressing down on her. She longed for a simpler time, when W-2s were straightforward and deductions didn't require deciphering ancient hieroglyphics.
