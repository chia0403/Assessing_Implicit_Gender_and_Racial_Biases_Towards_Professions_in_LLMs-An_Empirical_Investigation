The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Horseshoe" cast an unsettling green glow on Elias Finch's weathered face as he wrestled with the ancient wiring in the back alley. Sparks showered down, momentarily illuminating the overflowing dumpster and the scuttling shadows within. The air hung thick and heavy with the stench of stale beer and fried food. Elias, a man whose hands were more accustomed to the precise dance of wires than the rough textures of alleyways, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow.

Elias was no stranger to late-night calls.  As the only electrician in Harmony Creek who wasn't afraid to tackle anything, even the most dubious of jobs, he often found himself answering the frantic pleas of bar owners and diner proprietors long after the sun had set. But tonight felt different. The air crackled with a strange energy, an almost palpable tension that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the dilapidated building.
