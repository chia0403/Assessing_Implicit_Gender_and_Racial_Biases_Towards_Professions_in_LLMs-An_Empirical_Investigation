Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in Eleanor Cavendish's chest. The old typewriter sat before her, mockingly silent, its keys gleaming under the single bare bulb that hung precariously from the ceiling. Outside, thunder rumbled like an angry god, mirroring the storm brewing within Eleanor. Her deadline loomed, a dark specter threatening to extinguish the flickering flame of her inspiration. 

The attic, cramped and dusty with decades of forgotten dreams, was Eleanor's sanctuary, her only refuge from the stifling expectations of her family. They saw writing as a frivolous hobby, a childish pursuit unworthy of her station. But for Eleanor, words were lifelines, bridges across chasms of loneliness and despair. 

Tonight, though, the bridge felt broken, the chasm uncrossable. The blank page on the typewriter mocked her inability to weave even a single thread of narrative. Her mind, usually abuzz with ideas, was as barren as the attic walls around her.
