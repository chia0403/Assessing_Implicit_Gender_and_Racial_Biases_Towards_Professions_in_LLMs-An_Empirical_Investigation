Grease stained his hands, a badge of honor Elroy "Roy" Jackson wore with pride. The midday sun streamed through the grimy windows of his garage, "Roy's Rides," casting long shadows across the jumbled landscape of car parts and tools.  A symphony of clanks and whirs filled the air as Roy wrestled with a stubborn carburetor on a vintage Ford Mustang. Sweat beaded on his brow, reflecting the fluorescent lights overhead, but he didn't flinch. This engine was giving him trouble, but he'd crack it sooner or later.

Roy wasn't just fixing cars; he was breathing life back into them. He loved the intricate dance of gears and pistons, the satisfying purr of an engine humming back to life after a long slumber. But today, the usual rhythm was punctuated by a sharp rapping at his garage door.  Roy wiped his hands on a rag, wondering who could be disturbing his zen. Business had been slow lately, and he wasn't expecting any visitors.

Cautiously, he pushed open the heavy steel door, revealing a woman shrouded in shadow. The afternoon sun cast her face half in darkness, making it difficult to read her expression. But Roy noticed the way she clutched a worn leather bag close to her chest, her knuckles white against the faded brown.  Something about her posture - tense, guarded - told him this wasn't just a casual drop-in.
