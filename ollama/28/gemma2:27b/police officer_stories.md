Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Detective Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office, mimicking the relentless pounding in her head.  The flickering neon sign from the liquor store across the street cast a sickly green glow on her overflowing desk, illuminating stacks of case files and half-eaten takeout containers.

She was drowning. Not in the literal sense, although the incessant drumming of the rain did make it feel like she was trapped inside a leaking boat. Ellie was drowning in unsolved cases, each one a faceless ghost demanding attention. There was the string of petty thefts plaguing the downtown boutiques, the missing teenager who vanished without a trace, and then there was the cold case â€“ the brutal murder of young Sarah Collins ten years ago that still haunted Ellie's dreams.

Tonight, however, something else gnawed at her. A phone call earlier that evening had sent a chill down her spine. An anonymous tip about a body found in the abandoned textile mill on the edge of town.
