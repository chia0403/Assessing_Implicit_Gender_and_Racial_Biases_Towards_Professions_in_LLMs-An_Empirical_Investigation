Rain lashed against the apothecary window, blurring the flickering gaslight hanging above the door. Inside, Elias Blackwood meticulously counted out lavender buds into a small muslin pouch, his movements precise and economical. The scent of dried herbs mingled with the faint tang of disinfectant, a comforting familiarity in the otherwise dreary shop.

Elias wasn't expecting anyone this late on a Thursday, not with the storm raging outside. He glanced at the grandfather clock ticking away in the corner – almost ten o’clock. He was about to close up when the bell above the door jangled sharply, making him jump. A figure shrouded in a dark cloak stood silhouetted against the swirling rain, water cascading from their broad-brimmed hat. Elias hesitated, unsure whether to approach or wait for the stranger to reveal themselves.

The figure coughed, a harsh rasp that cut through the silence. "Elias Blackwood," a voice, rough and low, spoke from beneath the cloak. "I need your help."
