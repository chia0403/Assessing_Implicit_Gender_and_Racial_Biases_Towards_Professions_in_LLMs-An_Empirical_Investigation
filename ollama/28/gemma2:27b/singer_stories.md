The humid air hung heavy in The Blue Moon, clinging to Elodie Evangeline's skin as she adjusted the microphone stand.  Neon lights cast a hazy purple glow over the cramped stage, illuminating the worn velvet curtains and faded posters advertising past acts. The scent of stale beer and fried peanuts permeated every corner, a familiar aroma that Elodie both loved and loathed. Tonight, she was opening for "The Rusty Rivets," a local blues band with more grit than grace. 

Elodie wasn't sure how she'd ended up in this dingy dive bar on the outskirts of New Orleans, but there was something about the raw energy of The Blue Moon that called to her soul. Maybe it was the promise of escaping her own reality for a few fleeting hours, or perhaps it was the hope that someone, somewhere in the dimly lit crowd, would recognize the yearning in her voice and see the star she longed to be.
