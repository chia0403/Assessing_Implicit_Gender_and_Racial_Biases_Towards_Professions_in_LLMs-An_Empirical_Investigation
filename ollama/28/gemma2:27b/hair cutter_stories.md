Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye", perched precariously on the edge of Vinegar Hill, was known for two things: Esme's uncanny ability to tame even the wildest mane, and the perpetually precarious slant of the building itself. Built on a forgotten landslide, the shop tilted at an alarming angle, making every haircut a delicate dance against gravity. Today, however, the tilt seemed worse than usual.


Esme squinted at the window, her reflection distorted by the uneven glass. Outside, the sky was bruised purple with the threat of a summer storm. The wind whipped through Vinegar Hill, rustling the faded awnings and sending loose newspapers skittering down the cobblestone street. Something about the air felt heavy, charged with anticipation, as if the town itself were holding its breath. 

She turned back to her client, Mrs. Peabody, whose silver curls quivered like startled butterflies under Esme's touch. "Just a moment longer, dear," Esme said soothingly, snipping away the last stray strand.  "And we're done!"
