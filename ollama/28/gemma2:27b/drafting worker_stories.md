The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over his drafting table. Blueprints for a new apartment complex sprawled before him, their delicate lines a stark contrast to the grimy smudges on his calloused fingers. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and graphite dust, a familiar perfume in this cramped corner of the architectural firm. Elias tapped his pencil against the paper, frustration gnawing at him as he tried to reconcile the architect's whimsical vision with the practicalities of building codes.

Outside, the city throbbed with life, a symphony of honking horns and distant sirens. But here, in the windowless drafting room, time seemed to stand still. Elias longed for fresh air, for a glimpse of the sun, anything to break the monotonous routine that had begun to feel like a cage.
