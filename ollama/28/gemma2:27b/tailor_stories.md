The air in Silas Peregrine’s workshop was thick with the scent of beeswax and lavender. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing above rows of antique sewing machines. Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague hummed with the clatter of trams and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares. But inside Silas's world, time seemed to stand still. He hunched over a velvet bodice, his needle flashing like silver lightning as he stitched delicate embroidery along its seams. His brow furrowed in concentration, his wizened face reflecting years spent meticulously crafting garments for Prague’s elite. 

Today, however, Silas was not working on a commission for a baroness or a duchess. Today, he was stitching something far more personal: a wedding dress for his granddaughter, Eliska.
