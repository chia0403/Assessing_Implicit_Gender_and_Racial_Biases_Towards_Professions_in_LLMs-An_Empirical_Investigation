Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Silas Blackwood's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his skull. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarette smoke and desperation – a familiar perfume in this part of town. Silas, a man whose face bore the map of a thousand hard-lived years, despite being only forty-five, swirled the amber liquid in his glass. Bourbon. Always bourbon. It dulled the edges, allowed him to function without succumbing to the ghosts that clung to him like shadows.

His phone buzzed, a jarring intrusion in the symphony of rain and regret. Silas squinted at the caller ID – "Evelyn Thorne."  He recognized the name; it was attached to a case he'd been avoiding for weeks, one that smelled of secrets and danger thicker than the smog choking the city. He sighed, taking a long swig before answering.

"Blackwood here," he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of chain-smoking and too many sleepless nights.


The story takes place in a shadowy, rain-soaked metropolis, teeming with life yet shrouded in a perpetual gloom. Silas Blackwood is a private detective haunted by his past, who finds solace only in the bottom of a bottle. He's about to be pulled into a case that promises to unearth more secrets than he can handle.
