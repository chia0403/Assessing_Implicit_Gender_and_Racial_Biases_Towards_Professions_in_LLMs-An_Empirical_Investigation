Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the kennel block, each drop a tiny hammer blow on Elara Blackwood's already frayed nerves. The wind howled through the gaps in the wooden walls, whistling a mournful tune that matched Elara's mood.  The once-bright paint on the kennels was peeling, revealing the faded grey wood beneath. Mud squelched under her worn boots as she trudged between the rows of cages, each housing a shivering, forlorn animal. 

This wasn't how Elara envisioned her life. Fresh out of veterinary school, she dreamed of working in a pristine clinic, surrounded by cutting-edge technology and pampered pets. Instead, she found herself at the helm of "Second Chance Sanctuary", a dilapidated shelter nestled on the edge of a forgotten town.
