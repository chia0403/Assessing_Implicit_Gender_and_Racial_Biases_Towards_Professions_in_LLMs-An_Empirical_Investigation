Crayon shavings littered her desk like confetti, a testament to the day's ambitious art project - paper plate masks depicting famous historical figures. Mrs. Finch sighed, rubbing her temples. Third grade could be wonderfully chaotic.

Outside, the wind rattled the old oak tree that stood sentinel beside the school playground, its leaves whispering secrets only it knew. The air smelled faintly of rain and freshly cut grass, a comforting combination that did little to soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in Elara's stomach.

It started with a series of strange phone calls - silent hang-ups punctuated by heavy breathing. Then there were the anonymous notes left on her desk, cryptic messages scrawled in childish handwriting. Elara tried to rationalize it away, blaming overactive imaginations and pre-summer jitters, but deep down, a sliver of doubt gnawed at her.
