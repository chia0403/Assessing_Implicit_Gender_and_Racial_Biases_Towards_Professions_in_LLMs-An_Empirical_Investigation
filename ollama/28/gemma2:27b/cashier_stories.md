Rain lashed against the dusty storefront window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into an anemic smear. Inside, Amelia Cartwright sighed, her reflection staring back from the polished counter – tired eyes framed by unruly brown curls, a smudge of red lipstick threatening to disappear entirely. The bell above the door jingled mournfully as another customer trudged in, shaking droplets onto the already damp linoleum floor.

Amelia plastered on a smile, the kind that felt stretched thin and brittle after eight hours of scanning groceries and listening to complaints about expired coupons. "Welcome to Benny's Bodega! Anything I can help you find?" she chirped, her voice betraying none of the weary ache in her bones.

The newcomer, a woman swathed in a dripping raincoat, looked up with eyes as grey as the storm raging outside. A shiver ran through Amelia as she met the stranger's gaze – it was an unsettling mix of desperation and something else, something sharp and unfamiliar.
