Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Lawson & Cartwright law firm, blurring the already dim cityscape outside. Eleanor Finch, perched precariously on her too-high stool, winced as another gust rattled the windowpane. The ancient ceiling fan wheezed overhead, stirring up dust motes in the stale air.  Eleanor tapped her pen against a stack of unfiled documents, her gaze drifting towards the ornate grandfather clock ticking away in the corner. 4:57 pm. Just three more minutes until freedom.

For Eleanor Finch, secretary to the formidable Mr. Cartwright for the past five years, freedom was a fleeting concept. Evenings were often consumed by typing up late-night dictations or sorting through mountains of legal paperwork that mysteriously appeared on her desk after hours. Yet, tonight, she harbored a flicker of hope â€“ Mr. Cartwright had mentioned attending a prestigious gala, promising an early departure for Eleanor.
