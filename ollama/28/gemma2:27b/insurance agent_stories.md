Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quigley's office, blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street. A damp chill permeated the air, even with the ancient radiator wheezing its best effort in the corner. Bart hunched over his desk, a mountain of claim forms threatening to avalanche onto his scuffed loafers. He sighed, rubbing a weary hand over his thinning hair. Another Tuesday night, another deluge of misfortune. Today's highlight? A woman whose prize-winning poodle had apparently eaten her dentures, resulting in a panicked chase through the neighborhood park and a hefty dental bill.

Bart wasn't sure what he'd expected when he'd taken this job at "Fortuity Insurance," but it certainly wasn't this parade of bizarre mishaps. He dreamt of grand adventures, not deciphering handwritten accounts of misplaced toupees and spontaneously combusting toasters. Still, he needed the paycheck, and besides, somewhere beneath the tedium, a flicker of curiosity always ignited. 

Tonight, however, that flicker was doused by the insistent ringing of his phone. He picked it up with a weary groan. "Fortuity Insurance, Bartholomew Quigley speaking," he said, bracing himself for whatever calamity awaited.
