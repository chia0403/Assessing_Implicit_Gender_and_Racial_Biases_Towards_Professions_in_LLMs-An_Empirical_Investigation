Rain lashed against the windowpanes of The Tranquil Touch, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid, sighed as she watched the storm rage outside.  It was Wednesday night, usually her slowest time, but tonight, even the bravest souls seemed content to stay indoors and away from the howling wind.

Amelia glanced at the empty massage table draped with crisp white linen, longing for the comforting weight of a client. The scent of lavender oil still lingered in the air, a reminder of Ms. Henderson's relaxing aromatherapy session earlier that afternoon. Amelia loved her work, the quiet satisfaction of easing tension and pain through her touch. But lately, something felt off.

A persistent ache throbbed beneath her left shoulder blade, a nagging reminder of an injury sustained years ago during a reckless skiing trip. It flared up more often these days, especially when she was stressed. And stress, Amelia realized, was starting to become a constant companion. The weight of running her own business, the increasing competition from chain spas, and the unsettling feeling that someone was watching her â€“ it all conspired to keep her on edge.
