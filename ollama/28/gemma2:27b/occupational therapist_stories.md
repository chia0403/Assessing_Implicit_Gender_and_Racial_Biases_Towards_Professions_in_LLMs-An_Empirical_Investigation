Rain lashed against the windows of the rehabilitation center, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic watercolor of greys and yellows. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear as she surveyed the cluttered therapy room.

Toys lay scattered across the floor, their once vibrant colors dulled by years of use. A half-finished puzzle sat abandoned on a table, its pieces jumbled like misplaced memories.  Amelia ran a hand over the worn surface of the occupational therapy table, a familiar ache settling in her chest. She loved her work, helping patients regain independence and find joy in everyday tasks, but lately, she'd been feeling burnt out.

The constant struggle, the setbacks, the knowledge that some patients would never fully recover â€“ it was taking its toll. Today, however, a new patient awaited her, someone who might just reignite Amelia's passion.

The file lay open on her desk: Elias Thorne, 42, recovering from a traumatic brain injury sustained in a car accident.  Amelia skimmed through the sparse details, feeling a flicker of curiosity. What kind of man was Elias Thorne? And what would it take to help him reclaim his life?
