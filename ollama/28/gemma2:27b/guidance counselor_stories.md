The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow across Eleanor Beatrice Finch's cramped office. Posters with inspirational quotes like "Reach for Your Dreams!" and "Believe in Yourself!" plastered the walls, but their cheerfulness felt hollow amidst the clutter of college brochures, crumpled permission slips, and overflowing filing cabinets. Eleanor sighed, rubbing her temples, wishing she could escape the suffocating air and step into the vibrant autumn afternoon she glimpsed through the frosted windowpane.

It was senior year, and her inbox overflowed with panicked emails from students facing the daunting prospect of choosing their futures. College applications loomed, scholarships seemed impossibly elusive, and the weight of expectation hung heavy in the air. Eleanor, a veteran guidance counselor with fifteen years under her belt at Willow Creek High School, felt it too – the pressure to steer these young minds towards fulfilling destinies, even if they themselves were uncertain about what those destinies might be.

Today's appointment was particularly daunting.  Eleanor glanced at the file on her desk: Liam O’Connell, a quiet, introspective boy with a talent for coding but a crippling fear of public speaking. He was scheduled to give a presentation at the upcoming science fair, an event that filled him with dread.
