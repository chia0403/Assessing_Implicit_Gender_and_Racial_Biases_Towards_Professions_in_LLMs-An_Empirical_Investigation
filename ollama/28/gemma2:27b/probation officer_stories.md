The stale air conditioning in the office hummed like a disgruntled hornet, barely pushing back the stifling humidity that clung to everything in downtown Miami.  Amelia "Amy" Diaz tapped her pen against the overflowing inbox on her desk, each click echoing the growing tension in her chest.  She'd been a probation officer for five years now, and while she'd seen her share of troubled souls, today felt different. 

The file open before her was thinner than most, containing only basic information:  Alejandro Reyes, 22, charged with petty theft and possession of stolen goods. His parole hearing was in two days, and Amy had a gnawing feeling that something wasn't right. Alejandro had no prior record, an impeccable academic history, and glowing letters of recommendation from professors who swore he was destined for greatness. Yet, here he sat, facing potential jail time for stealing a pair of designer sneakers. 


The incongruity gnawed at Amy.  She needed to meet Alejandro face-to-face, delve deeper into the circumstances surrounding his arrest, and see if there was more to this story than met the eye.
