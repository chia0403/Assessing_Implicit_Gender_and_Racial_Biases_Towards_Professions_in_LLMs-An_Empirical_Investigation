Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice, a relentless drumming that mirrored the pounding in her chest. The quaint Victorian building, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh, felt eerily still despite the storm raging outside.  Eleanor stood frozen, staring at the ancient, leather-bound book she'd unearthed from a forgotten corner of the attic above her office. Its title, embossed in tarnished silver, sent a shiver down her spine: "The Grimoires of Tooth and Bone."

This wasn't your typical dental textbook. The pages crackled with arcane symbols and incantations written in a language she didn't recognize.  Fear warred with curiosity as Eleanor traced the intricate diagrams of teeth intertwined with roots that seemed to delve deep into the earth.  What secrets did this book hold? And why had it been hidden away for so long?
