The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and decaying leaves. A thin mist clung to the manicured lawns of Whispering Willows Estate, obscuring the distant outline of the Victorian mansion. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his calloused hands gripping a rusty rake, surveyed his domain with a sigh. The early morning sun was struggling to pierce through the fog, casting long, spectral shadows from the ancient oak trees that dotted the sprawling grounds.  

Bart had been the groundskeeper at Whispering Willows for over twenty years. He knew every inch of the property like the back of his hand - the hidden pathways winding through the rose garden, the moss-covered fountain whispering secrets in the courtyard, and the forgotten cemetery tucked away behind a thicket of overgrown ivy.  He took pride in keeping the estate pristine, despite its melancholic air. Whispering Willows had seen better days, its grandeur fading along with the fortunes of the Cavendish family who once called it home. 


Now, the only residents were rumors and shadows. Bart often swore he heard disembodied laughter echoing from the empty hallways, or caught fleeting glimpses of a woman in white gliding through the mist-shrouded gardens. Most dismissed him as an old man with an overactive imagination, but Bart knew what he saw. And today, something felt different. A sense of foreboding hung in the air, heavier than the damp fog.
