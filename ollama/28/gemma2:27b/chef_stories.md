The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and simmering garlic, a symphony only Alessandro “Alex” Moretti could truly appreciate. Rain lashed against the windows of his trattoria, "Il Piccolo Sole," blurring the twinkling lights of the cobblestone street outside.  

Nestled in a quiet corner of Florence, Il Piccolo Sole was Alex's sanctuary. Exposed brick walls and rustic wooden tables spoke of generations past, while copper pots gleamed above the open kitchen, promising culinary delights to come. Tonight, however, the usual convivial chatter was replaced by an uneasy silence. A single candle flickered on the empty table nearest the window, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames. Alex stood at the stove, his normally jovial face creased with worry.  He stirred a pot of creamy mushroom risotto, his mind miles away from the dish before him. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
