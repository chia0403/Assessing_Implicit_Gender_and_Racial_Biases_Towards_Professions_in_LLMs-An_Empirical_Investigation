The humid Charleston air clung to Elias "Eli" Davenport like a damp shirt as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the new apartment complex rising from the marsh. Saltwater mingled with the scent of sawdust and fresh concrete, creating a unique aroma that Eli had come to associate with progress.  

He wasn't building skyscrapers or bridges – just modest three-story buildings designed for young professionals looking for a taste of waterfront living. But even these simpler projects held a certain beauty for Eli. He relished the physicality of his work, the satisfying thunk of hammer against nail, the steady rhythm of the power saw cutting through wood.  

Today, though, Eli's mind wasn't entirely on the task at hand. A nagging unease, like a knot in his stomach, had been growing for days. It started with a fleeting glimpse of a shadowed figure lurking near the construction site at dusk, then progressed to whispers among the other workers about strange occurrences – tools disappearing overnight, machinery malfunctioning inexplicably. Eli scoffed at first, chalking it up to superstition and overactive imaginations. But now, as he stared at the unfinished facade, a shiver ran down his spine. Something wasn't right.
