Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, blurring the already fading light of the late autumn afternoon. Amelia Croft sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The waiting room was empty except for Mrs. Henderson's aging tabby, Whiskers, who lay curled in a sunbeam that somehow still managed to pierce through the gloom. 

Amelia loved Whisker's purrs almost as much as she loved solving the mysteries of animal ailments. But today, even the rhythmic rumble couldn't soothe her unease. A call earlier that morning had sent a shiver down her spine: a frantic farmer reporting his prize bull, Brutus, down with unknown symptoms. Something about the urgency in the man's voice and the cryptic description of Brutus' condition whispered danger.  As Amelia gathered her kit, she couldn't shake the feeling that this case would be unlike any she'd faced before.
