Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the already fading city lights into an impressionistic smear. Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over everything. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and anxiety.

Something about this patient, something she couldn't quite place, filled her with a sense of foreboding.
