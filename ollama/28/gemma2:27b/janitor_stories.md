The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow across the deserted gymnasium floor. Dust motes danced in the stale air, swirling around Ellie's mop as she pushed it back and forth, her movements slow and deliberate. The smell of old sweat and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a scent Ellie had grown strangely accustomed to over her twenty years working as the night janitor at St. Augustine's Academy.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Ellie's spine as she worked. The silence was too profound, broken only by the squeak of her mop and the distant drip of a leaky faucet somewhere in the labyrinthine corridors of the school.  Usually, even at this late hour, there would be the muffled sound of music from a student practice session or the click-clack of a teacher grading papers.

Ellie paused, leaning her mop against the bleachers and listening intently. Nothing. Just the unsettling quiet and the faint echo of her own heartbeat. 

A sudden crash from the direction of the art room sent a jolt through Ellie's system. She grabbed the heavy flashlight clipped to her belt, its beam slicing through the shadows as she cautiously approached the source of the noise.
