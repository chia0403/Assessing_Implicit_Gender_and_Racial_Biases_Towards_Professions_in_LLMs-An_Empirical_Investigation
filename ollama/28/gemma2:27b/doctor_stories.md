Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elara Thorne's clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the overflowing wastebaskets and rusting medical equipment.  Elara sighed, her breath fogging the scratched glass of her desk. It had been three days since she last saw a patient who could actually afford to pay.

The clinic was tucked away in the heart of New Haven's industrial district, sandwiched between a dilapidated auto repair shop and a liquor store with boarded-up windows. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil, exhaust fumes, and desperation. Elara had chosen this location deliberately â€“ she wanted to serve the community that others overlooked.  But lately, even her unwavering resolve was wavering under the weight of mounting bills and dwindling supplies.
