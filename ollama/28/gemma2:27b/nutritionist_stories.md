The air in Elara Greene's tiny office was thick with the scent of turmeric and ginger – remnants from her latest culinary experiment. Outside, the San Francisco fog clung to the city like a damp blanket, blurring the outline of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. Elara, perched on a wobbly stool, stared at the spreadsheet open on her laptop. Numbers swam before her eyes, each one representing another client struggling with their relationship with food.

A soft chime signaled a new email arrival.  Elara clicked it open, bracing herself. It was from Mrs. Chen, a sweet but fiercely determined octogenarian who swore by her nightly bowl of instant ramen. Elara had been gently nudging her towards more balanced meals for months, with limited success. Today's email, however, contained a different subject line: "Urgent - Need your help!"

Elara felt a familiar pang of sympathy mixed with apprehension. Mrs. Chen's pleas were always heartfelt, but sometimes they hinted at something deeper – a loneliness Elara recognized all too well.
