The scent of turmeric and ginger hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of lime.  Eleanor Cartwright, RD, paused, inhaling deeply. It was a familiar comfort, a reminder of why she'd chosen this path: to help people find joy and nourishment through food, not deprivation. She adjusted the overflowing basket on her arm – mangoes bursting with sunshine, ruby red tomatoes still warm from the market, bundles of fragrant cilantro – and stepped into the bustling kitchen. 

Sunlight streamed through the arched window above the sink, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. This wasn't Eleanor's usual sterile hospital setting. It was Mrs. Alvarez's home, a vibrant testament to a lifetime spent surrounded by family and flavor. But lately, that vibrancy had dimmed. Mrs. Alvarez, once a whirlwind of energy who could whip up a feast for twenty with a smile, now moved slowly, her eyes clouded with fatigue. Her diabetes was spiraling out of control, and Eleanor was here to help her reclaim her health, one delicious bite at a time.
