Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Millie Carmichael's aging Buick, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of sound. The wipers struggled to keep pace with the deluge, smearing streaks across the windshield and obscuring her view of the winding mountain road. Frustration tightened its icy grip around Millie's chest. This was not how she envisioned showing a multi-million dollar estate nestled in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains. 

She imagined sunshine dappling through ancient oak trees, highlighting the sprawling lawns and meticulously manicured gardens. Instead, she was battling biblical rain, her neatly pressed blazer clinging damply to her frame. The GPS insisted she was mere minutes from her destination, "The Hemlock Estate," but Millie couldn't help but feel a gnawing sense of doubt. What if the buyers, a notoriously demanding tech couple from Silicon Valley, balked at the weather? Would they even be able to see the breathtaking mountain views through this curtain of water?
