The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of sawdust, both familiar comforts to Thaddeus "Teddy" Blackwood. Dawn was barely breaking over Greymont, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street outside his shop, Blackwood & Son Butchers. The early morning chill still clung to Teddy's woolen apron as he surveyed the rows of glistening carcasses, each one a testament to his skill and his family's legacy. 

Greymont was a town steeped in tradition, its inhabitants bound by generations-old rituals and unspoken rules. Blackwood & Son had been a fixture for over a century, its chipped wooden sign hanging precariously above the doorway like a watchful gargoyle. Teddy knew every crack in the floorboards, every rustle of the ancient scales, every creak of the meat hooks that swayed gently from the ceiling. 

But something felt different this morning. A shiver ran down his spine, unrelated to the cold. The silence felt heavier than usual, punctuated only by the drip-drip-drip of melting ice onto the stone floor. Teddy couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, a sensation that prickled at the back of his neck.
