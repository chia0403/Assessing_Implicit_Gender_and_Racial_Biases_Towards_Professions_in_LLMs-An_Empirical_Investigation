Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's clinic, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. The rhythmic drumming was an unwelcome counterpoint to the throbbing pain radiating from Evelyn's own neck. Two weeks ago she'd tweaked it adjusting a particularly stubborn rugby player, and it seemed the injury was refusing to cooperate with her usual chiropractic self-care routine.

Evelyn sighed, pushing away thoughts of her aching muscles and focusing on the patient list for the afternoon. A steady stream of appointments filled the schedule: a stressed-out lawyer with persistent shoulder pain, a retired ballerina struggling with arthritis, and a young musician plagued by carpal tunnel syndrome.  But one name stood out â€“ Mrs. Beatrice Hawthorne. The elderly woman had been referred by Evelyn's childhood friend, Emily, and something about the vague description of "chronic discomfort" piqued Evelyn's curiosity.

The clinic itself was small, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Seattle. Brick walls lined with vintage anatomical charts met polished hardwood floors, creating an atmosphere both comforting and professional. The faint scent of lavender oil from her diffuser mingled with the earthy aroma of sandalwood incense, a combination Evelyn found soothing for both herself and her patients. 

As the rain intensified, casting shadows across the waiting room, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that Mrs. Hawthorne's visit would be anything but ordinary.
