Rain lashed against the windows of "Restore & Revive Physical Therapy," blurring the neon "Open" sign hanging crookedly above the door. Inside, Evelyn Rosalind Cartwright sighed, rubbing weary circles on her temples. The rhythmic thumping of rain mirrored the ache in her own chest, a dull throb that had nothing to do with muscle strain.

Her practice, once bustling with patients eager for recovery, now sat eerily quiet. Months ago, word had spread through Willow Creek about the new "miracle" clinic on the edge of town, boasting futuristic treatments and guaranteed results. Evelyn's old-school methods, emphasizing personalized care and hands-on therapy, suddenly felt archaic in comparison.

The phone remained stubbornly silent. Outside, a lone dog yipped forlornly, its mournful cry echoing Evelyn's own growing sense of despair. She needed to do something drastic, something bold, before "Restore & Revive" faded into oblivion like a forgotten dream.
