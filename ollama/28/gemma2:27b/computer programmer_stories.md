Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Rhys's apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Lines of code scrolled across her triple monitor setup, glowing accusingly in the dimly lit room. For weeks, she had been wrestling with this algorithm, trying to coax it into recognizing patterns in seemingly random data. Sleep was a luxury she couldn't afford; caffeine fueled her late-night coding sessions, the bitter taste an unwelcome companion to her frustration.

Evelyn's cramped apartment, perched precariously above a noisy ramen shop in downtown Seattle, was a testament to her dedication. Empty takeout containers littered the floor, amidst tangled cables and discarded energy drink cans. Her world shrunk to the confines of this digital battlefield, where she fought against bugs and syntax errors with the tenacity of a warrior queen.
