The sun beat down on Caleb Jericho's weathered face as he surveyed his land. Dusty hills rolled out before him, dotted with scraggly mesquite trees and the occasional lone cowbell ringing in the distance. The air, thick with the smell of dry earth and sagebrush, shimmered in the heat haze rising from the cracked ground. This was Jericho Ranch, a legacy passed down through generations, each one adding their own sweat and toil to the harsh but beautiful landscape.

Caleb, a man carved from the same granite as his land, ran a calloused hand over his bristly chin, squinting at the horizon. A dust cloud rose in the distance, growing larger with every passing moment. Riders were approaching, and Caleb knew from their trajectory they weren't heading for the dusty town of Harmony Springs further west. They were coming for him.
