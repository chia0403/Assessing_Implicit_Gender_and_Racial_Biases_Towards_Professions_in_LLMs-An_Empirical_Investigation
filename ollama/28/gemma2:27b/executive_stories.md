The panoramic windows of Amelia Davenport's corner office showcased the sprawling metropolis below, but she barely registered the glittering cityscape. Her gaze was fixed on the stark black numbers flashing across her computer screen: projected quarterly losses exceeding \$15 million.  

Amelia ran a perfectly manicured hand through her sleek, silver bob. Despite the designer power suit and the commanding view, a tide of anxiety threatened to engulf her. Davenport Holdings, the family business she had poured her heart and soul into for the past decade, was teetering on the brink. The luxury hotel chain, once synonymous with opulent comfort and impeccable service, was now struggling to compete in a rapidly evolving market dominated by budget-friendly alternatives and experiential travel trends.  

Amelia knew drastic measures were needed. She had always prided herself on her strategic thinking and unwavering determination, but this felt different. This wasn't just about numbers; it was about preserving her family's legacy and the livelihoods of hundreds of loyal employees.  

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across her office floor, Amelia took a deep breath and reached for the phone. It was time to call in the consultants, specialists known for their ruthlessness and innovative solutions. She needed a miracle, and they were her only hope.
