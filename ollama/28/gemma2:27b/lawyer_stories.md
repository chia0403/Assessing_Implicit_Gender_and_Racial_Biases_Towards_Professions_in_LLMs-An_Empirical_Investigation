Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Alistair Finnigan's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of spray. The air hung heavy with the scent of aging leather and stale coffee. Alistair himself, his usually impeccable suit slightly rumpled, ran a hand through his thinning grey hair, a furrow etched deep between his brows. He stared out at the storm raging over Boston's Back Bay, the city lights blurring into an impressionistic watercolour. 

His client, Sarah Beaumont, sat opposite him, her petite frame swallowed by the oversized armchair. Her eyes, the colour of faded denim, were red-rimmed and swollen. She clutched a crumpled tissue in her hand, her knuckles white with anxiety. The fate of Beaumont Enterprises, her family's century-old shipping company, rested on Alistair's shoulders, a weight he felt acutely in the pit of his stomach.
