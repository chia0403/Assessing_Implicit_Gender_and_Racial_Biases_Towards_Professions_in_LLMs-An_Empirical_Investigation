The flickering neon sign outside The Rusty Spatula cast an unsettling green glow across Amelia Cartwright's freckled face as she unlocked the back door. It was barely 5 AM, but the diner already smelled faintly of bacon grease and burnt coffee, a scent Amelia had come to associate with both comfort and exhaustion. She sighed, flipping on the overhead lights and revealing the familiar scene: red vinyl booths lining the walls, a worn counter running along one side, and the ancient jukebox humming softly in the corner. 

Amelia loved The Rusty Spatula, even if it wasn't exactly glamorous. It was her haven, her escape from the monotony of her life outside its greasy embrace. Today, though, something felt off. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine as she noticed a single, dusty rose lying on the counter, its petals tinged crimson in the artificial light.  She hadn't seen anything like it before. Who would leave a rose at The Rusty Spatula?
