The air in the cramped workshop hung heavy with the scent of solder and ozone. Static crackled from the half-assembled radios scattered across the workbench like forgotten toys.  Elias Finchley, his forehead beaded with sweat despite the late autumn chill outside, tightened a screw on a vintage Zenith console, his brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of his cluttered shop on the edge of the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven. Elias wasn't fazed by the storm; it was just another Tuesday night wrestling with recalcitrant vacuum tubes and frayed wiring.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A peculiar frequency, barely perceptible amidst the usual cacophony of radio waves, seemed to be pulling at him. It pulsed faintly, a rhythmic beat like a distant heartbeat. Elias paused, tilting his head as if listening for a whispered secret. He knew Oakhaven's airwaves intimately; every station, every ham operator, every stray signal was familiar territory. This, however, was something entirely new.  Curiosity piqued, he reached for the dial of his ancient oscilloscope, a relic from a bygone era, its cathode ray tube glowing with an ethereal green light.
