Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Reginald "Reggie" Bartholomew's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cramped space. Reggie himself was hunched over a workbench, his grease-stained hands delicately manipulating a tangle of copper pipes. He swore under his breath, a low growl that was swallowed by the relentless drumming of the storm. 

The smell of mildew and old tools hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the sharp tang of flux and soldering paste. Outside, the wind howled through the alleyway behind Reggie's shop, whipping up puddles into miniature whirlpools. The neon sign above his door, a sputtering red "Bartholomew Plumbing: No Leak Too Big or Small," flickered precariously in the gloom.

Tonight, Reggie wasn't dealing with leaky faucets or clogged drains. Tonight, he was wrestling with a demon â€“ a recalcitrant shower valve that refused to cooperate. He needed this job done; Mrs. Higgins, his most prized customer, wouldn't be pleased if her morning shower turned into a scalding nightmare again.

But as the rain intensified and the thunder grumbled ominously, Reggie couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The air crackled with an unfamiliar tension, and the shadows in the workshop seemed to writhe and deepen. He glanced nervously at the flickering neon sign, wondering if it was just the storm playing tricks on his weary mind.
