The relentless Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning his collar red beneath the grime. Dust devils danced across the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him, mocking the futility of trying to contain their swirling chaos. Eli squinted at the horizon, where shimmering heat waves blurred the jagged outline of the distant mountains. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grease across his forehead.

He was perched precariously on the back of a rumbling dump truck, its engine groaning like a weary beast as it deposited another load of asphalt onto the parched earth. The air throbbed with the rhythmic clangs of shovels and hammers, a symphony of construction punctuated by the occasional guttural roar of a passing eighteen-wheeler. Eli was part of a crew tasked with repairing a stretch of Highway 50, a desolate artery slicing through the heart of the Mojave Desert. It wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills and kept him moving forward, one mile marker at a time.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease wormed its way under Eli's skin, whispering warnings he couldn't quite decipher. The silence between the clangs of his co-workersâ€™ tools seemed louder than usual, broken only by the insistent buzz of cicadas and the occasional mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead.
