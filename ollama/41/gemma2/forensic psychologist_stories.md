The air hung heavy with the scent of bleach and despair. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her brow furrowed beneath the fluorescent lights, surveyed the scene before her. It wasn't the carnage that bothered her - she’d seen worse, dealt with far more disturbing acts as a forensic psychologist for the Chicago Police Department.

This wasn't just another statistic, another nameless victim added to the city's ever-growing list.

But now, it felt suffocating, the scent of turpentine battling against the metallic tang of blood. Eleanor took a deep breath, pushing aside her own grief, reminding herself that this was a case, a puzzle to be solved, a woman's story waiting to be pieced together.
