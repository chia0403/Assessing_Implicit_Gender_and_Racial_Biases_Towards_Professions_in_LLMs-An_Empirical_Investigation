The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Bright's porch swing as she watched the last leaves flutter down from the ancient oak tree in her yard. The air held the crisp scent of fallen autumn and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort that always signaled the approaching holiday season. Ellie sighed, running a hand through her unruly auburn hair, the weight of the day settling heavily upon her shoulders. 

Her small veterinary clinic, nestled on the outskirts of Maple Creek, had been overflowing with anxious pet owners all week. The annual migration of Canada geese had begun, bringing with it an unfortunate rise in avian flu cases and a wave of worried calls about their beloved feathered companions. Ellie, despite her exhaustion, wouldn't have traded her job for anything.  

The soft chime of the front door bell pulled Ellie from her musings. A young woman, eyes red-rimmed and cheeks flushed with worry, stood on her porch, cradling a small, shivering ball of white fluff in her arms. 


"Please, Dr. Bright," the woman choked out, "my kittenâ€¦ he's not well."
