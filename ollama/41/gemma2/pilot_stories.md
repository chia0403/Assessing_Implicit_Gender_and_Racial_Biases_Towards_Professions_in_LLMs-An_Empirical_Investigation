The desert air shimmered with heat, blurring the edges of Joshua's vision as he squinted at the landing strip ahead. A ribbon of cracked earth snaking across the ochre landscape, it was barely more than a suggestion under the relentless Arizona sun. This wasn't exactly the kind of runway Captain Jericho Hayes preferred to land on, but desperation had a way of narrowing your options.  Jericho, as he was known by most, ran a calloused hand over his worn leather pilot helmet, the familiar texture grounding him amidst the chaos swirling in his mind. His mission: deliver a vital medical package to the isolated settlement of Dustbowl before nightfall, a journey fraught with risk and shrouded in secrecy.

Dust billowed behind them, painting the sky a hazy orange as Jericho wrestled the aircraft towards the landing strip. He was running out of time, options, and perhaps most importantly, fuel.
