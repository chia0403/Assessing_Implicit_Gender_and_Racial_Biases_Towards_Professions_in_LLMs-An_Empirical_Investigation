The victim, identified by his driver’s license clutched in his pale hand, was Richard Beaumont Jr., heir to the Beaumont Oil fortune and known for throwing lavish parties that spilled onto the quiet streets. Amy could almost hear the echoes of laughter and clinking glasses from the night before, a stark contrast to the stillness that now pervaded the scene.
