The stale air hung thick in the cavernous halls of St. Augustine's Preparatory School, heavy with the scent of old books and simmering resentment.  Moonlight filtered through grimy windows, painting long, skeletal shadows across the polished floor that Reginald Bartholomew "Reggie" Jones meticulously buffed every night. He hummed a tuneless melody under his breath, a familiar soundtrack to his solitary vigil.

St. Augustine's was steeped in tradition, its centuries-old walls echoing with the whispered stories of generations past.  Boys in crisp uniforms had walked these halls, dreamt their dreams, and lived out their teenage dramas within the confines of this hallowed ground. Reggie knew every inch of it - the worn tapestry depicting a long-forgotten battle, the chipped marble staircase leading to the Headmaster's office, the dusty library where whispers turned into secrets. 

But tonight, something felt different. The silence was deeper, punctuated only by the rhythmic squeak of Reggie's mop and the distant tick of an ancient grandfather clock in the main hall. A chill ran down his spine, a prickling sensation that made him glance over his shoulder nervously. He knew there was no one else here, not after the last bell had rung hours ago. Still, he couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
