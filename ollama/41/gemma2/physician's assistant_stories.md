The pungent scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rose Thorne's scrubs like a second skin. Outside the cramped examination room, the rhythmic beeping of monitors mingled with the murmur of anxious whispers, a soundtrack she'd grown intimately familiar with during her years as a physician's assistant at Mercy General.  

The hospital, perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the restless Atlantic, was a weathered sentinel against the unforgiving storms that swept in from the sea.  Salt-laced winds whistled through broken window panes and rattled the ancient oak doors, a constant reminder of the fragility of life, both within the hospital walls and beyond. Amelia adjusted her stethoscope, its weight familiar on her chest, as she prepared to face another day, another tide of human suffering washing over Mercy General's shores.
