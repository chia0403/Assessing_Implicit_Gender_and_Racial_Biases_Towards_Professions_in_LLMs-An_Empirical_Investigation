The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Quillfeather's head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the mountains of paperwork spread across her desk. The air in her tiny office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the January wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windowpanes and reminding everyone within earshot that tax season had officially begun.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She'd been an income tax preparer for over fifteen years, long enough to know that this was her favorite time of year â€“ the quiet chaos before the storm, when the familiar scent of anxiety hung in the air and clients flocked to her door like weary pilgrims seeking solace from the IRS. 

This year, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck told Amelia that something wasn't quite right. She couldn't put her finger on it, but a sense of unease lingered in the air, heavier than the usual stress of tax season.  


The setting is:

* **Amelia's small, cluttered office:** Overwhelmed by paperwork and the faint scent of desperation.
* **A bleak January day outside:** The wind howls and reflects the tense atmosphere inside.
