The acrid bite of smoke stung Emilia "Em" Reyes' nostrils as she burst through the door of the abandoned warehouse. Her headlamp sliced through the smoky haze, revealing a chaotic scene. Rusted machinery lay strewn across the floor, sparks spitting from exposed wires like angry fireflies. A single flickering bulb cast long, dancing shadows on the cracked concrete walls. 

Em crouched beside the source of the emergency call – a young man with blood seeping from a deep gash on his arm. His breathing was shallow, his face pale and clammy with pain. "Hey," Em said softly, her voice calm despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. "I'm an EMT, I'm here to help. Can you tell me what happened?"

The warehouse, a forgotten relic of a bygone industrial era, stood on the edge of the city, shrouded in whispers and shadowed by its own crumbling history.  Tonight, it was the stage for a scene Em had seen before – desperation, pain, and the fragile thread of life hanging in the balance.
