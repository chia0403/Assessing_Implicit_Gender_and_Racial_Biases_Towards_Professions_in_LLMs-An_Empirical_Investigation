The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Eleanor Blackwood's waiting room.  The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and nervous anticipation. A worn copy of "Runners World" lay open on the small coffee table, its pages dog-eared and stained with what could only be assumed to be marathon runner sweat. A grandfather clock ticked loudly in the corner, each clang a hammer blow against Eleanor's mounting frustration. 

It was nearly noon, and she was still waiting for her first patient of the day. The morning had started with a jammed hip flexor – a common complaint in this town filled with weekend warriors obsessed with CrossFit – followed by an email from the insurance company threatening to cut their reimbursement rates. But nothing compared to the crushing silence of an empty waiting room. 

Eleanor sighed, twisting a strand of her auburn hair around her finger. She loved her work, helping people reclaim their bodies and lives through chiropractic care. It was why she'd moved back to Oakhaven after years in Chicago, eager to bring her skills to this sleepy town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. But sometimes, like today, she felt utterly alone in her pursuit.


**Setting:** A small, cozy chiropractic clinic in Oakhaven, North Carolina – a fictional town with a population of around 5,000, located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The clinic is decorated with calming colors and natural elements, but the sterile air and empty waiting room hint at the financial struggles Eleanor faces.
