The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the golden haze. Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of the mahogany table he was building. This one was for Mrs. Hemmings, a local schoolteacher, and Elias had poured extra care into its craftsmanship. He wanted it to be more than just furniture; he wanted it to be a piece that would last generations, a testament to his skill and dedication. 

The workshop, nestled on the outskirts of Oakhaven, was a ramshackle affair built by his grandfather. Over time, Elias had added extensions and renovations, each bearing the mark of his own design and labor. The walls were lined with shelves overflowing with tools â€“ gleaming planes, chisels honed to razor sharpness, and intricate carving tools. It was a sanctuary for Elias, a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of creation, the satisfying thud of hammer on nail, the rasping whisper of sandpaper.  

But today, a sense of unease lingered beneath the familiar comfort. The news had spread through Oakhaven like wildfire: strange occurrences were plaguing the nearby forest, whispers of shadowy figures and unnatural sounds. Elias dismissed it as superstition, the product of an overactive imagination. He was a man of wood and tools, not ghosts and legends. Yet, a prickle of unease persisted, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that he couldn't ignore.
