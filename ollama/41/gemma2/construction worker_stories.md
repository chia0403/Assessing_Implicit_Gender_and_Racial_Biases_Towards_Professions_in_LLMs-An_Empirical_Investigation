The sun beat down on Bartholomew “Bart” O’Malley's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, each drop of sweat clinging to his skin like tiny beads of molten gold.  Dust devils danced across the barren expanse of the construction site, swirling around his worn steel-toe boots and kicking up plumes of grit that stung his nostrils. The air hung heavy with the smell of fresh concrete, welding fumes, and the metallic tang of anticipation – a potent mix for a man whose life was as rough-hewn as the scaffolding he climbed daily.

Bart squinted through the haze at the towering skeleton of steel and glass rising before him, a monument to ambition and progress in the heart of Chicago's ever-shifting skyline. It was supposed to be a beacon of hope, a new landmark for the city – but to Bart, it was just another pile of bricks and beams demanding his sweat and labor.
