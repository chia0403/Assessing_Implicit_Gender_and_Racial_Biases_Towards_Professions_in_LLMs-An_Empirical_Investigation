The scent of rain-soaked asphalt and jasmine hung heavy in the air as Dr. Amelia Rosalind Carter stepped out of her office building. The San Francisco fog, always a fickle mistress, had rolled in thick and fast, swallowing the golden afternoon light and leaving behind a muted twilight. Streetlamps flickered to life, casting an orange glow on the slick cobblestones, turning them into shimmering ribbons of liquid gold. 

Amelia adjusted her navy peacoat collar against the chill, its warmth a small comfort against the gnawing unease that had settled in her stomach all day. Her current patient, a man named Elias Thorne, had been particularly troubled in their last session. He spoke of shadows, whispers, and a pervasive sense of dread that clung to him like a shroud. Amelia knew the line between clinical diagnoses and genuine paranormal phenomena was blurry, but Elias's desperation felt different, raw and unsettlingly real.  


As she walked towards her car, a lone figure emerged from the fog across the street. He stood motionless, his face obscured by the swirling mist, watching her with an intensity that made Amelia's heart hammer against her ribs. She hesitated, then quickened her pace, pulling out her keys as she approached her car. The figure remained, a silent, spectral observer in the deepening gloom.  


Amelia slid into the driver's seat, locking the door behind her and letting out a shaky breath. She wasn't sure if it was just Elias's unsettling story playing tricks on her mind, or if there was something truly sinister lurking in the fog-laden streets of San Francisco tonight. Either way, she knew this case was about to take a dark turn.
