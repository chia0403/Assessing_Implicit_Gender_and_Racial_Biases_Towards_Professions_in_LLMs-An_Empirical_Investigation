The scent of old paper and ink clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, savoring it in her tiny, book-lined office perched above a bustling London street. The city roared below – a symphony of car horns, hawkers' cries, and the rhythmic clatter of trams – but here, amidst towering shelves crammed with first editions and forgotten manuscripts, Amelia found solace. Her fingers danced across the worn keys of her antique typewriter, the click-clack rhythm a counterpoint to the urban cacophony. 

Today, however, the usual calm was shattered. A letter, thick with desperation, lay on her desk, demanding her attention.  Its sender, a struggling novelist named Edward Finch, had penned a story so hauntingly beautiful, so profoundly unsettling, that Amelia knew it had the power to change everything... if she could just help him polish its rough edges.
