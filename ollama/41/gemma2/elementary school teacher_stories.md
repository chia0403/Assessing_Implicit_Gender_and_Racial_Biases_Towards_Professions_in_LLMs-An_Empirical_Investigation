The scent of crayons and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick like an unwelcome second skin.  She surveyed her classroom with a practiced eye, noting the rogue glitter glued to the back of Timmy's chair, the lopsided construction paper snowflake hanging precariously from the ceiling, and the alphabet chart where the letter "Q" was missing its decorative quacking duck. It wasn't chaos, exactly, but it was certainlyâ€¦lively. 

Eleanor sighed, adjusting her sensible cardigan. This was her third year teaching first grade at Sunnybrook Elementary, and while she loved her little charges with all her heart, mornings like this were a constant reminder of the unique brand of pandemonium that came with educating six-year-olds. Today felt particularly chaotic - the school janitor had called in sick, leaving behind a sticky residue of mystery on the floor by the water fountain, and Mrs. Peterson, the lunch lady, was rumored to be making "mystery meat" again. 

But Eleanor Thistlewick wouldn't have it any other way.  


She took a deep breath, straightened her glasses, and with a smile as bright as the sunshine streaming through the classroom window, she began her day.
