The scent of antiseptic and sterile linen hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of machines and hushed whispers echoing down the hallway.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows, cast long, thin rectangles across Amelia Beatrice Finch’s cluttered workspace. Papers spilled from overflowing trays, colourful exercise bands snaked around her desk like playful serpents, and a half-eaten granola bar sat forlornly beside an open textbook on neuroanatomy. 

Amelia, a whirlwind of blonde curls and perpetual motion, surveyed the scene with a grimace. Her patient, a charming but stubborn man named Theodore Beaumont, was due in any minute, and her room looked like a disaster zone. She sighed, grabbed a stray band, and began tidying up, hoping against hope that Theodore wouldn't notice the chaos she called "organized".  After all, he had enough on his plate already. A car accident a month ago had left him with nerve damage in his arm, forcing him to navigate the world with a frustrating new sense of vulnerability. 

Amelia, however, wasn't deterred. This was her battleground, and she wouldn't let anything get in the way of helping Theodore reclaim his independence – even if it meant battling paperwork mountains and stray granola crumbs along the way.  


The door creaked open, and Amelia straightened, a smile plastered on her face. "Good morning, Mr. Beaumont," she chirped, trying to sound more confident than she felt.
