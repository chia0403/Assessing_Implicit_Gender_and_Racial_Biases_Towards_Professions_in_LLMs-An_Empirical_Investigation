The air in Mr. Beaumont's office was thick with cigar smoke and the scent of old leather. Elsie Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, smoothing down the wrinkles on her crisp white blouse as she watched him pace. He ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair, muttering about deadlines and "damned journalists" who wouldn't understand the complexities of international finance. 

Elsie, however, understood. She understood Mr. Beaumont's anxieties, his penchant for dramatic pronouncements, and the way his frown lines deepened whenever his manicured nails tapped impatiently against his mahogany desk.  She'd been his secretary for fifteen years, a silent sentinel in the storm of his world. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the city skyline visible through the panoramic window, painting the clouds in hues of orange and crimson. The office, perched high above the bustling streets of New York City, felt both privileged and claustrophobic. 


Elsie sighed, steeling herself for another late night spent deciphering Mr. Beaumont's cryptic memos and fielding calls from agitated clients. It wasn't glamorous, but it was her life.  Her world revolved around his whims, and the rhythm of his day dictated her own. This office, with its faded grandeur and lingering scent of ambition, was as much a part of Elsie Beatrice Finch as her own worn spectacles and meticulously organized files.
