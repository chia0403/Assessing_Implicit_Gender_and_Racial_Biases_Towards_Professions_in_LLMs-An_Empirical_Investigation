The steel-edged sunlight glinted off Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's spectacles as she hunched over her drafting table. The air in the office was thick with the scent of graphite and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that had become synonymous with both success and tedium in her line of work.  Amelia's fingers danced across the T-square and compass, meticulously transferring intricate blueprints onto parchment paper. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she worked, a symphony of clicks and whirs emanating from the various mechanical tools at her disposal.

The year was 1893, Chicago buzzed with the promise of progress, steel reaching for the sky, bridges spanning rivers like metallic arteries. But within the cramped confines of the drafting room, Amelia felt more like an automaton than a creator.  She was just one cog in the vast machine churning out designs for the city's ever-expanding infrastructure. 


**Setting:** A bustling Chicago drafting office in 1893. The room is cramped and cluttered with drafting tables, stacks of blueprints, and various tools of the trade. Outside, the sounds of construction and city life blend into a cacophony.
