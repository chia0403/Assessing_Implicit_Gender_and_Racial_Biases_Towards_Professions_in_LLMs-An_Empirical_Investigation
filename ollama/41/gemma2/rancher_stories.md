The wind whipped across the parched plains of eastern Montana, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and dust. The sun beat down mercilessly on Jebediah “Jeb” McArthur’s weathered face as he squinted at the horizon. His boots crunched on the cracked earth as he surveyed his herd – a dwindling band of Herefords struggling to survive the relentless summer drought.  Jeb's ranch, McArthur Spread, had always been a place where resilience was etched into the very soil, passed down from generations who’d weathered blizzards and dust storms with gritted teeth and calloused hands. But this year felt different. This year, the sky seemed to hold its breath, refusing to release even a single drop of rain.  

Jeb ran his calloused hand over the rough hide of Bess, his oldest mare, her flanks as thin as parchment. He knew she wasn’t the only one suffering. His own stomach rumbled in protest, but he had rationed his last tin of beans days ago. 
 
He needed a miracle.  A desperate hope flickered within him – maybe, just maybe, tonight's storm might bring the life-giving rain they so desperately craved. But deep down, Jeb knew that even with every ounce of strength he could muster, McArthur Spread might not survive this year’s drought.
