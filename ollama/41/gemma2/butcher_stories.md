The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of “Finnegan’s Finest Meats,” each drop a tiny drumbeat announcing another dreary Tuesday morning in Port Barrow.  Inside, Thomas Finnegan, his hands still slick with yesterday's pork fat, surveyed his domain. The air hung thick with the familiar scent of blood and brine, spiced with the sharp tang of vinegar and sawdust. 

Tom ran a calloused thumb over the worn countertop, its surface scarred by countless cleavers and carving knives. His father’s hand-forged initials, "T.F.," were still faintly visible beneath years of grime. He missed his old man, the way he'd hum along to the radio while deboning chickens, the creak of his boots on the wooden floor like a comforting metronome. 

But Tom was alone now, just him and the ghosts of past cuts and cleavers whispering in the chill air. A gust of wind rattled the shop windows, sending shivers down Tom's spine. He glanced at the clock above the doorway: 6:30 am. Time to open up.  Time to start another day in Port Barrow's oldest butcher shop.
