The morning sun, already brutal in its July intensity, beat down on Amelia Juniper's neck as she wrestled with a stubborn clump of weeds. Sweat stung her eyes, blurring the meticulously manicured lawns of Oakwood Estates, a neighborhood where every blade of grass seemed to yearn for perfection. 

Amelia, despite her name that conjured images of verdant forests and fragrant blossoms, was anything but romantic about gardening. It was grueling work, hot and dusty, with more thorns than roses. But it paid the bills, and she wasn't afraid of a little dirt under her nails. Besides, there was a certain satisfaction in shaping chaos into order, transforming unruly patches into green havens.  

Today, though, even Amelia’s usual quiet determination wavered. The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and something else – a metallic tang that made her nostrils twitch.  She scanned the manicured rows, searching for the source. It wasn't until she reached the edge of Mrs. Davenport's rose garden that she saw it: a glint of crimson amidst the velvety petals, like a drop of blood on freshly fallen snow.
