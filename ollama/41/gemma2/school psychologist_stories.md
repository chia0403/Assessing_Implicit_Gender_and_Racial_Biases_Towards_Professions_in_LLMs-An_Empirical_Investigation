The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Amelia Brighton's meticulously arranged office.  A poster advertising "Growth Mindset" hung precariously crookedly on one wall, its edges curling with age. Outside the window, the playground at Meadowbrook Elementary erupted in the chaotic symphony of recess: shrieking laughter, bouncing balls, and the occasional frustrated yell.

Amelia sat behind her desk, staring at a pile of student files.  Her nametag read simply "Ms. Brighton," but to most, she was just "the counselor." A safe harbor for anxieties too big to carry alone, a sounding board for dreams that felt impossible, a quiet oasis in the whirlwind of childhood. 

Today's appointments were particularly daunting: a first-grader plagued by nightmares, a fifth grader struggling with bullying, and then... Liam O'Malley. Liam was Amelia’s biggest mystery. An eighth-grader with an uncanny talent for art, he was brilliant yet withdrawn, his eyes always shadowed with a deep, unspoken sadness. He rarely spoke, but when he did, his words were carefully chosen, laced with a melancholy that tugged at Amelia’s heart. 


The bell signaled the end of recess, and the hallway outside her door began to thrum with the returning energy of children.  Liam's name was next on the list, and Amelia took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever storm might be brewing within him today.
