The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows of the Grandview Hotel, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already tired facade. Inside, the lobby was a dimly lit symphony of hushed conversations and rustling newspapers, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice in an overpriced cocktail.  

Elias Thorne, bellhop extraordinaire (at least that's what his mother called him), stood at the reception desk polishing a brass nameplate with more fervor than necessary. He meticulously buffed out each speck of dust, the repetitive motions calming the storm brewing inside him. Tonight was pay day, and he desperately needed every penny to fix his grandmother’s leaky roof, before she ended up drowning in her own tears (and probably her cat).

He scanned the faces of the arriving guests – a tired businessman with a briefcase overflowing with dreams, a honeymoon couple radiating enough saccharine sweetness to rot your teeth, and a lone woman shrouded in an enigmatic cloak that seemed to swallow the meagre light. Elias knew every story etched on their faces, every whispered secret carried within their luggage. The Grandview was a stage for both triumphs and tragedies, and he was just another player in its ever-changing play.
