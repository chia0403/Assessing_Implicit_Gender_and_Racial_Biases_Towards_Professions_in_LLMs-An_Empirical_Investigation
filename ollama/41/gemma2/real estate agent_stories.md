The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia Beaumont like a second skin as she walked through the overgrown garden of the Victorian mansion. Wisteria, once vibrant purple, now hung limp and dusty, its tendrils snaking around crumbling stone pillars. The paint on the house itself was peeling in long, sun-bleached strips, revealing patches of cracked wood beneath. This wasn't the kind of property Amelia usually handled – she preferred modern condos with stainless steel appliances and sleek minimalist kitchens. But this one had a certain allure, a whisper of forgotten grandeur that tugged at something within her. 


The For Sale sign in the front yard had been there for months, its message barely visible under a layer of dust and pollen. Amelia suspected the original owner, Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, had passed away leaving behind a treasure trove of memories tangled with neglect. 

Amelia straightened her crisp white blouse, her tailored suit doing little to combat the oppressive heat. This sale was going to be a challenge, but she thrived on challenges.  A successful real estate agent in Savannah, Amelia had a knack for seeing potential where others saw decay. Perhaps beneath the layers of dust and time, this old house held a story worth telling – a story that she could help bring back to life.
