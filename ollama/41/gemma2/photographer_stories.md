The air hung thick with the scent of salt and decaying seaweed as Amelia Celeste Brighton knelt on the worn wooden pier, her camera lens trained on the roiling ocean.  Waves crashed against the pilings, sending icy spray that stung her face. The sky above was a canvas of bruised purples and angry greys, mirroring the turmoil she felt within.

Amelia wasn't used to being out here, at the edge of the world, alone with her thoughts. Usually, her lens captured bustling city streets, vibrant festivals, or the fleeting smiles of strangers. But lately, her camera had become a shield, a way to distance herself from the hollowness that gnawed at her soul. The recent loss of her grandmother, the anchor in her tumultuous life, left an aching void she couldn't seem to fill.


The wind whipped around her, carrying whispers of forgotten stories and the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. Amelia tightened her grip on her camera, its familiar weight grounding her amidst the swirling chaos. 

This desolate stretch of coastline, miles from civilization, was a world away from the bright lights and cacophony of her life back in London. It felt like the perfect place to confront her grief, to face the storm brewing both inside and out.
