The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and artificial cherry blossom, a cloying sweetness that was somehow both comforting and unsettling. Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois surveyed her salon, "La Lune," with a practiced eye. It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers.  Sunlight filtered through dusty lace curtains, illuminating rows of glittering nail polishes and chipped porcelain bowls holding emery boards. A single wilting chrysanthemum sat in a chipped vase on the counter, a silent testament to her mother's insistence that "even a salon needs a touch of elegance."

Esme wasn't concerned with elegance. She cared about precision, about creating intricate miniature worlds on people's fingertips â€“  a tiny dragon scale here, a swirling galaxy there, or perhaps just a simple, perfectly executed french manicure for the woman who wanted to feel put together for her first date since her divorce.


Today, though, felt different. There was an unusual buzz in the air, a sense of anticipation that prickled Esme's skin. It wasn't just because it was Friday afternoon, the busiest time of week. This feeling was deeper, more profound. Like the universe itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
