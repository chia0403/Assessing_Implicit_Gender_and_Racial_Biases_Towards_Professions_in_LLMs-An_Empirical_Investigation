The static crackled like a thousand tiny fists pounding against Eleanor Bellweather's eardrums. She squinted at the tangle of wires snaking across her workbench, each one labelled with cryptic notes in her own messy handwriting: "Antenna Booster - Possibly Possessed," "Grounding Loop - Whispers From Below," "Speaker Coil - Echoes of a Forgotten Song."  

Eleanor was no stranger to strange.  As the sole radio technician for the remote island community of Saltwind, she'd dealt with everything from faulty transmitters to malfunctioning Morse code machines. But this... this was different. The radio station, normally a beacon of connection in the vast expanse of the North Atlantic, had become a conduit for something unsettling. Whispers bled through the speakers, voices calling her name, and phantom static that pulsed like a heartbeat.  

Saltwind itself was as isolated as it was beautiful. A cluster of weathered cottages huddled against the relentless wind on a cliff overlooking the churning sea. The islanders lived by the rhythms of the tide, their lives woven into the fabric of this unforgiving yet strangely comforting landscape. Tonight, however, the familiar sounds were drowned out by an unnerving silence, broken only by the unsettling whispers emanating from the radio station.


Eleanor knew she couldn't ignore it.  She had to get to the bottom of this, even if it meant facing whatever lay hidden within the heart of the machine.
