The acrid scent of burnt wool hung heavy in Elias Thornfield's workshop, a stark contrast to the delicate floral perfume that usually permeated the space. He coughed, waving away the smoke tendrils that snaked from the charred remains of his latest commission – a crimson velvet cloak, destined for the Earl of Alderbrook. 

Elias’ workshop was tucked away on a narrow cobblestone street in the city of Atheria, its quaint facade barely visible beneath the overflowing baskets of fabric and spools of thread that spilled onto the worn wooden steps. Within, the walls were lined with bolts of every imaginable colour and texture – shimmering silks, sturdy wools, and supple leathers, each whispering stories of their past lives.  The air hummed with the rhythmic whirring of his sewing machine, a modern marvel in this city steeped in tradition. 


Elias, despite his youthful appearance, was Atheria's most sought-after tailor. His nimble fingers could coax life into even the most stubborn fabric, and his keen eye for detail ensured that every garment he crafted reflected the wearer's personality with stunning accuracy.
