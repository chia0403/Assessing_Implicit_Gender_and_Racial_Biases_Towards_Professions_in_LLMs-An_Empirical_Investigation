The air hung thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and impending rain in Ruby Clementine’s salon, “Curl Up & Dye.”  Neon streaks of pink and blue painted the storefront window, framing the bustling scene within. 

Ruby, her own hair piled high in a gravity-defying beehive adorned with fuchsia curls, expertly snipped away at Mrs. Henderson's unruly grey bangs. Her movements were precise, each snip accompanied by practiced chirps of encouragement and witty banter. The salon, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of bustling New Orleans, thrummed with the low hum of conversation, the whirring of hair dryers, and the clinking of shears against metal.  Outside, the sky had turned an ominous shade of bruised purple, mirroring Ruby's own mood as she watched a pair of unfamiliar faces enter her haven.
