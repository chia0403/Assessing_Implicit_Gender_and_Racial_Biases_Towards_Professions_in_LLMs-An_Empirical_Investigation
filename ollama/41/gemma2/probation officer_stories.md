The humid Florida air clung to Amelia "Amy" Kensington like a second skin as she walked the cracked asphalt path leading to Block B. Palm trees swayed listlessly in the breeze, their fronds rustling like whispered secrets. The sun beat down mercilessly on the sprawling Miami Gardens Correctional Facility, casting long shadows that stretched and contorted with every passing cloud. Amy adjusted her sensible beige blazer, feeling the faint sweat prickle at her temples. It was days like this she wished she'd opted for a career in air-conditioned comfort rather than one spent navigating the labyrinthine world of parolees, petty criminals, and simmering resentments. 

Her gaze fell on the weathered face of Mr. Vargas, slumped against the chain link fence separating him from the bustling open yard. A former electrician now serving time for embezzlement, Vargas was Amy's newest case. His eyes held a weary resignation that sent a familiar pang through her. She had seen it before in countless faces - a blend of regret and defiance, a desperate hope for redemption mixed with the bitter tang of unfulfilled potential.  

Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Amy approached Vargas. He offered a curt nod, his eyes fixed on some unseen point beyond the fence. Today's meeting wasn't going to be easy.
