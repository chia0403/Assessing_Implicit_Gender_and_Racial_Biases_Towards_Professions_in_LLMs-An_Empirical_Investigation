The worn brass doorknob felt cool beneath Amelia Eleanor Thistlewick’s palm. She pushed it open with a practiced ease born from years spent navigating the labyrinthine hallways of Blackwood Manor. The scent of lilies, heavy and cloying, drifted in from the grand foyer, mingling with the faint aroma of damp plaster and something else…something metallic, like old blood. Amelia frowned.  

Blackwood Manor was a relic of a bygone era, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched precariously on the edge of a windswept moor. Its once vibrant façade had faded to a melancholic grey, mirroring the somber mood that seemed to cling to its every brick and mortar. The manor was owned by the reclusive Lord Blackwood, a man shrouded in whispers and rumors, who rarely ventured beyond his darkened chambers. 

Amelia, with her neatly braided hair, sensible shoes, and ever-present dusting cloth, was the only soul who dared to pierce through the oppressive silence that hung like a shroud over the manor. She knew its secrets, its creaking floorboards, its hidden passages, and the chilling stories whispered by the wind whistling through its broken windows. Today, however, something felt different, as if the manor itself held its breath, waiting for an unknown event to unfold. 


Amelia, her heart beating a little faster than usual, stepped across the threshold and into the familiar gloom of Blackwood Manor.
