The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt insulation. Elias Blackwood, his calloused hands slick with sweat and grime, squinted at the mess of wires splayed across Mrs. Peterson's kitchen floor like a tangled, metallic serpent. The culprit, a faulty junction box, now lay cracked and smoking, its plastic shell warped and discolored.

"That was a close one," Elias muttered to himself, gingerly maneuvering around the charred wreckage. He'd been called in after the power surge fried Mrs. Peterson's entire kitchen appliance suite â€“ a not uncommon occurrence in this old neighborhood with its aging infrastructure. But this wasn't just any electrical mishap; there was something...off about it. A subtle vibration, a faint hum that lingered even with the circuit breaker flipped off. Elias rubbed his temple, feeling a familiar prickle of unease crawling up his spine. He'd been an electrician for twenty years, but this one felt different.  Something wasn't right. 


**Setting:**

A dimly lit, cramped kitchen in an aging Victorian house on the outskirts of a small coastal town, nestled amidst rolling hills and shrouded in a perpetual haze of salt spray. The town itself is steeped in folklore, whispered tales of strange happenings and unexplained phenomena woven into its fabric.  The kitchen, while functional, is a time capsule - faded floral wallpaper clinging to the walls, mismatched antique furniture, and an old cast-iron stove that still bears the scars of countless meals.
