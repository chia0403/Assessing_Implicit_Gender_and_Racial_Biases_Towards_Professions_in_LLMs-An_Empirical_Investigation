The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, thick enough to taste. A sliver of dawn bled through the towering redwoods, casting long shadows that danced across the forest floor.  

Elias Blackwood, his calloused hands gripping a worn-smooth handle, took another measured swing. The axe bit deep into the redwood trunk, splintering wood showering down like a cascade of amber tears. Sweat beaded on Elias's brow, slicking back the dark curls under his faded cap. 

He wasn't just felling a tree; he was carving out his future, every swing a testament to the legacy carved by generations of Blackwoods before him. But beneath the familiar rhythm of work, Elias felt a tremor of unease. The whispers in the logging camp had grown louder: about changes coming, about machines replacing men, about the relentless march of progress that threatened their way of life.  The ancient forest, once his sanctuary, now felt like a battleground. 


**Setting:** A remote section of Redwood National Park, Northern California, early 1980s. The story centers around a logging camp nestled on the edge of a vast redwood grove.
