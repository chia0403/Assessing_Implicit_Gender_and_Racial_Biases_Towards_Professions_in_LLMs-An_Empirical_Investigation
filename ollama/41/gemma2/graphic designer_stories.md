The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed in Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's ears like an angry swarm of bees. She hunched over her workstation, a tangled mess of wires and half-eaten granola bars, desperately trying to coax life back into the lifeless logo for "Bubbly Bliss Bath Bombs." The company wanted something whimsical, ethereal, capturing the essence of a "luxurious lavender oasis," whatever that meant. Ameliaâ€™s own vision was more akin to a stressed-out daisy drowning in glitter. 

The setting was the typical open-plan purgatory of Creative Solutions Inc., where cubicles were separated by flimsy partitions and gossip travelled faster than wifi.  Walls plastered with motivational posters featuring smiling faces and empty platitudes mocked Amelia's current state. Outside, the city throbbed with a life she desperately craved, its pulse a stark contrast to the stagnant air within these walls. 


Amelia sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Maybe it was time for a career change.  She had dreamed of designing fantastical worlds, not bath bomb branding. But rent was due, and dreams didn't pay the bills.
