The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile white of the dental operatory. She glanced at the digital clock: 8:57 AM. Her shift was due to start in three minutes, and already, the faint scent of antiseptic and coffee hung heavy in the air. A wave of familiar pre-shift jitters rippled through Amelia. This wasn't dislike for her job – she genuinely enjoyed helping people achieve healthy smiles – but a certain restlessness always accompanied these early mornings. 

Amelia Cartwright was no stranger to routines, but today felt different.  A strange energy pulsed beneath the usual humdrum of Dr. Miller's practice: a sense of anticipation mixed with the faintest tremor of unease. It was as if the very walls whispered secrets only she could hear, secrets waiting to be uncovered. 


As Amelia adjusted her mask and gloves, a sudden clatter from the hallway sent a shiver down her spine.  Had something fallen? Or was it just the wind whistling through the old vents? A prickle of curiosity mingled with her apprehension. Something in this quiet morning felt... off.
