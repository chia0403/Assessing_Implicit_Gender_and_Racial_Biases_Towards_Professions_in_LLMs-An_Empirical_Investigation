The sun hung low in the bruised sky, casting long shadows across the asphalt that shimmered like obsidian under its dying light.  Augustine "Gus" Finley squinted through the dust kicked up by passing trucks, each one a rumbling behemoth spitting diesel fumes into the already choked air. He tugged his worn baseball cap lower over his forehead, shielding his eyes from the gritty particles swirling around him. The highway stretched before him, a ribbon of black snaking through the arid plains of West Texas, as endless and unforgiving as the desert itself. Gus was perched on a rickety metal chair beside his crew's beat-up pickup truck, meticulously repairing a pothole with a hand trowel and a shovel.  

The rhythmic scraping of metal against concrete was punctuated by the distant wail of a passing siren and the insistent buzzing of cicadas in the dry brush that lined the highway. Gus sighed, feeling the familiar ache in his shoulders and the sting of sweat in his eyes. Another day on the asphalt, another step closer to retirement, though he wasn't sure if that held any allure at all. The open road had been his life for as long as he could remember, a tapestry woven from sun-scorched days and star-filled nights. But even after decades spent mending the cracks in the world, Gus sometimes felt like he was slowly crumbling himself.
