The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' van like angry fists. Inside, Bart sat hunched over his toolbox, its contents rattling with every gust that slammed against his mobile workshop. He was parked on a cobblestone side street in Old Grimsborough, a labyrinthine district where centuries-old buildings leaned precariously against each other, their foundations groaning under the weight of time and relentless weather. 

Bart sighed, his breath fogging up the dusty window. Another night shift, another desperate call from some unfortunate soul with a leaky pipe or a clogged drain. Tonight's client was Mrs. Thistlewick, a woman notorious for her dramatic pronouncements and fondness for over-the-top theatrics whenever anything went amiss in her ancient townhouse. Bart had learned to take such things in stride; after all, what else could you expect from a city built on the bones of saints and haunted by ghosts?

The rain intensified, turning the cobblestones into slick, treacherous paths. He pulled his weathered cap lower over his brow, shielding his eyes as he glanced at the address scrawled on his notepad: 23 Grimgarth Lane.  He'd need to watch his step; these old streets were notorious for hidden potholes and uneven paving stones that could trip up even the most experienced walker.
