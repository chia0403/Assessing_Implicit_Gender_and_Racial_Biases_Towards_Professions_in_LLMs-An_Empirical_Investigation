The wind howled through the iron bars of the watchtower, whistling a mournful tune that echoed Elara Anya Silverblade's unease. Below, the sprawling city of Veridia slumbered beneath a blanket of fog, its thousand rooftops like scattered embers in the dying light. A chill snaked down Elara's spine, despite the warmth radiating from the brazier beside her. It wasn't just the cold; it was the silence. 

Veridia was never truly silent. Even at night, the city throbbed with a restless energy â€“ the clatter of carts, the murmur of conversations spilling from open windows, the occasional bark of a stray dog. But tonight, an unnatural hush hung in the air. The only sounds were the wind's lament and the rhythmic thudding of Elara's own heart against her ribs. 

She tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword, the cold steel grounding her. Her keen eyes scanned the fog-shrouded streets below, searching for any flicker of movement that might betray an intruder. As a guard of the Royal City Watch, she was Veridia's last line of defense against the darkness that lurked just beyond the city walls. Tonight, that darkness seemed closer than ever.
