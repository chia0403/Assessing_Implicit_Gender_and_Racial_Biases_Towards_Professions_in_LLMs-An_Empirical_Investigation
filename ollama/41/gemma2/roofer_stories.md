The August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat slicked his brow, stinging his eyes as he navigated the precarious dance of shingle installation on Mrs. Peabody's Victorian roof. Below him, Boston sprawled out like a shimmering tapestry woven from asphalt and glass, its harbor glittering with the promise of cool respite later in the day. The scent of salt air mingled with the acrid tang of tar, creating a unique aroma that Eli had come to associate with both his livelihood and a strange sort of comfort. He squinted at the horizon, where wispy clouds were beginning to gather, hinting at an approaching storm.  Eli sighed, knowing he wouldn't be finished before it hit. The Peabody job was always a tight squeeze, particularly when the weather threatened. 


He wiped his brow with the back of his glove, leaving a smudged streak across his sun-weathered face. "Just gotta get this last row down," he muttered to himself, reaching for another shingle. "Then it's beer and a thunderstorm."
