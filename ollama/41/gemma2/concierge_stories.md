The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished marble floor of The Grand Belvedere Hotel, bathing Amelia Rosewater in a warm glow as she straightened a row of fresh lilies on the reception desk. A gentle breeze whispered through the open doors leading to the hotel's sprawling terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, carrying with it the scent of salt air and blooming jasmine. 

Amelia, ever attuned to her surroundings, noticed a slight tremor in the hand of the woman requesting information about the rooftop bar. Her practiced smile widened as she smoothly navigated the query, masking any hint of concern beneath layers of professional courtesy. It was a Wednesday afternoon, usually quiet at The Grand Belvedere, but lately, Amelia had sensed an undercurrent of unease among the guests – a subtle shift in their usual composure, a flicker of anxiety in their eyes.

Perhaps it was the unseasonably stormy weather that had rolled in the previous night, casting a brooding shadow over the normally sun-drenched coast. Or maybe it was something more…something Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on. Whatever it was, she knew, with a certainty that chilled her despite the warmth of the afternoon, that things were about to get very interesting at The Grand Belvedere.
