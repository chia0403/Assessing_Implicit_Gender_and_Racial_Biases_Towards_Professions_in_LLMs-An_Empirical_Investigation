The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of spilled beer, stale cigarettes, and regret. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign. Behind the bar, Elsie Mae Periwinkle polished a shot glass with a rag that had seen better days, its once vibrant red now faded to a dusty rose. The only other sound in the near-empty bar was the low hum of the refrigerator, struggling to keep the dwindling stock of lukewarm beer cold. 

Elsie Mae, her face etched with lines that spoke of countless late nights and even more sleepless mornings, sighed. It wasn't always like this. There used to be a steady flow of regulars, boisterous laughter, and maybe even a touch of romance in the air. But lately, The Rusty Mug had become a refuge for those escaping something, seeking solace in oblivion, or simply nowhere else to go.  And Elsie Mae, with her tired eyes and weary smile, was their silent witness.
