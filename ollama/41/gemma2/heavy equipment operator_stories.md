The sun beat down on Amelia "Ace" Rodriguez's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging her eyes as she wrestled with the controls of the excavator. The earth trembled beneath its metal claw, spitting out chunks of shale and clay that rained down around her boots. Dust devils danced across the parched Arizona landscape, swirling in miniature tornadoes against the backdrop of towering saguaros and scrubby palo verde trees. 

Ace squinted at the blueprint crumpled in her gloved hand, the lines blurring under the harsh glare. The new highway wasn't just carving a path through the desert; it was slicing through generations of family history. Her grandfather had once claimed these very hills were sacred ground, and while Ace didn't believe in spirits or legends, she couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that she was betraying something ancient and irreplaceable with every swing of her machine.  


This wasnâ€™t just another job for Ace. This was personal.
