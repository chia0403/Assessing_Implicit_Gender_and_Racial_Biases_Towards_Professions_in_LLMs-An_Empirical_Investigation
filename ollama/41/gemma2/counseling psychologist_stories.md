The flickering neon sign outside "The Lighthouse," a converted lighthouse nestled precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, cast an unsettling green glow across Dr. Eleanor Vance's face. Rain lashed against the windows, each drop like a tiny hammer blow against the glass. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of damp wool and saltwater, and a low hum of anxiety thrummed beneath the surface of the room. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing back her unruly auburn hair from her forehead. It was nights like this, stormy and isolating, that she truly felt the weight of her job â€“ guiding souls through the tempestuous waters of their own minds. Tonight, she had a new patient waiting: a young woman named Amelia Davies, seeking refuge from the storm raging both outside and within. 


The lighthouse itself felt like a metaphor for Eleanor's work: a beacon in the darkness, offering solace and guidance to those lost at sea. But sometimes, even the lighthouses creaked and groaned under the onslaught of the waves.
