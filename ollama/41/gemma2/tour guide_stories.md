The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Josephine “Amy” Reed like a second skin as she adjusted her straw sunhat. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the early hour, already promising a scorching day in the Everglades. Amy scanned the faces of her ten eager tourists, their cameras poised and sunblock smeared across noses. She was leading her third guided tour this week through the heart of Shark Valley, a popular path known for its abundant wildlife and breathtaking views. 

Amy loved being a guide here. She thrived on sharing her knowledge about the intricate ecosystems, pointing out tiny gopher tortoises lumbering beneath palmettos, or explaining the difference between a roseate spoonbill and a snowy egret. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down her spine, amplified by the unusually quiet swish of the sawgrass underfoot and the absence of any bird calls. 


“Alright, folks,” Amy chirped, forcing a smile to mask her growing concern. “Let’s get our trekking shoes on and see what wonders this morning has in store for us!”
