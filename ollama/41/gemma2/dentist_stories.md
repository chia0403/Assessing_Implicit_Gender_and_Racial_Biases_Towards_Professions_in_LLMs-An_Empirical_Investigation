The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Prescott as she donned her latex gloves. Her small dental practice, nestled on a quiet street lined with charming Victorian houses, was bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sunlight streaming through the dusty windows. The ticking clock on the wall seemed to reverberate in the otherwise silent room, each tick an echo of the waiting time stretching between appointments. 

Evelyn glanced at her reflection in the polished stainless steel tray â€“ a woman with kind eyes and hair pulled back tight in a bun, perpetually adorned with a smudge of lip balm from a patient's well-meaning but misguided gift. Today, the usual quiet hum of routine was absent. A nervous energy pulsed beneath the surface, a feeling Evelyn had learned to recognize as the prelude to something out of the ordinary. This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon in Prescott Dental.
