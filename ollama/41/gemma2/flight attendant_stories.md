The hum of the Airbus A380 vibrated through Elara Celeste's bones as she prepped the galley for lunch service. Outside the small window, the sun glinted off the turquoise expanse of the Aegean Sea, a stark contrast to the sterile, fluorescent-lit interior of the aircraft.  She smoothed down her navy blue uniform, adjusting the name tag that read "Elara Celeste" in crisp white lettering. Another transatlantic flight, another chance to be someone else for a few hours - a friendly face, a calming presence, a magician pulling out snacks and blankets from seemingly thin air. 

This flight, however, felt different. Elara couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled upon her like a thick fog since boarding in Athens. The passengers seemed more subdued than usual, their faces etched with an unspoken tension. Even the usually boisterous children were unusually quiet, their eyes wide and unblinking. 

It wasn't just them. Elara felt it too - a prickling sensation at the back of her neck, like being watched, that wouldn't go away.  She tried to dismiss it as nerves, but the air felt charged with something...off. This journey was heading towards London, a city she knew well, yet somehow this flight felt like stepping into an unknown territory.
