The diesel engine hummed a steady lullaby, vibrating through Earl Montgomery's bones like an internal metronome. Outside his windshield, the Nevada desert stretched out in a shimmering tapestry of heat haze and endless sagebrush. A rusty moon hung low in the indigo sky, casting long, skeletal shadows from the Joshua trees that clung stubbornly to life in the arid landscape. 

Earl, grizzled and weathered by years on the open road, adjusted his trucker hat, his eyes focused on the asphalt ribbon unwinding before him. The CB crackled with static, a lonely echo of the vast emptiness surrounding him. Tonight, he was hauling a load of frozen peaches from Fresno to Denver â€“ another monotonous leg in his never-ending journey across America.  

He took a swig from his lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste familiar and comforting. As he glanced at the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of his own weary reflection, Earl knew that this wasn't just about delivering fruit. This was about surviving another day, one mile at a time.
