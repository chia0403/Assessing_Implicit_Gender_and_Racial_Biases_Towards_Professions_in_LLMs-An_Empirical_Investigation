The air in "Sharp Edges" was thick with the scent of pine needles and the rhythmic thrum of clippers. It clung to everything, even after an hour of work had passed.  The only thing that seemed to break through the monotony was the sharp, crisp chime of the grandfather clock in the corner, announcing each passing hour, each ticking second felt like a measure of time itself. 

This was Aric Thorne's domain. The shop, nestled between an old bookshop and a bakery that specialized in artisanal bread, had been his father's legacy, passed down through generations of barbers. For Aric, it wasn’t just a place; it was a refuge. An arena for precision and the quiet hum of purpose. 

He leaned back, gazing at the worn leather chair before him where he'd just finished with Mr. Peterson - a man whose beard, like his age, was as unyielding as granite. Aric watched the man leave, a familiar feeling tugging at his chest – a mix of satisfaction and loneliness. There wasn’t much for an old-fashioned barber to do in this modern world, where people sought instant gratification instead of timeless tradition.  But Aric held on, hoping to weave magic with every snip of his clippers and the gentle whisper of his shears against each strand of hair.
