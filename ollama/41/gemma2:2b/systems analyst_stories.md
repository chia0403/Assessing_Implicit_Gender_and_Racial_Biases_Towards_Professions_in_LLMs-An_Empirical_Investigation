## Opening Scene

**Setting:** A bustling server room in a mid-sized tech company called "Codex Solutions", nestled within a concrete and steel complex overlooking the sprawling urban landscape of San Francisco. 

**Main Character:** Elias Thorne, 32 years old, sharp eyes peering over a sea of blinking LEDs and humming servers. He's wearing a worn flannel shirt beneath his lab coat, and a tired smile playing on his lips as he carefully tweaks a line of code on his monitor. He's hunched over like an accountant staring at spreadsheets, but for Elias, this is more than just another workday.  

**Opening Lines:** 
"It wasn't the code that was bugging him," Elias muttered to himself, tapping his fingers rhythmically against the desk as he stared at a particularly stubborn error message. "It was the silence." The server room usually hummed with the constant symphony of whirring fans and soft clicks of keyboard keys. But today, there was an unnerving quiet.  The usual murmur had faded into an unsettling stillness. He looked around, his brow furrowing as he noticed the air felt thick and static. 

Something about it felt wrong, like a shadow creeping across the familiar space. Elias closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, before opening them again with renewed determination. His focus was unwavering. The code wouldn't solve itself. He had to find what was causing this disruption.  "Let’s find out where the silence is hiding," he mumbled, rising from his seat. "It’s time to hunt."
