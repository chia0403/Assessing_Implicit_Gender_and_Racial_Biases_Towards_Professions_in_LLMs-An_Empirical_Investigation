The wind whipped at Silas "Sky" Walker's worn denim hat, tearing through his beard and leaving a chill behind that he could feel crawling under his thick coat. Above him, the San Francisco skyline was alive with the glow of the setting sun, but Sky only saw jagged black edges in the swirling grey sky. His boots crunched on the gravel driveway of his latest job: the sprawling Victorian home of Mrs. De La Cruz, a widow known for her extravagant parties and even more extravagant demands. 

It wasn't exactly a glamorous gig,  Sky liked to tell himself.  Roofing was rough work, requiring grit and sweat under unforgiving conditions. And while Mrs. De La Cruz's home was beautiful – the ornate tilework, the manicured gardens – it was also a labyrinth of hidden corners and unanticipated challenges. Sky wasn't just fixing her leaky roof; he was battling against time, rain, stubborn wind, and the ever-present ghosts of past failures that haunted him like shadows on the shingles. 

This job had been a gamble, a desperate attempt to pull himself out of the hole he dug after his last roofing contract went sideways.  Now, as he gazed at the looming structure above him, Sky wondered if Mrs. De La Cruz's wealth could buy him some peace of mind or even just a decent cup of coffee before the storm broke.
