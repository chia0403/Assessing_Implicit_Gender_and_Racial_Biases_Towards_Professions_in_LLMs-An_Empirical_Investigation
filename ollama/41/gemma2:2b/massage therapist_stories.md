The steam from Amelia’s heated stone slab lingered in the air as she surveyed her studio, "Serenity Springs." Sunlight streamed through the expansive window, dappling the hardwood floor with dancing beams of light. Outside, the gentle rustle of leaves against the willow trees bordering the property hinted at a soft summer breeze. It was supposed to be the perfect day for a massage session – but Amelia's usual tranquil aura felt strained. 

She ran her fingers over the worn-out inscription on the massage table: "A place where worries melt away."  Every day, she saw clients leaving with their troubles dissolved, replaced by a sense of calm and ease. But lately, even that simple act seemed to fail to reach the depths of Amelia's own anxieties. 

This wasn’t her first rodeo – years of experience in helping others heal had honed her skills, but there was a knot of unease in her stomach, a feeling she couldn’t quite define or let go.  Perhaps it was simply the weight of expectations, the pressure to deliver the "perfect" experience to every client. Or maybe, it was something else entirely.
