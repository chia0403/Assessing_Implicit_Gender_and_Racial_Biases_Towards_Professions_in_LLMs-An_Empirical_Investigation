## Story Opening

The neon glow of the city pulsed against Amelia's eyelids as she stared at her latest commission: a kaleidoscopic mural for a new vegan bakery downtown. The crisp white canvas seemed to mock her with its emptiness.  Gone were the days of churning out eye-catching logos and vibrant website designs that brought clients' businesses to life. Now, Amelia was drowning in abstract shapes, color combinations she couldn't quite decipher, and a growing sense of dread that gnawed at her like an empty stomach. 

**Setting:** The bustling streets of Portland, Oregon were alive with the energy of late-night revelers, neon signs casting long shadows on the cobblestones. Amelia was crammed into a cramped studio apartment above her favorite vintage clothing store, "The Second Chance." Every corner of her life felt cluttered and chaotic, mirroring the turmoil within.
