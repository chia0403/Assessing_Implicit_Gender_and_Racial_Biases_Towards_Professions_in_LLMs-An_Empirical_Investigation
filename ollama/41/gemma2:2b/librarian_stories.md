The scent of aged paper and dust clung to Amelia Hawthorne like a second skin.  Not that she minded. It was her sanctuary. The cramped, Victorian-era library, known as "Whisperwood Library" to its clientele, held the weight of centuries in its dusty shelves and creaky floorboards.  Today, however, even this haven felt unsettlingly silent. 

Amelia's fingers traced the worn spine of a leather-bound tome, its pages whispering secrets that were not meant for mortal ears.  The setting sun cast long shadows through the stained glass windows of the library, turning the familiar scene into something fantastical and slightly eerie. It was as if time itself had frozen, leaving Amelia in the heart of a quiet storm. 

She glanced at the clock on the mantle. The hour hand hovered over the stroke of midnight, its steady beat echoing her own growing unease.  Amelia took another breath of the musty air, forcing back a shiver that ran down her spine. Tonight, something was different. A new book had been added to Whisperwood's collection - a tome bound in obsidian, its cover bearing strange symbols that hummed with an unknown energy. It sat on the top shelf, untouched and seemingly waiting for her.
