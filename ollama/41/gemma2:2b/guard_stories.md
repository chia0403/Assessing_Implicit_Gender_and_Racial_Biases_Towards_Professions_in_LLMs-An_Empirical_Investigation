The midday sun beat down on the cracked stones of Aethelgard's Citadel, turning the air thick and hazy as if even the wind itself was holding its breath.  Even through his polished armor, which gleamed like a beacon against the oppressive heat, Garthen Thorne felt the sweat sting his eyes. It had been weeks since the last raid on the northern reaches, weeks of tense quiet punctuated only by the clanging of metal and the muffled grumbles of his fellow guards as they worked. 

He wasn't complaining; Aethelgard was a fortress built for peace.  But the weight of responsibility hung heavy on his shoulders. His father, the former captain, had been killed in an ambush years ago. Garthen inherited the mantle, and with it, the fear that haunted every night in his dreams - the fear of repeating history. He wasn't like his father, who wielded his sword as a dance partner and fought as if poetry were on the battlefield.  Garthen was more cautious, more methodical. And as he patrolled the outer walls of the citadel, keeping watch for any sign of trouble, he couldnâ€™t help but feel an unease settle in his gut. Something felt off, too quiet, like a storm brewing just beyond the horizon.
