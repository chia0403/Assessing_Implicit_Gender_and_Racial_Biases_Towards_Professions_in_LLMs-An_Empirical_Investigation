## Story Opening:

The mahogany door to Mr. Sterling’s office creaked open like an old man's joints. Amelia Thorne, with her crisp black skirt suit and meticulously tied hair ribbon (a detail she insisted on at all times), stepped into the space. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and a faint underlying aroma of leather and tobacco. A symphony of clicking heels echoed in the cavernous room as Mr. Sterling's secretary for over twenty years, Amelia was used to being swallowed whole by his presence. 

She always found herself looking out the window. Her gaze drifted across the city’s skyline – steel and glass spires piercing the cloudless sky – towards the imposing silhouette of a clock tower.  Every hour, its chime echoed through the air like a metronome keeping time for both Amelia's life and Mr. Sterling's.
