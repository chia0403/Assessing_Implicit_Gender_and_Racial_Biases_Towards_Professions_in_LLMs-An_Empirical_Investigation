The static crackled through the vintage Motorola receiver in Elias Thorne's hands like the hiss of a dying cat. It wasn't just static; it was a low hum, like an unseen serpent slithering beneath the surface of reality. He squinted at the faded blue paint on his workbench, its glow barely illuminating the dusty expanse of his workshop nestled within the forgotten corners of a sprawling old house in rural Vermont. 

Elias Thorne was more than just a radio technician; he was a keeper of frequencies, a whisperer to the silent voices hidden between the lines of static and noise. He'd learned his craft from the ghosts of past operators, their knowledge passed down through generations, etched on worn-out manuals and whispered secrets in smoky taverns. Elias had always found solace in the symphony of sounds that filled the airwaves, a world teeming with stories waiting to be told.

Tonight, however, something was different. The hum wasn't just static; it held an edge, a distinct urgency. It felt like... anticipation.  Elias knew, deep down, this wouldn't just be another evening of tinkering with his radio set; tonight, something extraordinary was about to happen.
