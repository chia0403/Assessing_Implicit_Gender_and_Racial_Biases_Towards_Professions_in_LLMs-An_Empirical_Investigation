The roar of the engines vibrated through Amelia "Amy" Davenport's teeth, each beat like a hammer against her skull.  She gripped the worn leather armrest of her seat, knuckles white as bone. The plane dipped sharply, sending a jolt through her and the already jostling passengers. "Turbulence," announced the pilot's voice over the intercom, calm but measured.  

It was a strange kind of turbulence. Not the usual lurching and bouncing that Amy had grown accustomed to in the 8 years she'd been working as a flight attendant for Skyway Airlines. This felt… off. A feeling that crawled beneath her skin, like icy fingers brushing against bone.  Amy knew this wasn't just a rough patch - it was something deeper, something unsettlingly silent and heavy.

The cabin lights dimmed. The usual hum of the plane's systems faded into a disconcerting stillness.  Amy couldn't help but feel like she was being watched, scrutinized, even though everyone else seemed completely oblivious. 

Outside, the clouds were swirling in an almost otherworldly dance, their forms twisting and changing with a sinister, silent grace. It was like a scene from a nightmare painted in shades of grey and black. 
 
Amy closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. This wasn’t just another flight - it was something… different. Something that felt wrong, off-kilter.  Something she couldn't quite grasp. 


**Setting:** A transatlantic flight from London to New York City, somewhere in the heart of the Atlantic Ocean during dusk.  


* **Conflict:** Amy feels a creeping unease on board as the plane encounters unusual turbulence. This is only amplified by the unsettling stillness and ominous appearance of the clouds outside. Is something out there causing this disturbance? 
* **Themes:** Isolation, fear, mystery 
* **Questions to consider for the story**: 

    * What does Amy see in the sky that unsettles her even more than the turbulence?  
    * Is there an underlying reason for the eerie silence on board the plane?  
    * What specific event or interaction with a passenger sparks a sense of urgency and danger in Amy’s eyes, forcing her to confront something beyond the usual demands of flying?
