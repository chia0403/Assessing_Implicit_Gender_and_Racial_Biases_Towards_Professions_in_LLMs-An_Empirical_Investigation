The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and exhaust fumes, blending into a familiar aroma that permeated every corner of the sprawling, industrial landscape.  It was 10:32 PM on a Tuesday, the moon a thin sliver peeking through the clouds, bathing the world in a stark, ethereal light.  Just another night for Elias Thorne, known to his coworkers as "Eli" – a highway worker with hands calloused and tanned like the leather of old work boots. 

He walked the perimeter of the newly constructed stretch of interstate, his headlamp cutting through the darkness, a solitary figure against the steel-grey expanse of asphalt.  The rhythmic chug of the construction equipment in the distance was almost drowned out by the low hum that vibrated through his bones – the earth, restless and alive beneath them all. A shiver ran down his spine, not from the cold wind, but from a primal awareness, a sense that something else was stirring in the vast silence surrounding him. The concrete seemed to pulsate with unseen energy, and he felt an unnerving anticipation build within him, drawing him deeper into the heart of this industrial wilderness.
