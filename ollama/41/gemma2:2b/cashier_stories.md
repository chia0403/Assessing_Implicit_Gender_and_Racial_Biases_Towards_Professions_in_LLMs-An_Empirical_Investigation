## Setting: 

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the sugary scent of donuts piled high on a corner shelf in "Sunny's Corner Cafe." Rain lashed against the grimy storefront windows, blurring the already faded neon sign outside that read "Sunshine Treats" – a hopeful name for this dreary, industrial corner of Chicago. The cafe was tucked between a pawn shop and an auto repair shop, a place you wouldn't want to wander into alone late at night. 

## Character:  

**Evelyn Grace Carter** – known as Ev by everyone who knew her, except maybe her grandmother. Ev was a girl trapped in a world of fluorescent lights and pre-packaged coffee pods, counting coins and scanning receipts for the rest of her life. At least that's what she expected until... 


## Story Opening:

"Hello?" Ev looked up from the keyboard with a sigh. The usual Tuesday afternoon rush had dwindled to a lone elderly gentleman in a fedora reading a newspaper like it was an antique bible. He sat hunched over his worn-out coffee, watching her like she was a wild animal being caged. "Can I help you? You seem... lost."

"Just waiting for the storm to pass, kid," he rasped, his voice brittle like old paper. "Heard this one's gonna be a doozy. Reminds me of my days in Iowa."
