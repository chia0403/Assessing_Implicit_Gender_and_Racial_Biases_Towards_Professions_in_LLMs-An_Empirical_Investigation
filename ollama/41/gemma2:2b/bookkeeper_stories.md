Rain lashed against the windows of "The Dusty Quill," a quaint little bookshop nestled between an antique furniture store and a struggling pizzeria in the heart of Portland. The scent of damp wood and old paper hung heavy in the air as Eleanor Thornton, her hair pulled back tight beneath her worn cap, hunched over a ledger, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

For years, she’d been the sole bookkeeper for this beloved bookstore, its dusty shelves holding countless tales whispered from page to page. But lately, the quiet hum of business had been replaced with a deafening silence, punctuated by the unsettlingly familiar sound of falling rain – not a normal kind of storm that brings the scent of petrichor and cleanses the city but the kind that whispers promises of something far more sinister. 

Eleanor’s heart thumped in her chest like a trapped bird. She had always been wary of Portland's hidden corners, its tales whispered by locals shrouded in secrets as old as the woods themselves. Tonight, though, something felt different. Like an unseen force was tugging at the edges of reality, blurring the lines between fiction and truth.
