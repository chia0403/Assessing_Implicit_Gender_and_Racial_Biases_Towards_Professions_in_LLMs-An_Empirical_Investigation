## Story Opening 

**Setting:**  The sweltering afternoon sun beat down on Savannah's old Victorian home, its dusty roses clinging to life despite the encroaching urban blight. The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and a faint hum of disrepair, a symphony only locals seemed to hear.

**Character:**   Eleanor "Ellie" Ashworth, a veteran real estate agent with more wrinkles than years on her resume, squinted at the house with its peeling paint and overgrown garden. She adjusted her hat, sweat dampening the brim, and took a deep breath.  It was a classic case of “fixer-upper” – the kind Ellie’s grandmother used to say would keep you up for nights, riddled with anxiety like a bad dream. 

Ellie knew this house had potential, just like she knew every other one in this forgotten corner of New Hampshire's historic landscape. But something about the sprawling Victorian mansion seemed different tonight; there was a weightiness to it, a lingering whisper of tragedy that felt more than just dust and time. The house’s past, even if hidden under layers of grime, whispered secrets she desperately wanted to uncover. 

"Ready for the usual suspects, Ellie?" chimed in the voice from behind her – old Mr. Harris, his eyes twinkling with knowing mischief as he held a glass of lemonade that seemed suspiciously frosty for such a sweltering afternoon. He was her regular client, the one who always reminded her why she fell in love with this town and its secrets. 


**Potential Story Arcs:**
