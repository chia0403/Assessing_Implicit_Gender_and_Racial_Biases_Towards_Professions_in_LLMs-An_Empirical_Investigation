The air in the workshop hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and sweat, clinging to Elias's worn jacket like an unwelcome shadow.  He stepped across the metal floorboards, carefully avoiding the puddles left by yesterday’s rain, his gaze sweeping over the chaos of blueprints spread out on the long wooden table – a symphony of triangles, circles, and lines that hummed with the potential for real things, buildings that would rise from the earth like titans. 

His name was Elias Thorne, and though he considered himself a craftsman rather than an artist, he felt a quiet satisfaction in his work. He was a drafting worker at Bramblewood Construction, a small but ambitious firm building houses, apartments, even a school for the newly-independent townsfolk – all from their headquarters in this quaint town nestled between rolling hills and the sprawling forest of Willow Creek. 

But today, Elias felt a knot of unease tighten his chest. A new project was being commissioned: a grand estate for Mr. Hawthorne, the reclusive millionaire who had become a whisper on the wind since he moved to Bramblewood three years ago. The silence surrounding the man's arrival, the secrecy of his dealings, was unsettling, and Elias could only hope this new project wouldn’t uncover something dark. He needed answers – not just about the Hawthorne estate, but about what lurked beneath the surface of their seemingly ordinary town.
