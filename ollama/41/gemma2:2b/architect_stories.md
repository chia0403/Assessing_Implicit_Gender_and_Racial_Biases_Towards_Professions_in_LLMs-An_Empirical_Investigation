Rain lashed against the windows of the penthouse apartment, its rhythmic drumming mimicking the beat of Ethan Blackwood's headache. He ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair, feeling the sting of salt water on his skin despite the humidity-controlled air. The city stretched before him, a sprawling metropolis of steel and glass reflecting the neon glow of skyscrapers that pierced the night sky.

His soul yearned for something more, something poetic, something that transcended the sterile confines of blueprints and city codes.  Ethan, an architect known for his innovative designs, felt utterly trapped. The weight of expectations sat heavy on his shoulders, a burden he couldn't seem to shed.
