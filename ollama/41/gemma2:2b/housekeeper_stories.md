The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop echoing like tiny hammers on Amelia Thorneâ€™s heart. She stood in the vast entry hall, the scent of damp wood and old leather filling her nostrils as she surveyed the imposing scene before her. The house was a cathedral of shadows, every inch choked with dust motes dancing in the sliver of light that streamed through the storm-tossed windows. Amelia's worn apron felt heavier than usual as she pulled her threadbare gloves tighter, the chill seeping into her bones even through the layers of wool. 

Amelia Thorne was not built for grandeur.  She preferred the familiar rhythm of scrubbing floors and dusting portraits in this sprawling manor, a place that seemed to exhale stories of bygone eras, each creak of floorboards whispering secrets of forgotten lives. But tonight, as she surveyed the darkened halls, Amelia felt the weight of something unseen, something deeper than the chill settling on her skin. There was an undercurrent of unease in Blackwood Manor, a darkness she knew was growing stronger with every thunderclap that echoed through the night.
