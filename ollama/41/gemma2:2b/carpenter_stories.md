Rain lashed against the workshop windows, drumming a frantic rhythm on the worn oak frame. Inside, Ethan Thorne ran a calloused thumb along the rough-hewn surface of his latest creation – a mahogany chest for a local widow's late husband. Each dent and scar in the wood told a story, each twist of the lathe a song sung to the spirit of the felled trees. The smell of sawdust hung thick, a familiar comfort that always calmed him even when the storm raged outside. 

Outside, thunder cracked and lit up the sky with flashes of purple and grey. Ethan had been building for decades now, his workshop nestled amongst towering pines and whispering willows in the heart of the Appalachian mountains.  He’d never considered leaving his beloved solitude for a life on the city streets, but lately, a strange yearning gnawed at him.  His phone rang, a jarring note that pulled him from his thoughts and back into reality. 
"Ethan," came the voice – gruff yet comforting. "There's been an accident, son. You need to come down to the village." 
He knew what he had to do. The storm wouldn't wait for anyone.  His world was about to change.
