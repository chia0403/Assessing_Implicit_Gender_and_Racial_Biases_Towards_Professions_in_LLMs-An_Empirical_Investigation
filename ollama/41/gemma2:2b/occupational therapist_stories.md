## The Gentle Hand 

**Setting:**  A sun-drenched waiting room in a quaint coastal town clinic, overflowing with colourful puzzles, stuffed animals, and posters depicting smiling children engaging in play therapy. Seashells scattered across a small table served as an ever-present reminder of the ocean breeze that swept through on days like this. 

**Main Character:**  Evelyn "Eve" Pierce, a twenty-something occupational therapist, stood at the entrance, watching the families file in and out with their children. She'd been hired for her fresh perspective and innovative approach to therapy, which resonated with the community. Eve, with her bright smile and easygoing nature, was known as much for her ability to make even the most challenging tasks seem fun and achievable as for her genuine concern for each child's well-being. 

Todayâ€™s case: a ten-year-old boy named Lucas, who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.  The diagnosis had left his family reeling, their once vibrant lives overshadowed by worry and uncertainty about the future. Eve knew she needed to help them not just regain a sense of normalcy but also reclaim some joy for Lucas. 

Eve glanced at her appointment pad, where she scribbled down a list of activities: clay sculpting, building with wooden blocks, and even a "sensory sandpit" session. As she began the daily round, a gentle breeze rustled the windowpane and the sound of crashing waves lulled her into the rhythm of this seaside town's life.
