The grease-stained overalls hung heavy on Finnigan "Finny" O’Connell's lean frame as he knelt beside the sputtering Honda Civic. The smell of gasoline and motor oil was his constant companion, a comfort that soothed the anxieties bubbling under the surface of his forty years.  He adjusted the wrench with a practiced flick of his wrist, its familiar weight grounding him amidst the cacophony of the garage's bustling life. Outside, the sun beat down on the metal roofs of the surrounding shops, casting long shadows across the worn concrete floor, but inside, time moved at Finny’s pace - slow and deliberate, a symphony of clangs and whirring.  He was a master of mechanics, his hands knowing the language of engines better than any human could ever hope to know them. But today, something felt off about this Civic. The engine coughed, sputtered, then died altogether. 


**Setting:** Finny's Garage, a well-worn family business nestled in a quiet corner of rural Vermont. A mix of old and new vehicles, each with their own stories whispered through the decades.  The garage smells of oil, gasoline, and something faintly sweet from Finnigan’s homemade apple pie left on the counter for his regulars to take. 

**Main Character:** Finny O'Connell - a gruff yet kind soul who runs his family's auto shop with quiet determination and an unshakeable sense of pride. He has spent years perfecting his craft, becoming known throughout the area as an honest and reliable mechanic.
