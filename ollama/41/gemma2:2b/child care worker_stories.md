The aroma of burnt sugar drifted in from the bakery next door, mingling with the sweet smell of fresh laundry drying on the line outside Amelia's tiny apartment. A gentle breeze, scented with jasmine and a hint of salt air, carried the sound of children’s laughter from the nearby playground.  It was supposed to be a quiet morning, yet Amelia found herself consumed by worry as she watched a flurry of activity unfold in her care center. 

Amelia adjusted the worn strap on her purse, its leather creaking like an old song, and smiled at the tiny human sprawled on the floor, attempting (with hilarious failure) to climb into a cardboard box decorated with dinosaurs.  This was her world: "Sunshine Daycare," a haven for 12 little explorers and their boundless energy, all under the watchful eye of a weary but dedicated caregiver. Today's chaos felt particularly daunting as Amelia's mind was abuzz with details about Mrs. Jenkins’ upcoming birthday party – the guest list alone had her spiraling in a sea of uncertainties.
