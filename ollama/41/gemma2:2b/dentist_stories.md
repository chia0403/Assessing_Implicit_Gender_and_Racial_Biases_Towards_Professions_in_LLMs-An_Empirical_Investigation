## Setting the Stage

The air in Dr. Elara Nightingale's office hummed with the soft buzz of electric instruments and the faint scent of antiseptic. The walls were painted a calming blue, adorned with delicate botanical prints that somehow managed to evoke both serenity and the raw chaos of a human jawbone. Outside, a gentle rain hammered against the stained glass windows, casting an emerald glow across Dr. Nightingale's meticulously organized shelves crammed with dental supplies.

"Thirty-four patients, a chipped molar in the middle of rush hour," Elara muttered to herself, tapping a manicured finger against her notepad.  The familiar routine was about to shift tonight. A new patient was coming, one whose smile held the promise of a storm and a history whispered only in hushed tones.  Elara's practiced calm masked a tremor of unease. She knew the rumors; some patients had vanished after visits here, replaced by an unsettling silence. Others claimed they encountered phantom teeth or felt their own smiles twist at the edge of perception. She wasn't superstitious, but tonight, even her sterile white uniform seemed to cling in anticipation.
