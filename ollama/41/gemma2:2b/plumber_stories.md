The rain hammered down on the corrugated tin roof like a thousand tiny fists, each one delivering a blow against the fragile structure that held the little bungalow together.  Dust motes danced in the meager light filtering through the grimy windows as Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, his weathered face illuminated by the flickering glow of the oil lamp he used to light his way, wrestled with a stubborn pipe underneath the kitchen sink.  The stench of sewage and rotten eggs hung thick in the air, clinging to Barty's old coat like a second skin.

Barty wasn’t exactly known for his finesse. His hands, hardened by years of elbow grease and countless plumbing jobs in and around Port Haven, were more accustomed to brute force than delicate precision. He was, however, a damn good plumber - reliable, trustworthy, and always ready with a quick quip to smooth over a tense situation (usually involving overflowing toilets or disgruntled wives). 

Port Haven, an aging seaside town nestled between rolling emerald hills and the vast Atlantic, was Barty's home. Its charm was undeniable: weathered wooden houses huddled together in close-knit communities, salty winds whispering secrets through the swaying palm trees, and sunsets that painted the sky with hues of fiery orange and soft lavender. But beneath this idyllic facade lived a truth as gritty as the grime clinging to his overalls: life in Port Haven wasn’t always about charming breezes and friendly smiles. There was an undercurrent of unease, of secrets buried deep within the salty air. And tonight, it felt like there was something more than just rain and rotten eggs brewing beneath the surface.
