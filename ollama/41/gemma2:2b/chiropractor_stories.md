The crisp November air bit at Dr. Alistair Finch's cheeks as he surveyed his cluttered practice office.  Pinewood Chiropractic was named for the towering pines that lined the street in front, a testament to the calming nature of his work and the gentle rhythm of life in this small coastal town. A sense of peacefulness settled over him; it was a far cry from the frenetic energy of New York City where he’d been forced to practice before escaping to escape the chaos.

Alistair’s desk, a sturdy oak testament to bygone days when time moved more slowly, sat under a large window overlooking the beach and the frothy surf crashing against the rocks. He glanced at his watch; 8:15 AM.  "Time for some morning stretches," he muttered, rising from his chair and stepping into his office’s tiny hallway leading to the treatment room. The air hung heavy with the scent of cedar and eucalyptus, remnants of his last session.

He straightened his worn bow tie as he glanced at his reflection in a tarnished mirror on the wall. His face was weathered but kind, etched by years of listening to patients' woes and their quiet moments of self-discovery.  Alistair wasn't just adjusting spines; he was helping people find balance in their lives - physically, mentally, emotionally.
