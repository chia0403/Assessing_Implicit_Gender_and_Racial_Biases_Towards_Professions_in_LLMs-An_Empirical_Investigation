## Setting: 

The air hung heavy with the scent of  sea salt and granite dust as Elara, knuckles worn smooth from years of shaping stone, stared at the massive slab before her. It was an emerald-green chunk of gneiss, thick enough to have once been a mountain peak, now resting in her workshop – The Granite Eye - on the windswept coast of Cornwall.  

The sea whipped around her, its rhythmic roar echoing the thrumming inside her own heart as she surveyed the colossal stone. This wasn't just another commission; this was the monument for the new king's coronation – a legacy Elara aimed to etch into history with her own hands. 

## Main Character:

**Elara Stonehammer**, known by all who knew her as "The Granite Eye" – not for any inherent magical power, but rather for the piercing gaze and unwavering focus she held when working with stone.  At a mere 25 years old, Elara had already carved her name in the annals of Cornwall's stone craft tradition, her precision unmatched by any other, her creations imbued with the very essence of the earth itself.


**Story Opening:**

Elara ran her weathered hand over the smooth, cool surface of the gneiss, tracing the vein of green that snaked through its core. The weight of the granite, heavy and dense in her hands, was a familiar comfort.  Yet today, even the stone seemed to press down on her with an unspoken urgency; a silent reminder of the grand monument that awaited her touch. 

A raven landed on the weathered signpost hanging outside her workshop, a black sentinel against the backdrop of the stormy Cornish sky. The bird’s sharp gaze met hers, seemingly conveying some cryptic message before it soared away into the vast expanse of sky and sea. 

"A storm's coming," Elara muttered to herself, her voice barely a whisper above the incessant roar of the waves, "And so is he."  


**Prompt for further development:**
What exactly about this monument is troubling Elara? Who is 'he'?  Why does the raven bring a sense of urgency and foreboding?
