Rain hammered against the cracked asphalt of Elm Street like angry fists. A dampness clung to Detective Ethan Rivers' coat as he stepped onto the porch of Mrs. Peabody's cottage, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The wind whipped strands of his dark hair around his face, carrying with it the scent of mildew and decay that permeated the air. 

Mrs. Peabody, a frail woman known for her meticulous gardening and even more meticulous routines, had been found lifeless in her kitchen. The cause? An unexplained heart attack at an age where most people were reaching for their walkers, not their commodes.  Her death was as perplexing to Detective Rivers as it was tragic. 

He'd met Mrs. Peabody's daughter, Abigail, earlier that day, the young woman standing on the porch like a wilted rose in her floral print dress. Her eyes, normally bright with life, were dulled and heavy with grief. "She was happy," she choked out, tracing a calloused finger across the worn windowsill. "A perfect little life, almost."  

Rivers ran his hand over his tired face, trying to gauge what was real and what was just a reflection of his exhaustion. This town held secrets like its rain-soaked rooftops, and todayâ€™s mystery felt as thick and suffocating as the air itself.
