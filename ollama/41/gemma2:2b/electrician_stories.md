Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, each drop echoing in the cavernous expanse of Arthur Thorne's workshop.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, their pale glow struggling to pierce the gloom that clung to the tools strewn across the floor like fallen soldiers. A thick layer of dust coated everything, a tangible testament to years spent hunched over flickering circuits and buzzing transformers.  Arthur Thorne, his hands calloused and rugged, felt the familiar weight of his trusty wrench in his palm as he stared out the single window that overlooked the storm-ravaged night. His workshop was more than just a workspace; it was his refuge, a sanctuary from the constant cacophony and judgment of the world. 

Arthur wasn't just an electrician; he was a man who knew the language of wires, a conductor of energy with hands that could coax life back into forgotten machines or silence the growls of malfunctioning appliances.  But tonight, even his talents couldn't quell the brewing storm within him - a storm that threatened to engulf everything he held dear.
