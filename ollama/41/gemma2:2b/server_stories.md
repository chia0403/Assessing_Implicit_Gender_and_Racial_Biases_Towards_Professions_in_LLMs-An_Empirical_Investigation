The salty air whipped at Amelia's face as she walked through the bustling crowd on Ocean Drive. Palm trees swayed in the relentless breeze, casting shadows that danced along with the revelers enjoying their sunset cocktails. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and purple, the perfect backdrop for the boisterous energy that pulsed from every restaurant lining the beach. Amelia, a waitress at "Seafarer's Cove" – her nickname given by regulars due to her uncanny ability to charm even the grumpiest of tourists – navigated the throng with practiced ease. 

Her name was Amelia Grace Thornton, but she preferred Amelia. A simple, yet elegant name that allowed her spirit to shine through.  Each day brought a new wave of characters - from boisterous families seeking a taste of tradition to newlyweds indulging in their honeymoon bliss. Yet, despite the constant flow of faces and stories, Amelia found solace in the predictability of her routine – taking orders, serving drinks, and bringing smiles with every passing plate.

The familiar thrumming of the waves was now intertwined with the clinking of glasses and laughter that echoed from the open-air restaurant. Tonight, however, something felt different. A new energy throbbed beneath the surface, a silent tension that prickled Amelia’s skin like the lingering sting of salt spray.  It seemed that even the sun had decided to take a break, sinking low in the sky, casting long shadows and an unsettling stillness onto Ocean Drive.
