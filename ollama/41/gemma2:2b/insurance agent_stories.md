Rain lashed against the office windows, blurring the neon sign that read "Ace & Sons Insurance" into a swirling mess of blues and grays.  Inside, Arthur McKinley Jr., known to everyone as "Archie," hunched over his desk, the fluorescent hum barely cutting through the rhythmic pitter-patter on the corrugated roof.  The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and something distinctly musty. 

Archie ran a hand through his greying hair, his face creased in a familiar mixture of boredom and frustration. He’d been fielding calls from a dozen heartbroken clients, each one more entangled in misfortune than the last: broken-down family home, flooded basement, car accident that resulted in a cat stuck on the roof.  It was a Monday like any other, but it felt heavier than usual, weighed down by the ceaseless rain and the unspoken weight of his own mortality.

Archie wasn't young anymore – 52 years old and still selling insurance, the irony not lost on him. But he loved this town. Maple Creek was woven into the fabric of his being, a place where stories unfolded like worn-out novels, each character played out against the backdrop of small-town life. And maybe, just maybe, he could weave a thread of hope in the chaos that seemed to be engulfing him, one policy at a time.
