The rain hammered against the neon sign above my office like angry fists, its blue glow flickering with every crash. It was 3 am on a Wednesday – a Wednesday that would soon be remembered as “the night of the missing heiress.” My name is Daniel Thorne. I’m not your run-of-the-mill private eye; I'm more like a grizzled, caffeine-addled wolf tracking down rabbits in a blizzard.  

My office door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a woman drenched to the bone.  Her platinum blonde hair was plastered to her forehead, her emerald eyes wide with fear, framed by the shadows cast by the flickering neon light above. “Mr. Thorne," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "My aunt is missing."

"Missing? And you think I can help?"
