The wind whipped around  Elias Blackwood's weathered face, biting through his worn leather coat as he surveyed the vast expanse of Wyoming plains stretching out before him. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like angry spirits beneath the unforgiving sun. The ranch, "Blackwood's End," was a relic of a bygone era – sprawling barns clinging to the foothills of a rocky mountain range, its fields bursting with green wheat that echoed the emerald hues of his late wife’s eyes. 

Elias, all calloused hands and stoic silence, adjusted the brim of his hat as he stared across the plains. Years had etched lines upon his face – deep grooves around tired eyes where hope still flickered despite a lifetime spent battling drought, loneliness, and an unyielding sense of loss.  It was in this desolate land that Elias found solace, a rhythm to his days: tending to his cattle, whispering prayers for rain, and holding onto the memory of Amelia’s laughter as he rode into the sunset. 


But lately, even the familiar ache in his soul felt different. A sense of foreboding lingered in the air, an unsettling undercurrent that ran deeper than the dust storms and whispered with a chilling certainty – something was coming. And it wouldn't be easy to outrun what was chasing him across the windswept plains.
