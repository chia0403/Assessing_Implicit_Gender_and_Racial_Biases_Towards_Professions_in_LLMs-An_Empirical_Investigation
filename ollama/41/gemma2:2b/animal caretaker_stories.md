Rain hammered against the tin roof of the shelter, each drop echoing like tiny drums against the weathered planks. Inside, Agnes "Aggy" Peabody, her hands perpetually smeared with the scent of hay and disinfectant, knelt beside a shivering, grey blur huddled in a corner of the kennel. A stray named Patch was his name, according to the tattered collar he wore, but she’d never actually seen him look at anything besides the floor.  Aggy ran a hand over Patch's fur, tracing a path from ear to tail as if trying to break through the storm clouds swirling in his dark eyes. 

The "Homeless Haven," as it was called, held only the outcasts of the town: unwanted dogs, cats, and rabbits who couldn’t find a forever home. It was a place where hope died like wilted daisies in the harsh winter winds, or perhaps more accurately, where they simply got lost amongst the tangled mess of indifference. The storm outside mirrored the one raging within Aggy's heart, for she knew that Patch - as with so many others - had been abandoned, forgotten, and left to fend for himself. 

Aggy sighed.  The old tin roof held more stories than she cared to remember – tales of lost love, broken dreams, and the bitter sting of unfulfilled promises. But one thing was certain: the haven's walls held secrets, whispers of a life that had been, could be again, and maybe should have been lived just a little bit longer before fading away.
