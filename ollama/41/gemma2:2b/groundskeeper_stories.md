The late afternoon sun slanted through the overgrown hedges, painting the once-proud rose garden in hues of burnt orange and dusty violet.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle, but for Silas Hawthorne, the only comfort was the familiar ache in his worn right knee. He’d been tending to this place for nearly forty years – since he was a boy escaping the stifling boredom of city life and finding solace in the wide open spaces of the sprawling estate. 

Silas stood amongst the ancient oaks, their gnarled branches reaching up like arthritic fingers, and felt a deep sense of melancholy wash over him. The grand house had changed hands several times since he was young, each new owner leaving their own unique mark: a splash of paint here, an invasive vine there – but nothing that could truly erase the memories etched into every inch of this place. Tonight would be no different.

Silas had been tasked with preparing his meticulously maintained rose garden – an emblem of the late owner’s elegance that he hoped to protect from the inevitable onslaught of change.
