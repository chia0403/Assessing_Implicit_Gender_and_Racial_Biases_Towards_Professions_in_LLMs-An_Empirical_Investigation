The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to lick at the horizon, painting the sky in hues of rose gold and lavender, when Alistair Finchley unlocked the gate leading into Whisperwood Manor's sprawling gardens. Dew clung to the emerald lawns like scattered diamonds, and the air was thick with the perfume of night-blooming jasmine.

Alistair, a man weathered by years spent coaxing beauty from the earth, inhaled deeply, letting the calming scent fill his lungs. He ran a hand through his greying hair, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he surveyed the grounds. It was his sanctuary, this tapestry of manicured hedges, vibrant flowerbeds, and ancient oaks that had stood sentinel for centuries. 

Today, however, there was a disquiet in the air, a subtle dissonance that Alistair couldn't quite place. As he pushed his wheelbarrow towards the rose garden, a flicker of movement caught his eye â€“ a shadow darting between the trees at the edge of the property. He frowned, momentarily forgetting the familiar routine of pruning and weeding. Something wasn't right.
