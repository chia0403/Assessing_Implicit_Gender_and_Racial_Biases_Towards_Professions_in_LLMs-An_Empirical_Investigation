The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar a shade darker. Dust swirled around his work boots as he hammered another nail into the exposed framing of the new apartment building. The clang echoed off the surrounding concrete and steel skeletons, a symphony of progress in this rapidly developing section of downtown. Around him, other workers scurried like ants, hauling lumber, operating heavy machinery, and weaving through a maze of scaffolding. Eli, however, was content to be lost in the rhythmic repetition of his task, his mind miles away from the noise and clamor. He dreamt of quieter days, maybe a small cabin nestled in the woods, where the only sounds were birdsong and the crackling of fire. But for now, he had bills to pay, dreams to save for, and a city that was growing faster than it could breathe.
