Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Flickering Lantern, a dive bar tucked away in a forgotten corner of Hollywood. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer, illuminated by flickering neon signs and the dim glow of vintage film posters plastered on every inch of wall space.  

Eleanor Vance, her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun, sat hunched over a booth, swirling a whiskey sour that had gone lukewarm. The script lay open before her, pages crinkled and stained with coffee rings, its words mocking her with their unattainable promise. Eleanor was renowned for her gritty, visceral films - portraits of the underbelly of society, raw and unflinching. But this project, her latest passion, a noir thriller set in the smoky underworld of 1940s Los Angeles, felt impossible to crack. The story, inspired by whispered legends and faded photographs from her grandmother's time, refused to take shape.


The door creaked open, ushering in a gust of wind and rain, followed by a figure silhouetted against the neon glow. Eleanor raised her head, squinting into the gloom. 

"Mind if I join you?" a gruff voice rumbled. "Looks like you could use some company."
