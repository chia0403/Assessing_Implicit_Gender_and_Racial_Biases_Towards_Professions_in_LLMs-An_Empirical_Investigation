Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the brownstone apartment, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of fury. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she surveyed the carnage before her. The once-elegant living room was now a battlefield of overturned furniture, ripped cushions, and paint swatches scattered like fallen leaves.

Amelia specialized in breathing life into forgotten spaces, but this project, entrusted to her by the enigmatic Mr. Alistair Cavendish, felt less like a renovation and more like an exorcism. The apartment, with its dusty chandeliers and faded velvet drapes, held a palpable sense of melancholy, as though it were mourning the ghosts of its past. 


And then there was the peculiar smell - a strange blend of lavender, mildew, and something vaguely metallic that Amelia couldn't quite place.  She wrinkled her nose, determined to ignore it. This job, with its generous fee and intriguing client, was too good to pass up. But as she picked up a chipped porcelain figurine depicting a scowling cherub, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something unsettling lurked beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary renovation.
