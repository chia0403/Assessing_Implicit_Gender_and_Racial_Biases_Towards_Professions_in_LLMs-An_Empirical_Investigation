The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony as Bartholomew Quill mopped the sticky linoleum floor of the Starlight Cinema. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and spilled soda, a heady cocktail that Bartholomew had come to associate with his late-night solitude. Outside, the neon marquee flickered intermittently, casting dancing shadows across the empty lobby. Bartholomew paused, his mop resting against the wall, and gazed at the faded poster advertising "The Bride of Frankenstein." He'd seen it countless times, a relic from a bygone era when moviegoers dressed up for the occasion.

Tonight, though, the only audience was Bartholomew himself, and the ghosts of laughter and shrieks that lingered in the plush velvet seats. He sighed, picking up his mop and resuming his rhythmic swish-swash across the floor. His work wasn't glamorous, but it had a strange kind of peace to it. In the stillness of the Starlight Cinema, Bartholomew Quill found solace.
