The rhythmic clatter of the ancient typewriter filled Amelia Rose Cartwright's tiny cubicle, a counterpoint to the insistent buzz of fluorescent lights overhead. Her fingers danced across the keys, transcribing deposition notes with practiced efficiency. Outside her window, rain lashed against the grimy glass of the Adams & Blackwood law firm, blurring the already indistinct view of downtown Chicago.

Amelia wasn't exactly living the glamorous paralegal life depicted in TV dramas. No sharp suits, no whirlwind court cases, just mountains of paperwork and the constant hum of legal jargon. Yet, she wouldn't have it any other way. Amelia thrived on the order and logic of the law, finding a strange satisfaction in untangling knots of legalese and unearthing hidden truths within dusty documents. Today's task was no exception: deciphering the handwritten notes from a witness interview in a complex inheritance case involving a reclusive billionaire and a hoard of priceless artifacts.
