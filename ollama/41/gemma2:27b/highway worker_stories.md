The air hung heavy with asphalt fumes and the drone of cicadas, a symphony only a man like Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley could truly appreciate. Sunlight beat down on the cracked blacktop, shimmering in waves off the freshly laid asphalt Bart and his crew had just finished pouring. Sweat stung Bart's eyes as he leaned against the handle of his shovel, surveying their handiwork. Highway 17 stretched out before him, a ribbon of grey bisecting the rolling green hills of central Georgia. The horizon shimmered with heat haze, promising another scorching day in this forgotten corner of the world.


Bart wasn't sure what had drawn him to this life - the solitude, maybe, or the tangible satisfaction of building something that would last.  He liked the rhythm of the work, the way muscle memory took over after years on the job. He knew every crack and crevice in his trusty shovel, every groan and sigh of the ancient asphalt paver. This stretch of road was his domain, a place where he could lose himself in the repetitive tasks, his mind free to wander as he worked. 

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease settled over Bart, a sense that the familiar landscape held secrets it hadn't revealed before. He glanced towards the treeline bordering the highway, where shadows danced and played in the afternoon sun. There was a stillness there, a quietude that seemed out of place with the usual buzz of cicadas and birdsong.
