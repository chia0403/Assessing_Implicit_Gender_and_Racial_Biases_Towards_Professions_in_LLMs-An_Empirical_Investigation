Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elias Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The stale scent of coffee mingled with the acrid tang of cigarette smoke – his vice, and one he was sorely tempted to indulge in right now. On his desk, a photograph stared back at him: a young woman with eyes full of laughter, frozen in time before her life had been brutally snatched away. Her name was Amelia Greene, and she'd been found strangled in her own apartment just yesterday. 

Elias ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, the weight of the case pressing down on him. This wasn't some petty theft or bar brawl; this was cold-blooded murder. And he, Elias Vance, veteran detective of the 17th precinct, was tasked with finding Amelia's killer and bringing them to justice. The city outside his window – a sprawling metropolis choked by neon lights and shadowed alleys – held its breath.

Elias knew every crack and crevice of this concrete jungle. He'd spent years patrolling its streets, facing down its darkness. But this case felt different. It tugged at something deep inside him, a sense of urgency he couldn't ignore. Amelia Greene deserved justice, and Elias Vance was determined to deliver it.
