The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Quince like a second skin as he lugged a steamer trunk up the grand staircase of The Grand Astoria Hotel. The polished mahogany banister gleamed under the ornate chandelier, casting dancing shadows that mirrored Bart's weariness.

It was late afternoon, the sun already dipping towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the opulent lobby. Guests milled about, their voices hushed whispers against the backdrop of a tinkling piano melody emanating from the salon. The scent of lilies and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sweat stinging Bart's eyes.

He hated this time of day. The late afternoon arrivals always brought with them an avalanche of luggage â€“ trunks overflowing with gowns and furs, leather suitcases bursting with souvenirs, even a violin case that looked precariously close to falling apart. 


Bart heaved the trunk onto the landing outside room 304, his back protesting with a sharp twinge. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime against his already sweat-stained uniform.

"Anything else for you, sir?" he asked, nodding politely at the portly man who had entrusted him with the weighty trunk. The man, clad in a tweed suit and sporting a monocle perched precariously on his left eye, simply grunted in response before disappearing into the room.

Bart sighed. Another faceless guest, another fleeting interaction. He longed for something more than the endless cycle of arrivals, departures, and heavy luggage.
