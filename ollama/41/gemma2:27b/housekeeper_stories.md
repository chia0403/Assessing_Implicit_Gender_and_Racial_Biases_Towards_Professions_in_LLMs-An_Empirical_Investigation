Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust rattling the ancient panes like bony fingers rapping for entry. Amelia Thistlewick, her apron already damp from wiping down perpetually dripping sconces, paused in her scrubbing to glance out at the tempestuous sky. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping the gnarled branches of the ancient oak outside into a frenzy.

Blackwood Manor was a place of shadows and secrets, its labyrinthine halls echoing with whispers of past generations. Amelia, who had been tending the sprawling estate for ten years, knew every creak of the floorboards, every musty corner in the attic, every ghostly chill that lingered in certain rooms. Yet, tonight, even she felt a prickle of unease, as if the storm itself were stirring something ancient and unsettling within the manor's stone walls.
