Rain lashed against the windows of "Serene Touch," the rhythmic drumming blending seamlessly with the soft jazz melody drifting from the hidden speaker.  Eleanor Rose Winthrop adjusted the aromatherapy diffuser, sending a wave of lavender and bergamot into the dimly lit room. A sigh escaped her lips as she surveyed the space â€“ calming bamboo shades, flickering candles, smooth stones arranged in a zen pattern on a small table. Everything about the room was designed to soothe and transport clients away from their daily worries. Yet, today, Eleanor felt a gnawing unease settling in her stomach, a feeling unrelated to the stormy weather outside. 

It wasn't unusual for appointments to be canceled due to bad weather, but today, two clients had called off at the last minute. Two appointments gone meant a significant loss of income, especially with rent looming on the horizon. Eleanor tapped her fingers nervously against the polished wooden table where she kept her massage oils and tools. Her phone remained silent, adding to her growing anxiety. What if no one else showed up?
