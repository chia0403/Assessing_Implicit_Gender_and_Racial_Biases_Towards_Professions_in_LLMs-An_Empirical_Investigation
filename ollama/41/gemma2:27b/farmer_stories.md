The morning mist clung stubbornly to Elara Blackwood's wheat fields, a ghostly shroud obscuring the rows of ripening grain. Dew sparkled like scattered diamonds on the emerald green leaves, and the air hummed with the drowsy buzz of unseen insects. Elara, her weathered face etched with years spent under the relentless sun, pulled her woolen shawl tighter against the chill. She surveyed her land, a tapestry of golden wheat punctuated by the deep crimson of poppies that had stubbornly refused to be plowed under.

Her calloused fingers brushed the rough grain, testing its ripeness. This year's harvest promised to be bountiful, a blessing after last season's devastating drought. But a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. The whispers traveling through the nearby village spoke of strange occurrences: livestock vanishing without a trace, crops withering inexplicably, and unsettling lights flickering in the night sky. Elara dismissed them as superstitious fancies, but the unsettling feeling lingered.
