The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling's office was thick with the scent of old money and desperation. A mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, dominated the room, its surface littered with charts and graphs that looked more like hieroglyphics than financial instruments to the untrained eye. Outside his window, the relentless pulse of Wall Street throbbed â€“ a symphony of car horns, shouting brokers, and the faint, metallic clang of the stock exchange bell.

Bart, however, wasn't tuned into the frenetic energy outside. He sat hunched over his desk, his brow furrowed in concentration as he stared at the latest reports on his monitor. His crisp white shirt was rumpled, his tie loosened, a testament to the sleepless nights and bottomless cups of coffee that fueled his relentless pursuit of profit.  He was facing a crucial decision, one that could make or break his career, and time was running out.
