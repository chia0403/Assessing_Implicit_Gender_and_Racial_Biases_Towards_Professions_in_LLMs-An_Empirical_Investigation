The flickering fluorescent light in Harold "Harry" Jenkins' cramped workshop hummed an unsettling tune. Sweat beaded on Harry's forehead despite the cool November air seeping through the cracked windowpanes. Wires splayed across his workbench like metallic snakes, each one pulsing with a faint electrical current. A half-dismantled vintage radio sat beside them, its brass speaker grill dulled with age.  

Harry ran a calloused thumb over a frayed wire, his brow furrowing in concentration. The old radio was giving him fits. He'd been tinkering with it for weeks, determined to bring the forgotten relic back to life. But something wasn't right. A rogue current kept tripping the breaker box in his workshop, sending sparks flying and plunging him into darkness.

The insistent ringing of his phone shattered the quiet. Harry sighed, wiping his hands on a grease-stained rag before answering. He knew it was likely another call for an emergency repair â€“ a blown fuse, a faulty outlet, something mundane that wouldn't test his skills as an electrician. 


He was wrong.
