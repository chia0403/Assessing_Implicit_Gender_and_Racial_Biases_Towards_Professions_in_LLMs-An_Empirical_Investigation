Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's office, mimicking the insistent throb in her temples. The flickering neon sign outside advertising "Thorne Chiropractic: Align Your Life" cast an unsettling green glow on the wet asphalt. Evie sighed, rubbing her forehead with weary fingers. It was a slow Tuesday, even for Willow Creek, a town where secrets were as plentiful as the moss clinging to the ancient oaks lining Main Street. 

She glanced at the clock - 3:47 pm. Two more hours until closing time, two more hours of staring at the worn spines of anatomy textbooks while the rhythmic tick-tock of her grandfather clock mocked her solitude.  Evie longed for the days when Willow Creek was bustling with tourists drawn to its quaint charm and rumored paranormal activity. But lately, even the ghosts seemed to be avoiding town.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping on the glass door startled her from her reverie. Evie turned, her gaze meeting the rain-streaked face of a stranger, his silhouette framed against the gloom. He was tall and lean, with dark hair plastered to his forehead and eyes that held an unsettling intensity.
