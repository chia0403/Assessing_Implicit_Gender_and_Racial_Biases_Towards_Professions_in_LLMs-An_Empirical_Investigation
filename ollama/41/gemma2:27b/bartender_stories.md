The neon sign outside flickered, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones. A lone taxi splashed past, its horn blaring a discordant melody in the otherwise oppressive silence of The Drunken Mermaid. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood polished a glass with practiced ease, her emerald eyes reflecting the dim amber lights strung across the bar. The smell of stale beer and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Ellie had come to associate with both comfort and despair.

It was a Tuesday night, the kind that bled into oblivion without leaving a mark. Regulars hunched over their drinks, nursing anxieties and sorrows as deep as the Mariana Trench. The jukebox crooned a melancholic blues tune, its mournful melody mirroring the weight of Ellie's own heart. Tonight, she felt it particularly keenly â€“ a gnawing sense of emptiness that even the strongest whiskey couldn't drown out.
