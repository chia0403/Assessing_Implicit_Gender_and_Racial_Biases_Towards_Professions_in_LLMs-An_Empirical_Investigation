The rusty Cessna 172 sputtered and coughed like an old man clearing his throat. Amelia "Ace" Davenport wrestled with the controls, sweat beading on her brow despite the chill mountain air seeping through the cracked window. Below her, the jagged peaks of the Sierra Nevada range stretched towards a bruised purple sky, the setting sun casting long shadows that swallowed whole valleys.

A fool's errand, most would say. But Ace lived for the thrill of the chase, the whisper of adventure calling her name like a siren song.
