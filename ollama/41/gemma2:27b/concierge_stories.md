The scent of roasted chestnuts and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting Parisian December wind.  From his perch behind the grand mahogany desk, Jean-Luc Dubois surveyed the swirling chaos of the Hotel de la Rive Gauche's lobby with the seasoned eye of a conductor leading an orchestra. Guests bustled past, their suitcases clinking like misplaced percussion instruments; children shrieked with delight, weaving through legs like errant oboes; and weary travelers slumped into velvet chairs, their sighs a mournful cello solo.

Jean-Luc, resplendent in his crisp navy uniform and impeccably polished shoes, exuded an aura of calm amidst the storm.  For thirty years, he had been the heart and soul of the de la Rive Gauche, anticipating guests' needs before they even formed them. He knew their preferences, remembered their birthdays, and could procure anything from a rare first edition to a table at the most exclusive restaurant in Paris with a mere whisper and a knowing glance. 

Today, however, an unsettling dissonance threatened his carefully orchestrated symphony. A young woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, stood hesitantly near the entrance.  Her gloved hands clutched a battered leather satchel, and she seemed to be struggling with a wave of anxiety so palpable it prickled Jean-Luc's skin. This was no ordinary guest.
