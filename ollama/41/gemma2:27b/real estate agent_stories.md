The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, turning the emerald green grass into shimmering pools of gold. Elara Beaumont adjusted her designer sunglasses, squinting at the imposing Tudor-style mansion before her. It was a beast of a house – all sprawling turrets, leaded glass windows, and enough square footage to comfortably house a small army.

Elara wasn't fazed by the grandeur. As Oakhaven's top realtor for five consecutive years, she'd seen it all: from charming cottages nestled in oak groves to ultra-modern penthouses overlooking the city skyline. But this particular listing, the sprawling estate of the late Mr. Theodore Hawthorne, held a certain allure. It whispered secrets through its crumbling stone façade and ivy-choked walls – secrets Elara was determined to uncover.
