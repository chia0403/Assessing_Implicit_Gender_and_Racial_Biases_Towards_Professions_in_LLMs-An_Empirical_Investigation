Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Physical Therapy, blurring the autumnal hues of the maple trees outside into watercolor smears. Inside, Amelia Cartwright, her auburn braid swinging with each frustrated movement, wrestled with a stubborn piece of equipment.

"Why does this darn treadmill always have to malfunction on Tuesdays?" she muttered, tightening a loose bolt with a wrench that felt far too small for her calloused hands. Tuesdays were Amelia's busiest day, packed with patients eager to reclaim their mobility after injuries and illnesses. The last thing she needed was a faulty treadmill throwing a wrench into her already meticulously planned schedule.

Her phone buzzed on the cluttered desk beside her â€“ probably Mrs. Henderson, calling to confirm her afternoon appointment for hip replacement rehabilitation. Amelia sighed, knowing she couldn't ignore it. As much as she loved helping her patients regain their strength and independence, mornings like this were enough to make her question her sanity. 

But then a cheerful voice chimed in from the doorway. "Good morning, Amelia! Is everything alright?"

It was Maya, her receptionist, radiating sunshine even on this dreary morning. Amelia plastered a smile on her face, hoping it didn't look too strained. "Just dealing with a few technical difficulties," she said, gesturing towards the recalcitrant treadmill.
