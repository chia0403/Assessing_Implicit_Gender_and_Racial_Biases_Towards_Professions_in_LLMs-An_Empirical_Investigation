As a freelance bookkeeper, her life revolved around spreadsheets, invoices, and quarterly reports. She lived for the satisfying click of her calculator keys, the order she could bring to chaos. Yet, tonight, even the familiar comfort of numbers offered no solace.

The sender promised a hefty sum, but something about the message, its veiled threats and promises of untold secrets, set her nerves on edge.
