Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumbeat in Eleanor Cartwright's chest. Her office, tucked away on the third floor of a dilapidated publishing house, felt suffocating despite the chill seeping through the cracks in the walls. Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to avalanche at the slightest tremor. Eleanor, hunched over her desk, was drowning in a sea of adverbs and misplaced commas, each one adding another layer of stress to an already overloaded day.

She rubbed her tired eyes, trying to focus on the manuscript before her â€“ "The Whispering Woods" by a hopeful newcomer named Amelia Hawthorne. The premise was intriguing: a young woman inherits a crumbling estate with a dark secret buried beneath its ancient oak trees. But Eleanor's initial enthusiasm had waned. Amelia's prose, while promising, lacked finesse. It felt like a rough draft, begging for the sculptor's touch.

Eleanor sighed, knowing she wouldn't be able to make a decision tonight. The weight of her responsibility as senior editor at Blackwood & Thorne pressed down on her. Every manuscript she accepted or rejected held the potential to shape a career, a life. And tonight, under the gloomy veil of the storm, Eleanor felt the burden acutely.
