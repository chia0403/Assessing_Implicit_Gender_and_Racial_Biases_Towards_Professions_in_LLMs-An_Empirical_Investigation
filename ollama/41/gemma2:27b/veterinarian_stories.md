Rain lashed against the windows of "Creature Comforts," a cozy brick building nestled amongst rolling green hills in the heart of Vermont. Inside, Dr. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, wrestled with a wriggling puppy. The little beagle mix, no older than eight weeks, had swallowed a rogue sock and was currently protesting Amelia's attempts to palpate his abdomen.

"Hold still, you rascal," Amelia chuckled, her voice calm despite the insistent yips echoing through the exam room. 

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, stirring fallen leaves into mini-tornadoes that danced across the porch. The storm had been raging for hours, cutting off power to most of the town and leaving Amelia feeling a little isolated. But she wouldn't have it any other way. Even amidst the chaos, there was a comforting familiarity to her world â€“ the scent of disinfectant mingling with dog food, the soft whimpers of anxious animals, the steady rhythm of her own heartbeat as she worked her magic.
