Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Agnes' workshop, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of London drizzle. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth and distant exhaust fumes. Inside, Elias Finchley, his weathered hands stained purple from a particularly stubborn copper pipe, wrestled with a leaky faucet in an ancient porcelain sink.  The water spurted erratically, mocking his every twist and turn.

Elias sighed, running a hand through his thinning grey hair. He'd been at it for hours, the relentless rain mirroring the frustration building within him. Plumbers weren't supposed to be poets, but sometimes, faced with the stubborn defiance of an old faucet, Elias couldn't help but feel a pang of creative melancholy. 

Suddenly, the door burst open, letting in a gust of wind and a woman soaked to the bone. "Elias!" she cried, her voice trembling. "It's Agnes! She's gone missing."
