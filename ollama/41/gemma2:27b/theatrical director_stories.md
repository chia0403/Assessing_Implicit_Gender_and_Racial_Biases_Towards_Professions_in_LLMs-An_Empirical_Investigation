Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the derelict theatre, the sound echoing through the cavernous space like mournful applause. Dust motes danced in the pale beam of Eleanor Winthrop’s flashlight as she surveyed the stage, her heart sinking further with each step.  This was it – The Grand Majestic, a once-glorious vaudeville house now decaying under years of neglect. It was supposed to be the perfect venue for her audacious production of ‘The Tempest’, but the reality was far from the Shakespearean utopia she’d envisioned.

Cracked plaster hung precariously from the ornate ceiling, threatening to rain down upon the dusty velvet seats below. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and forgotten dreams. Eleanor, a woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its bun and eyes that burned with an unwavering passion for theatre, couldn't help but feel a pang of doubt. Could she truly breathe life back into this decaying carcass?
