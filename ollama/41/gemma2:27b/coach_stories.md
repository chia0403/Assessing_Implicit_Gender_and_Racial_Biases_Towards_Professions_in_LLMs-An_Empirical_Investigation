Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Coach Theodore "Teddy" Albright's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated by the insistent chirping of a lone cricket trapped somewhere in the rafters. Teddy rubbed his weary eyes, the fluorescent lights doing little to pierce the gloom that had settled over his spirit, along with the perpetual cloud cover hanging over this godforsaken town.

The Carver Eagles hadn't won a game in three years. Three years of agonizing defeats, demoralized players, and dwindling crowds. Three years of Teddy questioning every decision he'd ever made, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life. 

He stared at the framed photograph on his desk: a younger, exuberantly grinning version of himself, arm slung around a group of jubilant teenagers, holding aloft the state championship trophy. A bittersweet ache pulsed in his chest. That felt like a lifetime ago. Now, even the sight of that faded image couldn't spark the fire he once carried within him.

A sharp knock on the door jolted Teddy back to reality. He sighed, steeling himself for whatever news awaited him. "Come in," he said, his voice raspy from disuse.
