The incessant drone of "Baby Shark" pierced through Emilia Rose Cartwright's headache like a rusty nail. It was barely 9 am, and already she felt the familiar ache behind her eyes, a constant companion these days. The brightly colored plastic jungle gym in the corner seemed to mock her with its cheerful hues, each slide and swing a testament to the endless energy of the three-year-olds currently bouncing off the walls (and each other). Emilia sighed, smoothing down her frayed apron emblazoned with "Sunshine Smiles Daycare â€“ Where Every Day is Fun!"

She knew she should be more optimistic. After all, she'd always dreamed of working with children, imagining herself a guiding hand in their formative years. But reality had a way of dulling even the brightest dreams.  The days were long and exhausting, punctuated by diaper explosions, tantrums that could rival Wagnerian operas, and the ever-present threat of bodily fluids. Still, Emilia persevered. Somewhere deep down, she knew these tiny humans needed her. And maybe, just maybe, today wouldn't be a "Baby Shark" day.
