Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store sign across the street.  Elara "Ellie" Vance sighed, tugging her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. The waiting room of her office – if you could call the cramped space with peeling wallpaper and a lone plastic fern an "office" – was empty save for the ticking clock on the wall.

Ellie usually wrapped things up by five, but today's case had been a real doozy - a missing sapphire brooch worth more than her yearly salary, claimed to have vanished from its owner's vault during a lavish masquerade ball. It wasn't the kind of claim she normally dealt with, Ellie specialized in run-of-the-mill car accidents and fender benders, not jewel heists fit for a Agatha Christie novel.

Still, the hefty premium on the brooch had convinced her to take it on. And now, after hours of poring over witness statements, security footage, and insurance policy minutiae, Ellie was no closer to solving the mystery than she'd been when she started.
