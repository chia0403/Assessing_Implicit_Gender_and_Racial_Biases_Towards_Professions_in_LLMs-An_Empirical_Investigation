The rain hammered against the skylight above Elias Finch's workbench, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound.  Elias sighed, running a calloused hand through his thinning gray hair. The rhythmic clatter was usually comforting, like a lullaby from the heavens, but today it only amplified the hollowness echoing within his cluttered shop.

He glanced around "Finch & Thread," a name once proudly emblazoned above the door in gold leaf now faded and peeling like sunburnt skin. Bolts of fabric lay draped across rusted shelves, their colours muted by years of dust. Mannequins, once adorned with Elias's most intricate creations, stood stiff and lifeless, their vacant stares mirroring his own despair.

For decades, Elias had been the go-to tailor in Oakhaven, crafting everything from sturdy workwear for the miners to elegant gowns for the mayor's wife. His needle danced like magic, transforming ordinary cloth into wearable art. But times had changed. The mines had closed, the young folks were leaving for the city, and even the mayorâ€™s wife now favoured mass-produced garments over Elias's bespoke creations.

Today, as Elias contemplated a half-finished waistcoat, a sliver of hope pierced through his gloom. A knock echoed from the shopfront, tentative yet insistent. He straightened, his heart unexpectedly quickening. Could it be?  After all these years...was someone finally seeking out the artistry of Finch & Thread?
