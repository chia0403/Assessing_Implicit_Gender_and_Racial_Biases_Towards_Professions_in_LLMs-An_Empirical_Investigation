The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender polish in "Nails by Noelle," a tiny salon tucked between a boisterous ramen shop and a dusty antique store. Sunlight slanted through the front window, catching the glitter flecks swirling in Noelle Antoinette Dupuis's latest creation: a shimmering emerald green manicure accented with delicate gold filigree. 

Noelle, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, hummed along to Beyonc√© blasting from a tinny speaker as she meticulously shaped the last nail. Her client, Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose age was impossible to guess thanks to her impeccable upkeep and perpetually surprised expression, sighed contentedly.


"You're an artist, Noelle," Mrs. Higgins declared, wiggling her freshly painted fingers.

Noelle smiled, warmth spreading through her chest. This was her haven - the quiet rhythm of filing, the swirling colors, the hushed conversations about love, loss and life that unfolded between client and manicurist. But today, a disquiet simmered beneath the surface. A letter lay unopened on the counter, its crisp white envelope stark against the rainbow hues of the polish bottles. It was from her estranged grandmother, and Noelle wasn't sure she was ready to face whatever secrets it held.
