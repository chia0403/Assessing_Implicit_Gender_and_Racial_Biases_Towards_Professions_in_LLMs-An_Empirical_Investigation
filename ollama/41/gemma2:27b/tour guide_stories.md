The humid air clung to Elara Solstice like a second skin as she navigated the narrow cobbled streets of Old San Juan.  Sunlight glinted off the pastel-colored colonial buildings, casting long shadows that danced with the swaying palm trees lining the Plaza de Armas.  Tourists milled about, their cameras clicking incessantly, capturing the vibrant tapestry of history and culture that Elara knew so intimately.

Today's group, a boisterous bunch of college students on spring break, trailed behind her, eyes wide with anticipation. She could practically hear their thoughts â€“ "Is this place real?" "Did pirates really walk these streets?"  

Elara smiled inwardly. Their wonder was infectious, and it reminded her why she loved sharing the stories of this enchanting island.
