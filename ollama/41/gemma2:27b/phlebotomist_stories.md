Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic smear. Inside, the fluorescent hum of the laboratory echoed off stainless steel counters and rows of blinking machines. Emilia Reyes, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously inspected a vial of blood, the crimson liquid swirling like captured sunlight. She was a phlebotomist, a master of veins, a whisperer to arteries. 

Emilia had seen it all in her five years at Mercy General: nervous teenagers clutching their parents' hands, stoic seniors bearing their wounds with quiet dignity, and everything in between. But tonight felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the humidity clinging to Emilia's scrubs. The whispers amongst the nurses hinted at a high-profile patient, someone powerful and secretive who demanded absolute discretion.

Emilia paused, her fingers hovering over the syringe. A shiver ran down her spine, not from the chill of the laboratory but from an unsettling premonition. Something about this night feltâ€¦ off.
