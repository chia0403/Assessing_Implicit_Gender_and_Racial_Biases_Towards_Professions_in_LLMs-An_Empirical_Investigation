The stale air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune as Elara Montgomery wrestled with a particularly stubborn overhead bin. It was always the bins at the back of the plane that seemed to have a mind of their own, resisting her every push and shove. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple despite the arctic chill emanating from the vents above.

Elara sighed, finally managing to coax the rogue suitcase into its designated space. "There you go," she muttered under her breath, straightening her crisp, navy-blue uniform. The familiar scent of airplane carpet and recycled air wafted around her, a comforting aroma she'd come to associate with home more than any physical place ever could.

She glanced at the clock on the galley wall: 5:47 am. Another early morning flight from Chicago to Los Angeles. Elara loved the quiet humdrum of these pre-dawn departures. It allowed her to sip her lukewarm coffee in peace, watch the sunrise paint the sky with hues of orange and pink as they soared above the clouds, and lose herself in a good book before the passengers started boarding. 

Today, however, a peculiar sense of unease gnawed at her. Perhaps it was the unsettling dream she'd had last night, a jumble of blurry faces and flickering lights that left her feeling strangely on edge. Or maybe it was the unusually heavy fog clinging to the tarmac outside, obscuring the distant runway like a ghostly veil. Whatever it was, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that this flight wouldn't be like any other.
