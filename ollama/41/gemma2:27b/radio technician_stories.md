The scent of ozone and burnt solder hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thornhill. He squinted at the tangle of wires spilling out from the vintage Philco radio on his workbench, its chrome grille dulled with years of neglect. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on his small workshop, nestled in the dusty outskirts of Tucson. 

Elias ran a calloused thumb over a frayed resistor, muttering under his breath. The rhythmic chirping of cicadas was drowned out by the low hum emanating from his own custom-built antenna, straining to pick up a signal through the static. He needed to find that elusive frequency, the one whispered about in hushed tones among collectors like him â€“ a ghost broadcast, said to emanate from somewhere deep in the Sonoran Desert. 

It was considered nothing more than folklore, a tall tale for radio enthusiasts huddled around crackling receivers on cold desert nights. But Elias felt a pull towards it, a stubborn conviction that there was truth behind the legend. He'd spent months meticulously restoring this Philco, its tubes and capacitors painstakingly replaced, all in pursuit of a signal that may not even exist.
