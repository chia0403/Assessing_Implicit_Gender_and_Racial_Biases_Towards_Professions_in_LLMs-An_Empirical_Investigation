Rain lashed against the windows of "Curl Up & Dye," blurring the neon pink flamingo sign into a watercolor mess. Inside, Esmerelda "Esme" Flores sighed, watching the downpour with the despondency only a slow Tuesday afternoon could inspire. The salon was quiet save for the rhythmic whir of the hair dryer she'd left on to mask the unnerving silence. She idly twirled a strand of fuchsia-streaked hair around her finger, missing the usual buzz of gossip and laughter that filled her tiny haven.

Esme had always dreamed of running her own salon, a place where people could feel transformed, empowered, even a little bit magical. "Curl Up & Dye" was everything she'd ever wanted â€“ quirky, colourful, and brimming with personality. But lately, it felt more like a mausoleum than a sanctuary. The influx of trendy, minimalist salons in the area had sucked away her clientele, leaving Esme with nothing but empty chairs and mounting bills.
