Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest. Outside, the quaint cobblestone streets of Charleston, South Carolina, were deserted, swallowed whole by the sudden downpour. Inside, the waiting room was eerily silent save for the ticking grandfather clock and the faint hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. It was past six, long after Eleanor had intended to be home curled up with a good book and a cup of chamomile tea.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The last appointment of the day – a root canal for Mrs. Henderson, notorious for her delicate nerves – had dragged on longer than expected.  Now, as Eleanor prepared to lock up and brave the storm-tossed streets, a sharp rapping on the door startled her. She peered through the frosted glass. A figure shrouded in darkness stood on the doorstep, their silhouette barely discernible against the backdrop of driving rain.
