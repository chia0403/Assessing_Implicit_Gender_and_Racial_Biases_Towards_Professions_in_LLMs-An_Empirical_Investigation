The humid air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he surveyed the overgrown mess before him. Ivy, thick as pythons, had strangled the once-elegant rosebushes, while weeds taller than his knee sprouted defiantly between cracked paving stones.  This was Mrs. Hawthorne's "English cottage garden," she'd called it with a wistful sigh, her voice cracking with age. Elias knew better; this was a battlefield overgrown with neglect.

Sunlight dappled through the ancient oak that dominated the yard, its gnarled branches casting long shadows across the tangled foliage.  A symphony of buzzing insects and chirping birds filled the air, punctuated by the distant rumble of traffic from the nearby highway. Elias inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves a familiar comfort. He loved this work, bringing order to chaos, coaxing beauty from the untamed wilderness. 


But today, Elias felt a prickle of unease.  This garden held secrets, he could feel it in the stillness of the air, the rustle of unseen things beneath the overgrown foliage. It was as if nature itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
