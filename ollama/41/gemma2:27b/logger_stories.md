Rain lashed against the windshield of Silas Blackwood's beat-up Ford pickup, blurring the already dim forest road ahead. The headlights struggled to pierce the heavy mist that hung low over the towering pines, making each turn a gamble.  Silas gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles white against the worn leather. He was running late. Damn late. Old Man Henderson wouldn't be pleased.

The air inside the truck smelled of damp earth, sawdust, and stale coffee – a familiar blend Silas had come to associate with both comfort and frustration. Outside, the forest whispered secrets in the wind, a symphony of creaking branches and rustling leaves that often calmed his soul. Today, however, it only amplified his anxiety.

He hadn't slept well last night. Visions of the massive Douglas fir he was supposed to fell this morning danced behind his eyelids, its colossal trunk a menacing silhouette against the moonlit sky. It wasn't fear that kept him awake – Silas had faced down giants before – but a nagging sense of foreboding. Something felt off, like the forest itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
