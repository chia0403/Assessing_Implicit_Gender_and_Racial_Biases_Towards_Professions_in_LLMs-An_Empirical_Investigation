Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the dilapidated community centre, a rhythm echoing Amelia Grace Thornton's growing anxiety.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the chipped linoleum floor and mismatched chairs arranged in a haphazard circle. This was hardly the sterile, sunlit environment Amelia envisioned when she dreamt of becoming an occupational therapist.

She shifted her weight from one worn-out shoe to another, nervously adjusting the thick folder tucked under her arm. Today marked her first day at "Second Chance," a small non-profit providing rehabilitation services to individuals struggling with addiction and mental health issues. The flyer promised "empowering journeys" and "transformative healing."  Amelia desperately hoped they weren't just empty words, because she needed this job â€“ needed the chance to prove herself capable after a string of disheartening rejections from prestigious hospitals.

The door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a man with kind eyes and a shock of unruly silver hair. "Amelia?" he asked, his voice warm despite the chill in the air.  "Welcome! I'm Daniel, the program coordinator. Glad you could make it."
