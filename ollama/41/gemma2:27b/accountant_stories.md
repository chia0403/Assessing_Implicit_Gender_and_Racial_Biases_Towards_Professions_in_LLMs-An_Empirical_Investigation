Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew Quill's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and unfulfilled dreams. Bartholomew, perched precariously on a wobbly stool, stared at the spreadsheet on his flickering monitor, each row and column a testament to his monotonous existence.

Tonight, however, his yearning felt particularly acute. A flyer had caught his eye earlier that day â€“ a call for adventurers to join an expedition into the uncharted jungles of the Amazon. The prospect ignited a flicker of hope in his weary soul. Could this be his chance to escape the mundane, to finally write his own story instead of meticulously recording everyone else's?
