The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Santiago's head, casting an almost surgical glow on the row of gleaming instruments laid out before her. The scent of mint toothpaste mingled with the faint tang of disinfectant, creating a uniquely sterile aroma that was as familiar to Esme as her own heartbeat. Outside the window of her small office at "Bright Smiles Dental," the relentless Arizona sun beat down, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage. 

Esme sighed, picking up a scaler and twirling it between her nimble fingers.  Mondays were always rough, but today felt particularly arduous. Her first patient, Mrs. Henderson, had arrived fifteen minutes late, smelling strongly of garlic and cigarettes, with a mouth full of plaque so stubborn it felt like she was chiseling at ancient rock formations. Now, Esme awaited her next appointment â€“ a new patient named Daniel Pierce, whose file promised nothing but mystery.  Daniel's address was unfamiliar, his insurance information incomplete, and his reason for visit simply listed as "general check-up." Something about the vague details prickled at Esme's intuition, making her both curious and apprehensive.
