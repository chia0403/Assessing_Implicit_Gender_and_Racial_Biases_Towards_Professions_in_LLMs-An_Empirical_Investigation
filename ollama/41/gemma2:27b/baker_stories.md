The pre-dawn air hung thick with the scent of yeast and burnt sugar. Emilia Beatrice Rossetti hummed along to the crackling radio as she kneaded dough, her strong forearms working rhythmically. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Florence were still shrouded in darkness, but inside Emilia's bakery, "Il Pane d'Oro," golden light spilled from the oven, illuminating shelves stacked with plump loaves and fragrant pastries.

Emilia, with a new sourdough recipe she'd been perfecting for months, felt a flutter of nervous excitement in her chest.
