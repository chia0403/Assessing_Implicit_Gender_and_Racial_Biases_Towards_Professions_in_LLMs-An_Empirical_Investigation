The sun beat down on Jedediah Clayborneâ€™s weathered face as he surveyed his parched pasture. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the withered grass that crunched underfoot. The sky, an endless expanse of relentless blue, offered no promise of rain. It had been months since the last meaningful shower had graced the dusty plains of western Oklahoma, and Jedediah's heart ached for his cattle. Their ribs showed through their hides like skeletal etchings, and their eyes, once bright and playful, now held a dull desperation.

Jedediah ran a calloused hand over the stubble on his chin, pondering his dwindling options. Selling some of his herd was unthinkable, a last resort he wouldn't entertain until every other avenue had been exhausted. He'd already cut back on feed, hoping the meager grazing would sustain them for a while longer. But how long could they hold out?

A sudden gust of wind whipped across the plains, carrying with it the faint scent of smoke. Jedediah squinted towards the horizon, where a plume of grey rose against the azure sky. It was too far to make out any details, but a shiver ran down his spine. Smoke meant fire, and in these dry conditions, even the smallest spark could ignite a disaster.
