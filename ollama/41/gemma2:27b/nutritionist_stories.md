Rain lashed against the windows of the tiny café, blurring the Parisian street scene outside into a watercolour wash. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of freshly baked croissants and strong coffee. Elodie Beaumont, a petite woman with fiery red hair tucked beneath a jaunty beret, sat hunched over her laptop, frustration etched on her delicate features.  

Elodie wasn't your typical nutritionist. Forget bland meal plans and calorie counting; she believed in vibrant, flavourful food that nourished both body and soul. She dreamed of opening a restaurant where people could experience the joy of healthy eating without sacrificing taste. But securing funding for her dream was proving to be an uphill battle. 

Today's meeting with a potential investor had fallen through – again.  Elodie sighed, the weight of her disappointment settling heavy in her chest. She glanced out the window, watching as a lone figure hurried past, their umbrella struggling against the wind. Paris, she thought wistfully, was a city that promised endless possibilities, but sometimes those possibilities felt frustratingly out of reach.
