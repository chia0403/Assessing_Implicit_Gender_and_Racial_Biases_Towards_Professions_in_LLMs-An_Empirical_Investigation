The insistent clanging of the ancient clock tower outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within Eleanor Rose Hawthorne.

But this envelope…this felt different. It was addressed in a swirling, unfamiliar hand, no return address, simply her name scrawled across the front: "Eleanor Rose Hawthorne." And something about the weighty paper and the crimson wax seal sent shivers down her spine.
