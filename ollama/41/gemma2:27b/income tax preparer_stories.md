Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Taxes Done Right" sign hanging precariously above Eleanor Finch's office door. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in April. Eleanor, her graying bun askew and spectacles perched precariously on the tip of her nose, sighed heavily, pushing a stack of W-2 forms aside. Another year, another mountain of paperwork. This wasn't how she'd envisioned her life at 58. She'd dreamed of sipping margaritas on a sunny beach, not deciphering cryptic deductions and soothing the frayed nerves of last-minute filers.

Still, Eleanor had built this business from scratch, brick by painstaking brick. It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers. And in the bleak landscape of her life, with its faded romances and unfulfilled dreams, "Taxes Done Right" felt like a beacon of stability, a testament to her quiet resilience.
