Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Evangeline "Eve" Moreau wrestled with a gurney, maneuvering it through the narrow hallway of a crumbling tenement building. The stench of mildew and stale cigarette smoke clung to her scrubs like a second skin.

A woman's panicked sobs echoed from the room ahead. Eve tightened her grip on the gurney, her heart hammering against her ribs. Another overdose, she thought grimly. This was the third one this week. The opioid crisis had sunk its claws deep into this forgotten corner of the city, leaving a trail of broken bodies and shattered lives in its wake.  Eve sighed, steeling herself for what lay ahead. She'd seen enough suffering to last a lifetime, but still, she wouldn't let it harden her. There was always hope, even in the bleakest corners.
