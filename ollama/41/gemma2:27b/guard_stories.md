The wind howled like a tormented beast, clawing at the ancient stone walls of Castle Blackwood. Rain lashed against Elara Thorne's face, stinging her eyes and blurring the already dim torches lining the ramparts. She pulled her threadbare cloak tighter around her, wishing for nothing more than a mug of steaming ale and a warm fire. But duty called.

As the youngest and least experienced guard in the Blackwood contingent, Elara had drawn the short straw – night watch on the north wall during a howling gale. The wind seemed to mock her isolation, whistling through the crumbling battlements and carrying with it whispers of forgotten battles and long-dead kings. Her hand tightened around the hilt of her sword, a reassuring weight against the gnawing fear that always accompanied the darkness.

From her vantage point, Elara could see nothing but the swirling grey mist that shrouded the forest below. The gnarled branches of ancient oaks twisted like grasping claws, and every rustle of leaves sent shivers down her spine. Legends whispered of monstrous creatures lurking within Blackwood Forest – goblins, wraiths, even a vengeful spirit said to haunt the ruins of an old abbey swallowed by the trees. Elara dismissed them as childish tales, but tonight, with the wind howling its eerie song and shadows dancing in the flickering torchlight, she couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease.
