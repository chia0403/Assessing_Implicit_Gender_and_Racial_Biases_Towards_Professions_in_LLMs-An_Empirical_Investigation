Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn air clung to the overgrown grass like a damp shroud, casting a mystical veil over the crumbling mansion that had been Elara Asteria Wychwood's family estate for generations. As she made her way down the winding driveway, her worn leather boots kicking up small clouds of dirt with each step, Elara felt a sense of familiarity and unease wash over her. It was a feeling she'd grown accustomed to since taking on the role of groundskeeper at Wychwood Manor.

Elara had always been drawn to the old house, its stone walls bearing secrets and stories that seemed to seep from every crack and crevice. As a child, she'd spent hours exploring the overgrown gardens and forests that surrounded the mansion, collecting wildflowers and leaves in her pocket like treasures. But it was only after the tragic accident that had left her with a mysterious, lingering limp that Elara's parents had offered her the chance to return to the family estate and tend to its grounds.

Now, as she approached the grand entrance, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that Wychwood Manor held more than just memories of her own. The trees seemed to loom over her like sentinels, their branches creaking softly in the morning breeze. She pushed open the heavy oak door and stepped into the warm glow of the foyer, where a faint scent of old books and decay hung heavy in the air.

"Good morning, Elara," a low voice called from the depths of the house.

Elara's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the voice of Mrs. Harrington, the elderly housekeeper who had been a constant presence in her life since childhood. "Good morning, Mrs. Harrington," Elara replied, her eyes scanning the dimly lit hallway for any sign of the woman.

But as she looked closer, Elara's gaze caught on something that made her blood run cold â€“ a small piece of paper pinned to the wall, with a message scrawled in red ink: "They're coming."
