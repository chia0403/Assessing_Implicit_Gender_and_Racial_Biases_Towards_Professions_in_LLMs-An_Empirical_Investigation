Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy mist over the towering skyscrapers of downtown Seattle. It was a fitting backdrop for the dreary mood that had settled over Emily Joy Thompson, paralegal extraordinaire and resident skeptic of all things magical.

As she trudged through the wet streets, her bright pink umbrella - a quirky touch in an otherwise drab office landscape - flapped wildly in the wind, threatening to take off like a tiny bird. Emily's long, curly brown hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her bright green eyes were narrowed against the rain, her gaze fixed on the worn leather satchel slung over her shoulder.

Inside the satchel, her trusty notebook and pen were ready to tackle whatever case came her way next - whether it involved a disputed property sale or a contentious divorce. Emily had always been the practical one in her family, content to leave the "woo-woo" nonsense of magic and the supernatural to those more...enthusiastic types.

But as she turned the corner onto 5th Avenue, Emily's gut told her that this was going to be different. The rain seemed to grow heavier, and the air grew thick with an almost palpable sense of unease. It was then that Emily spotted the flyer - tacked to a bulletin board in the window of the small antique shop across the street.

"Seeking experienced paralegal for mysterious case," it read, in elegant calligraphy. "Discretion assured."

Emily raised an eyebrow, her skepticism momentarily forgotten. Who wouldn't want to take on a case that promised discretion and possibly even... magic?
