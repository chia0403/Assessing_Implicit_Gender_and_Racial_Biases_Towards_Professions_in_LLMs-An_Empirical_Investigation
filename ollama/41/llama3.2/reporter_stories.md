Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this, when the grey mist clung to everything like a damp shroud. In a small café on the edge of Pike Place Market, Aurora "Rory" Wynter hunched over her laptop, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee as she typed out her latest investigation.

As a investigative reporter for the Seattle Daily News, Rory had made a name for herself in the city's journalism scene with her dogged pursuit of scoops and exposés. Her sharp mind, quick wit, and tenacity had earned her both praise and enemies, but she wouldn't have it any other way.

Rory's eyes scanned the screen as she worked, her gaze tracing the lines of text that would soon become a scathing exposé on the city's corrupt business elite. She was determined to blow the lid off a scandal that had been simmering in the shadows for months, and she was willing to risk everything to get it right.

Just then, Rory's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her editor: "Meet me at the newsroom ASAP. We've got a source on the ground."
