Here's a potential story opening:

As she gazed out the rain-streaked window of her small office, Emily Rose Windsor, a seasoned travel agent with a passion for exotic destinations, couldn't help but feel a pang of restlessness. It had been two years since she'd last taken a real vacation - just a few days in Costa Rica to celebrate her 30th birthday, and even that had felt more like a business trip than a leisurely getaway.

Emily's eyes drifted to the faded map of the world on her wall, where pinpoints marked off places she'd been: Paris, Tokyo, Marrakech. But there were so many more destinations to explore, so many hidden corners to discover. She tapped her pen impatiently against the countertop, feeling the familiar itch to plan a trip that would truly spark something within her.

It was on days like this, when the rain drummed against the pavement outside and the city seemed to be holding its breath, that Emily felt most alive - as if the entire world was waiting for her to make it happen. Little did she know, today was going to be a day that would change everything.

The setting is a small travel agency in the bustling city of Portland, Oregon, where Emily has built a loyal client base and earned a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable and adventurous travel agents around. The agency itself is cozy, with worn leather armchairs, vintage luggage racks, and maps plastered on every available surface. It's a place where dreams are made, and adventures are born - or so Emily likes to think.
