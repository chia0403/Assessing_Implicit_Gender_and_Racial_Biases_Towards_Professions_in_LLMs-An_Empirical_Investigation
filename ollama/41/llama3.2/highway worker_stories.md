Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of Interstate 40, casting a golden glow over the endless stretch of asphalt that stretched out before Highway Maintenance Worker extraordinaire, Brody Wilson Jenkins III.

Brody, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, stood at the edge of the highway, surveying the landscape below. He was dressed in worn jeans, scuffed up work boots, and a faded "I-40 Forever" t-shirt, a token from his high school days that had become a sort of good luck charm.

As he scanned the horizon, Brody's mind wandered to the strange occurrence that had brought him to this spot earlier that day. A truck driver had called in reporting a peculiar signal fire on the side of the road, with no apparent source or explanation for its origin. The authorities were stumped, and Brody, being the go-to guy for all things I-40-related, had been dispatched to investigate.

With his trusty thermos of black coffee in hand and his reflective vest slung over his shoulder, Brody set off into the fading light, ready to face whatever mysteries lay ahead on this stretch of highway. Little did he know, his life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would lead him down a path of secrets, lies, and danger lurking in every shadow.

The I-40 corridor stretched out before him like a serpent's spine, winding its way through the heart of America, where the open road and freedom beckoned. But tonight, something felt off.
