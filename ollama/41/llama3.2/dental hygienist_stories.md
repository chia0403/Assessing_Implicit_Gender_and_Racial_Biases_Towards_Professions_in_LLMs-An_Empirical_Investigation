Here's a potential story opening and setting for a tale featuring a dental hygienist as the main character:

Title: "Scaling Back"

Opening passage:

As she steamed the water in the dental office's sanitizing sink, Emily Rose Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the lingering scent of last night's cleaning solution or the faint hum of the ceiling tile fan above her station - it was the eerie silence that had settled over the office like a shroud.

Emily had worked as a dental hygienist at Oakwood Family Dental for five years, but tonight felt different. Maybe it was the way Dr. Patel's usually cheerful voice had been curt and distant during their pre-shift meeting, or maybe it was the strange look exchanged between her colleague, Rachel Lee, when Emily mentioned her plans to start moonlighting as a dental assistant at a local clinic. Whatever it was, Emily felt like she was walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

The office itself was a cozy, if slightly dated, space with cream-colored walls and faded floral prints adorning the furniture. The sound of gentle chatter and the occasional beep from the computer created a soothing background hum that usually put patients at ease. But tonight, it all felt...off. As Emily began to prep for her first patient of the evening, she couldn't help but wonder what had really been going on behind the scenes at Oakwood Family Dental.

This setting establishes Emily as a dental hygienist with some experience and familiarity in the office, while also hinting at underlying tensions or conflicts that will be revealed throughout the story.
