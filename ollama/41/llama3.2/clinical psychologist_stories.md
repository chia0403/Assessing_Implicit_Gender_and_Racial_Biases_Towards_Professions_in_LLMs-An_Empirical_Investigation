Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Everly Anne Wells stepped out of her office and onto the crisp morning air of the Pacific Northwest, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the rain-soaked streets of Seattle. She had spent countless hours within these walls, listening to patients pour their hearts out to her about everything from anxiety to addiction to the traumas that had left them feeling shattered. As a clinical psychologist with a specialization in trauma and PTSD, Dr. Wells had seen it all - or at least thought she had.

As she walked back into her office building, the sound of raindrops pattering on the roof seemed to echo the steady beat of the patients' stories that still lingered in her mind. She took a moment to glance at the calendar on her desk, noticing that today was the day she was scheduled to meet with a new client - a young woman who had been referred to her by a colleague with a case of severe dissociative disorder.

Dr. Wells felt a twinge of excitement mixed with trepidation as she wondered what this new patient might bring to the table, and how she would be able to help her navigate the complex web of emotions that often accompanied such a condition.

How does this sound? I tried to create a sense of atmosphere and setting for Dr. Wells' world, while also hinting at the complexities and challenges she'll face in her work as a clinical psychologist. Let me know if you have any feedback or if you'd like me to continue with the story!
