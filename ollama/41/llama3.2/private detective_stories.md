The rain-soaked streets of New Haven gleamed like polished onyx as private investigator Augustus "Gus" Thompson stepped out of his office and onto the sidewalk. The flickering neon sign above the bar next to his office cast an eerie glow over the deserted alley, casting long shadows that seemed to writhe like living things.

Augustus pulled his worn fedora low over his eyes, shielding them from the drizzle, and surveyed the scene before him. A crumpled piece of paper on the ground caught his attention - a torn corner of a flyer for an escort service, advertising "Lily LaRue's Exclusive Companionship" in bold letters.

Gus had seen it all over this town, but there was something about this particular message that piqued his interest. He tucked the paper into his breast pocket and began to walk, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of Lily LaRue herself. The phone inside his pocket buzzed with an incoming call from his secretary, Margaret - "Gus, you've got a meeting with potential new client at 5 pm at Joe's Tavern."

Augustus raised an eyebrow. Something about this case felt off. He quickened his pace, the neon lights of the city blurring together as he disappeared into the rainy night.
