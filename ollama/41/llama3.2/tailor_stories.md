The sun had long since set on the bustling streets of Marrakech, casting a warm orange glow over the vibrant souks and markets. In a small alleyway tucked away between a vintage clothing shop and a spice merchant, a single lantern hung from the ceiling of a modest tailor's workshop. The sign above the door read "Ahmed el-Hassani, Tailor" in elegant calligraphy.

Inside, Ahmed el-Hassani, known to his friends and family as Ahmadi, carefully stitched together a intricate pattern on a richly embroidered cloak for a wealthy client who would be arriving any moment. His skilled hands moved with precision, the needle dancing through the fabric as he brought the design to life. The scent of wool, silk, and sandalwood filled the air, transporting Ahmadi back to his childhood in this very alleyway, watching his father work his magic on intricate garments for the city's elite.

Ahmadi straightened up, smoothing out his robes and preparing to receive the noblewoman who would be wearing this exquisite garment for her next important occasion.
