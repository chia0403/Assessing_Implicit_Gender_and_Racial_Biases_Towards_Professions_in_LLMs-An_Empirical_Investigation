The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a dirty blanket, shrouding the streets in a misty gray veil. Inside the cozy diner, "Momma's Kitchen," the aroma of sizzling bacon and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation and the clinking of dishes.

Amidst the bustle, 22-year-old Emily Anne Waters expertly balanced a tray of drinks and appetizers as she made her way down the crowded dining room. Her bright blue eyes scanned the tables, ensuring each customer received their order with a smile and a flourish. With a quick glance at her watch, she mentally ticked off the next round of drinks – 17 orders to go before the lunch rush subsided.

As she delivered a tray of steaming hot burgers to table five, Emily Anne couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over her.

There was something about her that drew Emily Anne in, something that made her feel like she needed to know more.
