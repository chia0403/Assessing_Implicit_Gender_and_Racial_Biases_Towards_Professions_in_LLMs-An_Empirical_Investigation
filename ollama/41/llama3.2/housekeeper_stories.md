Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven were always at their most unforgiving in the dead of night. But for 32-year-old Emilia "Mia" Thompson, a small-town housekeeper with a worn-out but reliable car, the gloom outside was nothing new. Mia had spent countless nights driving through the mist-shrouded streets, her headlights cutting through the darkness as she made her way to yet another client's doorstep.

As she pulled up to the grand estate on Elmwood Avenue, the flickering porch light above the heavy wooden door cast an eerie glow over the wet gravel. The house loomed before her, its turrets and spires reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. Mia felt a shiver run down her spine as she killed the engine and stepped out into the damp air.

She had worked for the wealthy and reclusive Bellvue family for three years now, and while they paid handsomely for her services, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to their lives than met the eye. Tonight's visit was no exception â€“ Mrs. Bellvue, the matriarch of the household, had summoned Mia with an air of urgency that didn't sit right in her stomach.

As Mia took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch, the door swung open before her, revealing a cavernous hallway that seemed to stretch on forever. The butler, Jenkins, stood in the doorway, his eyes fixed on Mia with an unreadable expression.

"Good evening, Emilia," he said, his voice as dry as the sandpaper that rubbed the floors in Mrs. Bellvue's study. "Mrs. Bellvue is expecting you. Please, come in."
