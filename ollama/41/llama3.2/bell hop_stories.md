Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as the night air clung to the city like a damp shroud. In the midst of this melancholy atmosphere, the imposing facade of the luxurious Bourbon Street Hotel loomed, its grandeur tempered by the weary gaze of its inhabitants.

Inside, bell hop extraordinaire, Étienne "Tienne" LaFleur, navigated the labyrinthine corridors with ease, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of misplaced luggage or disgruntled guests. A native son of the Crescent City, born and raised in the French Quarter, Étienne had spent years perfecting the art of providing exceptional service to the city's most discerning visitors.

As he expertly juggled multiple suitcases and delivered a tray of fine china to room 314, his thoughts wandered to the cryptic message he'd received earlier that evening from an unknown source. The note, scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper in hasty handwriting, read: "Meet me at the bar downstairs at midnight. Come alone."

Étienne's instincts told him to ignore the warning, but a nagging sense of curiosity lingered, refusing to be silenced. He tucked the message into his pocket, mentally preparing himself for a night that would prove to be anything but ordinary.

Little did Étienne know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take him down the twisted alleys of New Orleans' underbelly, where secrets lurked in every shadow and the line between loyalty and deception blurred like the misty dawn breaking over the Mississippi.
