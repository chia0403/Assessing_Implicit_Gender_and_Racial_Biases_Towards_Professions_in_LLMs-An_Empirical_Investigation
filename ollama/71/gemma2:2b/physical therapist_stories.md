Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Harding's small practice in rural Vermont, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second echoing the frantic pace of her thoughts. On one side of her cluttered desk sat Ethan Walker, a young boy with wide, worried eyes and a limp that betrayed his playful nature. Ethan had been brought to Amelia after tumbling down a flight of stairs, leaving him with a fractured tibia.  On the other side lay a stack of pamphlets detailing each possible treatment plan for broken bones – all of them seemed designed to mock her dwindling confidence. 

Amelia Harding, PT, felt an instinctive tug at her apron strings. Ethan wasn't just another case; he was a reminder of how far she had come in a career defined by the "miracle" she could orchestrate with each patient and their unique journey toward recovery. Yet, looking at the boy slumped on the chair, his body encased in a bulky cast, Amelia knew her power was waning. She wasn't simply a magician of musculoskeletal healing; she was also a student, navigating an unfamiliar terrain of emotional vulnerability. Ethan's silence spoke volumes - a silent plea for more than just pain relief. He wanted to run again, dance again, and laugh again, but his body wouldn’t cooperate.  Amelia knew the storm inside her needed to dissipate before she could even begin to help him.
