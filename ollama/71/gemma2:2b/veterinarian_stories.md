The late afternoon sun dripped through the gaps in the barn doors, casting long shadows across Dr. Amelia Croft's cluttered desk.  She ran her fingertips over a stray piece of string that clung precariously to a small clay figurine of a fox, its red eye gazing accusingly from within Amelia’s overflowing desk drawer. "Must be your lucky charm, then," she muttered under her breath, picking up a crumpled photograph of the farm's golden-haired mascot, a mischievous dog named Biscuit who was more trouble than he was worth.  

Amelia’s small office in the heart of Meadowbrook Animal Clinic pulsed with life - the sounds of barking dogs, meows from stray cats, and the occasional high-pitched squeal from distressed rodents vying for her attention. This wasn't some plush, sterile corporate clinic. It had weathered decades, every creak and groan a testament to its years. The smell of disinfectant mingled with fresh hay, an aroma Amelia cherished as much as she did the sound of a purring cat on her lap. 

This was her life's work: mending and healing, listening to the silent stories whispered through each animal’s eyes, and finding comfort in the furry bodies that trusted her.  But tonight, something felt off. A tension thrummed beneath the usual hum of Meadowbrook, a feeling Amelia couldn't quite place. 

The evening air held a chill she hadn't expected, and the shadows lengthened, swallowing the farm like a hungry beast. Tonight, the mystery of the missing goat would have to wait until morning when the sun rose over the fields again.  But as Amelia stared out at the darkening sky, a sense of foreboding settled in her stomach. It wasn't just the cold; something felt... unsettlingly quiet.
