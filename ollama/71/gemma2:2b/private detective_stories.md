Rain hammered against the windows of "The Last Call" - the kind of downpour that seemed to eat away at the already dim neon sign outside, blurring the lettering into a hazy mess.  Inside, shadows danced around the worn booths as Mr. Ethan Thorne - the city's most jaded and efficient private eye - sat hunched over his desk, a half-eaten sandwich gathering dust on it. His fedora cast a deep shadow across his face, but his eyes, sharp as obsidian, were glued to a single photograph clutched in his hand.  The woman in the picture was young, her vibrant red hair caught in the spray of a nearby fountain – a stark contrast to the grimy alleyway she stood in. Her smile was innocent, a promise of joy that seemed cruelly distorted by the harsh lines of the photograph. 

"Gone too soon," Ethan muttered under his breath. It wasn't just the rain that reminded him; it was the weight he felt in his chest. He knew this case would pull him out of his routine of stale coffee, late nights, and dead ends - a symphony of misery that had become his life's soundtrack for years.  He rubbed his tired eyes, the weariness clinging to him like a second skin. This case – a missing person, not just an "untangling of threads" as he liked to call it – was going to be different.
