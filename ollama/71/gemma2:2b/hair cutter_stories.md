The scent of lavender shampoo hung heavy in the air like an old sweater left out on a summer day.  It did little to counter the underlying tension that was building around Estelle Blackwood's small salon. The front door creaked open and in walked Miss Agnes Peabody, her usual regal bearing replaced with a manic gleam in her eyes. 

"Estes," Miss Peabody said, voice tight as the frayed ribbon on her hat. "My hair is... unyielding." 

Estelle sighed, already knowing what this meant.  Miss Peabody's unruly crown was an epic undertaking, and it rarely went down smoothly. It wasn't just about the color or style; it was about control â€“ a need for precision that Miss Peabody had developed after years of battling the whimsy of her own curls. Estelle, used to the occasional dramatic twist of a client's hair, found herself wondering if this time, there would be more than just a trim. She glanced around her cluttered salon - the vintage shears hanging by chipped porcelain dolls; a faded copy of "The Odyssey" tucked beside the blow dryer. The setting was familiar, but today, it felt like a stage set for something bigger, something that could shake up even the quietest town.
