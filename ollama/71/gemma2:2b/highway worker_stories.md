The desert wind whipped at Elias Thorne's worn leather jacket, carrying with it the scent of miles and miles of asphalt.  His hands, callused from years spent working on the endless ribbon of Route 66, gripped a steel wrench tighter than usual. The late afternoon sun beat down mercilessly on the stretch of highway they were repairing between Gallup and Santa Rosa. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like phantoms in the blazing red sky.  It was August, and even the normally indifferent desert felt a strange intensity, as though it held its breath before the approaching storm. 

Elias wasn't just any highway worker. He was a man of few words, his presence more of a quiet shadow than a spotlight. He was known for his meticulous work, the way he'd fix a crack in the pavement with a precision that bordered on obsession, and the faint, almost ghostly smile that would linger on his face after every job.  His life had been shaped by the endless highway, a canvas of concrete and asphalt that mirrored his own stoic, enduring nature.
