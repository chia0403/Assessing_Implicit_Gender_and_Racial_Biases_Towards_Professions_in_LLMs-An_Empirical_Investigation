## Setting:

A smoky jazz club nestled in the heart of Montmartre, Paris. Crumbling stone walls, overflowing with cigarette smoke and the scent of cheap wine, frame the stage where an aged grand piano sings its soulful melodies. The air vibrates with an unspoken tension; every clink of glasses, every cough or whisper, hangs like a secret between the musicians and the audience. 

## Character:

The name on everyone’s lips is **Vivienne Beaumont**, her voice a velvet ribbon weaving tales of love lost and found under the Parisian moon. Tonight, however, Vivienne’s usual stage charisma seems dimmed; her eyes hold a depth that speaks of unspoken anxieties.  Her emerald green dress, once a dazzling spectacle, now hangs heavy and forlorn. 

## Story Opening:


The spotlight found Vivienne as she stood backstage, shrouded in the blue and grey light of the club's dressing room.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and hairspray, the only sounds a distant murmur from the other performers and the steady rhythm of her heart drumming a frantic beat against her ribs. Tonight, she wasn’t singing for a cheering crowd; tonight, it was just her. 

Her eyes swept across the worn posters plastered on the wall – portraits of famed musicians, their names whispering tales of glory long past.  She ran a hand over the smooth surface of a faded photograph, a blurry image of a woman with vibrant auburn hair and an impossibly wide smile. The woman's name was written on the back in Vivienne’s meticulous handwriting: "Beatrice." A bittersweet ache filled her chest. It had been a decade since she last heard Beatrice sing, a lifetime ago for Vivienne. 

Vivienne closed her eyes, the weight of the past pressing down like a tombstone.  "One song," she muttered to herself, her voice barely audible above the hum of the club's life. "Just one song." And as she stepped onto the stage, the crowd roared and the melody took flight – an echo of memories, of dreams and anxieties, of a journey through music and loss.
