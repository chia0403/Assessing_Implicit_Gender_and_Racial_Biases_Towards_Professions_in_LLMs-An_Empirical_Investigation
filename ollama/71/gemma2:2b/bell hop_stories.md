The scent of stale cigarette smoke clung to the air like a phantom limb, its ghostly presence lingering in every corner of the Grand Excelsior Hotel. Even after hours of cleaning, the aroma seemed to cling stubbornly to the polished brass rails and faded floral wallpaper of room 205.  Here, nestled between towering stacks of luggage and the echoing silence of an empty hallway, was Bertram "Bertie" Thorne, the most meticulous bellhop this side of the Mississippi River.

At twenty-five, Bertie's youthful face, a canvas still dotted with freckles and kissed by sunshine, carried an air of stoicism that belied his anxieties.  The bustling city life of Chicago held him captive - even the constant churn of traffic outside seemed to mirror the internal chaos in his mind.  He was just another cog in the grand machinery of the Grand Excelsior, a silent observer caught in a web of wealth and privilege he could only dream of stepping into. His heart yearned for a different kind of adventure, one that didn't involve hauling suitcases and delivering telegram messages on cold nights. 

Bertie knew he was just waiting for the right spark to ignite the fire within him, but how could he possibly know where to start?  The city whispered secrets in his ear, promises of love, fame, and fortune, but all he had were dusty luggage tags and a growing sense of isolation.
