The wind whipped across Red Mesa Ranch, sending dust devils swirling across the parched landscape like miniature tornadoes.  A crimson sunset bled into the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple before disappearing entirely beneath a vast expanse of ink-black night. The only sound louder than the mournful howl of the wind was the rhythmic clang of cattle bells, the symphony of life on Red Mesa echoing across the desolate plains. 

His name was Silas Thorne, and he'd been running this family ranch since his father passed away six years ago. It wasn't easy, not anymore. The land was unforgiving, the drought relentless, and the price for cattle had dipped lower than the dry creek bed after a summer storm. Today, though, Silas felt a different kind of weariness settling into his bones. It wasn't just the sun-baked plains or the gnawing ache in his tired arms. He felt it deep within, like an old wound starting to fester.  He was losing something - hope, maybe - and it threatened to engulf him entirely.
