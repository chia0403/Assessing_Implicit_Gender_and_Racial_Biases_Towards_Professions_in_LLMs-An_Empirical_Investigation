## Opening

The desert wind whipped across Elias "Elroy" Crane's weathered face, tugging at his faded flannel shirt as he worked through another day on the construction site. The vast expanse of sand and gravel stretched endlessly before him, broken only by the skeletal remains of half-built buildings that looked more like the ghosts of a forgotten civilization than actual structures.  The sun beat down relentlessly, turning the air hazy and shimmering. Even beneath the oppressive heat, Elroy felt a familiar chill run through his bones. 

He was used to it, this harsh landscape. After all, he'd spent most of his life battling its unforgiving elements as an operator of heavy machinery - bulldozers, excavators, graders –  anything that could reshape the raw earth for some semblance of progress. But even he couldn’t ignore the unsettling silence that hung in the air. 

It was a silence not of tranquility, but of dread.
