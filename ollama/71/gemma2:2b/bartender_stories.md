Rain lashed against the windows of "The Salty Siren", its insistent drumming a familiar rhythm to Elara Thorne's weary soul. She'd seen countless storms roll in over her ten years behind the bar at this ramshackle waterfront pub, and yet every time it happened, the salty tang of sea air seemed to sharpen the edges of her life like a honed blade. 

Elara was tall and lean, her auburn hair usually tied back in a tight bun that held its own against the wild sea winds. She was no stranger to the gritty reality of this town; years spent mixing drinks with an endless stream of locals had turned her hardened edges into something more akin to resilience than resentment. 

Tonight, though, the storm seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing inside her. A man in a worn leather jacket sat hunched in the corner booth, his gaze locked on the flickering gaslight outside. His name was Silas Crowe, and he had walked into Elara's life like a rogue wave, crashing into it with an unyielding force that she hadn't anticipated.  His eyes held an unreadable depth, a hidden storm simmering beneath the surface. The only clue to his past - or perhaps future - was a single crumpled photograph tucked inside his pocket.
