The rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of Frank's van like angry fists.  Inside, sweat clung to his brow as he wrestled with the stubborn knot in the drain pipe leading into the basement of Mrs. Peabody’s Victorian house. A full day of leaky sinks and overflowing toilets had left him feeling more like a weary old sailor than a plumber, a thought that was only amplified by the smell of mildew and despair that hung thick in the air. 

Frank, whose real name was actually Frederick Thomas Miller but he'd sworn off all formal titles at the age of 15 when his dad gave him a slap-stick joke for 'Ferd,' adjusted his worn cap and muttered under his breath. “Just gotta snake it out,” he sighed, his gaze narrowed as he peered into the murky depths.  Frank was no stranger to plumbing challenges, but Mrs. Peabody's house always had that unsettlingly whimsical air to it - a mix of antiquated charm and Victorian-era weirdness. 

The van’s interior felt like an antique cabin itself – all peeling paint, chipped enamel, and creaking metal, echoing with the quiet hum of Frank’s tools.  It was his haven, this worn-out mobile workshop – just as much a reflection of himself as he was of it. He had a deep love for these old pipes, for the intricate dance of water flow and pressure that flowed through them. 

He just needed to figure out this drain pipe...
