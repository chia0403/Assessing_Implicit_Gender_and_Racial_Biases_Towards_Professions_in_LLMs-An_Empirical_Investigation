The rusty groan of the lift echoed through the steel skeletal structure of the abandoned factory, mirroring the low hum of Barry "Brick" Montgomery's tired brow as he clambered his way up to the third floor.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight slicing through a shattered skylight, illuminating the chipped paint and debris littering the concrete floor like fallen stars. The air hung thick with the tang of stale cement and something else... decay, both tangible and metaphorical. Brick's boots clicked rhythmically on the exposed pipes as he surveyed the vast emptiness, his worn work gloves tightening around a steaming cup of instant coffee.

This was the heart of the old mill town, its skeleton swallowed by progress, left to rot for decades while he, and others like him, were building new lives in the shadow of past promises. It was here Brick found solace, a forgotten corner of his own history that mirrored the sprawling blueprints he carried in his worn tool bag: a blueprint for his future.  But this abandoned behemoth held secrets, whispers of forgotten stories, a ghost in the machinery that only he could hear.
