The worn linoleum beneath Amelia's feet vibrated with every footstep she took through the bustling lobby of Sterling & Co. law firm. She was used to it - the echoing footsteps, the clinking of coffee mugs on ceramic plates, and the ever-present buzz of client calls. Her name was Amelia Thorne, and for the past five years, she'd been the unsung hero of this place, keeping its gears turning smoothly while the lawyers and paralegals waged their legal battles in hushed corners and over boardroom tables. 

Her current task involved a seemingly simple yet daunting responsibility: organizing the incoming mail, separating it by client, case type, and urgency. The stack was reaching Mount Everest proportions, with folders overflowing with legal documents, handwritten notes scribbled on the back of old business cards, and even a few oddly-shaped packages that looked suspiciously like they had belonged toâ€¦ a raccoon? 

Even in the middle of this office jungle, Amelia's mind wandered, filled with daydreams of tropical beaches and quiet evenings at home.  A flash of blue caught her eye, a letter tucked between two envelopes, its contents clearly labeled "Mr. David Sterling." She felt a strange energy surge within her, like a jolt from an old-school power line. It wasn't just the mundane task that demanded her attention; it was something... more. Something that hinted at a hidden world beyond the walls of the law firm.
