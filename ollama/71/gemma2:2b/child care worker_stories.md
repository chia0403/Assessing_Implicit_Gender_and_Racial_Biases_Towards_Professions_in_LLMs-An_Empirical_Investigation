The air hung thick with the smell of cinnamon and vanilla as Elara,  "Ellie" to everyone except her mother, settled into her usual spot by the kitchen window. A kaleidoscope of colours danced on the glass as sunlight streamed in from the sprawling backyard, dappling the worn linoleum floor.  Across the room, Mrs. Patterson's boisterous laughter echoed through the house, a melody that Ellie found both comforting and slightly jarring. 

Ellie was used to it - this blend of sweet chaos and gentle calm that defined Mrs. Patterson’s household. As a child care worker for the vibrant, sometimes unpredictable eight-year-old prodigy, Amelia "Amy" Johnson, Ellie's days were never dull. The house itself was an extension of Amy: crammed with art supplies spilling over into each room, books stacked precariously in every corner, and toys – from miniature teacups to a vintage wooden rocking horse – begging for the chance to be played with. 

But today, something felt different.  A subtle tension hummed in the air, making Ellie's heart tighten like a fist around her ribs. Her usual optimism about starting another busy day at Mrs. Patterson’s house seemed to have vanished, replaced by a growing unease that whispered unsettling secrets. A feeling, Ellie knew instinctively, wouldn't be silenced until it was faced.
