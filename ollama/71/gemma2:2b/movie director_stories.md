Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Thorne's Malibu Beach house, mirroring the stormy turmoil within her. The Hollywood scene was in a perpetual dance of dazzling expectations and bitter disappointments, but tonight, it felt like the storm had finally broken its dam. 

Amelia Thorne, renowned for crafting hauntingly beautiful tales through her films that explored the human condition, found herself facing an existential crisis unlike any she’d ever encountered. Her latest project - a biopic about the legendary artist Frida Kahlo - was supposed to be her magnum opus, a masterpiece destined to sweep awards and redefine filmmaking itself.  But now, surrounded by crumpled script pages and echoing silence, Amelia felt adrift. 

The year was 1978, a time when disco fever consumed the airwaves and the Vietnam War loomed large in the collective consciousness of the nation. Hollywood, however, was shrouded in its own private darkness, filled with whispers of power struggles, financial scandals, and broken dreams. Amelia’s film, meant to be a testament to artistic resilience, was starting to feel like an indictment of the very industry that had birthed it.
