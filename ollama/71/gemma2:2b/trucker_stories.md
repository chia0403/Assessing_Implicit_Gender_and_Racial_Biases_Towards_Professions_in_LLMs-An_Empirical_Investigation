The highway stretched before Dalton “Dusty” Ramsey like a ribbon of asphalt swallowing the sunset.  Dust devils kicked up in the dry heat as he shifted gears, grinding the engine into another long haul across Arizona. The endless desert landscape was familiar, yet tonight felt different. Tonight, it wasn't just the scorpions and dust clouds that buzzed in the air; it was the weight of his anxieties, a pressure that threatened to burst under the harsh glare of the Wyoming moon.  Dusty, with his calloused hands and tired eyes, had been hauling cargo since he was a teenager, but tonight felt like every mile had an extra layer of strain. 

His rig, "The Coyote," rumbled down the road towards Albuquerque, its chrome reflecting the moon's cold light. The diesel fumes mixed with the scent of sagebrush as Dusty navigated the desolate stretches, each curve and hill a silent witness to his inner turmoil. A storm was brewing in the distance, the kind that could turn the normally placid sky into a canvas of lightning and thunder.  It wasn't just the weather that felt heavy; it was his heart, burdened with secrets he didn't dare speak out loud.
