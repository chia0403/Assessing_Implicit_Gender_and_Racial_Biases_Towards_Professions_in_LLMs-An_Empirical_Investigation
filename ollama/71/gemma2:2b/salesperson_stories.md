The humid air hung heavy in the air conditioner-free office as Amelia "Amy" Davenport struggled to keep her composure. It wasn't just the stifling heat or the persistent buzzing from the nearby faulty fluorescent lights; it was the endless stream of rejections that had begun to erode even the thickest layer of her self-confidence.  Today, she was pitching a new line of vegan leather goods – "Earthly Chic" – at the corporate office of a notoriously environmentally resistant company, "TerraCorp." 

The sterile white walls, lined with glossy presentations of recycled paper coasters and bio-degradable water bottles, felt like an insultingly perfect echo chamber for Amy's dwindling hopes.  She was facing down her biggest challenge yet: convincing the CEO, Mr. Thorne, a man known more for his opulent lifestyle than any commitment to sustainability, that Earthly Chic could be "the next big thing" in consumerism. 

The setting was a mid-sized conference room with an oversized oak table draped in a beige fabric tablecloth and surrounded by uncomfortable steel chairs.  The only splashes of color were the vibrant brochures for the products; Amelia felt her hope dwindling like the last rays of sunlight piercing through the suffocating office windows.
