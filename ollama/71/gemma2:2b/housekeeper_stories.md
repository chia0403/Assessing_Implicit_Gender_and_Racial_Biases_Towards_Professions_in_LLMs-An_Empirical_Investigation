Rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of Blackwood Manor like a thousand angry fists, each blow echoing through the dusty grandeur of the once magnificent estate. The wind howled outside, whipping branches against the stone walls in a desperate attempt to pry open the ancient oak doors. Inside, Eloise "Ellie" Harper, her face creased by years of scrubbing and sweeping, felt the chill seep into her bones despite layers upon layers of worn flannel and a woolen sweater.  

Blackwood Manor wasn't just an old house; it was a living monument to the past – a testament to forgotten elegance, now choked with dust and decay. Ellie had been its sole caretaker for the last five years, ever since Mrs. Blackwood passed away, leaving behind only her memories and a lingering sense of loneliness that permeated every room.  She'd known the house before she even knew the first word spoken in its walls - the memory of it was etched into her childhood, a hazy dream of echoing footsteps and grand gestures lost to time. But now, years later, Ellie felt like an unwanted guest in the once-proud manor's decaying embrace. 
 
Her worn house shoes scuffed across the aged oak floorboards as she moved between the library and the dining room, her eyes scanning for stray dust bunnies or misplaced silver spoons – not that there was anything left to find after years of neglect. The air hung thick with an aroma of old memories and lingering sadness, a melancholy symphony conducted only by Ellie's own tired footsteps.
