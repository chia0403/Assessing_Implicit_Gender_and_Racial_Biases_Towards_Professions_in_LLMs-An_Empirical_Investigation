The salty spray stung Zephyr Thorne's eyes as he stood on the deck of the 'Wanderlust', a battered schooner bobbing precariously in the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea. He was supposed to be enjoying the sun-drenched paradise his clients were flocking to, selling them dream vacations and exotic escapades.

It seemed like a lifetime ago when his vibrant brochures depicting tropical beaches and bustling city life held the promise of adventure. 

He ran a hand through his windswept hair, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing down on him.  The storm clouds brewing in his chest mirrored the gathering storm on the horizon â€“ one that could swallow his dreams along with his clients' expectations.
