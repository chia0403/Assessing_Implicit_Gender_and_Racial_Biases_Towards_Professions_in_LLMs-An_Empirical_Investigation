Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, each drop echoing like a gunshot in the empty street outside.  Amelia "Amy" Croft, her trench coat plastered to her damp skin, pulled her thick woolen hat further down over her face and pushed a fistful of crumpled bills across the greasy counter. "The usual, Hank," she rasped, her breath fogging the air around the worn Formica surface.

Hank, a man who looked like he'd seen too many winters and too much whiskey, wiped his grimy hands on his overalls. He grunted in response, more of a guttural rumble than an actual sound. His smile was as chipped and faded as the diner's once pristine linoleum floor. 

The setting: The Rusty Bucket, a greasy spoon perched at the crossroads of two deserted highways in the forgotten corner of Nevada. It was a place where secrets clung to the worn vinyl booths like dust motes caught in sunlight, a place where time seemed to have stopped decades ago.  It was also a place Amy Croft had made her home, and its faded glory served as both sanctuary and fuel for her insatiable thirst for truth. 

The story that awaited her wasn't a glamorous one. It wasn't the kind with flashing cars and red-faced suspects. This was about a missing girl, Maggie Davis, who vanished from this very diner a year ago, leaving behind only whispers of heartbreak and unanswered questions. A town like this was where stories got buried under years of dust and forgotten memories.  But Amy Croft wasn't afraid to unearth them, her unwavering determination fuelled by the gnawing ache in her heart for truth, even if it meant battling ghosts from the past.
