## Setting:

The grand foyer of the "Everly Manor" was a symphony of hushed grandeur. Marble floors gleamed under the warm amber light emanating from ornate chandeliers. The scent of aged leather and rosewater lingered in the air, a mix that somehow managed to be both comforting and a touch unsettling. This was the heart of a sprawling historic estate, nestled in the rolling hills of Connecticut. 

## Character:

**Name:** Alistair Hawthorne

Alistair's crisp white uniform felt like an extension of his own being, each crease and fold meticulously crafted.  His gaze, usually sharp with a practiced blend of professionalism and quiet observation, softened as he looked at the woman standing before him. Her frantic gestures, her red-rimmed eyes, and the tremor in her voice spoke volumes - it was a storm brewing on the horizon. 


## Story Opening:

"It's not about the money, Mr. Hawthorne," Mrs. Ainsworth whispered, her fingers twisting the beaded cuff of her wristwatch. "It's...it's about my daughter." 

Alistair felt a wave of unease roll over him, the polished perfection of Everly Manor suddenly crumbling in his hands like shattered porcelain. He knew that Mrs. Ainsworth hadn't been the type to trouble him with mundane concerns. 

"Mrs. Ainsworth," he replied, his voice firm but measured, "what is it?" 

The womanâ€™s gaze drifted towards a shadowed corner of the foyer.  Her face, etched with worry lines and hidden under a veil of silk tears, was contorted in a silent scream. 
"It's..." she stammered, "...it's about Miss Amelia."
