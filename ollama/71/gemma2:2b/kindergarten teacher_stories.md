The scent of crayons and warm cinnamon clung to Miss Amelia Peabody’s classroom like a comforting blanket. Sunshine streamed through the windowpanes, turning the colorful alphabet wall into an abstract rainbow.  It was Wednesday, which meant Storytime with Mrs. Featherbottom, the flamboyant storyteller who had somehow charmed even the most skeptical five-year-olds. The air buzzed with anticipation as Amelia surveyed her charges: a boisterous crew of giggling, sticky-fingered monsters, each one eager to be swept away by Mrs. Featherbottom’s words. 

The classroom was small but vibrant – a kaleidoscope of primary colors and mismatched furniture. Bookshelves lined the walls, laden with more stories than anyone could ever imagine reading, their spines begging to be touched. Amelia's heart warmed at the sight of them, for in this room, each book held a universe waiting to be discovered.
