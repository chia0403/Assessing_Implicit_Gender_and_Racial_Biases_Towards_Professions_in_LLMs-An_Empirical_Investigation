The air hung thick with jasmine perfume as Eleanor "Ellie" Sterling surveyed her latest disaster. The grand ballroom, once draped in plush velvet and echoing with laughter, was now a mangled scene of clashing furniture, overturned tables, and paint splatters like angry graffiti across the ornate plasterwork. 

It had all been so meticulously planned. Ellie’s clientele included affluent socialites, high-powered CEOs, even a few eccentric royalty, each expecting her to transform their homes into resplendent spaces that reflected their inner grandeur. Yet, somehow, this client's vision – a sprawling Victorian mansion dubbed "Grimalkin Manor" – had spiraled out of control. 

The previous owner, a reclusive baroness who’d inherited the estate in the last century, had left behind an outdated behemoth with more quirks than charm. Ellie was supposed to bring it into the 21st century, make it fit for the modern elite. But the task now felt as insurmountable as scaling the mansion's gothic staircase –  a whirlwind of unyielding chaos, and all she could manage was a desperate sigh and a wish that her latest client’s fortune would magically extend to paying for an entire team of professionals. 


**Setting:**

* **Location:** Grimalkin Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion nestled in the heart of London's exclusive Mayfair district. The manor boasts grand staircases, hidden passages, and a sprawling library filled with antique books.
* **Atmosphere:** Despite its opulent façade, the house is steeped in mystery and neglect. Dust covers everything from ornate tapestries to century-old portraits depicting long-forgotten ancestors.  The air vibrates with a lingering sense of unfamiliarity and forgotten stories.
