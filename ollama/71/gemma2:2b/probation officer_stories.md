The fluorescent hum of the waiting room was as familiar to Amelia "Amy" Carter as the comforting weight of her worn leather-bound notebook.  She sat at the edge of the plastic chair, her gaze fixed on the single potted plant drooping on the chipped table. This wasn't supposed to be this hard.  Probation wasn't about punishment; it was about rehabilitation, right? But after four years on the job, Amy started to wonder if that ideal even existed anymore, especially in the city she called home - a sprawling concrete jungle where hope felt as thin and brittle as the peeling paint on the building next door. 

Today’s case involved James "Jimmy" Riley – a young man whose life had been reduced to a series of unscripted missteps, each one leaving him further behind on the road to normalcy. From Amy's perspective, his story was tragic and hopeful in equal measure. He’d been caught with stolen goods - nothing major, just petty theft that would cost him years on the wrong side of society if he didn't change course. The court had handed down a sentence of community service followed by probation.  

The door creaked open, and Amy watched as a disheveled Jimmy stepped into the room, his shoulders slumped like an old suitcase dragged through a muddy field.
