## The Last Stop Café

The air hung thick with the scent of burnt sugar and lukewarm coffee. **Clementine "Clem" Everly** surveyed the bustling line at the register, her usual stoic mask slightly creased by the weariness of another late-night shift at the Last Stop Café.  Outside, the neon glow of the diner sign cast a sickly yellow sheen onto the snow-dusted streets of Maplewood, casting an almost melancholic atmosphere over the usually lively town square. Clem was used to it - every corner held a story, every face a reflection of her own quiet solitude. 

Tonight, however, felt different. There was an energy in the air that went beyond the usual humdrum of last-call orders and late-night cravings for sugar and caffeine. The door opened with a loud bang, letting in a gust of wind that carried the scent of rain and the faint echo of a mournful song from somewhere beyond the café walls. A figure stepped out into the frigid night air – tall, cloaked, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat.  He looked like he’d walked straight off the pages of a forgotten pulp fiction novel, carrying with him an unsettling aura that sparked Clem's curiosity and tugged at her unease.
