The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and burning orange, as Elias "Eli" Hawthorne meticulously straightened a row of geraniums. He was used to the quiet hum of summer evenings, the gentle breeze rustling through the blades of grass he’d cultivated with love since his grandfather had first entrusted him with their care years ago. His small corner of the city held an undeniable charm: brick-lined streets leading up to a verdant park, where children chased after fireflies and the faint aroma of hotdogs wafted from the nearby stand.

Eli wasn't exactly cut out for the finer things in life, but he found solace in his work - tending to the land was like breathing life into something dormant. He’d started with a simple patch of lawn on his grandfather's property, then expanded it into a small-scale garden with his own two hands. Years later, it had become more than just a collection of flowers; it was a canvas for his creativity, each bloom telling a story in his mind. 

Tonight, though, the city's usual quiet was disrupted by a cacophony of sirens and shouts. The usually gentle hum of cicadas turned into an urgent buzz as Eli saw flashes of blue and red light dance across the park from his vantage point atop the old oak tree he loved to climb. Something wasn’t right, something felt… off.
