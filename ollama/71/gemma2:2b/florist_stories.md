The air hung thick with the scent of lilies, jasmine, and something vaguely reminiscent of burnt sugar. Eleanor Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back into a messy bun, surveyed her greenhouse with tired eyes. The late afternoon sun slanted through the stained glass roof, painting the vibrant blooms in a kaleidoscope of color. It was beautiful, yet another reminder of the weight she carried on her small shoulders. 

The bustling city outside felt miles away, but its echoes of traffic and sirens were always present, reminding Eleanor that her little haven, nestled deep within the suburbs, existed as a fragile bubble against the chaos of the world. This wasn’t just a florist shop; it was her life's work, her solace, her escape. Yet, tonight, the weight of grief pressed down on her, heavier than any bouquet she could assemble.  

Tonight, Mr. Miller, the old man whose family had owned this very plot for generations, was being laid to rest. The funeral wasn’t just a somber affair; it marked the end of an era. For Eleanor, it meant more than that –  it meant the end of her childhood haven and the beginning of another chapter in her life she hadn't anticipated.
