The fluorescent lights hummed above Ezra "Zip" Miller as he mopped under the echoing silence of the Grand Metropolitan Library. Dust motes danced in the weak shafts of sunlight filtering through grime-coated windows, casting spectral projections on the peeling linoleum floor.  Zip, a man built more like an old oak tree than the nimble librarian his title suggested, moved with practiced ease between the towering bookshelves and the ancient stone fountain that graced the central courtyard. 

He had been here for twenty years, ever since he lost his job as a construction worker to a nasty workplace accident and found solace in the quiet routine of cleaning. The library was more than just a job; it was his sanctuary, its hushed whispers filling the void left by his own inner chaos. But today, something felt different. The usual uneventful hum of activity had been replaced by an unsettling silence, an absence of the usual chatter and rustle of pages that usually filled the air like a gentle breeze.
