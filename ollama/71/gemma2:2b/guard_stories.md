The moon hung fat and low in the sky like a bruised plum, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestone streets of Veridia.  Dust swirled in the biting winter wind, kicking up plumes of grey against the chipped marble archway that marked the entrance to Castle Everbright.  Here stood Arlon Thorne, his thick coat pulled tightly against the frigid air as he scanned the courtyard for any sign of trouble. It was a duty he’d performed countless times before, yet tonight it felt heavier than usual.  The stone gargoyles lining the towers above him seemed to leer down with malicious intent. 

Arlon's eyes were sharp, honed by years on patrol. He could tell you which cobblestone had been worn thin by a hurried footfall and where the damp earth underlaid the flagstone.  He was known for his efficiency, his keen observation, even his uncanny ability to predict when a stray bolt of lightning would strike the castle's highest spire - an ability that earned him the scorn of some but respect from others.

Tonight, though, Arlon felt unease he couldn’t shake. A strange disquiet hummed beneath the surface of his usual calm. Something felt…off. The shadows seemed deeper tonight, and even the wind's whisper felt tinged with a sense of foreboding.  He straightened his shoulders and pulled his cloak tighter, then turned to face the castle's imposing gates.
