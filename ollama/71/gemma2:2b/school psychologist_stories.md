Rain lashed against the windows of Elmwood High School, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia Crane's anxiety. Stepping into her office, she couldn’t help but glance at the worn floorboards, each one a silent witness to countless teenage confessions, triumphs, and heartbreaks. She was used to it –  years spent navigating the volatile waters of adolescent psyche had left her with an arsenal of coping mechanisms, both professional and personal. 

Tonight, however, the familiar scent of stale coffee and overused therapy books felt like a betrayal. The aroma clung to the air like a thick fog, obscuring any sense of normality or control she usually wielded in her role as School Psychologist for Elmwood High.  She was waiting for Daniel Miller, the newest student - his name alone had sent ripples of curiosity through her staff meetings.  He was arriving at 7:00 pm sharp for his initial assessment and Amelia felt a strange, almost feral urge to just walk away. The storm outside, she realized, mirrored the one brewing within her own chest.

The weight of unseen anxieties threatened to pull her down with every creak of the aging school building.  Tonight, it wasn't just about Daniel’s struggles; it was about facing her own demons and finding a shred of clarity in this chaotic world of teenage angst.
