## The Lighthouse Keeper's Son

**Setting:** A small coastal town called Seahaven nestled between crashing waves and a craggy coastline dotted with windswept cliffs. Every morning, the seagulls cry out their greetings above the rising sun as it paints the sky in hues of burnt orange and deep purple.  

**Main character:** Elara Evermore, 34 years old, possesses a quiet intensity hidden beneath her calm demeanor. A guidance counselor at Seahaven High School for six years now, she’s seen countless young lives unfold before her – from first crushes to graduation day anxieties.  Elara has always felt most connected to the sea's untamed spirit, its raw power echoing in the way it swept over her during turbulent storms and calmed her soul during calm, gentle waves. 

**Story Opening:**  The rhythmic lapping of waves against the shore served as Elara’s daily meditation as she stepped into her office, a small space with an oversized window overlooking the ocean. Today's appointment was different.  A sea-worn box filled with letters from Ethan Avery, the lighthouse keeper's son, sat on the desk. The boy had been struggling since his father's passing last week, and Elara felt a responsibility to help him navigate this tumultuous storm of grief, just like the waves that crashed against the lighthouse rocks each night.  

**Notes:** 
* This opening establishes the setting, introducing the main character (Elara), her occupation, and a hint of personal connection to the sea.
* The presence of an unusual box, filled with letters from Ethan Avery, creates a mystery element for Elara to delve into as she begins to understand the boy's struggles. 
*  The story can explore Elara's own journey alongside Ethan's and how her experience with the sea informs her understanding of both him and his father's life.
