The air hung thick with static and the scent of ozone as Daniel "Danny" Sullivan adjusted the last knob on his console.  Nightfall painted the workshop in hues of amber and deep indigo; shadows danced across his workbench where he was meticulously rewiring a vintage shortwave radio, its once-bright chrome now dull and tarnished.  The faint hum of power surged through the old equipment as Danny flipped a switch, testing the delicate circuitry with nervous anticipation. 

He'd inherited the workshop from his grandfather, a man whispered to have known secret frequencies that had brought him closer than any other human to the mysteries of space. Now, at twenty-six and still learning, Danny was chasing echoes of those secrets in the static hum of timeworn dials and crackling antennas. 
 
Outside, the wind howled like a restless spirit, rattling the windowpanes. The coast lay shrouded in an unsettling twilight, and the distant cry of a seagull echoed across the barren stretch of coastline. This was his haven â€“ the world he understood more intimately than the bustling city he left behind. Tonight, Danny felt closer to something bigger, something vast and unknown. It hummed within him like a silent promise. 


**Setting:** A cluttered workshop on the rugged coast of Maine, overlooking a stormy sea.
