Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur Blackwood's office, each drop like a tiny hammer blow on the glass. The storm raged outside, mirroring the tumult within him.  He stared at the photo clutched in his hand - a faded picture of a smiling woman with wind-swept hair and eyes that held galaxies untold. Amelia. His wife, gone three years. Three years since the air hung heavy with unspoken words, the silence punctuated by bursts of grief so sharp they threatened to carve him open. 

Arthur Blackwood, renowned criminal defense lawyer in the bustling metropolis of New York City, was a pillar of intellect and composure.  But even his usual razor-sharp wit seemed dulled tonight, like the shine of his polished silver cufflinks. His courtroom victories were as dazzling as the cityscape he viewed from his office window - a kaleidoscope of lights reflecting the endless churn of human drama. Yet, in this moment, only the echo of Amelia’s laughter resonated, reminding him that the world outside his law firm held no solace for the wounds left behind. 

The case at hand - a seemingly straightforward embezzlement case - felt as suffocating as the city's humidity. His client, Mr. Peterson, was being accused of stealing from his own company – something Arthur found deeply unsettling. A wave of unease rippled through him. This wasn't just another legal battle; it was a fight against memories, a desperate attempt to understand the echoes that haunted him even as he fought for justice on behalf of the accused.
