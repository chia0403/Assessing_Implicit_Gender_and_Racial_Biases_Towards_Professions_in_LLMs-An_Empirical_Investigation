## The Flicker

The flickering fluorescent light cast long, jagged shadows across Daniel “Danny” Montgomery’s worn tool belt. It was another Tuesday night, the kind that bled into Wednesday with barely discernible distinction – a symphony of buzzes and clicks in the vast, echoing emptiness of the warehouse's electrical panel room. Danny ran his calloused thumb over a half-empty coffee cup left on the workbench, its lukewarm contents long gone.  He preferred to work alone, even when he was working for his boss, Mr. Henderson’s gruff construction company. 

The air hung thick with dust and the faint scent of ozone – remnants of a recent repair that had brought some semblance of order to this chaos. Danny surveyed the room – a jumbled expanse of wires, transformers, and conduits; a testament to years of tireless labor, each tool etched with stories of countless jobs.  He'd inherited his grandfather's love for this art – the delicate dance between electricity and structure, where every connection held a silent promise of power, just like every job carried a hidden story waiting to be unraveled. 

Tonight, however, something was different. The familiar hum of machinery felt heavier, distorted, as if a discordant note had crept into the symphony. A low whine started at the back of the room, growing in intensity and urgency – the kind that set your stomach to churning before you even knew why. It seemed like an echo of a threat – but what was it?
