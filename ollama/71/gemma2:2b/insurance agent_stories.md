## Opening Lines

The rain hammered against the grimy office windows, mimicking the ceaseless rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Caldwell's anxiety. She adjusted her glasses, their reflection adding a layer of exhaustion to the weary lines on her face.  Outside, downtown Chicago was shrouded in a grey gloom, mirroring the dampness that clung to Amy's soul. 

The air hung thick with the smell of old coffee and despair, a potent brew that only amplified the mounting pressure building in her chest. It wasn't just the caseload of distraught homeowners facing financial ruin – it was the weight of another life lost tonight.  Tonight, she’d been summoned to an opulent penthouse suite to meet Mrs. Davenport, whose husband had met his untimely end during a botched charity auction, leaving behind a gaping chasm in her family’s fortune. 

Amy Caldwell wasn't looking for miracles - just answers. The kind that could help navigate the tangled threads of life and death, and perhaps even find some solace amongst the wreckage. 


## Setting 

**Location:**  Downtown Chicago, a bustling metropolis where ambition clashed with the raw realities of loss and hardship. The story takes place in Amy's modest office in the heart of the city, a space reflecting her quiet dignity and stark honesty - cluttered with insurance policies, client files, and mementos that hinted at a past she tried to leave behind. 

**Atmosphere:** A gloomy and melancholy backdrop. The rain outside mirrors the emotional turmoil within Amy's life as she grapples with the intricacies of death and survival. There is an inherent sense of vulnerability in her work, as her clients are facing their deepest fears and anxieties in a time of immense loss and uncertainty. 

**Key elements:**  The office should be a blend of practicality and personal touches that reveal a woman who's found a rhythm amidst chaos - perhaps an antique clock ticking away on the mantle, framed photographs of loved ones, or a worn-out leather bound copy of "Jane Eyre" resting on her desk. The overall setting will embody the duality of Amy’s character: grounded yet searching for something more in life.
