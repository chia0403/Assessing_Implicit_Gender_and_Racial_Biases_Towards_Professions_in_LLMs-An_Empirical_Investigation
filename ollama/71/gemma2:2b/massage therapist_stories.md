Rain hammered against the worn awning of Serenity Massage, each drop a tiny explosion in the otherwise monotonous symphony of the downpour. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of sandalwood and lavender, both familiar comfort to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, owner and sole practitioner.  Her weathered hands rested lightly on her kneading table, eyes flickering towards the steady rhythm of the storm outside. 

Tonight's clientele: a stiff-shouldered businessman named David, convinced his back was giving him the silent treatment. Amy knew better. It was merely a symptom of years of holding tension in the wrong places. Like a sculptor chiseling away at a block of granite, Amy would guide him through the release, into the quiet space where stress and pain dissolved like dew on a warm morning.  The storm raged outside, but inside Serenity Massage, there was a calm that only she knew how to cultivate.
