The air hung heavy with the scent of gasoline, motor oil, and regret. Elias Finnigan tightened the last bolt on the rusted engine block, wiping his greasy forehead with the back of his hand. The midday sun beat down on the corrugated tin roof of his garage, turning the interior into a sweltering oven. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless symphony, punctuated by the occasional honk of a frustrated driver stuck in the perpetual traffic jam that choked Main Street.

Elias sighed, surveying the mess around him: scattered tools, half-dismantled engines, and a greasy floor slick enough to double as an ice rink. It was days like this he questioned his life choices â€“ trading a college scholarship for a dusty garage and the promise of freedom. Freedom from what, exactly? Debt, maybe, but also from possibilities, opportunities that now seemed as distant as the stars visible only on the clearest nights.
