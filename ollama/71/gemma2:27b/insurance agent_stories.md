Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's office, mimicking the relentless pounding in her chest. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Bea, a seasoned insurance agent with weary eyes that had seen too many claims, stared at the file on her desk. It wasn't just another fire or fender bender; this was different. This was Mr. Alistair Finch's claim, and his voice, raspy and filled with a bone-deep terror, echoed in her mind: "It wasn't an accident, Ms. Hawthorne. They meant to burn it all down."

Bea lived in the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven, where secrets whispered on the salty breeze and everyone knew their neighbor's business. But this claim felt like a crack in the town's facade, a glimpse into something dark and unsettling lurking beneath the surface. The quaint charm of Oakhaven suddenly felt suffocating, each cobblestone street and charming storefront now tinged with suspicion.
