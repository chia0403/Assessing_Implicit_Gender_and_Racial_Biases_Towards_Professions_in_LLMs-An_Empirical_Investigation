Rain lashed against the dusty windows of the dilapidated clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the glass. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her auburn braid escaping its bun, stared out at the grey sky, frustration simmering in her chest. The power flickered again, casting long, grotesque shadows across the room. "Of all days," she muttered, rubbing her weary eyes.

Amelia was an occupational therapist, dedicated to helping her patients regain independence and quality of life after injuries or illnesses. But this clinic, nestled in the forgotten corner of rural Appalachia, felt more like a battleground than a sanctuary. The aging equipment creaked under the strain of use, supplies were constantly running low, and the relentless dampness seemed to seep into Amelia's bones.

Today was supposed to be different. Today was the day she'd finally convince Mr. Henderson, a stubborn widower with arthritis crippling his hands, to try adaptive utensils. 

But now, with the power threatening to go out entirely, Amelia feared their session would be another frustrating exercise in futility. She sighed, wondering if her idealism had been misplaced. Perhaps some battles were simply too hard to win.
