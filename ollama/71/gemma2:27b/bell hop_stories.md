The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets, clinging to Elias Bartholomew "Eli" Jones like a second skin. He balanced a precariously stacked trolley laden with luggage, navigating the opulent lobby of The Grand Magnolia Hotel. Chandeliers dripped with crystal prisms that caught the fading light, casting rainbows across the marble floor. Jazz music, muted yet vibrant, drifted from the gilded ballroom, beckoning Eli with its syncopated rhythm. 

But Eli had no time for waltzes or sweet beignets tonight. The late-arriving guests were demanding, their faces pinched and weary after a long journey. He adjusted his bellhop cap, plastering on a smile as bright as the brass elevator buttons he was about to press. 


Eli knew every corner of this grand old hotel, its secrets whispered in the creaking floorboards and the hushed voices echoing down the hallways.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A shiver danced down his spine, an unsettling premonition that clung to him like the sticky humidity.
