The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and lavender, a familiar perfume to Elara Solstice. Sunlight streamed through the arched window of her studio, painting a golden rectangle onto the worn wooden floorboards. Dust motes danced in its warmth, swirling around canvases stacked against the walls like colourful sentinels. Elara, clad in paint-splattered overalls and with streaks of cobalt blue across her cheek, stepped back from her easel, tilting her head to study her work. 

It was a portrait - an old woman with eyes as deep and green as moss, wrinkles etched around them like a roadmap of forgotten journeys. But something wasn't right. The woman's gaze, meant to be serene and contemplative, seemed haunted, filled with a nameless sorrow that Elara couldn't quite capture. Frustration gnawed at her. This commission, for the granddaughter who wanted to honour her late grandmother's memory, was proving more difficult than she anticipated.
