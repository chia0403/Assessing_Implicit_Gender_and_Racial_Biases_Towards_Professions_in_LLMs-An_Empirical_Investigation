The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of candy bars and tabloids lining the checkout aisle. She sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the polished countertop – weary eyes framed by dark circles, her auburn braid fraying at the ends. Another Tuesday night at QuickStop, another symphony of beeping scanners, impatient sighs, and the cloying scent of artificial strawberry.

Amelia tapped her manicured nails against the counter, a nervous habit she couldn't seem to break. Tonight felt different. The air hung heavy with an unnerving stillness, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old building settling.  Even the usual throng of late-night shoppers seemed absent, leaving Amelia alone in the cavernous store.
