The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and ozone from the ancient hairdryer perched precariously on the counter. It was a smell Eleanor "Ellie" Vance knew better than her own skin - comforting, familiar, tinged with a hint of chemical burn. Sunlight streamed through the dusty shop window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air above the worn leather barber chairs. Outside, the city thrummed with its usual frenetic energy; but within Ellie's "Snip & Style" salon, time moved at a gentler pace.

Ellie herself was a study in contrasts: her hands, nimble and sure with shears, were adorned with chipped turquoise nail polish. Her silver hair, pulled back in a loose braid, framed a face creased with laughter lines and etched with the wisdom of years spent listening to her clients' joys and sorrows. Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. A letter lay unopened on the counter, its crisp white envelope mocking her from beneath a tangle of bobby pins. It was from the landlord - news she knew wouldn't be good. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer. Ellie forced a smile and straightened the faded floral tablecloth covering the styling station. "Welcome to Snip & Style," she chirped, hoping her voice sounded as cheerful as her facade. "What can I do for you today?"
