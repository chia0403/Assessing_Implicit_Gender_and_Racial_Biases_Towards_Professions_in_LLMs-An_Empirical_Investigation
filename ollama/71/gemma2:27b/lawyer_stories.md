The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Sinclair's office, casting long shadows across the overflowing bookshelves and stacks of legal tomes precariously balanced on his mahogany desk. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, a testament to Bart's relentless pursuit of justice – or at least, that's what he told himself as he wrestled with yet another tedious contract clause.

Bart was no stranger to the grind. He’d built his reputation in this decaying corner of downtown Phoenix on sheer grit and an unwavering belief in upholding the law, even when it meant taking on cases most others wouldn’t touch. Today's client, however, was testing even Bart's formidable patience. Mrs. Esmeralda Ramirez, a petite woman with eyes that held both fear and defiance, sat nervously across from him. She clutched a tattered handbag containing what she claimed was irrefutable proof of her husband's infidelity – a collection of love letters written in a language Bart couldn't decipher.

A knock on the door interrupted their tense standoff. 

“Come in,” Bart barked, already anticipating another interruption by his perpetually flustered assistant, Mildred. Instead, a tall man with an unsettlingly placid expression and piercing blue eyes stepped into the room. He wore a tailored suit that seemed out of place amidst the clutter, and a silver ring adorned with a curious symbol flashed on his finger as he extended his hand towards Bart.

"Mr. Sinclair? I believe we have business to discuss."
