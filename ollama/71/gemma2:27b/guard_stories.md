The salt-laced wind whipped at Silas Hawthorneâ€™s face as he squinted towards the churning grey sea. The obsidian cliffs of Blackhaven jutted out from the tumultuous water, their jagged peaks seeming to claw at the storm clouds above. Below him, waves crashed against the rocks with a thunderous roar, sending plumes of white spray high into the air. Silas shivered, pulling his threadbare cloak tighter around his shoulders.

Blackhaven was notorious for its brutal storms and unforgiving coastline, but that wasn't what kept Silas on edge. It was the fortress perched atop the cliffs, its granite walls looming dark and imposing against the stormy sky. For generations, the Hawthorne family had served as the guardians of Blackhaven Keep, protecting it from whatever threats might dare approach. But Silas, a young man barely out of his teens, felt the weight of that responsibility keenly. 

Tonight, he was alone on guard duty, his father away tending to a sick villager and his younger brother still too green for such a crucial post. The wind howled through the arrow slits in the watchtower, sounding like mournful cries. Silas tightened his grip on his spear, its iron tip glinting dully in the fading light. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a sense of unease prickling at the back of his neck.
