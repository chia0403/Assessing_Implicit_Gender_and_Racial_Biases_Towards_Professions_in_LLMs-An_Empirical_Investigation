The midday sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves of heat.  Inside Dr. Amelia Rosalind Thorne's dental practice, however, the air was refreshingly cool. The faint whirring of the overhead fan mingled with the gentle clinking of dental instruments as Amelia meticulously polished a molar. 

Her patient, a young boy named Ethan, fidgeted nervously in the chair. He gripped his stuffed dinosaur with white knuckles, his eyes wide and worried. Amelia smiled reassuringly, her touch as light as a feather on his gums. "Almost done, Ethan," she said softly. "Just one more polish and you'll have the brightest smile in town!"

Ethan peeked cautiously at the gleaming silver instruments reflecting the overhead light.  He wasn't sure about smiles, but he did trust Amelia. She had a way of making even the scariest procedures seem manageable.  But outside, the world was anything but manageable. A strange quiet had settled over Elm Street, punctuated by the occasional muffled thump and distant shouts.

Amelia paused, her brow furrowing slightly. The sounds were unsettling. Something wasn't right.
