The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's rain-slicked windshield.  “Open 24 Hours” it proclaimed, in bold, uneven letters that seemed to warp and twist under the streetlight’s hazy glare.  Eleanor hesitated, her fingers drumming a nervous tattoo against the steering wheel.  It was 3:02 am, the witching hour when shadows danced and logic took a holiday.  She'd promised herself she wouldn't make these late-night stops anymore, but desperation had a way of eroding even the strongest resolve.

The diner, “Mel’s Starlight Diner,” was a greasy spoon relic from a bygone era – all red vinyl booths, chrome trim, and the lingering aroma of burnt coffee.  Inside, a lone waitress with a weary smile and tired eyes wiped down the counter, her movements slow and deliberate.   Eleanor slid into a booth near the window, the cracked leather sighing beneath her. 

She needed answers, something beyond the textbook definitions and clinical diagnoses she relied on. Something…real.  And maybe, just maybe, this greasy spoon diner, perched precariously on the edge of reality in the dead of night, could offer a glimpse into the shadows that haunted her patient's mind.
