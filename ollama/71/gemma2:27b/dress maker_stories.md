The air in Elara Thorne's atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windowpanes of her Parisian shopfront, cast long shadows across bolts of silk and velvet piled high on antique dressmaker's dummies. Outside, the rumble of carriages and hawkersâ€™ cries battled with the melodic tinkling of a nearby carousel, creating a chaotic symphony that Elara found strangely comforting. 

She ran a gloved finger along the delicate lace she was embroidering, her brow furrowed in concentration. A gown for Madame Dubois, a notorious courtesan known for her extravagant taste and even more extravagant demands.  This commission, while lucrative, was proving to be particularly taxing. The woman insisted on a shade of turquoise so specific, Elara had resorted to grinding down crushed malachite and mixing it with her dyes. 

A sudden clatter from the street below startled her. Peeking through the dusty windowpane, she saw a young boy, no older than ten, being chased by a gruff-looking man in a butcher's apron. The boy clutched a stolen loaf of bread to his chest, his face streaked with grime and fear.  Elara sighed. Another day, another reminder of the stark inequalities that plagued their city.

Closing her eyes, she took a deep breath, willing herself back to focus on Madame Dubois' gown. But the image of the boy, running desperately for his life, lingered in her mind. Perhaps, just perhaps, she could do something to help.
