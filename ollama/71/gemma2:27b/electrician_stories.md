Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature percussion solo. The air hung thick and humid, smelling of ozone and damp earth. Ellie, her grease-stained hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, squinted at the tangled mess of wires before her. 

Her shop, nestled on the edge of sleepy Blackwood Creek, was a chaotic symphony of tools, half-dismantled appliances, and flickering fluorescent lights.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, sending shivers down Ellie's spine. She knew this storm wasn't just rain; it was the kind that brought down power lines and plunged entire towns into darkness. 

Just then, her phone buzzed, shattering the silence. It was Mrs. Hawthorne, her voice trembling with panic, reporting a power outage in her bakery. Ellie sighed, knowing she wouldn't be getting any rest tonight. Blackwood Creek needed its electrician, rain or shine.
