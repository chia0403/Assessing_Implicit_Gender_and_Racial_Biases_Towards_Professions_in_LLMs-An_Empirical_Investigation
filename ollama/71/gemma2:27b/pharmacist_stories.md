Rain lashed against the stained-glass windowpanes of Elmwood Pharmacy, blurring the vibrant colors into an impressionistic mess. The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the faint metallic tang that lingered from yesterday's spilled cough syrup.  Eleanor Beaumont sighed, meticulously counting out a fistful of bright blue capsules for Mrs. Henderson's arthritic hip. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mirroring the unease coiling in Eleanor's stomach. 

It had been three weeks since the last delivery truck arrived, leaving Elmwood with dwindling supplies and mounting anxieties. Rumors of supply chain disruptions and unseen plagues whispered through the small town like ghosts. Eleanor tried to focus on Mrs. Henderson's prescription, but her mind kept wandering back to the empty shelves lining the pharmacy walls and the growing sense that something was terribly wrong.
