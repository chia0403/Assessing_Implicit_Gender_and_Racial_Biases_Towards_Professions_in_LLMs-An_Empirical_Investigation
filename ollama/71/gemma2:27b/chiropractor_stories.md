Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Cartwright's clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. The rhythmic drumming was punctuated by the occasional groan of distant thunder, adding a soundtrack to Amelia's growing anxiety. Her first appointment wasn't for another hour, but the empty waiting room felt like a cavernous echo chamber, amplifying her doubts.

Amelia had only been practicing for two years, fresh out of Palmer College of Chiropractic and eager to make a difference in her small coastal town of Seahaven. But business hadn't exactly been booming. Today was already shaping up to be another slow day.  She chewed nervously on her thumbnail, scanning the diplomas lining the wall - testaments to years of grueling study, now feeling more like mocking reminders than achievements. 


Was she cut out for this? Was Seahaven even big enough for a chiropractor, let alone one who specialized in treating chronic pain and sports injuries? As Amelia wrestled with her anxieties, the sharp clang of the bell above the door startled her. A figure emerged from the downpour, shaking water off a battered leather jacket.
