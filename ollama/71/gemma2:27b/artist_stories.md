The acrid scent of turpentine hung thick in the air, mixing with the earthy smell of clay and the faint sweetness of drying lavender from the vase on Elara Solstice's workbench. Sunlight, slanted and golden, streamed through the dusty window of her attic studio, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Elara herself was a whirlwind of motion, brushstrokes blurring as she worked feverishly on her canvas. 

Her current project: a portrait of old Mrs. Hawthorne from down the street, notorious for her prize-winning roses and even more prized grumpiness. Capturing both the woman's fierce spirit and the delicate beauty of her weathered face was proving to be a delightful challenge for Elara. She dipped her brush into a pool of cerulean blue, hoping to capture the twinkle in Mrs. Hawthorne's eyes that appeared whenever she spoke about her beloved roses.
