Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own chest. The worn leather armchair across from her sat empty, a silent indictment of yet another canceled appointment. This was the third one this week, and the gnawing anxiety in Eleanor’s gut deepened with each missed session. 

Her practice, nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Portland, Oregon, had always been more sanctuary than bustling clinic. The soft lighting, the scent of lavender from the diffuser, the calming melody of wind chimes tinkling by the window – all carefully curated to foster a sense of peace and safety for her clients. But lately, the serenity felt suffocating.

Eleanor glanced at the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall, each second amplifying her growing unease. Something was wrong. More than just cancellations, there was an unsettling quietude in the air, a palpable tension that clung to her practice like cobwebs.
