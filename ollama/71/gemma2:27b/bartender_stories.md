The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones. "The Tipsy Siren," it proclaimed in bold, cursive font, though half the letters were burnt out, leaving it looking more like a drunken mermaid's garbled attempt at signage. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and something faintly floral â€“ probably from Esmeralda, the barmaid who liberally doused herself in cheap perfume.

Behind the mahogany counter stood Silas Blackwood, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back against a head already beginning to wrinkle. He wiped down a glass with practiced efficiency, his gaze distant, seemingly absorbed in the rhythmic swirl of the rag. Years tending this dive bar had etched lines on his face deeper than any knife could carve.

Silas wasn't one for idle chatter. He knew the regulars by name and their usual orders, dispensing drinks with gruff efficiency. Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, punctuated by the occasional nervous cough and the clinking of glasses held a little too tightly.  Even Esmeralda seemed subdued, her perfume strangely muted. Silas sensed something was coming. 


He just didn't know what.
