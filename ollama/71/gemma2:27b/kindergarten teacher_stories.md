The scent of crayons and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume Amelia Beatrice Cartwright had come to associate with both joy and exhaustion. Her classroom, Room 207 at Sunnyside Elementary, buzzed with the frenetic energy only five-year-olds could muster. A cacophony of giggles, shrieks, and off-key renditions of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" bounced off the cheerful yellow walls adorned with finger paintings and lopsided alphabet charts. 

Amelia surveyed the scene with a fond smile.  She loved her job, even on days like this when the sugar rush from the birthday cupcakes threatened to send her students into orbit. Today was Liam's fifth birthday, and the excitement was palpable. Liam himself, sporting a crown fashioned from construction paper and glitter glue, beamed at everyone with infectious glee.
