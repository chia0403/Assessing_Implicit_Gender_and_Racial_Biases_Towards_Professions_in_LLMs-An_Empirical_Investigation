The air hung thick with pine needles and damp earth. A shiver ran down Elijah Silas Blackwood's spine, though the sun beat relentlessly through the canopy above. It was always colder in the heart of the forest, he thought, even on days like this when summer clung to the mountains with desperate tenacity. 

Elijah wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of grime across his weathered forehead. He leaned against the ancient trunk of a Douglas fir, its bark scarred and knotted like the hands of an old man. The chainsaw sputtered beside him, its metallic scent mingling with the sweet perfume of pine resin. This was his life: the rhythmic thrum of the saw, the groan of falling giants, the smell of sawdust and sweat. 

He squinted through the dappled sunlight, searching for the next tree to fell. It wouldn't be long before this stand was cleared, leaving behind a raw scar on the landscape. A pang of guilt tugged at him, but it was quickly swallowed by the need to earn a living. Logging wasn't glamorous, but it fed his family and kept a roof over their heads. Still, as he surveyed the silent giants around him, Elijah couldn't shake the feeling that something else was watching him from the shadows of the forest. Something ancient and unseen.
