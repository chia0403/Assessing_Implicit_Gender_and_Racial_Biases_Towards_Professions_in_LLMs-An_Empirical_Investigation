Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elias "Eli" Thorne's office, each drop an echoing drumbeat in the oppressive silence.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and damp tweed, a symphony only Eli seemed to appreciate these days.  His desk, usually a battlefield of scattered files and half-eaten donuts, was unusually pristine. An empty cardboard box sat forlornly in the corner, mocking him with its emptiness. 

Outside, the neon glow of Bourbon Street bled into the storm, painting the slick cobblestone streets in lurid hues. New Orleans, even in its darkest hours, pulsed with a vibrant energy that Eli had always found both exhilarating and exhausting. But tonight, even the city's seductive rhythm couldn't penetrate the fog of grief that clung to him.

The phone on his desk buzzed, jolting him from his melancholic reverie. He hesitated for a moment before picking it up, bracing himself for whatever grim news awaited.
