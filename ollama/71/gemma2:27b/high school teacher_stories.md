The bell shrieked its metallic protest, sending a tremor through Miss Eleanor Blackwood's spine. It always did this, as though lamenting the end of another captive audience forced to endure her lectures on 18th-century British literature. She sighed, pushing away from the worn mahogany desk in her cramped classroom at Hemlock High. Sunlight, filtered through dusty windows, painted pale squares across the linoleum floor. Outside, cicadas thrummed their incessant summer song.  

Eleanor smoothed down her floral print dress and turned to face the sea of adolescent faces before her. Some were slumped, eyes glazed over with boredom; others stared intently at their phones, pretending not to notice her presence. Only a handful – Sarah in the front row, ever the diligent student, and Michael, his brow furrowed in thoughtful contemplation – seemed genuinely engaged. The rest were just biding their time until freedom rang.  

Eleanor craved that freedom too, but hers wasn't the carefree release of teenagers. It was a heavy mantle of responsibility, laced with the bittersweet knowledge that she wouldn’t truly be free until she left Hemlock altogether. This town, with its suffocating familiarity and whispered secrets, felt like a gilded cage.
