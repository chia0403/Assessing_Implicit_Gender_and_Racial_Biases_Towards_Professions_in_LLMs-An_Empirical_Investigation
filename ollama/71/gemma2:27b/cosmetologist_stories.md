The humid air hung heavy in the salon, thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and burning hairspray.  Cicada song thrummed from outside, amplified by the open window overlooking Bourbon Street. Inside, "Glamour Galore" was buzzing.  

Esmeralda "Esme" Dupree weaved deftly between styling chairs, her bright pink streaks momentarily blinding under the fluorescent lights as she adjusted a client's foil highlights. Her hands, calloused yet surprisingly gentle, worked with practiced precision.
