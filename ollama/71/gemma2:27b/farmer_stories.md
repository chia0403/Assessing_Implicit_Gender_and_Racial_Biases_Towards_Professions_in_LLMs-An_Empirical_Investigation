The wind, sharp as a butcher's cleaver, sliced through Silas Blackwood's weathered hands as he surveyed his fields. Dawn painted the eastern sky in hues of bruised plum and fading gold, but the chill seeped deep into Silas' bones. The harvest had been meager this year, the rains too fickle, the sun too harsh. His cornstalks, usually proud sentinels against the horizon, drooped like weary giants, their ears barely full.

Silas Blackwood was a man carved from the very earth he tilled.  His face, etched with wrinkles as deep as the furrows in his fields, spoke of years spent under the unforgiving sun. His calloused hands, scarred and strong, held the stories of countless harvests, both bountiful and lean. He stood on the porch of his ramshackle farmhouse, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, a silhouette against the rising sun. 

A crow cawed from atop a gnarled oak, its harsh cry mirroring Silas' own growing unease. This land had sustained his family for generations, but this year, it felt like the earth was turning away from him.
