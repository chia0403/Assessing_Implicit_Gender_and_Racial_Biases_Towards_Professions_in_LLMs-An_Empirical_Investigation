Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the tempest raging inside Alistair Finnegan's soul.  His latest manuscript lay sprawled on the dusty floorboards like a fallen bird, its pages scattered and lifeless. Three years. Three excruciating years he had poured into crafting this intricate tapestry of words, only to be met with rejection after rejection from publishers. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and dashed dreams.

Outside, the ancient oak tree in his overgrown garden creaked ominously, its branches clawing at the night sky like gnarled fingers. Alistair glanced at the worn leather armchair nestled beside the window, a haven he'd often retreated to during writer's block. Today, however, even the comforting scent of old books and pipe tobacco couldn't soothe his gnawing anxiety. His deadline loomed, the publisher growing increasingly impatient.

Alistair sighed, running a hand through his greying hair. He needed inspiration, a spark to ignite the embers of his creativity. But where could he find it? The world outside felt bleak and unyielding, mirroring the desolation within him. As if summoned by his despair, a low rumble echoed from the depths of the attic, followed by a faint scraping sound. Alistair's heart quickened. He wasn't alone.
