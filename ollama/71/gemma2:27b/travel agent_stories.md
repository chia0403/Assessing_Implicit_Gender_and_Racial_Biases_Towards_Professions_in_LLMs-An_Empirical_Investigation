The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow onto Eloise Davenport's face as she stared out the window of her cramped office. "Paradise Found Travel" it declared in bold, slightly warped letters, promising escapism that Eloise herself rarely experienced. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct view of the alleyway behind her building. It was a fitting metaphor for her current situation: shrouded in gloom, with barely a glimmer of hope on the horizon. 

Eloise sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl back from her forehead. The phone sat silent on her desk, mocking her with its lack of ringing. Business had been abysmal lately. People were tightening their belts, opting for staycations over exotic locales. Eloise understood; she was doing the same. But she couldn't help but yearn for the days when she could weave dreams of faraway shores for her clients, seeing excitement light up their eyes as they booked their flights to Machu Picchu or the Maldives. 


Now, she just hoped she could afford to keep the lights on in her own "paradise".
