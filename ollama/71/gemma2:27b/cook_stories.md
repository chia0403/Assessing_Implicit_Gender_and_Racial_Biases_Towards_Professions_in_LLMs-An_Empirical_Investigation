The air hung heavy with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke. Emilia Rose Hawthorne, her apron dusted with flour like a fresh snowfall, surveyed her domain: The Rusty Spatula, a diner perched precariously on the edge of Whisper Creek, a town whispered to be haunted by more than just the ghosts of lumberjacks past.  Beyond the greasy spoon's windows, the ancient pines swayed in the twilight breeze, their silhouettes sharp against the bruised purple sky. 

Emilia, her red hair pulled back in a tight braid, expertly flipped a stack of buttermilk pancakes onto a waiting plate. The diner was nearly empty, save for old man McGinty nursing a cup of coffee at the counter and a couple sharing a booth by the window, their faces bathed in the warm glow emanating from the neon "Open" sign. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle ran down Emilia's spine as she heard the chime above the door jingle, announcing a new arrival. It was late for anyone to be out on these winding backroads. And judging by the way the newcomer stood silhouetted against the fading light, they weren't just any traveler.

This wasn't going to be a normal night at The Rusty Spatula.
