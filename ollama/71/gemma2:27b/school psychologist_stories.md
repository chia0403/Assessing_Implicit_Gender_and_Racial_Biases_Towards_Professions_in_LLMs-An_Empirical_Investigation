The insistent chirping of cicadas filled the humid August air, their song weaving through the dusty oak leaves outside Dr. Amelia Rhys's office window.  Amelia sighed, pushing away from her overflowing desk and stretching her stiff shoulders. The last rays of afternoon sun slanted across the linoleum floor of the cramped room, highlighting the faded motivational posters plastered on the walls. "Reach for your Dreams," one declared optimistically, while another exhorted students to "Believe in Yourself." Amelia chuckled wryly.  Easier said than done for some of her students at Westbridge High School, a sprawling brick behemoth that housed everything from gifted athletes to teens battling debilitating anxiety and depression.

Today had been particularly draining: a tearful freshman grappling with social media bullying, a senior struggling with crippling performance anxiety before college applications, and a student on the verge of expulsion for fighting.  Amelia loved her job, truly she did, but sometimes the weight of their anxieties felt like a leaden cloak draped over her own shoulders.  She longed for a break, a chance to escape the confines of Westbridge's walls and breathe in fresh air untainted by teenage angst.
