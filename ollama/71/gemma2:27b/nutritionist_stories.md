Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Eloise Beatrice Davenport's tiny storefront clinic.  The air hung heavy with the scent of turmeric and cumin, remnants of her last client's spiced lentil soup recommendation. Eloise sighed, watching fat drops streak down the windowpane, blurring the already indistinct view of the bustling market square across the street.

Today was supposed to be a good day. A local newspaper had just published an article featuring Eloise and her unique approach to nutrition - blending traditional Ayurvedic wisdom with modern dietary science. She'd envisioned a steady stream of curious new faces seeking her guidance, eager to improve their health through wholesome food choices. Instead, the dreary weather seemed to have conspired against her, keeping everyone huddled indoors.

Eloise straightened the worn spines of her collection of ancient medicinal texts lining the shelf behind her desk. Perhaps she should brew some ginger tea - its warming properties always felt particularly comforting on days like these. Or maybe a quick meditation session would help calm her anxious thoughts and draw in positive energy. As she contemplated her options, the bell above the door chimed, announcing an unexpected arrival. 

Eloise turned, her heart skipping a beat with renewed hope.  Could this be the first of many clients drawn by the article's praise?
