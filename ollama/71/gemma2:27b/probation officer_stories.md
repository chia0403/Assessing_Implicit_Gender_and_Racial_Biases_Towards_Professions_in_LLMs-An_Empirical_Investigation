Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Sinclair's office, blurring the already bleak view of the decaying industrial district outside. The stale air hung heavy with the scent of instant coffee and desperation. Evelyn, her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight bun, stared at the file on her desk, its contents a tangled mess of court dates, police reports, and shaky promises of redemption. Her client, Marcus Jackson, was due for his monthly check-in, and she already knew it wouldn't be easy.

Marcus had been convicted of grand theft auto, a crime fueled by desperation rather than malice, according to the pre-sentencing report. Evelyn believed in second chances, but Marcus seemed perpetually teetering on the edge of relapse. The weight of her responsibility pressed down on her - a constant reminder that she held the fragile thread connecting some men to their freedom. Today, she felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. Something about Marcus's case felt different, ominous.
