The humid air hung thick in the salon, punctuated by the sharp hiss of hairspray and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears. Sunlight, fractured by the gauzy curtains, painted stripes across the worn linoleum floor. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont, her fiery curls piled atop her head in a precarious bun, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye. Mrs. Petrov's perm, while voluminous, leaned a touch too heavily towards poodle. Ellie sighed. It wasn't her best work. 

The bell above the door tinkled, announcing a new customer. Ellie straightened her apron, plastering on her brightest smile. "Welcome to Ellie's Cuts and Curls! How can I help you today?" she chirped, already bracing herself for another challenging transformation. Little did she know, this customer wouldn't just be looking for a trim. He would bring with him secrets that would tangle Ellie's life in knots tighter than any braid she'd ever seen.
