Rain lashed against the greenhouse roof, a staccato rhythm that echoed Silas Blackwood's growing unease. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume usually comforting but tonight laced with something sharp and unsettling. Moonlight sliced through the gaps in the warped glass, painting fleeting silver stripes across the tangled ferns and vibrant orchids Silas tended. 

For thirty years, he had been the unseen guardian of Blackwood Manor's sprawling gardens, his life interwoven with the rhythm of seasons and the whispering secrets of ancient trees. Yet tonight, something felt different, a tremor beneath the familiar tranquility. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the panes and sending shivers down Silasâ€™ spine. Even the usually stoic azaleas seemed to droop, their vibrant petals bruised by the relentless storm.  

Silas tightened his grip on his worn trowel, his knuckles pale under the dim light filtering through the greenhouse. He couldn't shake the feeling of being watched, a prickling sensation at the nape of his neck that intensified with every gust of wind.
