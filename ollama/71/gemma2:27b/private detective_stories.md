Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias "Eli" Blackwood's office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape outside. The neon glow from the liquor store across the street painted flickering streaks across his desk, illuminating a half-empty bottle of rye and a stack of dusty case files. Eli took a long swig, the fiery liquid burning a path down his throat, momentarily chasing away the chill that clung to him like a second skin. 

He hadn't taken on a new case in weeks, and boredom was starting to gnaw at him.  The thrill of the chase, the unraveling of secrets, the satisfaction of seeing justice served - those were the things that kept Eli going, but lately, they had become distant memories.  Just then, a sharp rap on the door startled him from his reverie. He rose, wiping his hands on his already stained trench coat, and shuffled over to the door, bracing himself for whatever unwelcome visitor awaited him.
