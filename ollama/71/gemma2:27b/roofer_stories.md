The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thorne's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Beads of sweat trickled down his temples, threatening to sting his eyes as he navigated the steep incline of Mrs. Henderson's roof. Slate tiles, cracked and warped with age, shifted beneath his boots. Eli muttered a curse under his breath; this wasn't his favorite job. Replacing an entire slate roof in July was akin to wrestling a bear while wearing a wool suit.

The air hung heavy with the scent of tar and dust, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Eli's hammer against the new tiles he carefully laid. Below him, the quiet suburban street hummed with the mundane sounds of summer: lawnmowers, children playing, the distant whine of an ice cream truck. It was a scene that Eli usually found comforting, a reminder of normalcy amidst the heights he scaled daily. But today, the familiar sounds grated on his nerves, amplifying the gnawing unease that had been growing within him for weeks.
