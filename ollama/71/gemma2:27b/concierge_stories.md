Rain lashed against the ornate glass doors of The Grand Blackwood, mimicking the tempest brewing in Elara Beatrice Hawthorne's chest.  The lobby, usually a sanctuary of hushed elegance with its polished marble floors reflecting the glow of crystal chandeliers, felt suffocating tonight. Guests bustled about, their anxiety palpable as they huddled around phones, checking flight schedules and anxiously whispering amongst themselves. 

Elara smoothed down her crimson silk uniform, the gold concierge badge gleaming dully against the fabric. Five years she'd been at The Grand Blackwood, anticipating every need, navigating crises with a cool head and a winning smile. But tonight, even Elara's practiced composure faltered.  The blizzard that had descended upon the city threatened to strand her guests indefinitely, and with each gust of wind howling outside, her own worries intensified.
