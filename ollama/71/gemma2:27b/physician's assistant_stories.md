The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear. Eleanor Rose Davenport adjusted her surgical mask, her gloved fingers unconsciously tracing the worn inscription on its side: "Hope heals." A hollow laugh escaped her lips. Hope felt like a distant memory in this overcrowded ER waiting room, filled with anxious faces illuminated by the flickering glow of the TV screen showing a news update about the spreading virus.

Eleanor was exhausted. Three twelve-hour shifts in a row had chipped away at her usual resilience, leaving her feeling raw and vulnerable. Still, she pushed down the fatigue, reminding herself of the oath she'd taken â€“ to serve, to heal, to comfort.  She scanned the faces before her, searching for the next patient who needed her touch, her expertise. 

The double doors swung open with a heavy thud, admitting a gurney carrying a young woman struggling for breath. Eleanor's heart clenched. This wasn't just another flu case. This was something worse. Something she feared deep down.
