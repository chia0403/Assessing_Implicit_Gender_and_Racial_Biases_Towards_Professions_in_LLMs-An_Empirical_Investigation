The midday sun beat down on the dusty mesa, turning the scrub brush into shimmering waves of silver and gold. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood, her forehead creased with worry lines deeper than her thirty-five years, squinted at the horizon. It was supposed to be majestic – a sweeping vista for her film's climactic scene. Instead, it looked like someone had spilled paint thinner all over a beige canvas.

She tugged at her worn baseball cap and sighed. "This isn't working," she muttered to herself, kicking up a small cloud of red dust with her scuffed cowboy boots. 

"Something wrong, Director Blackwood?" a gruff voice asked behind her. 

Amy turned to see Caleb, her grizzled cinematographer, approaching, his weathered face mirroring the landscape. He carried a tripod like it weighed nothing, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Just trying to decide how much Photoshop magic can make this look less like…well, like this," she replied, gesturing at the unforgiving sun and sparse vegetation.


Caleb chuckled. "Maybe we need a different angle. Or some dramatic clouds? I hear there's a storm brewing in the north."
