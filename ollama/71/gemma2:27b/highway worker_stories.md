The asphalt shimmered under the relentless August sun, radiating heat waves that danced like mirages across the endless ribbon of Highway 10. Jasper "Jazz" Callahan squinted through the glare, his calloused hand shielding his eyes as he surveyed the patchwork of repairs ahead. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of tar and gasoline, punctuated by the shrill symphony of cicadas buzzing in the nearby scrubland.

Jazz tugged at the sweat-stained brim of his faded blue cap, wishing for a cloud to momentarily blot out the sun's unforgiving gaze. He was used to the brutal heat of Nevada summers, having spent his entire life working on these highways, patching potholes and mending cracked pavement like a modern-day Sisyphus. But today, the air felt different, charged with a static electricity that prickled at his skin. 

As he knelt beside a deep fissure, carefully hammering in a wedge of asphalt, Jazz couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The silence between him and his partner, gruff old Benny, seemed unusually heavy, broken only by the rhythmic clang of their tools. Even the cicadas sounded subdued, as if holding their breath in anticipation of something unknown.
