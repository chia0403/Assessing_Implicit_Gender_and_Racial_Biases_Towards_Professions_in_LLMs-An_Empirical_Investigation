The insistent chirp of the antique clock on the wall was Amelia Hawthorne's cue to straighten her posture and force a smile onto her face. It was precisely 8:59 am – one minute before the deluge. The glass doors of Hawthorne & Blackwood, Attorneys at Law, would soon swing open, unleashing a tide of stressed clients, disgruntled spouses, and ambitious interns.  Amelia smoothed down the wrinkles in her crisp white blouse, the faint scent of lavender from her hand cream a feeble attempt to combat the inevitable tension that filled the air. The mahogany reception desk gleamed under the soft glow of the chandelier, reflecting Amelia's weary eyes.

Hawthorne & Blackwood was an imposing building, its Victorian facade etched with gargoyles and ivy, its windows overlooking the bustling heart of the city. Inside, however, Amelia felt strangely detached. She was a cog in this well-oiled machine of legal battles, her role confined to answering phones, directing visitors, and brewing endless pots of lukewarm coffee. Yet, despite the monotony, Amelia harbored a secret yearning – a desire to be more than just a face behind the desk. Today, however, felt different. A strange anticipation thrummed beneath her skin, whispering promises of something unexpected, something that might finally break the tedium of her routine.
