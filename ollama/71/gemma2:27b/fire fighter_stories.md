Smoke stung Elias Blackwood's nostrils, acrid and hot even through his thick mask.  The roar of flames filled his ears, a relentless dragon clawing at the old Victorian house. He crouched low to the ground, the heat radiating off the asphalt making the air shimmer. Around him, fellow firefighters battled the blaze with practiced precision, hoses unleashing torrents of water that hissed and steamed upon contact with the inferno.

Elias' heart hammered against his ribs, adrenaline spiking through his veins. This wasn't just another routine fire. Something felt different, off-kilter, about this one. The flames seemed to dance with a manic intensity, licking hungrily at the structure. A shiver ran down Elias' spine despite the searing heat. He couldn't shake the feeling that something unseen was fueling the blaze, something darker and more sinister than mere chance.

He pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the task at hand.  A child, a girl no older than seven, was trapped on the second floor, her terrified cries echoing through the inferno. Elias tightened his grip on his axe, determination hardening his gaze. He wouldn't let this little girl become another statistic. He would fight the flames, fight the fear, and fight for her life.

This wasn't just about duty anymore; it was personal.
