The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Eliza Thorne's studio, each drop a tiny drumbeat in a relentless symphony. The light filtering through the grimy skylight was the colour of old pewter, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered workspace. Cameras and lenses lay scattered on every surface, their chrome glinting dully in the gloom. Eliza herself, perched precariously on a rickety ladder, squinted through the viewfinder of her trusty Leica M6, trying to capture the perfect shot of a wilting rose clutched in a skeletal hand.

The model, a gaunt young man named Leo, sat patiently on a stool beneath her, his face pale and drawn. Eliza had found him wandering the streets, his eyes hollow and haunted, and saw something compelling in his despair. This photo shoot wasn't about beauty or glamour; it was about capturing the raw essence of human vulnerability, the fleeting fragility of life itself.
