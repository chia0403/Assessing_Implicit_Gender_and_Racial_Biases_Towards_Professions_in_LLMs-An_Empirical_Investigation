The pre-dawn air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood like a second skin. The rusty scent of iron and diesel fuel mingled with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil, creating a unique olfactory signature that Teddy had come to associate with home. He sat perched atop his Caterpillar D9R bulldozer, its massive yellow frame dwarfing him like a metal titan.  

The construction site was a tapestry of chaos: half-finished buildings jutting into the sky, mounds of earth waiting to be sculpted, and winding paths carved through the dust. Beyond the immediate clamor, Teddy could hear the distant rumble of traffic on Highway 101, a constant reminder that this sprawling development project was carving its way further into the untouched wilderness bordering San Francisco Bay.

Teddy rubbed his calloused hands together, feeling the familiar ache in his knuckles. He'd been operating heavy machinery since he was old enough to reach the pedals, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. This particular job – clearing land for a new high-rise complex – wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and allowed him to indulge in his real passion: restoring vintage motorcycles.
