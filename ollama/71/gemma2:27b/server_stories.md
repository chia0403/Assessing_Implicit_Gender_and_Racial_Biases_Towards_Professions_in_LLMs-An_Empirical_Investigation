The flickering neon sign outside cast greasy streaks of purple and green across Amelia Rose Cartwright's tired face.  "Luigi's," it proclaimed in bold, blocky letters, promising "Authentic Italian Cuisine Since 1978."  Amelia snorted. Authentic was pushing it. The frozen lasagna came pre-portioned from a food service warehouse twenty miles away.

She stood at the doorway, smoothing down her perpetually wrinkled uniform apron, and took a deep breath of the air thick with garlic, oregano, and the faint scent of desperation. Luigi's wasn't fancy, but it was steady work. And in this economy, steady was all that mattered.  Tonight, however, the usual din of clattering plates and boisterous conversation felt off-kilter. A hushed tension hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic clinking of glasses from the bar and the low hum of a forgotten radio playing Sinatra.


Amelia pushed open the door, steeling herself for another night of dodging drunken tourists, placating grumpy regulars, and balancing overflowing trays while praying she wouldn't spill marinara on Mr. Esposito's pristine white shirt.

But something was different tonight. A stranger sat alone at table six in the corner booth, shrouded in shadow. He wore a dark fedora pulled low over his eyes, and a long trench coat hung loosely from his frame. As Amelia approached, she couldn't shake the feeling that this man wasn't there for the spaghetti and meatballs.
