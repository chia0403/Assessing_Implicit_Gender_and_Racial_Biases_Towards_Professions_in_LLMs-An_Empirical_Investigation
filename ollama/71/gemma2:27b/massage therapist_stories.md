The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of antiseptic. Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather smoothed down her linen tunic, her fingers lingering on the intricate embroidery of hummingbirds threading through cherry blossoms. The afternoon sun slanted through the windowpanes of her tiny massage studio, casting long shadows across the bamboo mat where she awaited her next client. Outside, the bustling streets of San Francisco hummed with life â€“ a stark contrast to the tranquil haven Sera had carved out for herself within this second-floor walkup.

A gentle chime signaled the arrival of her appointment. Sera inhaled deeply, centering herself before turning towards the door, a calm smile already gracing her lips. Today felt different. A sense of anticipation thrummed beneath her skin, as if the universe itself held its breath, waiting to see what would unfold.
