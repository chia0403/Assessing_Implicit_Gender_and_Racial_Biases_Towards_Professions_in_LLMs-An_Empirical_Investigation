Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Harold Finch & Associates, blurring the already indistinct lights of New York City into a shimmering watercolor. Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright, known to all as Bea, shivered despite the oppressive humidity clinging to the air like cobwebs. The ancient typewriter before her clattered rhythmically, its keys worn smooth from decades of diligently transcribing legal decrees and forgotten love letters.

Bea straightened her spine, tugging at the starched collar of her blouse. A stray thought crossed her mind:  Harold Finch must have been a formidable man, judging by the stacks of dusty tomes lining his mahogany shelves and the air thick with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco. He'd left the firm in the capable hands (or so she'd been told) of his nephew, a Mr. Theodore Finch â€“ a name Bea had never met face-to-face.


Theodore was an enigma, a whisper echoing through the halls of Harold Finch & Associates rather than a tangible presence.  He rarely visited the office, preferring to conduct business via cryptic phone calls and terse letters delivered by messengers with faces as impassive as marble statues.

Today, however, promised to be different. Bea had received a handwritten note on thick parchment, requesting her presence in Mr. Finch's private study at precisely 3pm. A shiver of apprehension danced down her spine. What secrets lay hidden behind that mahogany door? What could Mr. Theodore Finch possibly want from a humble secretary like herself?
