The airship groaned, its massive frame straining against the relentless gales whipping across the Azure Isles. Amelia "Ace" Vance wrestled with the control yoke, her knuckles white as bone. Rain lashed against the panoramic cockpit windows, blurring the already treacherous landscape below. Jagged peaks pierced the tempestuous clouds, their snowy summits shrouded in a veil of swirling mist.

Amelia squinted through the downpour, her gaze fixed on the flickering lights of Port Azure, barely visible through the raging storm. Her cargo – a delicate shipment of alchemically-enhanced flora for the Royal Academy – swayed precariously in its harnesses, threatening to spill overboard at any moment. 


Landing in these conditions was suicidal, but Amelia had never been one to shy away from a challenge. The wind shrieked like a banshee, trying to tear her airship apart, while lightning cracked the sky, illuminating the churning sea below. This wasn't just flying; it was a dance with death itself.
