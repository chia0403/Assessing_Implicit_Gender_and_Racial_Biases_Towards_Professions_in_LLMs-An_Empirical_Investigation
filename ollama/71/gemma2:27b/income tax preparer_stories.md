Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Evelyn Price's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatened to topple over, each form a testament to another year of financial woes for her clients. Evelyn sighed, pushing back a stray auburn curl that had escaped its bun. The smell of stale coffee mingled with the faint scent of desperation that clung to every surface in the room - a scent Evelyn knew all too well.

Evelyn Price wasn't just any income tax preparer.

They came to her not just for accurate returns but for a glimmer of empathy in a world that often felt cold and indifferent.
