Rain lashed against the windows of "Restore & Reclaim," blurring the vibrant cityscape beyond into an impressionistic smear of yellow and grey. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, watching the deluge through the steamed glass while rhythmically stretching her own stiff shoulder.  The clinic was eerily quiet for a Tuesday afternoon – only the faint ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner broke the silence. 

Amelia hadn't planned on opening her practice in bustling Seattle. She’d envisioned a quaint, sun-drenched seaside town, somewhere with salty air and the sound of crashing waves instead of endless drizzle. Life, however, had a habit of defying expectations, sending her careening across continents after a whirlwind romance ended as abruptly as it began.  

Now, she found herself in this urban oasis, surrounded by the city's frenetic energy but yearning for a sense of grounding. She loved her work – helping people regain their mobility and reclaim their lives – but today, something felt off. Perhaps it was the relentless rain mirroring the storm brewing within her.
