The neon lights of "Ruby's Cafe" cast a warm glow over the bustling streets of downtown Portland, Oregon. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon wafted out onto the sidewalk, enticing passersby to come in and indulge in a mid-morning treat. Inside, server extraordinaire, Alethea Mae Thompson, navigated the crowded diner with ease, her bright pink apron a beacon of warmth amidst the chaos.

Alethea, or Lee as her friends called her, had been working at Ruby's for five years, and she knew every trick in the book. From juggling multiple tables at once to remembering the intricate details of each customer's order, she was the ultimate multitasker. But despite her skills and confidence, Alethea couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It started with small things: a missing ingredient here, a miscommunication there â€“ but had been escalating into full-blown anxiety in recent weeks.

As she expertly juggled a tray of drinks and plates, Lee's mind wandered to the strange phone call she'd received last night from an unknown number. The voice on the other end had been low and gravelly, with an accent that sounded like it came from nowhere in particular. "Meet me at Ruby's tonight," they'd said. "We need to talk."
