Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain pattered against the grimy windows of the small, cramped office building on 5th Street, casting a melancholy gloom over the drab concrete floor. In a corner office that seemed to be stuck in a perpetual state of stagnation, Emily Victoria Wellesley hunched over her desk, eyes fixed on the computer screen as she mechanically typed out another day's worth of reports.

It was 9:05 AM on a typical Tuesday morning at Smith & Co., a mid-sized accounting firm that had been struggling to stay afloat in an industry rapidly undergoing automation. Emily, a secretary with three years of experience and a keen eye for detail, was responsible for keeping the office running smoothly - or, at the very least, trying to.

As she worked, Emily's mind wandered to her plans for the day: a meeting with the firm's struggling CEO, Mr. Johnson, who was rumored to be on the verge of being fired; a phone call to the client who had been threatening to take his business elsewhere; and a tedious task list that seemed to grow longer by the hour.

The office phone rang, shrill in the silence, and Emily's heart skipped a beat as she reached for the receiver. She knew it was going to be another long day at Smith & Co.
