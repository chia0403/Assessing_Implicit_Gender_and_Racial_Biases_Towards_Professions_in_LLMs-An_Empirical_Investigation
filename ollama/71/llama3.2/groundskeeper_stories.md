Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant hint of blooming lilacs.

In a small plot of land on Elm Street, groundskeeper Everett Fletcher surveyed his domain with pride. He had spent countless hours tending to the overgrown gardens, weeding out the weeds, and pruning the bushes. His job was never glamorous, but it gave him a sense of satisfaction that he couldn't find anywhere else.

Everett's eyes scanned the property, taking in the vibrant colors of the flowers and the lush green of the grass. He had always loved this spot, with its ancient oak tree and winding path that led to a small pond. It was a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustling town, and Everett felt lucky to be able to call it his own.

As he walked along the path, the sound of birds chirping and water lapping against the shore filled the air. Everett felt a sense of contentment wash over him, and for a moment, he forgot about the troubles that plagued the rest of his life. But as he approached the pond, he noticed something strange - a piece of paper caught in the reeds, fluttering gently in the breeze.

Everett's heart quickened as he reached out to retrieve the paper. It was an old-fashioned letter, yellowed with age and creased from being folded multiple times. The address on the envelope read "For Everett Fletcher, Groundskeeper", and the postmark indicated it had been sent from a small town hundreds of miles away.

What could this letter mean? And who would have sent it to him?
