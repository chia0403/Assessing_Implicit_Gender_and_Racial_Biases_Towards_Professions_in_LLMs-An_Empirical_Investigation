Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she stepped off the last bus of the evening, Dr. Sofia Elena Vasquez gazed out at the mist-shrouded streets of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, the soft glow of the city's nightlife illuminating the towering buildings and eclectic shops that lined 12th Avenue. It was a chilly spring evening in late April, with the promise of rain hanging heavy in the air like a damp shroud.

Sofia, or Sofie as she was known to her friends and colleagues, had spent the day at the Seattle Children's Hospital, working with children with physical disabilities and watching them learn to navigate the world around them. As an occupational therapist specializing in pediatric rehabilitation, she took pride in helping kids like Max, a bright-eyed six-year-old who had been confined to his wheelchair since birth.

Now, as she made her way home through the quiet streets, Sofia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She'd received a cryptic message from an unknown number earlier that day - a single text with no explanation, just two words: "Look again."
