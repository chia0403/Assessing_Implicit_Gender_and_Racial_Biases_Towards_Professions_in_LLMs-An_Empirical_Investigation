Here's a potential story opening:

The fog crept in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of Ravenshire in a damp, grey mist that clung to every cobblestone like a damp shroud. In the heart of this misty metropolis, where the smell of cured meat and freshly baked bread wafted from the butchers' shops, lived Emilia "Mia" Blackwood - a master butcher with hands as skilled as they were scarred.
