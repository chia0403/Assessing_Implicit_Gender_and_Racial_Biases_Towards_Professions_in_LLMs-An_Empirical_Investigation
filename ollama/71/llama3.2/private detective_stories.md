It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle's historic Pioneer Square neighborhood, the kind of night that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of coffee. But for Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, private detective, there were no such comforts on the horizon.

As he stood outside his office, a small, unassuming building on the corner of First Avenue and Yesler Way, Hawk gazed out at the rain-soaked streets, his eyes squinting against the gloom. His office was a dingy but reliable haven, cluttered with files, photos, and the occasional broken chair, all testaments to the countless cases that had crossed through its door over the years.

Hawk himself was no stranger to the rain, his dark hair slick with it, his eyes a piercing blue that seemed to bore into those he met. A former cop turned private eye, he'd built a reputation for being one of the best in the business – if not the best. He had a keen mind, a quick wit, and a sixth sense for sniffing out trouble.

As he pushed open the door to his office, a bell above it let out a tired clang, announcing Hawk's arrival to the handful of regulars who filled the waiting room with their various ailments: a flustered businesswoman with a missing briefcase, a desperate husband searching for a cheating wife, and a pair of giggling teenagers trying to find their lost phone. It was just another night in the life of Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, private detective – where the rain poured down, but the stories never dried up.
