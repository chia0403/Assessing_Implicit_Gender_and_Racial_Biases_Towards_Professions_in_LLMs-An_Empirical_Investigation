As one of the top salespeople at the prestigious company, Takasago Industries, Kaito was no stranger to high-pressure deals and long hours. But tonight was different. Tonight was the night he had been waiting for – the night he would finally close a deal that could make or break his career.

With a smile plastered on his face, Kaito walked into the heart of the company's headquarters, ready to close the deal that would change his life forever.
