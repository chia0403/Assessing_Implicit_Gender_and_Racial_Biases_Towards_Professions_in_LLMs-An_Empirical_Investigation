Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain pounded against the old stone walls of Ravenshire Keep, casting a misty veil over the crumbling castle. Inside, Guard Elwes ap Rhys stood watch at the entrance, his eyes scanning the darkening courtyard for any sign of trouble.

It was a night like any other in this forsaken corner of Wales - the wind howled through the battlements, and the candles flickered in the great hall as if trying to keep the shadows at bay. But Elwes knew better than to be lulled by such petty comforts. He had seen what lurked beyond the safety of these walls: the dark forests, the whispered rumors of ancient powers stirring in the depths of the nearby mountains.

As he gazed out into the night, his thoughts turned to the strange letter that had arrived earlier that day. It was addressed to him personally, and its words sent a shiver down his spine:

"Meet me at midnight, in the old oak grove just beyond the forest's edge. Come alone."

Elwes knew better than to ignore such an invitation - not when the weight of Ravenshire Keep hung precariously in the balance. He had seen it before: the sudden appearances of ghostly apparitions, the whispered rumors of dark rituals and ancient powers stirring once more.

And now, as he stood watch over the castle's threshold, Elwes wondered what new danger was about to unfold beneath his very nose.
