Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, shaking the water from her jacket as she gazed up at the towering spires of the Olympic Hotel. The neon lights of the bars and clubs that lined 2nd Avenue reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the sidewalk. It was just after midnight on a drizzly spring night, and the city's usual bustle had given way to an eerie silence.

As she watched, a lone figure emerged from the shadows of the hotel's entrance, dodging a taxi cab as it sped away into the darkness. Emilia's instincts told her that this person was trouble - someone who didn't belong in this part of town at this hour.

With 12 years on the force and a reputation for being one of the best in the city, Detective Thompson had seen her fair share of weird cases. But there was something about tonight that felt off, like a thread waiting to be pulled. As she watched the stranger disappear into the hotel's lobby, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that this case was just beginning.
