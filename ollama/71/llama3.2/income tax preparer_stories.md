The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn Form 1040s that littered the countertops of Rachel Marie Thompson's small office in downtown Portland, Oregon. As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Rachel's eyes scanned the stack of returns, searching for any sign of life amidst the sea of deductions and exemptions. It was March 15th, Tax Day, and Rachel's phone had been ringing nonstop since dawn.

She took pride in her work, but the job was far from glamorous, and she often found herself feeling like a number-crunching automaton, churning out returns by the dozen without ever really stopping to consider the human stories behind each one.
