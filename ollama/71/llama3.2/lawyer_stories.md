Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of the misty morning air and into the warm, golden light of her office. She stretched her arms over her head, feeling the familiar creak in her shoulders from a long night of pouring over documents and case files.

As a partner at the law firm of Smith & Associates, Lexi had spent years building a reputation as one of Seattle's top corporate lawyers. Her clients were some of the city's most influential business owners, and she took pride in being able to navigate the complex web of laws and regulations that governed their industries.

But on this particular morning, Lexi's mind was elsewhere. She was still reeling from the events of the previous night, when she had received a cryptic phone call from an old acquaintance with information about her mother's mysterious death all those years ago. The revelation had left her feeling shaken and uncertain, like the fragile foundation of one of her own high-rise buildings had been suddenly breached.

Now, as she settled into her chair and began to sift through the day's mail, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The rain outside seemed to be falling in rhythmic patterns, like a ticking clock counting down the moments until she would uncover the truth about her mother's death and the secrets that had been hidden for so long.
