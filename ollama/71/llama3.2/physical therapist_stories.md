Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stood at the edge of the rooftop pool, her gaze sweeping over the city skyline as the sun set behind her. The warm breeze carried the scent of saltwater and sunscreen, a familiar comfort after a long day of helping patients recover from injuries on land.

As a physical therapist at St. Michael's Hospital, Alex had spent years working with patients who had suffered everything from broken bones to debilitating neurological conditions. She took pride in watching them regain their strength and mobility, but it was moments like these – when she could finally step back and clear her head – that reminded her of why she became a therapist in the first place.

The city lights twinkled like diamonds below, casting a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. The rooftop pool was one of the hospital's many amenities, designed to promote relaxation and well-being among patients and staff alike. Alex had grown to love this spot, finding solace in its peaceful atmosphere after a long day of pushing patients to their limits.

As she stood there, lost in thought, Alex's phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the silence. She smiled wryly, knowing that whatever message it was, it would likely be work-related. She pulled out the phone and peered at the screen, her eyes narrowing as she read the text from her colleague, Dr. Patel:

"Meet me in conference room 3 ASAP. We need to discuss the Johnson case."

Alex's heart sank slightly – the Johnson case was one of her most challenging patients, a young woman with multiple sclerosis who had been struggling to regain mobility and independence after a devastating relapse. Alex had been working closely with Dr. Patel, their team leader, to develop a new treatment plan for the patient.

Without hesitation, Alex slipped off her shoes and made her way back into the hospital, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in the world of physical therapy.
