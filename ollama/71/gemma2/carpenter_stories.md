The scent of sawdust and varnish hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's calloused fingers like a second skin. Sunlight streamed through the open workshop doors, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer echoed in the stillness, punctuated only by the distant cawing of crows circling overhead. 

Elias, a man weathered and worn like the antique oak he was currently refinishing, took a moment to wipe the sweat from his brow. At fifty-two, his once-strong back ached with each movement, but the work itself held a calming rhythm that soothed the restless anxieties gnawing at him lately. 

He lived in Oakhaven, a quaint seaside town nestled between rolling hills and the turbulent Atlantic Ocean.  The air carried the salty tang of the sea, a constant reminder of both beauty and danger, much like life itself. Elias had spent his entire life here, carving his future out of wood one piece at a time. But lately, a storm was brewing within him, threatening to shatter the quiet tranquility he had carefully constructed.
