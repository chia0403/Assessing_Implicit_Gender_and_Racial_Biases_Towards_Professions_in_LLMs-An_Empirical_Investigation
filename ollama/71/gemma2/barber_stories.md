The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung thick in the air, a familiar lullaby to Bartholomew Silas "Barty" Finch's ears. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of his shop, illuminating motes dancing in the golden light. His antique chair, worn smooth by countless backsides, creaked softly as he adjusted the comb nestled amongst his carefully kept clippers and shears. Outside, the bustling city of New Albion hummed with its usual energy, a cacophony of carriage wheels clattering on cobblestones and hawkers shouting their wares. But within the four walls of Barty's barbershop, time seemed to move at its own leisurely pace, measured by the snip of scissors and the gentle rasp of razors against skin. 


He was finishing up a particularly intricate fade on Mr. Henderson, a portly merchant with a penchant for meticulously combed sideburns, when the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer. Barty glanced up, his eyes settling on a figure shrouded in shadow. His gut told him this wouldn't be just another day at the barbershop.
