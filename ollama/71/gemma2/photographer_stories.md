The air in Savannah hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, making Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's linen dress stick to her skin like a second layer. Sweat beaded on her brow, but she didn't dare wipe it away â€“ not while she was framing the shot.  

Amelia had come to Savannah chasing the ghosts of history, drawn by its cobblestone streets and moss-draped oaks that seemed to whisper tales of forgotten lives. She aimed her camera at a weathered wrought iron gate, its once vibrant paint faded into a melancholy rust. Beyond it lay a crumbling mansion, its balconies shrouded in creeping vines, looking like something out of a gothic novel. This was the heart of Savannah's historic district, a labyrinth of stories begging to be told through her lens. She longed to capture not just the beauty of the decaying grandeur, but also the unseen, the echoes of laughter and sorrow that lingered within these aged walls.  


This city, Amelia believed, held more secrets than its charming facades revealed. And she, with her trusty camera as her guide, was determined to unearth them.
