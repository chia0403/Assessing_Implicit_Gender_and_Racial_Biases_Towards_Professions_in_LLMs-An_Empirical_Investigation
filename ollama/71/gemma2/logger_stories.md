The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Silas Blackwood swung his axe with practiced ease. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes against the backdrop of dawn breaking over the Cascade Mountains. The towering firs stretched towards the pale sky, their branches laden with the promise of a crisp autumn day.  

Silas was alone, as he usually was when it came to felling the giants. His family, scattered across the state and beyond, never quite understood his passion for this solitary life. They called him stubborn, said he'd find a better way to earn a living, but Silas knew no other life worth living. The rhythm of the axe, the thud of the falling trees, the raw power of nature – it was all that mattered. 

He paused, glancing at the familiar curve of the mountain path leading down from his camp. His father's cabin, perched precariously on the edge of a steep incline, came into view. It had been empty since his father’s passing three years ago, a constant reminder of Silas' solitary existence. But today, something felt different. A flicker of movement in the distance made him raise an eyebrow. He couldn't quite make out what it was, but it wasn't anything he'd seen before.
