The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's clinic cast an eerie green glow over the deserted parking lot. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the anxious drumming of Ellie's fingers on her worn examination table. It was 1:30 am, well past closing time, and she was alone in the dimly lit building, save for a snoring tomcat named Mittens curled up in a basket behind the reception desk. A sense of unease settled over Ellie like a damp shroud. This wasn't your typical late-night emergency; this was different. It felt...charged. 

The call had come just as she was about to turn off her bedside lamp â€“ a breathless, frantic plea from a voice she recognized instantly: Mrs. Henderson, the elderly woman who lived on the edge of town and whose beloved golden retriever, Buddy, had been acting strangely all week.  Now, with a whimper echoing over the phone line, Mrs. Henderson had told Ellie, "He's gone strange, doctor. He won't eat, he's whining...and he keeps looking at me like I don't belong."

Ellie knew Buddy well; he was a gentle giant, more likely to lick your face than bite you. This wasn't like him. Whatever was happening felt sinister, almost supernatural, and Ellie found herself gripped by a mixture of curiosity and dread as she waited for Mrs. Henderson to arrive with her canine companion.  The wind howled outside, rattling the windows in their frames, and Ellie wished she hadn't turned off the overhead lights just yet.


**Setting:** A small, run-down veterinary clinic on the outskirts of a sleepy town, late at night during a raging storm.
