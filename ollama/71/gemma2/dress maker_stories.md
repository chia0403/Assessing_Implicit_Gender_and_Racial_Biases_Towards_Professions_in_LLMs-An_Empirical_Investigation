The air in Elara Beaumont's atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender and old silk. Sunlight, filtered through stained glass windows depicting whimsical floral patterns, painted rainbows across the dusty floorboards.  Each seamstress had their own patch of sunlight to work in, their stations a symphony of flickering candlelight and the gentle clacking of thimbles against needles. 

Elara, however, found her solace not under the sunlit skylight but tucked away in a shadowy corner by the back wall. Here, surrounded by bolts of velvet as dark as night and shimmering satins that whispered promises of luxury, she breathed life into fabric, transforming simple swatches into wearable dreams. Elara, with her calloused fingertips and eyes that held the wisdom of a hundred forgotten stories, was known throughout London for crafting gowns that captured not just the wearer's form but their very essence.  

Today, however, a knot of worry tightened in Elara’s chest. A commission, one more prestigious than any she’d undertaken before, lay draped over her mannequin. It wasn't the intricate design or the precious beads that troubled her, but the looming deadline and the whispered rumors swirling through the city like autumn leaves caught in a storm - whispers of a curse, a darkness that threatened to engulf even the brightest stars.
