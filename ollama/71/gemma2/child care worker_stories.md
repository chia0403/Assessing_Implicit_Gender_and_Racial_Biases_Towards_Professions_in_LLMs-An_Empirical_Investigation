The smell of burnt toast hung thick in the air, a familiar scent to Clara Beatrice Hawthorne on Tuesday mornings. It wasn't unusual for little Liam, a five-year-old with boundless energy and a penchant for "helping" in the kitchen, to accidentally set off the smoke alarm while attempting breakfast solo.  

Clara sighed, her usual morning pep fading slightly as she surveyed the scene: flour dusted across the counter, a half-eaten jar of peanut butter clinging precariously to the edge, and Liam himself, perched on a stool, his face smudged with jam and a sheepish grin plastered across his lips.  

The setting was "Sunshine Days," a small, brightly-painted day care center nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac in suburban Maplewood. Its walls were adorned with children's artwork, the air buzzing with the constant hum of playful chaos. It wasn't always easy, Clara knew, managing a group of twenty rambunctious preschoolers between the ages of three and five, but she wouldnâ€™t trade it for the world. 


The day was just beginning, and Clara had a feeling it would be anything but ordinary.
