The air in the penthouse suite was as thick with cigar smoke as it was with unspoken tension. Amelia "Amy" Sinclair-Jones, CEO of Solaris Industries, paced before the panoramic window overlooking the glittering Manhattan skyline. Her stilettos clicked against the hardwood floor like a metronome keeping time with her mounting anxiety. Below, the city pulsed with life, oblivious to the storm brewing within these opulent walls. Tonight's board meeting had gone south, fast, and Amy knew the fallout could be catastrophic for everything she'd built. 

The mahogany desk in the center of the room held a half-empty glass of scotch and a crumpled stack of financial projections, each page stained with the telltale smudges of her frantic calculations. A sleek silver phone lay beside them, its silent ring tone mockingly hinting at the avalanche of calls she was avoiding. Amy took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising tide of panic. It had all come down to this - one disastrous quarter, and her empire teetered on the brink. She needed a miracle, and fast.
