The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty windows of "Bargain Bin Bonanza," casting long, distorted shadows across shelves overflowing with mismatched trinkets and faded relics. Behind the counter, Amelia Beatrice Kensington, known to most as Amy, meticulously polished a tarnished silver locket with a weary sigh. 

The air hung thick with the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams.  A lone fly buzzed erratically around a chipped porcelain doll with vacant eyes. The bell above the door tinkled faintly, announcing a customer â€“ or perhaps just another gust of wind swirling through the deserted strip mall. Amy straightened her faded apron and forced a smile, already bracing herself for yet another day of politely fielding inquiries about broken toasters and second-hand encyclopedias. She longed for something more, anything more, than this dusty purgatory of forgotten treasures. But for now, she was just Amy Kensington, the reluctant purveyor of the past.
