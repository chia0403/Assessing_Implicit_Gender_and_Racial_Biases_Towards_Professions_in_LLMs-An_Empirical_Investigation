The dawn mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s boots like a disapproving ghost as he surveyed his domain.  Bartholomew, or Bart as his meager social circle allowed him, ran a calloused hand over the weathered wood of his rake handle. The sprawling Victorian mansion known as Blackwood Manor loomed before him, its once vibrant paint now faded and peeling like sunburnt skin. It whispered secrets in the wind through broken panes and crumbling gargoyles. 

Bart was the caretaker, the last bastion against nature’s relentless encroachment. He knew every crack in the cobblestones, every rustle in the overgrown rose bushes, every mournful sigh of the ancient oak that stood sentinel by the manor's front gates.  He had spent his entire life within these crumbling walls, tending to them as a silent guardian while the world outside moved on. But this morning felt different. A shiver ran down Bart’s spine, prickling him with an unsettling awareness. Something was amiss in Blackwood Manor’s stillness.
