The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind that rattled the windows of the Grand Blackwood Library. Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewood, head librarian for nearly two decades, surveyed the rows upon rows of towering bookshelves with a practiced eye. Each volume held a universe within its pages, whispering forgotten stories and untold secrets.  

Eleanor loved this sanctuary, her refuge from the chaotic world outside. Here, amidst the hushed whispers and rustling pages, she felt truly at peace. But today, even the familiar solace couldn't entirely quell the unease that had settled over her like a shroud. The grand oak doors, usually flung open wide to welcome visitors, were locked tight, casting long shadows across the marble floor. A single flickering lantern illuminated her path as she made her way towards the main desk, its mahogany surface polished to a gleam by countless fingertips seeking knowledge and solace.  

Her gaze fell upon a note pinned to the brass nameplate: "Gone for an unscheduled emergency. Please do not disturb." It was scrawled in a hurried hand, unfamiliar to Eleanor, leaving a chill crawling down her spine. Something was amiss.
