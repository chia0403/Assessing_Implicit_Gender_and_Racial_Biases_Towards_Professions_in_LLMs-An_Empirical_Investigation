The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee in Dr. Eleanor Vance's tiny office. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the diner across the street. A lone streetlight flickered outside, casting long shadows that danced ominously across the worn linoleum floor.  

Eleanor rubbed her tired eyes, trying to focus on the file in front of her.

She sighed, a weary sound lost in the hum of the fluorescent lights above.

As he stepped closer, Eleanor could see his face: young, pale, and etched with worry lines that seemed far too deep for someone barely out of his teens.
