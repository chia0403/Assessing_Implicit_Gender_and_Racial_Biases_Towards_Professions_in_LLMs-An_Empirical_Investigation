The salt spray stung Amelia "Ace" Vanderlyn's face as she leaned out of the cockpit window, letting the wind whip through her dark braid. Below, the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea churned, whipped into a frenzy by the approaching storm. The air crackled with static electricity, and the sky bled crimson and bruised purple. 

Ace’s small seaplane, christened “The Dragonfly,” bobbed precariously on the waves. She gripped the controls tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This wasn't just any flight; this was a mercy mission. Dr. Elias Thorne, an elderly but brilliant marine biologist, was stranded on a remote island, ravaged by the storm and in dire need of medical attention. Ace had volunteered for the risky delivery of emergency supplies and his evacuation before the hurricane hit full force.

The Dragonfly creaked and groaned under the strain of the wind. The radio crackled with static, the only sound besides the roaring tempest.  Ace knew this wasn't going to be easy. The storm was building rapidly, and visibility was already plummeting. But Ace Vanderlyn didn’t shy away from a challenge. She was known as "Ace" for a reason - she thrived on danger, pushing her skills and luck to their limits.


This island, shrouded in mist and fury, awaited them.
