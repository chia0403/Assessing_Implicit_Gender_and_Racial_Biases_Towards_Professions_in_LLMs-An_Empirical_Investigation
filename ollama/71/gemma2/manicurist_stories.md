The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and cherry blossom nail polish as Amelia Rose Dubois carefully filed the edges of Mrs. Hemmingsworth's nails. Outside, the bustling city of New York hummed a symphony of sirens and construction, but within the confines of "Nails on Lenox," it was a haven of hushed whispers and gentle clinking. Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting warm squares across the plush purple carpet and illuminating the rainbow display of polishes lining the walls.

Amelia, with her nimble fingers and ever-present smile, had become something of a confidante to her clientele. They came not just for manicures, but for Amelia's patient ear and surprisingly insightful advice. She knew Mrs. Hemmingsworth’s favorite granddaughter's name (Lily), that Mr. Jones was secretly writing a romance novel, and that Ms. Garcia preferred classic red over anything trendy. 

Today, however, something felt different. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the surface of Amelia's usual calm. A new client sat across from her, shrouded in an air of mystery. The woman’s face was partially hidden behind dark sunglasses, and her fingers, long and slender, tapped impatiently on the worn leather seat of the manicure chair. 


Amelia took a deep breath and set down her tools. This wasn't just another day at Nails on Lenox. Today felt like the beginning of something…unusual.
