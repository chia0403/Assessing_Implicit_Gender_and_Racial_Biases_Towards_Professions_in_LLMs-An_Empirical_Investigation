The stale scent of printer ink clung to Amelia Beatrice Cartwright like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar aroma as she surveyed her cluttered workspace. Mountains of colour swatches threatened to engulf her desk, while abandoned cups of lukewarm coffee formed precarious towers beside half-finished sketches. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of her converted attic studio, casting long shadows across the room and illuminating the chaos with an almost ethereal glow.

Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for bold colours and abstract patterns, was in the throes of creative turmoil.
