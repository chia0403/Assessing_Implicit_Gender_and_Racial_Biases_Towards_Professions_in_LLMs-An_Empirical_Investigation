The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the vast expanse of the National Museum of Antiquities. It was well past midnight, the usual cacophony of tourists replaced by the hushed whispers of slumbering exhibits and the rhythmic swish-swash of Silas Blackwood’s mop as he traversed the cavernous halls. 

Silas, a wiry man with eyes that held the weariness of countless late nights and an unyielding loyalty to his cleaning cart – affectionately nicknamed “Betsy” – was the museum's sole janitor. He knew its secrets better than any curator: the faint scent of cedar clinging to the ancient sarcophagus in Egyptian wing, the barely discernible tremor in the marble bust of Caesar when a gust of wind rattled the windows, and the precise moment the sun hit the mosaic floor just right, turning it into a shimmering sea of gold. But tonight, something felt different. 

A low hum resonated through the museum, vibrating in Silas’s teeth and prickling his skin with an unsettling static charge. The air grew thick, charged with an unseen energy that tugged at the edges of his consciousness. A shiver ran down his spine, a feeling he couldn't quite place – both exhilarating and terrifying. His gloved hand tightened on the handle of Betsy, suddenly realizing that the museum’s usual quiet hum had been replaced by something… else.
