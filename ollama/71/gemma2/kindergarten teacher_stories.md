The scent of crayons and Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Rose Hawthorne. Sunlight streamed through the windows of her tiny classroom, illuminating the rainbow alphabet letters strung across the wall and the handprint turkeys adorning the bulletin board. It was the first day back after Thanksgiving break, and the usual cacophony of excited chatter filled the room. 

Amelia, with her hair pulled back in a messy bun and a perpetually smudged smile, watched as her five-year-olds wrestled with their crayons, transforming blank sheets of paper into vibrant landscapes. She loved this time, the fresh start of every year, watching these tiny humans blossom with curiosity and creativity. This year, however, felt different. A subtle tension thrummed beneath the surface, a whisper of something unsettling just beyond Amelia’s grasp. It started with the missing crayons – first a handful of red ones, then an entire box of purple. Then there were the whispers, snippets of strange conversations overheard during playtime.  Amelia dismissed it all as normal kindergarten chaos, but a nagging feeling persisted, a chill that crawled up her spine whenever she glanced at the empty space under her desk.
