The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewood, their pallid glow reflecting off the sterile walls of the small clinic waiting room. The air was thick with antiseptic and hushed anxieties, punctuated by the occasional cough or sniffle. Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly to the crisp blue scrubs that hugged her slender frame, meticulously organized the vials on the counter.  

As a phlebotomist at Community Healthcare, she'd seen it all - nervous first-timers clutching their parent's hands, seasoned veterans with veins like hardened pipes, and everyone in between. The blood draw itself was just a small moment in their lives, but for Amelia, it was a tiny window into the human experience. A glimpse of fear, vulnerability, even resilience.  


Today felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck. Maybe it was the unusually quiet waiting room, or perhaps the lingering scent of lavender disinfectant that seemed to amplify the silence. Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.
