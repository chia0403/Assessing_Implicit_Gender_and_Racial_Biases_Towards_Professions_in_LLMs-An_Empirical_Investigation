The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Thompson's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Each flicker cast jagged shadows across her meticulously organized desk, momentarily obscuring piles of receipts, W-2 forms, and crumpled coffee napkins – the detritus of another tax season. 

Her small office, tucked away on the second floor of a faded brick building in downtown Elmwood, was a testament to both order and chaos.  The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma this time of year. Amy sighed, pushing her glasses up her nose. Outside, winter had finally sunk its teeth into Elmwood, blanketing the town in a layer of gray snow that mirrored the mood she felt creeping in. 

She glanced at the clock – 8:57 AM.  Only three minutes until the first client walked through the door, bringing with them their hopes (for a refund), fears (of an audit), and enough paperwork to fill a small swimming pool. 


Amy was ready. She always was. After all, she lived for tax season – the puzzle-solving, the late nights fueled by caffeine and pretzels, the satisfaction of helping her clients navigate the treacherous labyrinth of the IRS. This year, though, felt different. A weight settled on Amy's chest, a premonition that this wasn't just another season. Something was brewing, something beyond the usual tax woes and deadline pressure.
