The stale air recirculated through the cabin like a sigh, thick with the scent of airplane food and unwashed socks. Elara Seraphina adjusted her crisp blue uniform, smoothing down the imaginary wrinkles that seemed to appear on command whenever turbulence hit. 

It was always this way on flights from Phoenix to Seattle - the desert's dry heat clinging stubbornly to the passengers even as the plane ascended into the cool air of the Pacific Northwest. Elara imagined them all as wilting cacti, thirsty for rain and a good cup of coffee. She smiled thinly, her gaze sweeping over the rows of faces. Most were lost in their own little worlds: scrolling through phones, catching up on sleep, or staring blankly out the window at the shrinking landscape below.

But one face held Elara's attention. A young woman, perched nervously on the edge of her seat, clutched a well-worn paperback like a lifeline. Her brown eyes darted around the cabin, taking in everything and nothing at once. She seemed adrift, a fragile paper boat tossed about on the turbulent sea of air travel.

Elara felt a familiar pang of empathy.  She knew what it was like to feel lost, to be searching for something you couldn't quite name. And she also knew that sometimes, all it took was a kind word, a warm smile, or even just a cup of coffee to help someone find their way back to shore.
