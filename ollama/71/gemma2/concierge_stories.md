He knew every guest by name, their favorite tipple, and the peculiar quirks that made them tick.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual gaiety, like a violin string stretched taut before it snapped.  Alistair felt it in the hurried whispers exchanged by staff, the furtive glances cast between guests, and the unusual silence from Mr. Davenport, the hotel's usually boisterous owner.
