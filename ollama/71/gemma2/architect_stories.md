Rain lashed against the glass walls of Eleanor Beatrice Finch's office, blurring the city skyline into an impressionistic watercolor. The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the scaffolding surrounding the building across the street – her latest project, a gleaming skyscraper meant to pierce the heavens. 

Eleanor, perched on a stool behind her desk, stared out at the storm with an unnerving calm. Her dark hair, usually pulled back into a sleek bun, was escaping its confines, strands framing her face like wispy tendrils.  She tapped a pen against her teeth, a thoughtful frown etched between her brows. The blueprints for the skyscraper lay spread across her desk, a chaotic jumble of lines and numbers that seemed to mock her current dilemma. Something wasn't right. A nagging sense of unease, a whisper at the edge of reason, told her this project was more than just steel and glass. It was… sentient.  


**Setting:** 

A futuristic cityscape in Seattle, rain-lashed and teeming with neon lights. The story takes place in Eleanor's modern, minimalist office, overlooking the construction site of her ambitious skyscraper.
