The humid Georgia air hung heavy as Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins wrestled the rusty pipe out from under the sink.  Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes, but Bart didn’t flinch. He wiped it away with the back of his grimy hand, grumbling about the age of the plumbing in this old Charleston duplex. The tenant, a young woman named Lily, stood patiently by, her face etched with concern as she watched him work. 

“Anything I can do to help?” she asked, her voice soft and hesitant.

Bart chuckled, a gravelly sound like rocks tumbling in a dry well. “Just try not to flood the place while you wait, alright? This old gal’s got more leaks than a sieve.” 


The setting: A cramped and humid kitchen in a dilapidated duplex on a sweltering summer day in Charleston, South Carolina. The year is 1947, and the air is thick with the scent of magnolia blossoms and stale coffee.  Outside, cicadas buzzed incessantly, their song a relentless backdrop to Bart’s work.
