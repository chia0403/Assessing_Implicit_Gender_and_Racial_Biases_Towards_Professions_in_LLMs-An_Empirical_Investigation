The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Croft's head, casting a sterile glow on the worn leather sofa. It was perpetually 5:02 PM in her office – the time just before the after-work rush began to build outside, the world turning into a chorus of sirens and traffic jams, while here, inside this quiet space, the air remained thick with unspoken anxieties. Amelia leaned forward, her gaze fixed on the man across from her, David Lewis. He fidgeted, his hands twisting in his lap like restless vines. 

Amelia's office was tucked away in a nondescript building on a bustling city street. It wasn't grand, but it was hers – a sanctuary built around bookshelves overflowing with volumes on the human psyche and a faint scent of sandalwood incense that lingered in the air. Through the window, she could see the cityscape unfurl – a tapestry of concrete and glass, reflecting the city's perpetual state of motion, a stark contrast to the stillness within her office walls.
