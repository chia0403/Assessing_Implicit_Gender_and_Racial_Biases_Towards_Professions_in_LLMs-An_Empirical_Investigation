The air hung thick with lavender and eucalyptus in Willow Creek Wellness. Rain lashed against the large windows, blurring the world outside into an impressionistic canvas of greens and grays. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously lined up her array of oils – peppermint, ginger, chamomile – each bottle a promise of soothing relief. Outside, the storm raged on, but within these walls, a haven of calm existed. It was Amelia's sanctuary, where she kneaded away tension, not just from muscles, but from the very souls of those who crossed her threshold.  She glanced at the clock, 10:45 am, and waited for her next client, a man named Harold, to arrive. His booking note simply read "chronic neck pain." Amelia hoped she could offer him more than just temporary respite; she wished she could unravel the knotted anxieties that often lurked beneath physical discomfort.
