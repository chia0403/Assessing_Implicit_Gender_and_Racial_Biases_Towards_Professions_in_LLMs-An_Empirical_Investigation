The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and asphalt, a scent as familiar to Elias "Lee" Montgomery as his own skin. He squinted through the haze, watching the sunrise bleed over the endless ribbon of Highway 12. Another day, another stretch of blacktop to mend, another symphony of jackhammers, engines, and shouted commands. Lee tugged his worn baseball cap lower, shielding his eyes from the glare bouncing off the freshly laid asphalt. It was a brutal job, but someone had to do it, and he prided himself on being one of the best damn highway workers this side of the Mississippi. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the desolate Nevada desert landscape, painting the distant mesas in hues of burnt orange and dusky purple. The wind whipped through the open spaces, carrying with it the whispered secrets of travelers passing by, ghosts of stories etched onto the endless expanse of asphalt. Lee's weathered hand instinctively tightened around his thermos, the metal warm against his calloused fingers. His work crew was spread out across a mile-long stretch of road, patching up pothole craters like cosmic blemishes on the face of the earth. He knew every inch of this highway â€“ the treacherous curves, the patches of loose gravel, the hidden springs that sometimes turned the dust into slick mud traps.  This road, with its inherent dangers and quiet beauty, was his domain.
