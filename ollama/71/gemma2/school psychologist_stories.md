The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Brighton's head like a chorus of anxious bees. Her office at Ridgewood High School felt sterile, suffocating even, with its beige walls adorned with posters of motivational quotes that had long lost their meaning. It was the kind of place where teenage angst simmered just beneath the surface, waiting for the slightest provocation to erupt. Amelia, however, found a strange solace in this controlled chaos. 

Today's storm was brewing in the form of Ethan Davis, a hulking sophomore who'd stormed into her office earlier that morning, his face twisted in a grimace of pure frustration.  His parents had insisted he see her after multiple outbursts in class and a concerning note discovered tucked away in his locker. Amelia suspected it wasn't simply teenage angst, though Ethan was adamant about proving otherwise. 


"It's nothing," he muttered again, his voice rough with defiance as he glared at the worn-out rug beneath his feet. "Just school stuff."
Amelia leaned forward, her gaze soft but unwavering.  "Ethan," she began, choosing her words carefully, "I understand things can feel overwhelming sometimes, but shutting down isn't going to help. Talking about it might." 


The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken emotions. Outside, the wind howled, mirroring the tempest raging inside Ethan's soul. Amelia knew that beneath his tough exterior, there was a boy desperately trying to find his way, and she was determined to help him navigate this storm.
