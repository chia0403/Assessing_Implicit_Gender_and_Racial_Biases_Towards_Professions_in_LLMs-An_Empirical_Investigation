The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across Eleanor Violet Hawthorne's cluttered writing desk. Stacks of parchment, each meticulously inked with her spidery handwriting, rose precariously like miniature towers beside an overflowing inkwell. Outside, London throbbed with the ceaseless hum of carriages and hawkers, but within the confines of her cramped attic room, a silence reigned, broken only by the scratch of Eleanor’s quill against paper.  

She chewed on the end of her pen, staring at the blank page before her. Inspiration, once a constant companion, had abandoned her like a fickle lover. The grand romance she'd envisioned for her latest novel – a tale of star-crossed lovers entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal – felt as lifeless as yesterday’s bread. Her fingers tightened around the quill, frustration gnawing at her. How could she write about passion when her own heart felt like a barren wasteland?
