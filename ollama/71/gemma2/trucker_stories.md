The rusty CB crackled to life in Harlan "Hurricane" Hayes' rig, its baritone voice slicing through the thick humidity hanging over the Louisiana bayou. "Truckers' Prayer comin' up," the gravelly voice announced, followed by a familiar hymn about safe passage and clear roads. Harlan smiled wryly. He knew the tune by heart, sung it a thousand times during his cross-country hauls, but tonight, he wasn't sure if prayers would be enough. 

The humid air pressed against the windows of his Peterbilt, its chrome gleaming dully under the sickly yellow streetlights that lined Highway 90. He was two days into a six-day haul from Houston to New Orleans, hauling a refrigerated trailer full of Louisiana crawfish destined for some fancy restaurant in Chicago.  He'd chosen this route before, but something felt different tonight. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, and the usual symphony of crickets and frogs seemed muted, replaced by an unnerving silence broken only by the drone of his diesel engine. 

Harlan took a deep breath, gripping the steering wheel tighter. He'd faced blizzards in Montana, wildfires in Oregon, and even a tornado chasing him down the Kansas plains, but something about this Louisiana night sent a shiver down his spine.
