The air hung thick with humidity, heavy as the July afternoon sun beat down on Amelia Rose Carter's black Ford Focus. Her office, nestled in a cramped storefront in downtown Savannah, Georgia, offered little relief. The window unit wheezed out lukewarm air, struggling to combat the oppressive heat that seemed to seep through every crack and crevice of the building. 

Amelia sighed, pushing her thick, auburn hair off her sweaty forehead. Another day, another parole hearing. This time, it was Daniel "Danny" O'Connell, a young man fresh out of prison for petty theft, with a string of offenses stretching back to his teenage years. Amelia had seen this type before - lost, desperate, caught in the relentless grip of circumstance. She wasn't sure if Danny was capable of breaking free, but she knew she wouldn't let him fall through the cracks.  

As Danny's name flashed on her screen, a familiar knot of tension tightened in Amelia's chest. This wasn't just about paperwork and legal jargon; it was about people, about second chances, about trying to make a difference in a world that often felt indifferent to their struggles.  


This time, she hoped Danny would be different.
