The rain hammered against Dr. Elara Blackwood's office window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  

The room itself was a haven of calm amidst the storm raging outside: warm lighting cast a gentle glow over plush armchairs and bookshelves lined with well-worn copies of psychological treatises. An earthy aroma from the diffuser filled the air, designed to soothe anxiety, though it seemed to have little effect on Dr. Blackwood's current state. She was staring at the empty seat across from her, waiting for a client who had never shown up before. 

This wasn't the first missed appointment; in fact, no-shows had become a disturbingly common occurrence lately.  It gnawed at Elara, fueled by a deep-seated belief that everyone deserved a chance to find their voice, to heal. These missed appointments felt like a betrayal of that belief. A silence settled over the room, heavy and oppressive. 

Elara sighed, leaning back in her chair. It was times like these she questioned her choices. Perhaps psychology wasn't her calling after all.  Perhaps it was just too much, bearing the weight of other people's pain.   


The chime of a notification on her phone startled her. A new message from the clinic: "Patient reschedule request. Name: Ethan Carter."  

Elara felt a flicker of hope. Maybe this wouldn't be another missed appointment. Maybe, just maybe, she could make a difference in Ethan Carter's life after all.
