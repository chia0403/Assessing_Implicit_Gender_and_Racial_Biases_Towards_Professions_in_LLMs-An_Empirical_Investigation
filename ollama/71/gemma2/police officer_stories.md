Rain hammered against the windshield of Officer Amelia Hayes' cruiser, blurring the neon signs of the downtown strip into an impressionist smear. A low mist clung to the pavement, reflecting the city lights in fractured pools. Amelia squinted through the deluge, her brow furrowed as she scanned the rain-slicked street. Sheâ€™d been on patrol for three hours now, and the only excitement had been a stray cat tangled in some Christmas lights.  A familiar emptiness gnawed at her. This shift felt like every other: long stretches of quiet punctuated by the occasional mundane call.

Amelia wasn't sure when the thrill had gone out of the job. Maybe it was the endless cycle of petty crime, the bureaucratic red tape, or the creeping sense that she was merely rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced beneath her skin, urging her forward.  

The radio crackled to life, pulling Amelia from her thoughts. "Unit 23, we have a possible disturbance at The Crimson Dragon," the dispatcher's voice boomed over the static. "Multiple reports of shouting and possible weapons involved."


**Setting:** A gritty, rain-soaked city on the cusp of winter. Neon signs cast an oily glow on the streets, and the air is thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and damp pavement.  

The Crimson Dragon: An unassuming dive bar known for its seedy clientele and questionable reputation.
