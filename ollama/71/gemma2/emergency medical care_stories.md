The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and disinfectant as Elena Ramirez, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), burst through the door of the dilapidated apartment building. Sirens wailed in the distance, their mournful cries echoing off the graffiti-stained brick walls. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape outside.  

Elena's partner, rookie EMT Liam O'Connell, trailed close behind, his face pale under the harsh glow of his flashlight. "Call it in, Elena," he muttered, his voice barely audible over the drumming rain and the distant wail of the ambulance they had dispatched moments before. 

"Got it," Elena replied, tapping on her radio as she surveyed the scene. A thin trickle of blood snaked its way across the cracked linoleum floor leading towards a darkened doorway. "Dispatch, this is Eagle One, possible victim down at 123 Elm Street, second floor. Suspected assault."  

The rain seemed to intensify, each drop hitting the pavement with an almost angry thud. Elena swallowed, her pulse quickening. This wasn't just another routine call; something in the air, the way the shadows danced in the flickering streetlight, felt off. 


She pushed open the door marked "2B" and stepped into the gloom, Liam close behind. The smell of stale cigarette smoke mingled with the metallic scent of blood, sending a shiver down Elena's spine. This was going to be a long night.
