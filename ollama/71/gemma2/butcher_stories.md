The air in Butcher's Block was thick with the scent of iron and thyme, a perfume unique to the trade. Elias "Eli" Blackwood, his apron splattered with crimson from an early morning brisket, stood surveying his domain. The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh, was a symphony of worn wood, gleaming steel, and butcher's twine strung taut between hooks bearing glistening cuts of meat. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, casting long shadows across the mosaic floor that Elias's grandmother had painstakingly laid, piece by bloody piece, after every Saturday for fifty years.  

Eli wiped his brow, leaving a streak of grease on his forehead. It was market day, and the air thrummed with anticipation. He could hear the clatter of carts approaching from the main street, the shouts of hawkers peddling their wares, and the distant rumble of hooves on cobblestones. But inside Butcher's Block, time moved at its own pace, measured by the rhythmic thump of cleavers against bone and the low hum of conversation between Eli and his regulars. Today, though, a sense of unease hung in the air.  A chill had settled over the city that morning, deeper than the usual Scottish bite, and whispers about strange happenings outside town had begun to circulate.
