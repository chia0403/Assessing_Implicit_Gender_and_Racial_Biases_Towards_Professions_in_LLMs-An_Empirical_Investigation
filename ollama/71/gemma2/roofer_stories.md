The sun beat down on Amelia "Amy"  Bellweather's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped into her eyes, blurring the panorama of terracotta roofs stretching before her. She wiped it away with the back of her calloused hand, squinting at the flashing she needed to install on Mrs. O’Malley’s chimney. It was a tricky angle, requiring more balance and finesse than brute strength. Amy wasn't afraid of heights - in fact, she found solace in them. Up here, amongst the shingles and sky, her problems seemed miles away, replaced by the rhythmic hammering and the distant hum of the city below. 

This particular city, Denver, was a symphony of contradictions: sprawling green parks nestled beside towering glass skyscrapers, bohemian coffee shops juxtaposed with gritty dive bars, all wrapped in a perpetually sunny disposition.  Amy loved it. She had grown up here, her childhood spent wandering its dusty alleys and learning the art of fixing things from her grandfather, a retired electrician who taught her to respect the rhythm of life's gears. 


But right now, all Amy could focus on was Mrs. O’Malley's chimney and the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. The job wasn't going as smoothly as she had planned, and time was running out.  A storm was predicted for later that evening, and a leaky roof during a downpour meant more than just a wet carpet - it meant potential disaster.
