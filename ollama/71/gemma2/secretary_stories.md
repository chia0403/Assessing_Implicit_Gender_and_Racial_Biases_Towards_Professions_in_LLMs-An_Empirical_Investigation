The insistent buzz of the automatic coffee machine sliced through Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick's concentration like a hot knife through butter. She sighed, her shoulders slumping further into the worn leather of her office chair. It was 6:47 am, and she was already drowning in paperwork. Her boss, Mr. Bartholomew Grimshaw III, had an unfortunate habit of leaving his "urgent" memos until the very last minute, then demanding they be stamped and delivered by dawn.

Eleanor's office wasn't exactly grand. Situated on the fourth floor of the Grimshaw & Sons building, it was a cramped space with faded floral wallpaper, a perpetually dusty potted fern in the corner, and a window overlooking the bustling city street below. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. This wasn't the glamorous life Eleanor had envisioned when she graduated with honors in English Literature. She dreamt of being a journalist, weaving captivating stories that moved hearts and minds. Instead, here she was, trapped in a cubicle purgatory, her only solace the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard and the occasional delivery of lukewarm coffee. 

The clock ticked past seven. Mr. Grimshaw would be arriving any minute now. Eleanor gulped down the rest of her lukewarm coffee, steeling herself for the day ahead. This wasn't just another day at the office; today was Tuesday, which meant a mountain of expense reports to process, a flurry of calls to schedule, and a high chance Mr. Grimshaw would ask her to rewrite his entire retirement speech in iambic pentameter.
