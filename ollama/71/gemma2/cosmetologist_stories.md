The scent of lavender shampoo and rosemary conditioner hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic whir of the hairdryer and the quiet hum of conversation. Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows of "Shear Elegance," bathing the small salon in a warm glow. 

Isabella Marie Petrova, known to most as Izzy, expertly teased and curled the hair of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose bouffant held more volume than the entirety of some European countries. Izzyâ€™s nimble fingers worked with practiced ease, her movements smooth and precise, her smile bright and genuine.  She loved this time of day - the lull before the afternoon rush, when the salon hummed with a quiet energy and Mrs. Henderson's constant stream of gossip filled the air. 

But today, a tension buzzed beneath the surface of normalcy. Izzy could feel it in the way her usual cheerful customers seemed distracted, their conversations hushed, even their smiles a touch strained. The news had been buzzing all week about a mysterious illness sweeping through the city, leaving people sick and disoriented. No one knew much about it, but fear was starting to take root like a weed in fertile ground. Izzy, however, tried not to let it cloud her day. After all, she thought as she expertly applied Mrs. Henderson's favorite cherry-red lipstick, "People need their beauty routines now more than ever."
