The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Finch like a second skin as he wrestled with the tangled mess of copper wire beneath the rusted metal chassis of the 1940s-era Zenith console radio. Sweat beaded on his brow, tracing paths through the dust and grime that caked his face. The small repair shop, tucked away in an alley behind Mrs. Peabody's bustling bakery, smelled faintly of burnt sugar and ozone, a strangely comforting aroma for Bart.

Outside, the world pulsed with the chaotic energy of Savannah’s historic district. Tourists milled about, their voices echoing off the cobblestone streets, while jazz music spilled from open doorways, beckoning patrons into dimly lit bars. But inside the cramped workshop, time seemed to move differently. The whirring fan on the workbench was the soundtrack to Bart's world, its rhythmic hum a counterpoint to the crackling static that filled the air whenever he touched the radio’s delicate components. 


This wasn't just another repair for Bart. This Zenith, with its chipped Bakelite knobs and faded turquoise paint, held a piece of his past. It belonged to his grandfather, a man who had taught him everything about radios, about the magic that resided within their intricate circuitry. Now, facing this ancient machine, Bart felt a familiar tug of nostalgia, a yearning for simpler times when the world was less complicated, and the only static came from a poorly tuned antenna.
