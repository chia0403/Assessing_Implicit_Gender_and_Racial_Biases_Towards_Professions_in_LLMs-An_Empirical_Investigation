The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hayes' office. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the blinds, illuminating the rows of brightly colored yoga mats stacked neatly against one wall and the antique massage table draped in its crisp white sheet. The air smelled faintly of lavender and eucalyptus oil, a comforting blend designed to soothe both body and mind. 

Amy stood by the window, her gaze lost in the bustling city scene below. Cars zipped along the street like impatient ants, their horns blaring out a discordant symphony. She sighed, the weight of another long day settling on her shoulders. The city's energy was always so palpable, it could be both exhilarating and exhausting.  

Today had been particularly draining. A string of patients with chronic pain, each story carrying its own burden of weariness and frustration. Amy felt the familiar ache in her own lower back, a constant reminder of the physical toll her profession took. But despite the fatigue, she found solace in knowing she made a difference. In easing their aches, she was helping to alleviate the invisible weight they carried, allowing them a sliver more space to breathe, to move, to simply exist with less pain.
