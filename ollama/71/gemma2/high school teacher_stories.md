The fluorescent lights hummed above Mrs. Amelia Davenport's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over her history classroom. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst.  Outside, the Virginia sun beat down on the asphalt playground, but inside, the room remained stubbornly cool. 

Amelia surveyed her students, a motley crew of tired eyes and half-hearted yawns. They were sprawled over desks, slumped in chairs, and even a few dared to lie horizontally on the floor, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it was supposed to be a learning environment.  It was the last week of school before summer vacation, and Amelia could practically taste the freedom in the air, both hers and theirs. 


She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It seemed like just yesterday these kids had been wide-eyed freshmen, eager to learn about the past. Now, they were graduating seniors, more interested in their phones than ancient civilizations.
