The air in Jasper's workshop hung thick with the scent of whetstone and dust. Sunlight, filtered through grime-coated windows, cast long shadows across the cluttered floor, illuminating mounds of rough granite, slabs of marble waiting to be shaped, and chipped chisel heads scattered like fallen soldiers.  

Jasper Thorne, his hands calloused and strong from years of wielding hammer and chisel, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple as he kneaded the clay model in his lap, shaping it into a miniature replica of the colossal sundial he was commissioned to carve for Lord Beaumont's new manor. 

The workshop, nestled in a forgotten corner of the bustling city of Elowyn, was Jasper's sanctuary. Here, amidst the clang and clatter of his tools, he found solace from the city's clamour and the whispers that followed him like shadows â€“ whispers about his past, about the curse that clung to him like cobwebs. 


He ignored them all, focusing instead on the clay beneath his fingers, willing it to become the perfect miniature of his grand creation. A masterpiece that would not only impress Lord Beaumont but also silence the doubters who scoffed at his talent, whispering that he was merely a shadow of his father, the once-renowned stone sculptor whose legacy had been swallowed by tragedy.
