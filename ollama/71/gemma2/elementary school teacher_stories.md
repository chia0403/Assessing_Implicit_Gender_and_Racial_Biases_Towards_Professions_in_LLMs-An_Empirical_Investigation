The late August sun beat down on Miss Eleanor Periwinkle's weathered face as she knelt in her garden, weeding between rows of marigolds and zinnias. Their vibrant colours were meant to bring joy to the little faces that would soon be peering through classroom windows, but today, Eleanor felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. This year was different.

Her quaint elementary school, nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering willow trees in the small town of Applewood Creek, had undergone changes. Funding cuts meant larger class sizes, outdated textbooks, and no more field trips. A sense of unease hung heavy in the air, a palpable tension that even the sweet scent of blooming honeysuckle couldn't dispel. Eleanor glanced at the chipped paint on her porch swing and sighed. This year, she wasn't just facing the usual challenges of teaching first graders; she was navigating uncharted waters, uncertain about what lay ahead for her students, herself, and the beloved school that had been her second home for twenty years.
