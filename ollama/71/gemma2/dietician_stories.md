The aroma of burnt caramel wafted through the air in Clara Evelyn Beaumont's office, mingling with the faint scent of lavender hand sanitizer. It was coming from the client across from her - a man named Kevin whose self-proclaimed 'caramel fudge brownie diet' was causing him more trouble than joy. 

Clara, perched on the edge of her ergonomic chair, stared at the half-eaten brownie clutched in Kevin's hand.  Her office, tucked away in a quiet corner of a bustling downtown Toronto building, was a haven of pastel colours and natural light. A large potted fern occupied one corner, its fronds casting dancing shadows on the wall as sunlight streamed through the window. 

She was used to dealing with clients who had an unhealthy relationship with food, but Kevin's devotion to burnt caramel and chocolate seemed especially fervent. Clara sighed, bracing herself for another round of dietary 'negotiations'.  His stubbornness was a challenge, but she prided herself on her patience and ability to find common ground even with the most ardent sugar enthusiasts.
