The humid Georgia air hung heavy in The Rusty Bucket, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Harper like a second skin as she wiped down the sticky bar top. It was nearing midnight, the usual post-work crowd thinning out, leaving behind a haze of cigarette smoke and spilled beer. Amy leaned back against the worn wooden counter, her emerald green eyes scanning the handful of remaining patrons. 

The Rusty Bucket wasn't much to look at - a dimly lit dive bar nestled on the outskirts of Savannah, its neon sign flickering with a tired yellow glow.  But it held a certain charm, a sense of faded grandeur whispering through the peeling paint and warped floorboards. It was a place where secrets were shared over cheap whiskey, where stories unfolded like worn-out tapestries, each thread holding a piece of someone's life. 


Amy felt a familiar pull towards the regulars - their faces etched with years of laughter, loss, and everything in between. They were her family, bound together by the unspoken language of shared sorrows and quiet victories. Tonight, though, a prickling sense of unease settled over Amy, a feeling that something was different, something lurking just beyond the familiar hum of conversation.
