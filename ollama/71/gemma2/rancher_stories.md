The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, casting long shadows across the sprawling fields of Jasper Creek Ranch. A chill settled in the air, carrying the scent of sagebrush and drying hay. 

Johnathan "Jack" Blackwood stood on the porch of his weathered farmhouse, a worn Stetson pulled low over his brow. He surveyed his domain: rolling hills dotted with grazing cattle, the rickety barn where generations of Blackwoods had labored, and beyond it, the imposing silhouette of his father's grave. Jack was a man carved from the same rugged landscape he tended - strong, silent, with weathered skin and eyes that held the wisdom of countless sunrises and storms.  

He was alone. His wife, Sarah, had passed three years ago, leaving him to navigate the ranch and their young daughter, Lily, all by himself. This loneliness was a constant ache, a hollow space in his chest that no amount of hard work could fill. Yet, Jack wouldn't trade this life for anything. He carried on, bound by duty, love for his land, and the memory of Sarah's gentle smile. 


The wind picked up, whispering through the tallgrass like restless spirits. Jack turned away from the setting sun,  a sense of foreboding settling over him. Something was different tonight. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a tension that made his skin crawl. Whatever it was, he knew it wouldn't be good for Jasper Creek Ranch.
