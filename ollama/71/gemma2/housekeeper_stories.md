The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's worn cotton apron like a second skin. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the manor house, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.  Amelia stood poised by the grand fireplace, her gaze fixed on the intricately carved mantlepiece, her mind far away from the polished mahogany and gleaming silverware that surrounded her. She wasn't cleaning just a room; she was scrubbing away memories, each swipe of the cloth erasing another fragment of a life that felt increasingly foreign. 

This sprawling Victorian mansion, with its secrets whispered in the rustling curtains and hidden beneath layers of forgotten grandeur, had been Amelia's home for twenty years. Now, after the passing of Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood, its mistress for three generations, it felt like a mausoleum, echoing with the ghosts of laughter, tears, and a lifetime lived within these walls. 


Amelia knew every nook and cranny, every creak and groan of this house. She knew the way the sunlight slanted across the Persian rug in the drawing-room on a Tuesday afternoon, how the grandfather clock chimed at precisely ten o'clock each evening, and where Mrs. Blackwood kept her stash of lavender-scented soap hidden behind a tapestry in her bedroom. Yet, with each passing day, the house seemed to whisper its secrets to Amelia, not in words, but in the subtle shift of shadows, the faint scent of jasmine lingering in the air, and the echo of a song sung long ago.
