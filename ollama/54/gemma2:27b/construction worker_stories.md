The midday sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a grimy rag. Dust devils danced across the skeletal frame of the half-built skyscraper, whipping up plumes of gritty sand that stung his eyes. Below him, the city sprawled out like a concrete and glass mosaic, shimmering in the oppressive heat. Elias gripped the steel beam tighter, his calloused hands aching from hours of hoisting and maneuvering rebar. The constant clanging of metal on metal, the whine of power tools, and the shouts of his fellow workers formed a chaotic symphony that reverberated through his bones. He wasn't sure what he hated more - the relentless heat or the bone-deep exhaustion that threatened to cripple him with every step.

Today was Elias's thirtieth birthday. Thirty years spent building other people's dreams, while his own seemed to crumble around him like unbaked mortar.
