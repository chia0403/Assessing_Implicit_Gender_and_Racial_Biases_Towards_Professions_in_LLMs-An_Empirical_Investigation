The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, a sharp contrast to the acrid smell of burnt sugar emanating from the kitchen. Eloise Beaumont sighed, smoothing a crease on the antique damask tablecloth she'd just painstakingly ironed. "Really, Bernard," she called out, her voice laced with exasperation, "must you incinerate every batch of cookies?"

Eloise stood in the sun-drenched dining room of her latest project: a rambling Victorian townhouse nestled amidst the cobblestone streets and ivy-clad buildings of Edinburgh's New Town. The house itself was a testament to past grandeur, its ornate moldings and stained glass windows whispering tales of bygone eras. Eloise, however, was focused on breathing new life into the space, transforming it from a dusty relic into a vibrant haven for her clients, the McGregors, who were due to arrive any minute.

Beyond the elegant dining table, the drawing-room awaited its final touches: a velvet chaise longue nestled by the fireplace, a hand-painted Chinese screen dividing the reading nook from the grand piano. Eloise envisioned them all bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun streaming through the arched windows, creating an atmosphere both inviting and utterly chic.  But first, she needed to wrangle Bernard, her perpetually distracted and culinarily challenged assistant, away from his fiery culinary experiments.
