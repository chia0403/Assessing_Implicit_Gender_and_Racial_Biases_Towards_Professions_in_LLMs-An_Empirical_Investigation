The scent of crayons and construction paper hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Amelia Roseweather had come to associate with home more than her own cluttered apartment. Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows of Ms. Roseweather's Kindergarten classroom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm beam. Outside, the vibrant green of spring was just beginning to unfurl on the trees lining the playground, but inside, Amelia was facing a different kind of chaos. 

Twenty-five five-year-olds buzzed around her like hyperactive bumblebees. Tiny bodies sprawled across the brightly coloured rug, wrestling over blocks and squabbling over crayons. The cacophony was a symphony only she could truly appreciate: a blend of giggles, shrieks, and the insistent thrumming of "Wheels on the Bus" playing from a forgotten tablet propped against a stack of picture books. 

Today was show-and-tell day, and Amelia braced herself for the inevitable onslaught of stuffed animals, plastic dinosaurs, and questionable treasures unearthed from under beds and couch cushions. A mischievous grin spread across her face as she remembered last week's "show" which involved a half-eaten granola bar and a surprisingly eloquent defense of its nutritional value.
