Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Blackwood & Sons law firm, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Beatrice Ophelia Hawthorne. Her manicured nails tapped impatiently on the chipped Formica countertop as she stared at the overflowing in-tray. It was 6:15 pm, well past her supposed quitting time, and the mountain of paperwork showed no signs of diminishing.

Beatrice, a woman who believed order was next to godliness, was drowning in chaos. Her boss, the notoriously absent-minded Mr. Blackwood, had left for his annual fishing trip to the Scottish Highlands without delegating a single task, leaving Beatrice to wrangle unruly clients, decipher cryptic legal jargon, and attempt to maintain some semblance of normalcy in the firm's crumbling infrastructure.

The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long shadows across the dusty filing cabinets and overflowing bookshelves. A stale smell of old coffee and despair permeated the air. Beatrice sighed, her shoulders slumping further under the weight of responsibility. She longed for a moment of respite, a sip of something stronger than lukewarm tea, and perhaps a glimpse of the moon peeking through the relentless downpour.

But first, she had to conquer Mount In-tray, one crumpled document at a time.
