The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic like a thousand frantic drummers. Eleanor Rose Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her face as she watched the deluge through the grimy window. The power had been out for hours, plunging the small village clinic into an eerie twilight lit only by flickering kerosene lamps. 

A cough rattled from behind the flimsy curtain separating Eleanor's makeshift ward.  She straightened her rumpled uniform, the "St. Michael's Clinic" badge crooked on her breast pocket.  Tonight was already shaping up to be a long one.

Outside, the wind howled like a hungry beast, tearing at the flimsy tin walls and sending shivers down Eleanor's spine. But fear wasn't what gnawed at her - it was the unspoken dread in the eyes of the villagers huddled on the floor, their faces pale and drawn under the flickering lamplight.  They knew. They always knew. The storm meant more than just rain and wind. It meant danger.

And Eleanor, the only registered nurse for miles, was all that stood between them and the unknown.
