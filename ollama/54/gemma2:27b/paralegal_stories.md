Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's cramped office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the already-frazzled nerves of the overworked paralegal. Bart hunched over his overflowing desk, the sickly yellow light from a bare bulb casting long shadows across stacks of files teetering precariously. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - the olfactory signature of Finch & Finch, Attorneys at Law, a two-man operation struggling to stay afloat in the murky waters of legal representation.

Bart sighed, his gaze drifting from the mountain of paperwork to the framed photograph on his desk: a faded image of his grandfather, Bartholomew Sr., the firm's founder. The old man's stern face seemed to judge Bart's every move, a constant reminder of the legacy he was failing to uphold.  Tonight, the weight of that legacy felt heavier than usual. A particularly complex case involving a disputed will and a family riddled with secrets threatened to consume him entirely.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled Bart out of his contemplation. He straightened his rumpled tie, plastering a semblance of professionalism onto his weary face.


"Come in," he called, bracing himself for whatever fresh wave of legal chaos awaited.
