The July sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's neck like a blacksmith hammering iron. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn bundle of shingles. He stood precariously near the edge of Mrs. Henderson's three-story Victorian home, the faded turquoise paint peeling like sunburnt skin. Below him, the bustling city of Willow Creek hummed, oblivious to Bart's precarious dance on the rooftop. The sweet, cloying scent of honeysuckle drifted up from the garden below, a stark contrast to the pungent smell of tar and asphalt that clung to his work clothes. 

Bart adjusted his grip on the shingles, muttering a curse under his breath. He wasn't afraid of heights – he was born with a roofer's soul, his father and grandfather before him scaling the same dizzying peaks. But today, a gnawing unease settled in his stomach, heavier than any bundle of shingles. Something felt… off.

He glanced back towards the street, where Mrs. Henderson's gleaming black sedan sat parked incongruously amongst the modest pickups and sedans of the neighborhood. A shiver ran down his spine as he caught sight of a shadowy figure lurking behind a towering oak tree across the street.
