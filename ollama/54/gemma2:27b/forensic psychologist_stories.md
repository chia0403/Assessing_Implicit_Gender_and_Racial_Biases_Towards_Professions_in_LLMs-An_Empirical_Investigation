Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Albright's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed, casting an unsettling glow over the sparse furniture: a steel table bolted to the floor, two unforgiving chairs facing each other. Across from her sat Marcus Thorne, a man whose vacant eyes and unsettling stillness belied the brutal crime he was accused of.

Evelyn had seen her fair share of darkness in her years as a forensic psychologist for the NYPD, but something about Marcus unnerved her. His calm facade felt calculated, a carefully constructed mask hiding something far more sinister beneath. He hadn't uttered a single word since she entered the room, his gaze fixed on a point somewhere beyond her shoulder. 

The air hung thick with tension as Evelyn studied him, trying to decipher the labyrinthine pathways of his mind. Was he truly innocent, a victim of circumstance? Or was he a cunning predator, playing a twisted game? This case, unlike any she'd encountered before, promised to be a chilling descent into the darkest corners of the human psyche.
