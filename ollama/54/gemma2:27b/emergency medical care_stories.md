Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the diner sign into an abstract smear of pink and yellow. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright gnawed on her thumbnail, the sterile scent of disinfectant battling with the greasy aroma of fries wafting in from the next booth. Her pager buzzed, a shrill counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain.

Amelia snatched it up, her heart leaping into overdrive. A code blue at Mercy Hospital, Room 312. Cardiac arrest.  She slammed the pager down, adrenaline flooding her system. "Looks like dinner's off, Dave," she said to her partner, who was engrossed in a game of solitaire on his phone.

Dave barely looked up. "Yeah, yeah, go save the day." He mumbled through a mouthful of fries. Amelia rolled her eyes, already halfway out the door. 

Mercy Hospital loomed ahead, its windows glowing like watchful eyes against the storm-ravaged night. Tonight, Amelia knew, those eyes were looking to her for hope.
