The neon sign outside flickered, casting intermittent stripes of green and purple across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's face as she straightened the salt and pepper shakers on table six.  A greasy haze hung thick in the air, punctuated by the sizzle of burgers on the grill and the clinking of beer glasses. This was The Rusty Spatula, a roadside diner clinging to the edge of Highway 66 like a tired traveler needing one last cup of coffee before braving the endless asphalt ahead. Amelia had worked here for three years, long enough to know every squeak in the vinyl booths, every crack in the chipped Formica countertop, and the precise moment each night when Old Man Jenkins would order his usual: black coffee, two sugars, and a slice of apple pie "warmed up real good."  Tonight, however, felt different. A restlessness thrummed beneath Amelia's skin, an itch for something beyond refilling ketchup bottles and wiping down sticky tables. As she caught the eye of a weary trucker staring out the window, his face etched with miles and unspoken stories, Amelia knew â€“ tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
