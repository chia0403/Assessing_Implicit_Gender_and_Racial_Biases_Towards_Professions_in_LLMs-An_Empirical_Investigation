Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's chiropractic clinic, blurring the already fading light of the autumn afternoon.  The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, mirroring the steady ache in Eleanor's own shoulders. She'd been adjusting patients non-stop since noon, and even though she loved her work, a deep weariness had settled into her bones.

Eleanor’s clinic, nestled on a quiet side street in the historic district of Asheville, North Carolina, was an oasis of calm amidst the bustling city. Exposed brick walls, polished hardwood floors, and the soothing scent of lavender oil created a sanctuary for her patients, many of whom arrived with chronic pain and anxieties etched onto their faces.

Today, however, the usual serenity felt disrupted. The storm outside seemed to press in on Eleanor, mirroring the unease that had settled within her. It wasn't just the fatigue; something felt off, a subtle shift in the energy of the day.  As she prepared for her last patient, a shiver ran down her spine, and Eleanor couldn’t help but wonder if the storm was brewing both outside and within.
