Grease stained his fingers, permanently it seemed. Silas Tiberius "Ty" Blackwood ran a calloused hand through his unruly brown hair, strands sticking up at defiant angles.  The air in Ty's garage hung thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt oil, a fragrance that, to him, smelled like home. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air and catching on the chrome glint of a '57 Chevy Bel Air patiently waiting for its turn on the lift.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind where even the cicadas seemed to be taking a siesta. Ty was wrestling with a stubborn carburetor on a beat-up Ford pickup when the bell above the garage door jingled, announcing a customer. He wiped his hands on a rag, leaving streaks of black across the faded blue fabric. 

"Be right with ya!" he hollered, emerging from under the hood just as a figure stepped cautiously through the doorway.
