Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the ancient glass. Eleanor Beatrice Finch, her silver hair pulled into a severe bun, adjusted her spectacles and peered out at the swirling grey chaos. The storm had arrived suddenly, swallowing the afternoon sun in a matter of minutes. 

Inside the library, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the soft rustle of pages as Eleanor meticulously reshelved a collection of Victorian poetry.  The scent of aged paper and leather filled the air, a comforting familiarity that had wrapped around her like a warm shawl for over three decades. This was her sanctuary, her haven from the world outside.


But today, even the library couldn't quite quell the unease that prickled at Eleanor's skin. A strange dream, vivid and unsettling, had haunted her sleep. An ancient book, its pages filled with cryptic symbols, a whispering voice promising forbidden knowledge... It clung to her like cobwebs, refusing to be brushed away.

As if summoned by her thoughts, the library door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in shadow. Eleanor straightened, curiosity battling with a flicker of apprehension.  She had never seen this man before.
