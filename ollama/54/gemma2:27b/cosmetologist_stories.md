The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and argan oil as Elara Rose threaded a delicate silver needle through her client's braid. Sunlight streamed through the arched window of "The Gilded Comb," painting stripes of warmth across the hardwood floor and illuminating the intricate henna designs adorning Elara's hands. The shop, nestled in a bustling corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a haven of bohemian chic â€“ overflowing with vibrant fabrics, antique mirrors, and the soft murmur of jazz filtering in from the street.
