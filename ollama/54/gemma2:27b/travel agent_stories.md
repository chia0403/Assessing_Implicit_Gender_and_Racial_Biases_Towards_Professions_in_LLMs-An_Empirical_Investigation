The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes.  Amelia Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear as she stared out at the bustling Bangkok street. Tuk-tuks weaved through traffic like neon-painted dragonflies, their horns blaring a chaotic symphony. Above, the sky was a bruised purple, pregnant with monsoon rain. Amelia loved the energy of the city, the way it throbbed with life, but today, she felt a familiar pang of unease.

Her tiny office, tucked away on a side street crammed with street food vendors and flower stalls, was quiet. Usually, this time of day would be filled with the excited chatter of clients planning their dream vacations, but today, Amelia's phone remained stubbornly silent.  The recent downturn in tourism had hit her small agency hard, and she couldn't help but wonder if she'd made a mistake leaving the security of her corporate job for this unpredictable life.
