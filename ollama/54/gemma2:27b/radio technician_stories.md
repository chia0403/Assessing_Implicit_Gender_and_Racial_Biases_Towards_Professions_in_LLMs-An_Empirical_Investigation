The air in the cramped workshop hung heavy with the scent of solder and ozone.  Sweat beaded on Elara Finch's forehead as she hunched over the antique Zenith console, her tools scattered around her like fallen leaves. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly on the corrugated iron roof, turning the space into a furnace. 

Elara traced a delicate fingertip along a frayed wire, its insulation cracked and brittle with age. This was no ordinary repair job. The Zenith wasn't just any radio; it was a relic, a whispered legend from her grandfather's time. Rumored to pick up frequencies beyond the human ear, whispers of voices from another world clung to it like dust. Elara, ever the skeptic, dismissed them as folklore until she started hearing things herself - faint clicks and pops, ghostly echoes weaving through static.


Now, with the radio disassembled before her, a sense of unease pricked at her skin. This wasn't about fixing broken circuits anymore; it felt like unraveling something far deeper, something ancient and unknown.
