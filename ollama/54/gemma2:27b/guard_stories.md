The incessant dripping from the stalactites echoed like mournful chimes in the cavernous hall. A thin layer of condensation clung to every surface, blurring the edges of the flickering torches that cast grotesque shadows on the damp stone walls.  Elias Blackwood, his leather jerkin creaking with each weary sigh, patrolled the perimeter, his gaze flitting across the moss-covered sarcophagi and intricately carved obsidian pillars. The air hung heavy with the scent of incense and decay, a potent cocktail that made his stomach churn.

This was no ordinary tomb. Beneath the earth, nestled in the heart of the Greystone Mountains, lay the final resting place of the ancient necromancers who once ruled this land. Now, only whispers and legends remained of their dark power, yet Elias knew better than to dismiss them as mere fantasies. 


He clutched the hilt of his sword tighter, its cold steel a reassuring presence against the creeping dread that clung to him like cobwebs. The silence, broken only by the drip-drip-drip of water, was unnerving. He strained to hear any other sound – a creak, a rustle, a whisper – anything to break the oppressive stillness.  

Tonight, Elias felt it more keenly than ever before: something wasn't right.
