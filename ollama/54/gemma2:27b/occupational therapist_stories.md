Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Rehabilitation Center, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into an impressionistic smear of golds and reds. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver braid bouncing rhythmically as she walked, adjusted the height of a parallel bar system for her patient, Mr. Henderson. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and hand sanitizer, a scent Eleanor had come to associate with both comfort and challenge. Today felt particularly challenging.

Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter who'd suffered a stroke, was struggling. His frustration mounted with each failed attempt to lift his weakened leg, his weathered face contorting in a grimace. Eleanor crouched beside him, her warm brown eyes meeting his. "It's alright, Mr. Henderson," she said gently, her voice soothing like honeyed tea. "We'll get there together. Remember, small steps lead to big journeys."
