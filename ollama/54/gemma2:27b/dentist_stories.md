Rain lashed against the warped glass panes of Dr. Alistair Finch's office window, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of water. The ancient oak outside groaned under the assault, its skeletal branches clawing at the sky like desperate fingers.  Alistair sighed, his breath fogging the already murky air. He leaned back in his worn leather chair, the springs protesting with a weary squeak. 

The waiting room beyond his office door was empty, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock perched precariously on a stack of yellowed dental journals. Even the usual bustle of Friday afternoon had been swallowed by the storm. Alistair wasn't sure if he minded the solitude. It gave him time to contemplate the strange turn his life had taken, from the sterile predictability of a city practice to this ramshackle building perched precariously on the edge of a forgotten seaside town.
