The humid air hung heavy in the converted warehouse studio, thick with the scent of sweat and citrus cleaner. Neon light pulsed from behind the mirrored wall, reflecting off the rows of gleaming stationary bikes and casting long shadows across the polished concrete floor. Amelia "Amy" Chen adjusted her wireless microphone headset, the plastic cool against her damp skin.

A chorus of grunts and heavy breathing echoed around her as the participants in her 6:00 AM Spin class pushed through the final interval. Amy's own heart pounded in rhythm with the pulsing bass line of the techno track blasting through the speakers. She could see reflections of her own determined face, slick with perspiration, staring back at her from the mirrored wall. This was her domain, her sanctuary. Here, amidst the sweat and exertion, she felt truly alive.

But today, something felt different. A knot of tension tightened in her chest, a premonition she couldn't shake. As she guided the class through their cool down stretch, Amy caught a glimpse of a man standing at the back of the room, his face obscured by the shadows. He wasn't part of the class, and his intense gaze sent shivers down her spine.
