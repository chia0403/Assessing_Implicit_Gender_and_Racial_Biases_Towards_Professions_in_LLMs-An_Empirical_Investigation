Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's small clinic, a relentless torrent mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards, highlighting the scattered medical texts and empty vials that littered her workbench. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping through the ancient oaks that fringed the village of Oakhaven, their skeletal branches clawing at the stormy sky.

Eleanor gripped her teacup tighter, the warmth barely penetrating the chill that had settled deep in her bones. The news from London had arrived just hours ago â€“ a letter penned in her brother's elegant hand, filled with words that chilled her to the core. He was missing. Vanished without a trace from his prestigious practice in the heart of the bustling city. 


Eleanor knew she couldn't stay in Oakhaven. Her brother needed her, and the remote village nestled amidst the rolling hills of Yorkshire held no answers for a mystery shrouded in London's fog.  

With a heavy sigh, Eleanor set down her cup. The time for hesitation was over. She had to face whatever awaited her in the labyrinthine streets of the capital. Her brother's life might depend on it.
