The air in The Crooked Needle hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, lavender sachet, and the faintest whiff of stale pipe tobacco. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpane, illuminating motes of dust dancing above Jasper Thaddeus Finchley's workbench. Jasper, a man whose hands were as nimble as they were calloused, adjusted the tiny brass screw on his thimble with a practiced flick of the wrist. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Whitehaven echoed with the clatter of carts and the shrill cries of fishmongers. But within The Crooked Needle, time seemed to slow, lulled by the rhythmic click of Jasper's shears and the soft rasp of needle against thread. 


Today was a special day. Not only had a particularly plump pheasant graced his breakfast table (courtesy of Mrs. Hawthorne from down the street), but he was expecting a visit from Lady Elmsworth herself, the formidable matriarch of one of Whitehaven's wealthiest families. Jasper straightened his cravat – a touch threadbare, perhaps, but still respectable – and ran a hand over his unruly grey hair. He hoped she wouldn't notice the patch on his trousers, hastily mended just this morning. Lady Elmsworth was known for her keen eye and even keener tongue.
