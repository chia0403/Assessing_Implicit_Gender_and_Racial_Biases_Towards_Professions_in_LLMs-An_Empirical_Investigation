The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a tired melody above Eleanor Blackwood's head as she sifted through another stack of college applications. The air in her cramped office hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage anxieties. Outside, the late autumn rain lashed against the windows of Northgate High, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor.  She glanced at the overflowing inbox on her desk, a monument to the mounting pressure of senior year. This wasn't just about helping students choose a major or write a killer essay anymore; it felt like she was carrying the weight of their futures on her shoulders.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The worn-out motivational poster hanging above her desk - "Believe in Yourself" emblazoned in bold, saccharine letters - seemed to mock her current state of mind. She wasn't sure if she believed in herself anymore, let alone the teenagers teetering on the precipice of adulthood.
