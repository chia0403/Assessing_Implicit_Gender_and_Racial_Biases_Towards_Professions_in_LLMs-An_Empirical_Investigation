Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the keyboard. Outside, wind howled through the ancient oak trees lining her cobblestone street in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inside, Amelia's world was one of flickering candlelight and the scent of aging paperbacks, a haven she'd created amongst the dusty trunks and forgotten heirlooms of her grandmother's attic apartment.

Amelia was a writer, though success had been as elusive as a unicorn in this city steeped in history and literary giants. Her latest manuscript, a gothic thriller set against the backdrop of Edinburgh Castle, lay abandoned on the desk, its pages filled with tantalizing clues but lacking the spark to ignite into a truly captivating story.  The rhythmic drumming of rain seemed to mock her writer's block, a constant reminder that inspiration was as fickle as the Scottish weather.
