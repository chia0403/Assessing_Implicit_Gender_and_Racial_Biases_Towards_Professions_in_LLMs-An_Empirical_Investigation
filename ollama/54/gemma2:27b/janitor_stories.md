The fluorescent lights flickered, casting an anemic glow across the polished marble floor of the Grand Meridian Hotel ballroom. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins sighed, pushing his mop down the center aisle, leaving glistening trails in its wake. The air hung heavy with the ghosts of laughter and spilled champagne â€“ remnants of last night's gala, a dizzying affair of sequins, smiles, and whispered secrets Bart only ever glimpsed from the shadows. He knew every nook and cranny of this opulent space; every intricate carving on the mahogany pillars, every gilded cherub perched atop each crystal chandelier. 

Yet, tonight, the silence felt deafening. The emptiness was a stark contrast to the vibrant energy that usually pulsed through these walls. It was as if the ballroom itself were holding its breath, waiting for the curtain to rise once more. Bart, with his mop and bucket, felt like the lone caretaker of this slumbering giant, guarding its secrets until the next grand performance.
