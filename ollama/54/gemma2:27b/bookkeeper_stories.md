Rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Amelia Thistlewick's office window, blurring the already dim light of the gas lamps lining Mulberry Street. The smell of damp wool and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of Amelia's chamomile tea, growing cold and forgotten on her cluttered desk. Outside, the cobblestones gleamed slickly, reflecting the intermittent flashes of lightning like a thousand malevolent eyes. 

Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, squinted at the ledger before her.  Numbers swam in a dizzying dance, mocking her attempts to balance the accounts for Mr. Grimshaw's import-export business. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain mingled with the insistent tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, creating a symphony of unease that echoed Amelia's own growing apprehension. Something wasn't right. A discrepancy, too large to be ignored, stared back at her from the page. 

A chill snaked down her spine despite the warmth radiating from the coal stove in the corner. This was more than just a bookkeeping error. This felt... sinister.
