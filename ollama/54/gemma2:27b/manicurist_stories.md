The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the chipped linoleum floor of "Nails by Nina".  Nina Petrova, her thick fingers stained a rainbow of polish hues, hunched over Mrs. Kowalski's gnarled hands, meticulously shaping a stubborn cuticle.  The air hung heavy with the scent of acetone and lavender, punctuated by the incessant drone of the television mounted on the wall, perpetually tuned to some saccharine daytime talk show.

Outside, the relentless New Jersey sun beat down on the strip mall, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage. It was another sweltering August afternoon, the kind that made even breathing feel like an effort.  But Nina didn't mind. In her little corner of the world, where she wielded files and brushes with surgical precision, time seemed to slow down, offering a momentary respite from the chaotic symphony of life outside.
