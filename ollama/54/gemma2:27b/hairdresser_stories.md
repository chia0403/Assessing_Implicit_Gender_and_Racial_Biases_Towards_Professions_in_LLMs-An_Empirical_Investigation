The humid Savannah air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. Cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony from the live oaks lining River Street, their rhythm punctuated by the distant clang of the trolley bell. Inside "Curl Up & Dye", Amelia Josephine Bellweather wrestled with a particularly stubborn curl, her brow furrowed in concentration.  

Amelia wasn't your average hairdresser. Sure, she could wield a pair of scissors like a virtuoso and whip up a perfect balayage with her eyes closed. But Amelia possessed something more: an uncanny ability to sense the unspoken desires and hidden anxieties of her clients. This gift, often manifested as a tingling in her fingertips or a sudden flash of insight, made her salon more than just a place for haircuts; it was a sanctuary where women could shed their masks and embrace their true selves. 

Today, however, Amelia's intuition was on overdrive. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, whispering of secrets yet to be revealed. And as she finally tamed the rebellious curl, her gaze fell upon her next appointment: Eleanor Hawthorne, a woman shrouded in mystery, whose booking had arrived just that morning, handwritten on a faded lavender card.
