The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's broad shoulders as he chiseled away at the rough granite block. Dust swirled in the air, catching the light like miniature diamonds. His workshop, nestled against the cliff face overlooking the sapphire expanse of the Aegean Sea, was alive with the rhythmic clang of hammer on stone.  

Silas, a man built like an ancient olive tree – gnarled and strong – paused to wipe the sweat from his brow. He squinted at his work: a stylized griffin, its wings spread wide, about to take flight. It was commissioned by a wealthy merchant, who desired a symbol of power and protection for his villa. Silas had accepted the commission not only for the generous payment but also because he felt a kinship with the mythical creature – a majestic being trapped between earth and sky.  

Just as Silas was contemplating the next stroke, a shadow fell across the stone. He looked up to see a young woman standing hesitantly at the entrance to his workshop. Her eyes were the color of the sea, wide and filled with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. A worn leather satchel hung across her shoulder, its contents unknown.
