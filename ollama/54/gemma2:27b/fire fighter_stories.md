Smoke snaked through the pre-dawn sky, a grotesque parody of the delicate wisps that usually heralded sunrise over Havenwood. Elias Thorne, captain of Station 7, grimaced as he pulled on his turnout gear, the familiar weight settling onto his shoulders like an old friend burdened by countless battles. The shrill wail of the alarm echoed through the station, jolting the other firemen awake.

Havenwood, nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering pines, rarely saw anything more dramatic than a stray chimney fire or a squirrel trapped in a drainpipe. This blaze, however, was different. It emanated from the abandoned textile mill on the edge of town, its skeletal frame already illuminated by an angry orange glow. The air hung thick with the acrid smell of burning wood and something else, something chemical that pricked at Elias's nostrils and sent a shiver down his spine.

This wasn't just another fire. This smelled like danger.
