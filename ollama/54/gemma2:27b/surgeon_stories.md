The rain hammered against the OR windows, mimicking the relentless thudding in Dr. Emilia Rhys’ chest. It was a rhythm all too familiar - the anxious anticipation before a surgery, an intricate dance with life and death played out on the sterile stage of the operating room. 

Tonight's performance was particularly demanding. A young boy, barely ten years old, lay unconscious beneath the harsh glare of the surgical lights. His name was Ethan, and his heart, ravaged by a rare congenital defect, beat weakly against Emilia’s gloved fingertips. Every second counted.

The air hung heavy with antiseptic and quiet tension. Nurses moved around her with practiced grace, prepping instruments and adjusting monitors. The rhythmic beep of the EKG machine punctuated the silence, a stark counterpoint to the frantic symphony playing out in Emilia's mind.  She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the long hours ahead. Ethan’s future, his very life, rested on her skilled hands.
