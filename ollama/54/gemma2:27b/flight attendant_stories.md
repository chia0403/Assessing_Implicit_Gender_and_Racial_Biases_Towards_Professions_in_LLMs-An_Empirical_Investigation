The recycled air buzzed with anticipation, a low hum punctuated by the occasional cough and rustling plastic bag. Esme Rosalind Vance adjusted her scarf, tucking away a stray blonde curl that threatened to escape her meticulously styled bun. The familiar scent of jet fuel mingled with cheap perfume and anxious sweat, a cocktail unique to the belly of a Boeing 747 poised for takeoff.

Through the oval window, the runway stretched before them like a grey ribbon, leading into the hazy sunrise painting the Parisian sky in streaks of pink and orange. Esme loved this moment, the pregnant pause between stillness and flight, when the world seemed suspended, holding its breath before plunging into the unknown. Today, she was headed to Tokyo, carrying not just passengers but hopes, dreams, and perhaps a few lost wallets tucked away in overhead compartments.
