The bell for fourth period clanged through the hallways of Willow Creek High, its shrill note bouncing off the worn linoleum floors and echoing in the cavernous atrium. Ms. Amelia Brighton, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun that threatened to unravel with every exasperated sigh, surveyed the battlefield that was her English classroom. Papers littered desks like fallen leaves, remnants of a grammar quiz that had apparently been as thrilling as watching paint dry.  

Amelia rubbed her temples, willing away the headache blossoming behind her eyes. It wasn't the teenagers themselves who were exhausting – though their apathy and obsession with social media certainly didn't help – it was the crushing weight of expectations. Willow Creek High was a struggling institution, starved for funding and teetering on the brink of closure. The teachers, Amelia included, felt the pressure to perform miracles on shoestring budgets and dwindling resources. 


But today, something felt different. A current of unease pulsed through the air, making the usual teenage chatter seem strained and brittle. As Amelia turned towards the whiteboard, her gaze fell on a single crumpled note tucked beneath its edge. Picking it up gingerly, she saw a single word scrawled in shaky handwriting: "Run."  A shiver ran down her spine.

This wasn't like the typical adolescent angst notes she sometimes found – this felt urgent, desperate. And Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was brewing beneath the surface of Willow Creek High's seemingly mundane existence.
