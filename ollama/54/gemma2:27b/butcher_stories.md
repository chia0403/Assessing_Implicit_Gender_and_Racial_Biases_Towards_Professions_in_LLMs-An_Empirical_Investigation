The stench of iron and rosemary hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Thaddeus Bartholomew Quince, butcher extraordinaire of Oakhaven.  His shop, "Quince's Cuts," sat nestled between Mrs. Higgins' flower stall and the perpetually echoing blacksmith, its window overflowing with crimson cuts of beef, pale pork loins, and plump sausages glistening under the afternoon sun. Outside, the cobblestone streets buzzed with the usual afternoon activity: housewives haggling over prices, children chasing pigeons, and men in roughspun tunics discussing the day's fishing haul. Thaddeus, however, was oblivious to it all. He stood, shoulders hunched, behind his worn wooden counter, meticulously sharpening a cleaver with rhythmic strokes.  His brow furrowed in concentration, a faint tremor running through his calloused hand. Today was no ordinary day. The butcher of Oakhaven was about to receive a most unusual request.
