Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Cavendish’s office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. The worn, floral rug beneath her chair felt damp from the humidity seeping in through the old building’s cracks. Sunlight struggled to pierce the thick cloud cover, casting long shadows across the cluttered desk where files overflowed and a half-eaten granola bar sat abandoned beside a chipped mug. Eleanor sighed, pushing away the stray thoughts that threatened to consume her.

Today was supposed to be a fresh start at Maplewood High School, but the ominous weather seemed determined to mirror her anxieties. After five years in a private practice, she'd accepted this position hoping to make a real difference in the lives of adolescents. Yet, staring at the referral form for Michael Carter – a troubled fifteen-year-old exhibiting "significant behavioral issues" – Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that she was stepping into a maelstrom.
