The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Eloise Evelyn Thorne’s desk. It was 8:57 am, three minutes before the office officially opened, and the only sound besides the buzzing lights was the gentle click-clack of Eloise’s manicured nails tapping against her keyboard. She was re-reading the email for the tenth time, a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach with each pass. 

Outside, the sky over Manhattan was a bruised purple, hinting at the thunderstorms promised by the morning news. The rain would be relentless, Eloise knew, mirroring the storm brewing within her. Today was the day she had to tell Mr. Davenport, her notoriously demanding boss, that she was quitting.  Eloise’s cubicle, tucked away in a corner of the opulent lobby of Davenport & Sons, a high-powered investment firm, felt claustrophobic. The marble floor gleamed underfoot, polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting Eloise's anxious face back at her.

The grand mahogany desk in front of her was meticulously organized, a testament to Eloise’s obsessive need for order. But today, even the perfect alignment of her pens and staplers couldn't calm the swirling unease within her.
