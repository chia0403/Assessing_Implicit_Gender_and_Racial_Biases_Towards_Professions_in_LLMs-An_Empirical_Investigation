The morning mist clung to Elias Hawthorne's weathered face as he surveyed his domain. Dawn was just beginning to blush over the horizon, painting the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor in hues of rose gold. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, took a deep breath, the scent of damp earth and burgeoning roses filling his lungs. He knew every inch of this grand estate, from the labyrinthine hedge maze to the forgotten sundial nestled amongst the ancient oaks. Today, however, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, broken only by the distant caw of a crow.  Even the wind seemed to hold its breath, as if anticipating something momentous. 

Elias adjusted his worn tweed cap and grabbed his trusty pruning shears, steeling himself for whatever the day might bring. He had a feeling it wouldn't be ordinary.
