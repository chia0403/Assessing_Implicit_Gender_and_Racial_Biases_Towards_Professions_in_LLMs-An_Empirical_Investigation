Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Price's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of invoices towered precariously on her desk, each one a testament to the crumbling finances of "Price & Sons Emporium," the family business she'd inherited from her late father.

Evelyn wasn't built for this. With her neatly-braided auburn hair and penchant for meticulously alphabetized spreadsheets, she was more at home with numbers than people. But when her father passed away suddenly, leaving behind a mountain of debt and a dwindling inventory of antique furniture, Evelyn knew she had to step up.

The air in the office smelled faintly of mildew and mothballs – the scent of fading glory. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh's Old Town were slick with rain, reflecting the streetlights in a shimmering, melancholic dance.  Evelyn stared out at the storm, her reflection staring back, a ghost of the woman she used to be: carefree, optimistic, and blissfully unaware of the burden she now carried.

Tonight was the night she had to face reality – meet with the bank manager, Mr. Sinclair, a man known for his steely gaze and even sterner demeanor. She needed an extension on their loan, but she knew her chances were slim. 

Evelyn sighed, her fingers hovering over a crumpled invoice.  A shiver ran down her spine, not from the chill in the air, but from the fear that gnawed at her. Could she save Price & Sons Emporium? Or would it become another casualty of Edinburgh's ever-changing landscape?
