The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer, clinging to Silas Blackwood's worn leather apron like a second skin. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "The Last Call" in chipped crimson letters, cast an anemic glow on the dusty bottles lining the back bar.  Silas ran a calloused hand over the worn mahogany countertop, its surface etched with years of spilled drinks and drunken confessions.

He surveyed the handful of regulars huddled around their usual spots: Old Man Henderson nursing his whiskey sour in the corner booth; Maggie, the fiery redhead, arguing politics with anyone who dared listen; and Big Ed, his massive frame filling two stools as he devoured a plate of greasy fries. It was another Thursday night at The Last Call, a familiar symphony of clinking glasses, mumbled conversations, and the mournful croon of Hank Williams echoing from the jukebox.  

Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, a sense of anticipation that prickled Silas's skin. It started with the arrival of a stranger, a woman draped in shadows who slid onto a stool at the far end of the bar, her gaze fixed on Silas with an intensity that sent a shiver down his spine.
