The smell of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faintest scent of pipe tobacco from old Mr. Henderson's afternoon smoke. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes of "Silas Finnigan's Barber Shop," casting long shadows across the worn leather chairs and gleaming chrome fixtures. Silas himself, a man whose silver hair mirrored the sheen of his clippers, hummed a jaunty tune as he expertly swept away stray hairs from the collar of young Timothy, his latest customer. 

Timothy fidgeted in the chair, nervously eyeing his reflection in the mirror. Today was the day he'd finally be allowed to join the older boys in playing baseball, and he desperately wanted his hair to look just right. Silas, sensing the boy's apprehension, gave him a reassuring wink and said, "Don't you worry, Timothy. By the time I'm through with you, you'll be looking like a home run hitter."
