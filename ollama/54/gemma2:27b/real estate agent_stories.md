The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and salt. Eliza Winthrop adjusted her straw boater hat, pushing a stray curl back into its carefully coiffed bun. She surveyed the rambling Victorian mansion before her, its peeling paint and overgrown wisteria lending an air of forgotten grandeur. The "For Sale" sign, crookedly planted in the overgrown lawn, seemed to sigh under the weight of neglect.

Eliza wasn't fazed. In fact, she thrived on challenges. This crumbling beauty, with its creaking floorboards and faded glory, held a story waiting to be unearthed, a potential for restoration that Eliza could sense beneath the layers of dust and decay.
