The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of lemon furniture wax. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her grey bun precariously balanced atop her head, surveyed the drawing room with a critical eye. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path and highlighting streaks on the otherwise gleaming mahogany table.

The grand manor house, Blackwood Hall, stood perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning North Sea. Amelia had been tending to its opulent rooms for twenty years, her life a quiet rhythm of scrubbing, polishing, and ensuring every surface gleamed. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every secret nook tucked away in the dusty corners. Yet, today felt different. An unsettling tension hummed beneath the usual stillness, as if Blackwood Hall itself were holding its breath.
