The humid air clung to Elara Blackwood like a second skin as she navigated the narrow cobblestone streets of Prague. Above her, ancient buildings leaned in conspiratorially, their terracotta rooftops glowing in the afternoon sun. Tourists jostled around her, snapping photos of gargoyles perched on ornate bridges and craning their necks to glimpse the astronomical clock's intricate face. Elara knew this city like the back of her hand; its secrets whispered in her ear, its stories woven into the very fabric of its existence.

Today, she led a group of wide-eyed Americans through the winding labyrinthine streets of Old Town Square, her voice carrying the melodic lilt of her native Irish accent above the chatter and the clanging of trams. Elara wasn't just any tour guide; she possessed an uncanny ability to connect with her guests, weaving history and folklore into captivating narratives that brought Prague to life in a way no guidebook ever could.
