Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Patel's office, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into a watercolor wash of orange and red. Inside, Evelyn Rose Cartwright meticulously sharpened her scaler, the rhythmic scraping a counterpoint to the insistent drumming of the storm.  

The waiting room was empty, save for a single, dog-eared magazine splayed open on a side table.  Evelyn sighed, glancing at the clock. Another slow afternoon in rural Maple Creek. She loved the quaint charm of her town, nestled amidst rolling hills and apple orchards, but sometimes she longed for the bustling energy of the city where she'd trained. 

Just as she began to contemplate brewing another pot of chamomile tea, the door swung open with a gust of wind, revealing a man dripping wet and holding a hand over his grimacing face. "Evelyn?" he croaked, voice hoarse. "Is Dr. Patel in? I think..." His words dissolved into a pained groan. 

This wasn't just another routine cleaning. Something was wrong. Very wrong.
