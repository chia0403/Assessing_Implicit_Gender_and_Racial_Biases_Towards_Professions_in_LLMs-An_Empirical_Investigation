The scent of disinfectant and anxiety hung heavy in the air, a familiar combination for Dr. Eleanor Vance. Rain lashed against the windows of her small animal clinic, blurring the already-dim November light filtering through the frosted glass. A ginger tabby named Clementine yowled from behind the examination room door, adding a shrill counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the storm. Eleanor sighed, rubbing tired eyes. It had been a long day, filled with the usual parade of sniffles, sprains, and the occasional unexpected emergency.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease settled over her as she glanced at the clock â€“ 8:47 pm. She should have been heading home hours ago, but a new client had just walked in, clutching a limp carrier shrouded in an oversized raincoat. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that this case was going to be anything but ordinary.
