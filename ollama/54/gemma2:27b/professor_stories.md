Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Professor Elias Thorneâ€™s cluttered office, blurring the view of the ancient oak that stood sentinel outside his window. The old tree, its gnarled branches clawing at the storm clouds, had been a fixture on the grounds of Blackwood University for centuries, long before the imposing stone buildings rose around it. Elias, perched precariously on a stool, was lost in the depths of a leather-bound tome, its yellowed pages filled with arcane symbols and cryptic incantations. A stray gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, momentarily drawing him from his scholarly pursuit. 

He glanced at the grandfather clock ticking away in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome counting down to something unknown. It was nearing midnight, the hour when shadows stretched long and secrets whispered on the wind. Elias ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, a shiver running down his spine despite the crackling fire in the hearth. Tonight felt different. The air hummed with an energy he couldn't quite decipher, a foreboding that gnawed at the edges of his consciousness.
