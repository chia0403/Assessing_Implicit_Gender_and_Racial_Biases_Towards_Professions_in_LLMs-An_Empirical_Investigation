The harsh fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow on the blueprints spread across her desk. Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped its bun and was tickling her nose. The air in the cramped drafting room was thick with the scent of graphite and stale coffee, a familiar perfume she'd come to associate with long nights and endless revisions. Outside the window, rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already dreary cityscape into an abstract watercolor.

Amelia traced the lines of the latest architectural design with her calloused fingertip, her brow furrowing in concentration. The building was ambitious - a sprawling skyscraper designed to pierce the heart of downtown. But something wasn't right. A nagging feeling tugged at her intuition, whispering of flaws hidden beneath the sleek facade.
