The scent of turpentine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of salt from the open window overlooking the tempestuous North Sea. Amelia Rosehaven dipped her brush into the cerulean blue, swirling it onto the canvas where foamy waves crashed against jagged cliffs. The wind howled outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.

Amelia's studio, perched on a cliffside in the isolated Scottish village of Dunvegan, was her sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across her easel. But today, even the beauty of the wild coastline couldn't soothe the ache in her chest. A letter lay crumpled on the table beside her palette â€“ a rejection from the prestigious Edinburgh Gallery.
