The crisp autumn air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Mist clung to the frosted grass of Willow Creek Animal Sanctuary, shrouding the sprawling grounds in an ethereal veil. Elara Juniper Thorne, her cheeks flushed from the morning chill, scanned the paddock where she’d last seen Bartholomew, a grumpy old goat with a penchant for escaping his enclosure.

Elara adjusted the brim of her worn wool cap, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It wasn't uncommon for Bartholomew to go AWOL, but this time, a knot of worry tightened in her stomach. His limp had been worsening lately, and he was more vulnerable than usual. 


She sighed, glancing at the sprawling Victorian manor that served as both sanctuary headquarters and her home. The sanctuary’s founder, Mrs. Willowbrook, had entrusted Elara with its care after her passing, a responsibility she took seriously. With a determined glint in her hazel eyes, Elara headed towards Bartholomew's paddock, armed with a bucket of his favorite treats – dandelion-infused pellets.
