The morning mist clung to Elias Thorne’s weathered boots like a second skin as he surveyed his fields. Dawn painted the rolling hills in hues of lavender and apricot, but the beauty held little solace for the furrow in Elias' brow. Years of drought had parched the earth, leaving behind cracked soil that mirrored the lines etched on his face.  

His farm, Thorne Valley, was a legacy passed down through generations, each one battling the unpredictable whims of nature. This year, however, felt different. The relentless sun seemed to mock Elias' every effort, and even the hardy crops struggled for survival. 


The air hung thick with the scent of dry earth and desperation, a stark contrast to the sweet aroma of wildflowers that used to carpet his meadows.  Elias knew he couldn't afford another season like this. Thorne Valley was teetering on the edge, and soon, the farm wouldn’t be able to sustain him or his family.
