The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch’s head, casting a sterile glare over the tiny clinic waiting room. The air hung thick with the antiseptic scent of bleach and fear – two aromas inextricably linked in Amelia’s experience. She sighed, smoothing down her crimson scrubs, a splash of colour against the clinical grey.  Her name tag, emblazoned with "Amelia Finch, Phlebotomist," seemed to mock her as another patient nervously clutched their water bottle, eyes darting around the room like trapped birds. Amelia knew that look; it was the universal language of dread spoken by anyone facing a needle. 


She glanced at the clock. 8:57 AM. Just three minutes until Mr. Henderson's appointment. A man with chronic anemia who always claimed his veins were "as slippery as an eel."  Amelia smiled wryly. She hadn’t yet encountered a vein that couldn’t be coaxed, though she suspected Mr. Henderson might push her skills to the limit. The morning was young, and Amelia knew better than to underestimate the challenges it held.  This wasn't just about blood draws; it was about easing anxieties, offering a reassuring smile, and making the seemingly mundane feel human again. 


She straightened her posture, took a deep breath, and prepared for another day in the trenches of blood work.
