The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beaumont’s head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. It was the same dull symphony she’d endured for five years at Prestige Properties, a real estate firm where ambition oozed from the polished floors and mirrored walls like an unwanted fragrance.  

Eloise herself lacked any such aspirations. Her job consisted mainly of answering calls about overpriced apartments, fielding complaints about creaky floorboards and leaky faucets, and occasionally dealing with landlords who had less than stellar bedside manners.  It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills, which was all that mattered to Eloise. 

Today, however, something felt different. A palpable tension thrummed through the air, a nervous energy that crackled between the impeccably dressed agents as they scurried around, phones glued to their ears.  The usual calm before the storm of client calls had been replaced by a frantic hum, and Eloise found herself inexplicably caught in its current.

As she idly twirled a pen between her fingers, waiting for the inevitable onslaught, a sudden commotion at the front door shattered the tension.
