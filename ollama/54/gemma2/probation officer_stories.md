The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation in the cramped office.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already grimy cityscape outside. Amelia "Amy" Harper, her brow furrowed beneath a cascade of auburn curls, scanned the file before her. It was Michael Thorne, 24, convicted of theft and possession of stolen goods. Amy had been assigned his case just that morning, and the thin paper held little about him beyond his offenses.

He was due for his first meeting in an hour, and she felt a familiar knot of apprehension twist in her stomach. Every probationer presented a puzzle, a glimpse into lives she couldn't begin to understand. Amy had seen it all - desperation, regret, anger, even defiance – but she always hoped for the glimmer of something else: potential, redemption, a desire to change.  

The office door creaked open, letting in a blast of wind and rain, followed by Michael Thorne himself. He was tall and lean, his dark eyes shadowed beneath a mop of unruly black hair. A thin scarf wrapped around his neck did little to ward off the chill that seemed to emanate from him. Amy looked up, ready to meet his gaze with the calm professionalism she prided herself on.

But in that instant, something in his expression – a flicker of fear, perhaps, or weariness beyond his years – pierced through her practiced composure. 


"Mr. Thorne," she said, her voice softer than intended. "Come in."
