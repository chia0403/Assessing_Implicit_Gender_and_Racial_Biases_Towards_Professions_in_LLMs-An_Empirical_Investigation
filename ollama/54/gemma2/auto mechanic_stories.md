The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and ozone, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal on metal.  Grease stained Amelia "Amy" Grace's hands – evidence of another day spent wrestling with Detroit’s iron horses under the unforgiving Nevada sun. Outside her ramshackle garage in Rhyolite, Nevada, the desert shimmered like a mirage, promising little respite from the unrelenting heat. Amy wiped sweat from her brow, leaving a streak across her already smudged forehead. She squinted at the sputtering engine of a vintage Chevy Bel Air, its chrome once gleaming but now dulled by dust and neglect. The car’s owner, a rancher named Jebediah, paced nervously beside it, his weathered face creased with worry.  


"It's my only ride, Amy," he said, his voice gravelly like desert sand. "If this engine don't run, I can't get the sheep to market on time." 

Amy nodded, her eyes focused on the tangle of wires and hoses under the hood. “Don’t you worry, Jeb.  We’ll get you back on the road.”


Rhyolite was a ghost town reborn – resurrected not by gold miners but by tourists seeking a glimpse of the past. Amy's garage, "Grace's Garage & General Repair," sat on the dusty main street, a solitary beacon of life amidst the tumbleweeds and faded facades. It wasn’t much, but it was her sanctuary – a place where she could coax beauty and life from forgotten machines, where the only measure of success was a purring engine and a satisfied customer.
