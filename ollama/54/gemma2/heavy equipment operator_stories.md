The sun beat down on Jeremiah "Jerry" Hawthorne's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat slicked his brow and ran down into his faded, green work shirt, leaving a salty trail.  Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, kicking up miniature tornadoes of dirt that swirled around the massive construction site. Jerry wrestled with the controls of his excavator, guiding the steel jaws with practiced ease as he ripped through a layer of sunbaked earth.

The Nevada desert stretched out behind him, an endless expanse of cracked earth and prickly scrub. The skeletal remains of rusted cars littered the horizon like forgotten tombstones. This was Purgatory Flats, a stretch of land deemed too desolate even for tumbleweeds. Yet, here stood Jerry and his crew, battling the unforgiving elements to build a new solar farm – a monument to progress in a place where nothing ever seemed to grow.  


Jerry squinted through the dust haze at the foreman's frantic waving. Something was wrong, something serious. 
He eased the excavator into a neutral position, letting out a groan as his aging joints protested. The desert air crackled with tension, and even the usual drone of cicadas seemed to have ceased. Jerry knew in that moment that this wasn’t just another dusty day on Purgatory Flats.
