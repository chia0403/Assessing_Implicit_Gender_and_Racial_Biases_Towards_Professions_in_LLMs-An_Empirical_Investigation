The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood.  He took a deep breath, savoring it, even as a cough rattled in his chest.  Elias adjusted the worn canvas strap of his respirator, its filter struggling against the onslaught of sawdust swirling through the clearing. Above him, the towering Douglas firs, giants stripped bare by generations of lumbermen, reached towards the overcast sky, their tops disappearing into a veil of grey mist. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the forest floor, painting the scene in hues of orange and purple.  Elias was alone, his solitude punctuated only by the rhythmic thumping of his chainsaw and the occasional screech of a startled crow. He swung the saw, its powerful roar a testament to man's dominance over nature, yet Elias couldn't shake the feeling that it was a fragile victory, one whispered on the wind that carried the mournful cry of unseen owls.


This was the heartland of the Pacific Northwest, a land sculpted by ancient forests and shadowed by mountains that pierced the heavens. It was here, in this raw wilderness, where Elias Blackwood made his living, wrestling giants from the earth with calloused hands and an unwavering resolve.
