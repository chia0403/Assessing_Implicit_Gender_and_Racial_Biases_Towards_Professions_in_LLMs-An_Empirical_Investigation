The sun hammered down on Silas Montgomery's neck, turning his sweat-soaked shirt into a second skin. He wiped his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of grime across his forehead. The city stretched out below him like a shimmering heatwave, its skyscrapers melting into the hazy blue sky. 

Silas was perched precariously on the peak of Mrs. O'Malley's Victorian mansion, meticulously inspecting the recently repaired shingles. A gust of wind tugged at his faded baseball cap, threatening to send it tumbling down to the manicured lawn below. He grumbled under his breath and adjusted his grip on the ridge, squinting through the glare as he surveyed the work. It was a meticulous job, but Silas took pride in his craft. Every shingle laid, every seam sealed, was a testament to his dedication, his skill, and his love for being high above the world. 


He could hear the faint buzz of traffic far below, punctuated by the occasional clang of a distant construction site. The air vibrated with the city's energy, a constant hum that both energized and exhausted him. But up here, on this roof, amongst the shadows and the shingles, Silas felt a sense of peace.
