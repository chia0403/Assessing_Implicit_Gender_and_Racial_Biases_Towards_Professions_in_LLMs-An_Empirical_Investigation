The pungent aroma of iron and salt hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste. It clung to Bartholomew Silas Grimshaw’s worn leather apron like a second skin. The morning light, filtered through the grimy windows of Grimshaw's Butchery, cast long shadows across the tiled floor, illuminating a tableau of suspended carcasses and glistening cleavers. Bartholomew, his weathered face etched with years spent wielding blades and coaxing life from meat, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. 

The shop was nestled on a cobblestone street in the shadow of an ancient cathedral in the port city of Grimhaven. The rhythmic clang of a blacksmith’s hammer echoed down the lane, mingling with the cries of gulls circling above the docks.  Bartholomew felt a familiar pang of loneliness as he began his daily ritual – preparing the day's offerings for the hungry populace of Grimhaven. He knew each cut, each bone, each twitching muscle in the beasts that lay before him like fallen soldiers. 


But there was something different today, a tremor in the air, a prickling sensation on his skin. It was an unsettling feeling, one that Bartholomew couldn't quite place. A darkness seemed to be seeping into the light of his shop, whispering secrets he couldn't understand. He shook off the unease, attributing it to the chill wind whistling through the cracks in the ancient building. There was work to be done, and customers to satisfy. But as Bartholomew reached for his cleaver, a single thought wormed its way into his mind:  perhaps today wouldn't be just another ordinary day in Grimhaven.
