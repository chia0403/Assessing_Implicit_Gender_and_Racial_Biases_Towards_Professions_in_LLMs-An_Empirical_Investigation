The stale scent of coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Brenda Mae Butterfield’s cramped office. Papers overflowed from every surface – desks, chairs, even Brenda Mae's beloved vintage sewing machine tucked into a dusty corner. Outside, the pre-April 15th rush roared down Main Street, but inside, it was almost eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Brenda Mae’s fingers on her ancient, green-tinted computer screen broke the silence.

It was her busiest season – a time when everyone in Harmony Ridge, population 2,487, seemed to remember they owed Uncle Sam money.  Brenda Mae, the town's unofficial tax guru, thrived in this chaos. She knew every loophole, every form, every quirk of the system like the back of her hand. But this year, something felt different. A chill prickled at the back of her neck, a disquiet that went beyond the usual stress of crunch time. It wasn't just the mountain of paperwork or the incessant drone of the overhead fluorescent lights. Something was off.  


Harmony Ridge itself seemed to hum with a nervous energy. The whispers in the diner about Mr. Henderson’s sudden wealth and Mrs. Peabody’s suspiciously quiet divorce proceedings only added to Brenda Mae's unease. It felt like the town, usually so predictable and quaint, was on the brink of something...unpredictable.
