The aroma of lavender oil and sandalwood incense hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of liniment and muscle relaxant. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting rainbows across the worn wooden floor of Dr. Eleanor Rose Sterling's practice. Her waiting room, tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined street in Boston's historic Back Bay, was a haven from the city's hustle and bustle. A crackling fireplace cast a warm glow over the plush armchairs and antique bookshelves, while soft jazz played in the background.

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, meticulously cleaned the adjusting table with disinfectant wipes. She was a woman of contrasts: sharp-eyed and focused when working, yet radiating warmth and kindness when interacting with patients. This duality was key to her success; she listened intently to their aches and pains, not just as physical ailments but as manifestations of deeper stress and emotional burdens. 

As the clock ticked past nine, a tall woman with shoulders hunched under the weight of unseen worries entered the waiting room. Her face, etched with lines of tension, offered no clue as to her age, only hinting at a story untold.  Eleanor welcomed her with a warm smile, eager to unravel those unspoken burdens and set them free.
