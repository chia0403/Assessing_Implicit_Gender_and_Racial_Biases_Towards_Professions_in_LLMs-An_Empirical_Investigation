The dust devils danced across Jebediah "Jeb" Stone's weathered face as he squinted at the horizon. The sun beat down on the parched earth of his Wyoming ranch, a relentless heat that seemed to press down like an iron fist. The once lush grasslands were now brittle and brown, cracked by weeks without rain. Even the normally boisterous cattle seemed listless, their bells chiming faintly in the oppressive stillness. 

Jeb pushed back his Stetson, letting out a long sigh. This wasn't the life he envisioned when he’d first inherited Stone Ranch from his grandfather, a sprawling expanse of land that had promised generations of prosperity. Now, drought threatened to claim everything he held dear: his cattle, his livelihood, and perhaps even his own spirit. The relentless dryness gnawed at him, whispering doubts about his ability to keep the ranch afloat, echoing the fears he’d kept buried for months.
