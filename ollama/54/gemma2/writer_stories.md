The rain hammered against the attic window, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the dusty glass.  Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around her shoulders. The old house groaned around her, settling deeper into its bones with every gust of wind that rattled the warped shingles. 

Eliza sat hunched over her battered typewriter, the keys clicking out a rhythm that mirrored the relentless drumming of the storm. Her apartment below was occupied by her landlord, Mrs. Petrovsky, a woman who took "no visitors after nine" far too seriously.  So Eliza retreated to this attic sanctuary, its cluttered shelves and overflowing boxes a comfort amidst the howling chaos outside. 

She chewed on the end of her pen, staring at the blank page before her. The deadline for her short story submission loomed like a thundercloud, threatening to swallow her whole. Inspiration, however, remained elusive.  Eliza sighed, willing herself to find the spark, the thread that would weave her tale into being. 


Perhaps the storm itself held the key...
