Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Harper's office, mimicking the frantic beating of her heart. The rhythmic drumming was drowned out by the clatter of thunder that shook the quaint brick building nestled in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina. Outside, the bustling Blue Ridge Parkway was reduced to a ribbon of shimmering asphalt swallowed by the storm.

Inside, Amelia wrestled with the anxieties that gnawed at her insides. Today was "reintegration day" for Mr. Samuel Blackwood, a renowned jazz pianist who'd suffered a debilitating stroke six months ago.  His return to the music room, once his sanctuary and now a daunting reminder of what he'd lost, felt like stepping onto a battlefield. Amelia, with her years of training and unwavering belief in her patients, knew this was more than just physical therapy; it was about reclaiming a part of Mr. Blackwood's soul.  


The air hung heavy with the scent of old wood and forgotten melodies. The familiar weight of the worn piano keys under her fingertips felt oddly comforting as Amelia prepared the room for Samuel's return. Could she help him find his way back to the music, or would this storm be the final note in his symphony?
