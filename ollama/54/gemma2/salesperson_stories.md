The air in the showroom hung thick with the scent of leather and desperation. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the chrome bumpers of gleaming SUVs, mocking Amelia Beatrice Rodriguez's dwindling hopes for the month. Her quota loomed like a desert mirage, shimmering just out of reach. She idly traced the outline of a steering wheel, its plush velvet as soft as her anxieties. Today was the day she needed to make something happen.  A fat checkbook, maybe even a down payment on a yacht – anything but another day swallowed by spreadsheets and polite rejections.

Amelia glanced at the wall clock: 10:32 am. The dealership's usual morning rush had already passed, leaving behind an eerie silence punctuated only by the whirring of air conditioning units struggling against the relentless heat.  


Beyond the showroom window, a tumbleweed rolled across the dusty parking lot, a lone symbol of Amelia’s own predicament – drifting aimlessly with no destination in sight.
