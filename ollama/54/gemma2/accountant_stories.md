The air in Evelyn Beatrice Finch's office was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Papers overflowed from every available surface - her desk, filing cabinets, even the precarious stack precariously balanced on top of the ancient printer. Evelyn, perched on the edge of her chair like a hawk about to pounce on its prey, rubbed her weary eyes. 

She squinted at the ledger in front of her, its pages filled with a tangled mess of numbers that seemed to mock her tired brain. It was tax season, and the normally calm and ordered world of Evelyn Beatrice Finch, certified public accountant extraordinaire, had descended into chaos. Her clients, a motley crew of small business owners, freelancers, and even a disgruntled alpaca farmer, were all clamouring for her attention, their anxieties and financial woes spilling over like cheap wine at a poorly-planned party. 

Evelyn sighed, the sound swallowed by the clatter of the aging typewriter across the room. Her gaze drifted towards the window, where the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cluttered cityscape. It was a scene she knew well - the city that never sleeps, a constant reminder that even in this tiny, dusty office, there were bigger forces at play. Forces that demanded precision, order, and a healthy dose of caffeine. 


Evelyn Beatrice Finch took a deep breath, straightened her glasses, and picked up her pen. Time to face the numbers head-on.
