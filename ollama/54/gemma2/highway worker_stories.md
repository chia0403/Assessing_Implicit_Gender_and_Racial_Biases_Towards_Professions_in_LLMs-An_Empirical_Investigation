The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of Highway 127. Sweat clung to Daniel Alistair Finch's back like a second skin as he wrestled with the heavy orange cone, maneuvering it into place just past the stalled tow truck. A swarm of mosquitos buzzed around his head, their incessant whining adding to the symphony of screeching tires and impatient horns that filled the air.

Daniel squinted at the traffic snaking its way through the bottleneck, a frustrated river of metal and rubber slowly inching towards the small town of Dustbowl. He sighed, wiping his brow with the back of his gloved hand. Another beautiful day in paradise, he thought bitterly. 


Dustbowl was a speck on the map nestled in the heart of Montana, surrounded by nothing but endless plains and the occasional rusting oil rig. It wasn't exactly known for its glamorous opportunities, but it was home. Daniel had spent his entire life here, patching roads, fixing potholes, and dodging angry drivers - just another cog in the rusty machinery of this desolate town.
