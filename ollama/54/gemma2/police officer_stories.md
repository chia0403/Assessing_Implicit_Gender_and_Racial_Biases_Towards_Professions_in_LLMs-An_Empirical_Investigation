The neon lights of the Starlight Diner cast long, distorted shadows across Officer Amelia "Amy" Harper's face as she took her first bite of her lukewarm burger. The greasy patty tasted more of disappointment than beef, but Amy was too weary to care. Another night shift, another handful of petty squabbles and minor infractions in this sleepy desert town. 

The diner was mostly empty, save for a lone trucker nursing a cup of coffee at the counter and a couple arguing in hushed tones in a corner booth. The air hung thick with the scent of stale grease and regret, a familiar aroma to anyone who had spent enough time patrolling Dustbowl, Arizona. 

Outside, the wind whipped around the building, sending a shiver down Amy's spine despite the stifling heat emanating from the diner's interior. A tumbleweed rolled across the deserted street, its withered form a stark reminder of the relentless aridity that defined life in this forgotten corner of the world. 


The quiet, almost suffocating stillness was shattered by the screech of tires and a panicked shout from inside the diner.  Amy instinctively reached for her service weapon, heart pounding like a drum against her ribs. Something wasn't right. This wasn't just another night in Dustbowl.
