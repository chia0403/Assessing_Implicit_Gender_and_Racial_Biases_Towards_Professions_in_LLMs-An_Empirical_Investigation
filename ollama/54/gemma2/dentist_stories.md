The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, laced with the faint aroma of peppermint floss. Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass window of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, adjusted her silver-rimmed glasses and leaned over the patient chair, peering into the mouth of Mr. Henderson. 

The quaint dental practice nestled on Elm Street was as familiar to Eleanor as her own reflection. She'd inherited it from her father twenty years ago, and though she'd considered relocating to a bustling city clinic several times, something always kept her tethered to this small town, where everyone knew their neighbor's name and the gossip traveled faster than dental floss.  

But lately, a sense of unease had settled over Eleanor like a stubborn cavity. The patients were fewer, the conversations lighter, and the familiar rhythm of her days felt off-key. 


Mr. Henderson, bless his heart, was oblivious to her internal turmoil. He muttered about his granddaughter's upcoming piano recital and the new bakery down the street, oblivious to the creeping shadow of change that loomed over Elm Street.
