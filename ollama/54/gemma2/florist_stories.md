The bell above the door jingled a cheerful welcome as Elara Willowbrook rearranged a bouquet of lilies in her display window. Sunlight streamed through the dusty panes, illuminating the vibrant riot of colours that filled "Willow & Bloom," her small flower shop tucked away on a quiet corner street in Edinburgh. 

Elara inhaled deeply, the scent of freesia and lavender mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil from the greenhouse out back. It was a comforting symphony to her senses, one she'd known since childhood when she'd first started helping her grandmother tend their family garden. Now, as owner of her own shop, the scent was more than just pleasant; it was a reminder of her passion, her purpose.

But today, the familiar comfort felt tinged with unease. A thick fog had rolled in earlier, blanketing the city in an oppressive silence. It wasn't just the weather; Elara could feel a strange energy in the air, a tension that seemed to crackle around the edges of her usual serenity.  The phone hadn't rung all morning, and the shop door remained stubbornly closed â€“ a stark contrast to the usual bustle of customers seeking blooms for birthdays, anniversaries, or simply a touch of beauty in their lives. 


Elara hoped it was just a quiet Tuesday, but a nagging feeling whispered that something more was amiss.
