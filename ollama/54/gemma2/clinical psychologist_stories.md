The worn brass doorknob felt cool beneath Dr. Amelia Beatrice Sinclair's fingertips as she pushed open the office door. A wave of stale cigarette smoke and lavender air freshener washed over her, momentarily choking her senses before fading into the familiar scent of unfulfilled potential that permeated most of her patients’ lives. Her practice, nestled on a quiet side street in Seattle's historic Pike Place Market district, wasn't glamorous, but it was home. 

Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. A half-eaten bagel sat forlornly on the desk, evidence of her own rushed breakfast as she navigated a morning commute plagued by honking taxis and disgruntled pedestrians.  Amelia took a deep breath, trying to banish the lingering anxiety that seemed to follow her like a shadow. 

Today was going to be different. Today, she had a new patient: a man named Daniel Hayes who had requested an appointment specifically with her. The referral form mentioned “complex trauma” and "a desire for healing." Amelia felt a familiar tug in her heart, the pull that drew her to these broken souls, hoping to piece them back together, one fragile fragment at a time.
