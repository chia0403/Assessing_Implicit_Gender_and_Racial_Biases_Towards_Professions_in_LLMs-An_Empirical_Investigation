The air in the grand manor house hung heavy with the scent of beeswax polish and damp stone. Sunlight slanted through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air. Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick, her calico apron dusted with flour from the earlier batch of scones, surveyed the vast dining room with a critical eye.  A lone vase of wilted lilies sat on the mahogany table, their pale petals drooping like forgotten promises.

Eleanor sighed. Lord Hawthorne had been away for weeks, leaving her in charge of this sprawling, echoing house. It was lonely work, tending to the needs of an absent master, keeping the fire lit and the cobwebs at bay. She yearned for the chatter of guests, the clinking of glasses, the warmth of a shared meal. 


Instead, she had only the company of the portraits that lined the walls, their painted eyes following her every move. They seemed to whisper secrets in hushed tones, tales of grand balls and whispered scandals, of love lost and lives lived within these very rooms. Eleanor longed to hear their stories, but they remained silent, locked away behind centuries of varnish and dust.
