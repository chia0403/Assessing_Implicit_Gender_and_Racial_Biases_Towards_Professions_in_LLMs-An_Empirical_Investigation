The air in Clara Evelyn Thistlewick’s office hung heavy with the scent of old paper and stale coffee. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the towering piles of manuscripts that threatened to engulf her desk. She squinted at the screen, the blue light reflecting in her tired eyes.  Another day, another onslaught of aspiring novelists hoping their tales would be plucked from obscurity by the discerning eye of Clara Thistlewick, editor extraordinaire for The Inkwell literary magazine. 

Clara sighed, pushing away a particularly saccharine romance novel about a vampire barista and a werewolf baker. She needed something...different. Something that would stand out amongst the sea of predictable plots and clichés.  Something that would, dare she say it, surprise her.


The setting is a cluttered, somewhat depressing office in a small publishing house. Think old-fashioned furniture, overflowing bookshelves, stacks of manuscripts everywhere, and faded posters advertising literary events from decades past. The atmosphere is dusty and melancholic, mirroring Clara's own weariness with the predictable churn of submissions.
