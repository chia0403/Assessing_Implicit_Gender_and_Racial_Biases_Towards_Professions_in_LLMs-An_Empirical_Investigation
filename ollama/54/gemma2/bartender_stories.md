The humid air hung thick in The Rusty Mug, clinging to Emilia Pearl like a damp shroud. She wiped down the sticky countertop with a practiced hand, the red-stained rag barely making a dent in the grime.  Outside, the neon lights of Las Cruces flickered like dying fireflies, casting long shadows across the parched desert landscape. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, punctuated by the rhythmic clinking of ice and the occasional slurred lament. 

Emilia Pearl, a woman weathered by years spent pouring sorrows and chasing dreams, leaned against the bar, her gaze fixed on the dusty street beyond the grimy window.  Her reflection stared back, a tapestry of tired eyes and a smile that had seen too much sadness. Tonight, she felt it in her bones, was going to be one of those nights.
