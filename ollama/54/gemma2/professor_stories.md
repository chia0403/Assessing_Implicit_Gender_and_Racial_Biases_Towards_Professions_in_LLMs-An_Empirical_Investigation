The chill November air bit at Professor Amelia Radcliffe’s cheeks as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Augustine's University.  A swarm of students buzzed around her like agitated bees, their excited chatter a symphony of impending exams and Friday night plans. Amelia tugged her tweed coat tighter against the wind, her gaze fixed on the ancient oak doors of her office – a sanctuary nestled deep within the rambling Victorian building. 

St. Augustine's was steeped in history, its stone walls whispering tales of past scholars and clandestine meetings. Each creaking floorboard held a memory, each dusty tome in the library a portal to another world. Amelia, a professor of medieval literature for the past twenty years, felt a profound connection to this place, a kinship with the generations who had walked these halls before her. 


But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than usual, like a storm brewing on the horizon.  Amelia dismissed it as pre-exam jitters, though a flicker of unease tugged at her usually calm composure. She pushed open the heavy oak door and stepped inside, hoping for a moment of quiet solitude before the day's whirlwind truly began.
