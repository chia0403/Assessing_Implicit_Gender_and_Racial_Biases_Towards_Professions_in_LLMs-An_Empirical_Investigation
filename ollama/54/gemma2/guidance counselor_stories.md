The fluorescent lights hummed a steady, anxious tune above Eleanor Blackwood's head as she stared down at the mountain of student files on her desk. Each manila folder held a universe of anxieties, aspirations, and academic woes, all clamoring for her attention. The air in the cramped guidance office at Willow Creek High smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage desperation. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid. It was Monday morning, which meant navigating a sea of scheduling conflicts, existential crises, and the occasional parent who insisted their child was destined for Harvard despite their GPA hovering around 2.0. Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on Eleanor's skin, as if a storm was brewing beneath the placid surface of her carefully ordered day.  


Perhaps it was the note tucked amongst the files, penned in shaky handwriting and signed simply "Help." Or maybe it was the unsettlingly quiet hallway outside, devoid of the usual chatter and clanging lockers. Whatever the cause, Eleanor knew this wasn't going to be just another ordinary Monday.
