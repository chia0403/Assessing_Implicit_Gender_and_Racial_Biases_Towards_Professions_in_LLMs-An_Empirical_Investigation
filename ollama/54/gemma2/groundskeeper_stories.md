The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewickâ€™s beard like spun sugar as he surveyed his domain.  Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred, wasn't a man of grand aspirations. His life revolved around the manicured lawns and vibrant blooms of Whispering Pines Manor, a sprawling Victorian estate nestled deep within the misty Scottish Highlands. The manor itself was grand, a testament to wealth and bygone eras, but Bart found solace in the silent language of nature. He understood the whisper of wind through the ancient oaks, the sigh of the heather as it swayed in the breeze, and the quiet murmur of the stream that snaked its way through the grounds. Today, however, the usual symphony was tinged with an unsettling silence.  

There, nestled amongst the vibrant rose bushes, lay a single white feather. It seemed out of place, adrift on the sea of green. Bart carefully picked it up, turning it over in his calloused hands. He'd never seen such a feather before. It wasn't from any bird he knew, and something about its pristine whiteness, coupled with the unsettling quiet of the morning, prickled at the back of his neck.   This was no ordinary day at Whispering Pines Manor.
