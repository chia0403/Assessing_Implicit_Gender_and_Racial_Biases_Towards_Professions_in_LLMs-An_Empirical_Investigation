The humid Miami air clung to Elias "Eli" Cortez like a second skin as he maneuvered his cart down the grand marble lobby of The Flamingo Hotel. Palm trees swayed just outside the glass doors, casting dappled shadows across the polished floor that shimmered with streaks of yesterday's spilled champagne. A faint scent of saltwater and coconut sunscreen drifted in from the ocean breeze, competing with the perfume of expensive lilies adorning the reception desk. 

Eli adjusted the white linen cap on his head, its peak tilted at a jaunty angle as always. He was used to being overlooked – a shadow flitting between the towering guests, carrying their suitcases and answering their demands with a practiced smile that never quite reached his tired eyes. But today felt different. A prickling sensation crawled along his spine, a feeling that something was about to shift. 


Eli glanced at the grand staircase leading up to the second floor.  A single figure stood silhouetted against the warm light spilling from the upper landing. He couldn't make out any details – just a tall, slender form with hair like spun gold. The figure seemed frozen in time, their gaze fixed on something beyond Eli’s line of sight. 

A shiver ran down Eli’s spine. It wasn’t just the air conditioning – this was something more, something that made him feel strangely drawn to the figure and yet acutely aware of the distance separating them.
