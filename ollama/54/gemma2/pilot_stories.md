The rhythmic hum of the Aurora Borealis-painted sky was all Elias Thorne had ever known. Born on the outskirts of Nova Terra, a sprawling orbital habitat tethered to the moon's southern polar crater, the vastness of space was as familiar to him as his own backyard. He dreamt not of solid ground, but of star trails and nebulae, of celestial bodies dancing in an eternal ballet. 

Elias’ calloused fingers tightened around the joystick, his gaze glued to the holographic display shimmering before him. The lunar landscape sprawled beneath him – a tapestry of grey craters and jagged peaks bathed in the ethereal glow of Earth hanging fat and blue in the distance. Today, he wasn't delivering cargo or ferrying passengers. Today was different. Today, Elias Thorne was on a reconnaissance mission for the Lunar Mining Corporation, his sleek starship Zephyr slicing through the lunar atmosphere like a silver meteor, heading towards the uncharted region known as the Whispering Canyons.
