The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Juniper's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bonanza." The discount store was mostly empty at this hour, save for a lone man meticulously examining cans of soup and the occasional child dragging its feet behind a harried parent.

Amelia idly tapped her fingernails against the chipped countertop, the rhythmic clicking echoing in the silence. Her nametag, slightly askew, read "Amelia J."  She'd been working at Bargain Bonanza for three years, long enough to know every creaky floorboard and malfunctioning display better than she knew her own family. 


The afternoon sun bled through the grimy windows, painting the aisles in stripes of dusty gold. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and discount perfume. A half-eaten bag of chips sat abandoned on a shelf, its contents crawling with ants. This was Amelia's world - a symphony of boredom punctuated by the occasional chaotic surge of customers during sale periods.  

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amelia lifted her head, curious. It wasn't a customer she recognized.
