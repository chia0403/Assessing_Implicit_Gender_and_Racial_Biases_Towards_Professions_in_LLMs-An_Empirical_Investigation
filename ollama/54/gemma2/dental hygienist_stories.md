The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Kensington's head, casting a sterile glow on the rows of neatly arranged dental tools. She meticulously scrubbed down her ultrasonic scaler, its whine a familiar lullaby in the otherwise hushed dental office.  The air held the faint scent of antiseptic and peppermint, a combination that usually calmed her nerves. Today, however, Elara felt anything but calm. 


Her gaze drifted to the clock on the wall, ticking impatiently towards ten o'clock – the scheduled arrival time for Mr. Theodore Grimshaw. He was known to be difficult, prone to complaining about everything from the temperature of the water to the angle of the headrest. But this morning, Elara felt a prickle of apprehension that went beyond his usual grumpiness. She couldn’t shake off the unsettling feeling that something was different, something…off.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across the town square as the last few patients left for the day. The quaint, brick-lined building of "Smiles by Sterling" stood on a corner bustling with life, its windows glowing warmly against the encroaching twilight. But inside, Elara felt a growing sense of unease, a feeling that her usual routine was about to be disrupted in an unexpected way. 


She glanced again at the clock. Ten minutes until Mr. Grimshaw's appointment.  Ten minutes until whatever it was she couldn't quite name would unfold.
