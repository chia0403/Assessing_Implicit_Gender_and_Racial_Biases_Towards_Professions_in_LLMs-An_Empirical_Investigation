The acrid scent of smoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood.  Elara Thorne, her armor dented and grimy from days spent on patrol, surveyed the smoldering ruins of the northern market district.  

Smoke plumed lazily from collapsed stalls, casting long, eerie shadows across the cobblestones. Twisted metal and shattered timbers littered the ground, remnants of a brutal attack that had unfolded just hours before. Elara, her hand resting on the hilt of her broadsword, could still hear the echoes of screams in the wind. 

The normally bustling marketplace was now a graveyard of charred fruit stands, broken pottery shards, and overturned carts. The air buzzed with activity as fellow guards frantically searched for survivors amidst the debris. Fear clung to them like cobwebs, their faces drawn and pale under the flickering glow of torches.  Elara felt it too, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just another bandit raid. Something was different this time, darker. The savagery of the attack left no room for doubt â€“ this was an organized assault, calculated and cruel. 


The city walls loomed in the distance, a silent testament to the vulnerability of their haven.  Elara knew that the enemy wouldn't stop here. They would be back, hungry for more destruction. And she, Elara Thorne, Captain of the City Guard, would be there to meet them.
