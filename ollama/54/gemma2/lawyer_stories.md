The incessant drip from the leaky faucet in Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's office was a metronome for her mounting anxiety.  Each drop echoed like a hammer blow against the silence, amplifying the emptiness she felt. It was the kind of silence that settled deep in your bones after a long day spent dissecting the human condition through legal jargon, leaving you raw and weary. Outside her window, the Manhattan skyline glittered with an almost mocking vitality – a stark contrast to the storm brewing within Amelia. 


Her office wasn't opulent, just functional, with its worn leather armchair, cluttered bookshelves, and framed certificates of commendation hanging precariously on the beige walls.  It was the kind of space that reflected her: practical, focused, and a touch chaotic. Tonight, though, it felt more like a cage than a sanctuary.

The phone hadn't rung all day. A quiet anomaly in Amelia’s typically frantic world. The silence was unsettling, whispering ominous possibilities about the case she had been working on – the one that could make or break her career.
