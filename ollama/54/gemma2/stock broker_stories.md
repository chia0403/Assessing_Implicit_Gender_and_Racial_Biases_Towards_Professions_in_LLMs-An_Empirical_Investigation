The clinking of champagne flutes mingled with the nervous chatter of brokers at the top-floor penthouse overlooking Manhattan's glittering skyline.  A haze of expensive cologne and ambition hung in the air, thick enough to choke on. Bartholomew "Bart" Caldwell III adjusted his bespoke tie, smoothing out a nonexistent wrinkle. The air throbbed with anticipation; tonight was the annual Mergers & Acquisitions Ball, where the cityâ€™s elite gathered to celebrate their latest conquests and plot their next moves. Bart, having just landed a multi-million dollar deal on high-flying tech stock "SkyNet," felt the familiar thrill of victory coursing through him.  He sipped his champagne, his eyes scanning the room, searching for the perfect target: someone naive enough to invest in his new "sure thing."
