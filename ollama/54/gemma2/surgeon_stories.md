The air in Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's OR was thick with the antiseptic tang of sterilization and the hushed tension that always accompanied imminent surgery.  The overhead lights cast harsh shadows on the sterile steel instruments laid out before her, glinting like metallic jewels against the pristine white backdrop. 

Ellie ran a gloved hand over her forehead, smoothing down a stray strand of auburn hair escaping from her surgical cap. Her mind was already racing through the procedure: a complex aortic valve replacement, fraught with potential complications. The patient, a gruff, chain-smoking retired firefighter named Frank McAlister, was young for this kind of surgery, only 58, but his heart had betrayed him, leaving him teetering on the precipice.

The OR doors hissed open, and the circulating nurse entered, her face tight with the usual pre-op anxiety. "Dr. Vance," she began, her voice a low murmur, "Mr. McAlister is ready." 


Ellie met her gaze, her blue eyes filled with a fierce determination. “Let’s do this.”

The setting: A modern surgical theater in a busy teaching hospital on the outskirts of Chicago. The year is 2023.
