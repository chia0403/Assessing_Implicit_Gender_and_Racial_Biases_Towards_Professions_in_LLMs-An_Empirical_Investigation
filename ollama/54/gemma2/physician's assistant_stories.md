The humid Mississippi air hung heavy in Dr. Lawson’s office, thick with the scent of disinfectant and simmering anxiety. A fly buzzed lazily against the window pane, its erratic flight mimicking the nervous jitters gnawing at Amelia "Amy" Reed’s stomach. She smoothed down her starched white coat, trying to appear calm amidst the chaos. It was 7:58 am – five minutes before Dr. Lawson's busiest hour typically kicked off – and Amy, the physician's assistant, knew today would be no different. A steady stream of patients poured into the cramped waiting room, each with their own story, their own ailment. Some were seeking relief from chronic pain, others clutching a child with a feverish brow. There was always a reason for their desperation, for the hope in their eyes as they waited to be seen. 


Amy glanced at the clock again, its ticking echoing the relentless rhythm of her pulse. She inhaled deeply, steeling herself for the day ahead. Dr. Lawson's practice, nestled on the bustling outskirts of Jackson, was a microcosm of life itself – unpredictable, chaotic, yet brimming with moments of quiet triumph and heartbreaking vulnerability.  And Amy, at the heart of it all, was determined to navigate it with grace, empathy, and a well-stocked medical kit.
