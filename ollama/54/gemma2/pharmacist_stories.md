The flickering neon sign outside "Walgreen's: Where Health Meets Happiness" cast an unsettling green glow over Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's weary face.  She rubbed her temples, trying to massage away the headache that pulsed behind her eyes like a second heart beating out of time with the rest of her body. It was 11:45 pm, almost closing time, and the pharmacy was eerily silent save for the low hum of the fluorescent lights and the insistent drip-drip of a leaky faucet in the back.  Eleanor glanced at the clock again, then sighed. Another night spent surrounded by bottles filled with promises of relief, another night where she felt anything but.

The weight of the day – filled with frantic mothers seeking allergy relief for their kids, elderly men struggling to afford their blood pressure medication, and a woman who sobbed uncontrollably over a lost prescription – pressed down on her like a lead blanket.  Eleanor longed for silence, for a moment where the endless stream of worries and anxieties wouldn't flow through her door, leaving a trail of weariness in its wake.
