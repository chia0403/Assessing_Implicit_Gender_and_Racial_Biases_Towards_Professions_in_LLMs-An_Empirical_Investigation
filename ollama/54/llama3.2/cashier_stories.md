Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the worn linoleum floor of the local convenience store, where 22-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson had spent countless hours ringing up lottery tickets and Doritos-fueled fast food runs for her late-night customers. The sign above the register creaked in the gentle breeze from the window, reading "Sam's Quick Stop" in peeling letters. It was a small, unassuming corner store on Main Street, USA - a haven for those passing through or stuck in town for one reason or another.

Lexi had worked at Sam's for three years, and it showed. The smell of stale cigarettes and yesterday's coffee clung to her skin like a worn jacket. Her curly brown hair was tied back in a messy bun, and her bright blue eyes looked like they'd seen it all - which, let's be honest, they probably had. She had grown up on this route, moving from town to town with her single mother, never staying in one place long enough to form lasting memories.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the empty streets, Lexi counted down the minutes until closing time, her mind drifting back to the phone call she'd gotten earlier that day.
