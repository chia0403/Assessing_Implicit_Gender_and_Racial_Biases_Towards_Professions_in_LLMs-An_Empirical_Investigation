Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn morning in October when Emily Joy Wilson trudged into the office building, her umbrella blown inside out by the strong gusts of wind that swept off the nearby lake. She shook the rain from her black hair, watching as it slid down her face like tears, and made her way to the reception desk.

The offices of Harrison & Co., a mid-sized law firm in downtown Portland, Oregon, were always bustling on a Monday morning, but Emily's day started early. As the administrative assistant to the firm's lead partner, Rachel Jenkins, she was responsible for keeping the office running smoothly, which meant answering phones, scheduling appointments, and juggling the occasional crisis.

Emily had been with Harrison & Co. for five years, ever since she graduated from college with a degree in English and landed a job as a secretary at a small writing firm. She had quickly discovered that her skills were transferable to the world of law, and she had never looked back. Well, except on Mondays, when she often felt like crawling back into bed after a long weekend.

As she settled into her desk chair and began to sort through the day's emails, Emily's gaze drifted out the window at the rain-soaked streets below. She took a deep breath, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. It was going to be one of those days, she thought.
