The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small village of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the thatched roofs and the bustling town square. The air was alive with the smell of freshly cut stone and the sound of chiseling, as the villagers began their daily work.

In a small workshop nestled between the blacksmith's forge and the bakery, Asher Wellesley carefully selected a piece of Carrara marble for his latest commission. As a skilled stone cutter, Asher took pride in his craft, carefully shaping and polishing the stone to bring out its hidden beauty. His hands moved with a precision that had taken years to develop, and his eyes scanned the material with a deep understanding of its character.

Asher was a man in his late 30s, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through the stone he worked with. His dark hair was flecked with gray, and his calloused hands told the story of a life spent working with the raw material. Despite the physical demands of his job, Asher's fingers were surprisingly deft, capable of coaxing intricate patterns from even the most recalcitrant marble.

As he began to work on the new piece, Asher's mind wandered back to the commission that had brought him to this workshop. The local lord's daughter had requested a statue of her family's crest, and Asher was determined to create something truly exceptional. Little did he know, however, that this project would set in motion a chain of events that would change his life forever.
