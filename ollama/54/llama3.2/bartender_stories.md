Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The neon sign creaked in the gentle ocean breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets of Oceanview Beach. Inside the worn wooden walls of "McGillicuddy's Pub," the smell of stale beer and yesterday's regret hung heavy in the air. Behind the bar, bartender Kieran Patrick McGillicuddy polished a mug with a dirty rag, his eyes fixed on the TV mounted above the counter, where a news anchor droned on about some crisis or other.

It was just another Friday night at McGillicuddy's, the kind of place where the regulars came to forget their troubles and the newcomers came to find them. Kieran had worked here for five years, pouring drinks and listening ears for the town's lost souls. He knew everyone's story, from the fishermen who braved the choppy waters every morning to the tourists who stumbled in off the highway, searching for a taste of adventure.

But tonight was different. Tonight, a stranger had walked into McGillicuddy's, looking like he'd just been swept up from the streets of Dublin and dropped onto the sandy shores of Oceanview Beach. His eyes were sunken, his skin pale, and his dark hair was mussed in every direction. He ordered a whiskey on the rocks and sat at the end of the bar, his gaze fixed on some point beyond the horizon.

Kieran's curiosity was piqued, but he kept it to himself, watching as the stranger sipped his drink and waited for something – or someone – that only he could see.
