Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving in the early morning hours. The city was still waking up from its nocturnal slumber, the only sound being the steady patter of droplets on the pavement. It was a time when the world seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the day's trials and tribulations to begin.

In a small, smoke-filled office nestled in the heart of Capitol Hill, private detective August "Augie" Wynter was already elbow-deep in the day's first case. His eyes, a piercing shade of blue that seemed almost grey in the dim light, scanned the stack of files and papers scattered across his desk.

Augie, a man in his mid-40s with a rugged jawline and a mop of unruly brown hair, was a fixture on these streets. He had seen it all - the dark alleys, the seedy bars, the desperate souls who came to him for help when no one else would touch them.

As he poured himself a cup of black coffee from the thermos sitting beside his computer, Augie's mind turned to the latest case that had walked through his door. A beautiful young woman named Sophia Jenkins, her porcelain skin and sapphire eyes a stark contrast to the desperation in her voice as she begged Augie to help her find her missing sister.

With a sigh, Augie pushed back from his desk and stood up, his worn leather shoes making soft crunching sounds on the floor. He grabbed his trench coat from the hook near the door and stepped out into the rain-soaked streets of Seattle, ready to face whatever lay ahead in the pursuit of truth.
