Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a chilly autumn morning in October 2022 when Evelyn Louise Thompson stepped into her small office in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as she booted up her computer and began to sort through the stack of tax returns that needed attention. As an income tax preparer at Thompson & Co., Evelyn took pride in helping individuals and small businesses navigate the complex world of taxes.

The office itself was a cozy, eclectic space that reflected Evelyn's love of vintage decor and good books. Shelves lined one wall, stacked high with dusty tomes on everything from accounting principles to historical fiction. A worn leather armchair sat beside the window, where Evelyn often spent hours poring over tax codes and regulations.

As she sipped her morning coffee, Evelyn's gaze drifted out the window, taking in the vibrant streets of Portland. The city was alive and buzzing, with cyclists whizzing by on the nearby bike path and pedestrians strolling along Hawthorne Boulevard. It was a far cry from the quiet, suburban world that many of her clients came from – a world where the only sounds were lawnmowers and gentle chatter.

Despite the hustle and bustle outside, Evelyn's office remained a sanctuary of sorts, a place where she could focus on one thing: helping people get their finances in order. And as she settled into her morning routine, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change – something big, something that would bring a floodgate of new clients and challenges her skills as an income tax preparer.
