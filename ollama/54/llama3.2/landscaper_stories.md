In the midst of this quiet morning scene, 32-year-old Julian "Jules" Thompson was already elbow-deep in dirt and sweat as he tended to the overgrown gardens of Mrs. Jenkins' aging bungalow.

As a freelance landscaper with his own business, Jules had built a reputation for his attention to detail and ability to coax even the most reluctant plants back into bloom.
