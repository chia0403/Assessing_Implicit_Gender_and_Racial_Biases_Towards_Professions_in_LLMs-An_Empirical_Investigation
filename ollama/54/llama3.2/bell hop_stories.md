Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Evelyn "Evie" LaRue stepped out of the downpour and into the warm glow of the Carousel Hotel's lobby. The soft chime of the revolving doors announced her arrival, and the concierge, a flamboyant man named Marcel, looked up from his station to greet her with a bright smile.

"Good evening, Evie, cher! You look like you've been through a storm. Come give your old friend Marcel some coffee and let's get you dried off."

Evie smiled wearily as she shed her sodden coat and hat, revealing a crisp white dress that would soon be stained with the day's spilled drinks and mysterious stains. As a bell hop at one of New Orleans' most iconic hotels, Evie LaRue had seen it all – from rowdy bachelorette parties to high-stakes business deals gone wrong.

The Carousel Hotel was a grand old place, built in the 1920s by some rich uncle who'd lost his fortune in the stock market. Over the years, it had changed hands more times than Evie's own name had been passed around at family gatherings. But despite its checkered past, the hotel still held a certain allure – a sense of old-school glamour that drew in travelers from all over the world.

Tonight was no exception. A lone guest sat sipping whiskey at the bar, his eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the room's windows. Evie recognized him as a regular – the enigmatic stranger who always seemed to be watching her from afar. She made a mental note to keep an eye on him tonight.
