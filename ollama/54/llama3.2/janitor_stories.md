Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glow over the drab, institutional corridors of Ravenswood High School. It was 4:45 AM on a chilly autumn morning, and the only sound was the soft hum of the heating system and the muffled murmur of distant students stirring in their dorms.

Amidst this sleepy chaos, janitor-in-charge Elmer Everett Jenkins wiped down the worn linoleum floor with a practiced efficiency, his eyes scanning the deserted hallways for any signs of trouble. A former Marine turned high school custodian, Elmer took pride in keeping Ravenswood's hallowed halls spotless and secure, even as he secretly harbored a deeper concern: something was amiss at this forsaken institution.

With twenty years of service under his belt, Elmer knew every nook and cranny of the school, from the sticky puddles on the gym floor to the hidden vents that whispered secrets to the wind. He was the eyes and ears of Ravenswood High, a guardian of its daily rhythms and rituals – and perhaps, just perhaps, the only person who could uncover the dark truths lurking beneath its surface.

As Elmer continued his rounds, his gaze lingered on a small, forgotten corner near the old auditorium: a spot where the school's custodial staff had long avoided, whispered about in hushed tones by fellow janitors. It was there that Elmer discovered the mysterious message scrawled on the wall – a single word, written in red ink and seemingly out of place among the drab concrete: "Watch."
