Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished glass as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson trudged through the downpour, her worn sneakers making squelching sounds with each step. A recent graduate of Seattle University College of Law's paralegal program, Lexi had landed a job at the prestigious law firm of Hansen & Associates, specializing in corporate litigation and bankruptcy cases. Her days were filled with the humdrum tasks of document review and research, but she was determined to prove herself as a valuable asset to the team.

As she walked into the office building, the warm glow of the lobby's chandelier lights enveloped her, a welcome respite from the dreary rain outside. Lexi took a deep breath, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her. She had always known that law school would be tough, but she was ready to put in the hard work and prove herself as a top-notch paralegal.

But as she made her way to her cubicle, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The office seemed quieter than usual, with several of her colleagues working from home due to the inclement weather. And then there was the whispered conversation between two of the senior partners, their hushed tones and worried glances making Lexi's curiosity piqued.

She settled into her chair, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she began to sort through the day's stack of documents. Little did she know, today would be a day like no other â€“ one that would test her skills, challenge her resolve, and set her on a path she never could have imagined.
