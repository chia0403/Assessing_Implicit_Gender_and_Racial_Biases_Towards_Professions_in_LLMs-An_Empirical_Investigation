Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun rose over the vast expanse of Interstate 80, casting a golden glow over the worn asphalt and rusty guardrails, Jack Wesley Thompson trudged wearily towards his trusty old pickup truck, Bertha. The air was crisp with the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant hum of diesel engines filled the air, a familiar soundtrack to Jack's daily routine as a highway worker.

For the past decade, Jack had been a fixture on this stretch of road, earning the nickname "The Fixer" among his fellow workers for his ability to diagnose and repair even the most obscure problems plaguing the aging infrastructure. With a rugged beard and weathered hands, Jack had spent countless hours under the scorching sun, wrestling with wayward potholes and oil slicks, always ready to lend a helping hand or offer a sympathetic ear to the endless stream of weary travelers who passed through his domain.

Tonight was no exception. As Jack loaded Bertha up with his gear – a battered toolbox, a tarp, and a thermos filled with black coffee – he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A strange, restless energy seemed to be building in the air, like the low rumble of thunder on a summer evening. And as he started the engine and pulled out onto the highway, Jack caught a glimpse of something that made his heart skip a beat: a plume of smoke rising from the eastbound lanes, where the night's shift had just begun.
