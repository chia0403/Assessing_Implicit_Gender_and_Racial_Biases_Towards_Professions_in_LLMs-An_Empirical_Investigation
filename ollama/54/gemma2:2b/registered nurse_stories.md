The humid air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and regret as Evelyn Thorne, RN, knelt beside the bed.  Her normally neat bun was escaping its confines in her frantic effort to untangle the tangled blanket covering Mrs. Abernathy's frail frame. The hospital lights reflected off the steel bars that were now a stark contrast to the gentle curves of Mrs. Abernathy's once youthful face.  She ran a hand over the woman’s forehead, feeling the fever burn beneath her touch. This wasn't how Evelyn envisioned this particular shift. 

The late summer heat was unrelenting in the small city of Willow Creek. The humid breeze swirled through the open windows of Mrs. Abernathy’s room, carrying with it a symphony of groans and coughs from the other patients on the ward floor.  The sound of their suffering, however, couldn't compare to the chilling silence that had fallen upon Evelyn's soul since she received the call earlier that morning – a call that had shattered her sense of normalcy and plunged her into a vortex of grief.

**Setting:** Willow Creek General Hospital, a quaint yet aging institution nestled in the heart of a small town known for its apple orchards and idyllic setting. The hospital reflects its slow-paced environment with faded décor, creaky floors, and an overall atmosphere of quietude punctuated by the constant hum of machinery and the mournful sighs of patients. 


**Main Character:** Evelyn Thorne, RN -  A woman in her late 30s, with a gentle but resolute demeanor. She has dedicated her career to caring for others, often working double shifts and going above and beyond to provide support and comfort to those she encounters.   She carries the weight of past experiences and unspoken grief that she tries to hide beneath a professional facade.
