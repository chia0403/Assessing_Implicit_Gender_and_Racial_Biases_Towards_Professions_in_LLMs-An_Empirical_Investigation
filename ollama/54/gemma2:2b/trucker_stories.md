Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the world outside into streaks of gray and white.  Inside his rig, its engine purring a steady rhythm like an old dog’s growl, Clayton “Calico” Campbell wrestled with the weight of another load: boxes stacked high enough to make the steel frame creak with strain. He'd been on the road for three days now, each mile pulling him further away from his wife and daughter in rural Oklahoma.  The only company he had was the endless hum of the engine and the echoing silence of the truck stop diner's fluorescent lights that flickered like dying stars. 

His rig, affectionately nicknamed "Big Bertha" after his late mother, was a behemoth of steel and chrome. It ran on diesel fumes and loyalty, its tires scarred with tales of lonely nights and distant highways, each one more miles than he wished to count. He'd seen too many sunsets in this life -  each a reminder of home, yet another reason to keep driving.

The diner's greasy spoon menu hung behind the counter like a faded poster from a forgotten time, its coffee pot brewing something that smelled vaguely of desperation and regret. Tonight, Calico was hunting for solace, not just food, in the familiar, if slightly worn, surroundings of this lonely roadhouse.
