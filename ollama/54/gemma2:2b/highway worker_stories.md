The asphalt shimmered under the unforgiving sun like molten glass, reflecting the cracked sky above with an almost obscene intensity.  Dust devils danced erratically in the distance, their frantic movements mimicking the anxieties churning inside Carlathan "Cal" Montgomery's gut. He adjusted his worn Stetson, its brim casting a shadow over his tired eyes. The monotony of endless asphalt stretches stretched before him, broken only by the occasional screech of tires and the rhythmic click of his toolbox. 

Cal wasn’t built for this life. Not like his father, who had spent a lifetime working on these very roads, etching himself into their veins with every passing mile. His father had been a legend, leaving behind tales that sounded as if he'd tamed the very desert itself. Yet, Cal felt more like a wanderer, lost in the endless expanse of concrete and steel. 

He pulled out his lunch – a lukewarm sandwich and a thermos of coffee - and settled himself on a dusty wooden bench under the shade of a lone oak tree.  The familiar scent of pine and dust filled his nostrils, a melancholic symphony for his restless soul. He was a highway worker, a cog in the vast machine of progress, forever bound to the unforgiving grip of asphalt and concrete.
