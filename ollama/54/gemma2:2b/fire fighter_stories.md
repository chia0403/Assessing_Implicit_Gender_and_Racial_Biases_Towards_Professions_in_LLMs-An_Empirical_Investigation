The crisp autumn air bit at Captain Elias Vance's exposed skin as he surveyed the scorched remains of the old lumber mill.  Smoke still curled from the wreckage like the ghost of a dying bonfire, a somber reminder of the fiery disaster that had ripped through the town just hours ago. The setting sun cast long shadows across the smoldering debris, painting the scene in hues of orange and violet, both beautiful and unsettling. 

Elias inhaled deeply, the smell of burning wood and acrid smoke stinging his nostrils. His face, hardened by years spent battling flames, was etched with concern as he looked out over the chaotic landscape.  He knew this town was broken, its heart scorched and its spirit wavering under the weight of the tragedy that had unfolded.

His hand tightened around the worn handle of his axe as he walked towards the makeshift command post set up in the middle of the yard, his boots crunching on the cracked asphalt.
