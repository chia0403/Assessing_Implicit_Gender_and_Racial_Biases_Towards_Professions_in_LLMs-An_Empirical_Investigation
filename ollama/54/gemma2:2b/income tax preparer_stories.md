The fluorescent lights hummed above Hazel "Hettie" Thorne like a swarm of restless bees, their buzz matching the nervous chatter in her small office. It was a Friday afternoon, a day traditionally reserved for celebratory takeout and mindless television. But this wasn't just any Friday; it was deadline day for the annual citywide income tax season.  

As usual, Hettie found herself surrounded by mountains of paperwork.  Forms with titles like "1040-EZ" and "Schedule A" were piled high on her desk, each one a potential gateway to someone's financial security – or at least that's what she told herself as the weight of deadlines threatened to crush her under the immense pressure of 1075 North Oak Street.  

Hettie, with her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight bun and a perpetually stained apron, was an accountant who saw the world through the lens of taxes. Not just numbers but stories; not just deductions but dreams. She'd spent twenty years in this very office, guiding her clientele towards financial freedom – at least that’s what she told herself. But tonight, as she stared into the abyss of paperwork, a nagging sense of unease crept in.
