## The Scent of Decay

The humid air clung to Elara Thorne like a damp shroud as she stood before the shopfront of Blackwood Apothecary.  Smoke from her late husband's pipe swirled above his weathered face in the waning light of sunset. It was one of those days where even the sun seemed reluctant to break through the perpetually oppressive fog that seemed to settle upon Salt Bay every evening. 

Elara ran a hand over the worn wood of the apothecary door, her fingertips tracing the familiar grooves etched into its surface like memories.  Her eyes lingered on the faded sign above - "Blackwood Apothecary," now barely clinging to its frame like a desperate grasp for relevance.  The shop was a relic of bygone days, filled with dusty cabinets overflowing with vials and dried herbs, a testament to a time when apothecaries held more sway over a community's health than modern medicine did.

Her name echoed through the hushed silence – Elara Thorne. A woman who had once been known for her wisdom and her gentle touch, but now found herself adrift in the currents of grief and uncertainty. Her husband's passing had left an emptiness she couldn’t quite fill. The apothecary, a beacon of his love and their shared legacy, was now all she had left.  But would it be enough to keep the spirit of Blackwood alive?
