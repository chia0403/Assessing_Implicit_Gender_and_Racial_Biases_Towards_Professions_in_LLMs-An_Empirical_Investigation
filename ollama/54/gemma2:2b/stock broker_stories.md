##  The Midas Touch

**Setting:** A gleaming skyscraper in Manhattan's financial district, 2023. The air vibrates with anticipation as traders rush through the sterile halls, fueled by coffee and ambition. Outside, the city hums - a symphony of horns and the relentless drone of traffic. 

**Main Character:**  Ethan Beaumont. At 34, he's already amassed a fortune through his savvy trading skills. His penthouse suite boasts panoramic city views, a state-of-the-art gym, and enough gadgets to make any tech enthusiast drool. Ethan's life is meticulously organized, every decision calculated, every interaction strategically crafted. He navigates the treacherous waters of Wall Street with a practiced ease, known for his ruthless ambition and uncanny ability to predict market trends.  

**Opening:** 
The crisp white collar felt oddly tight on Ethan’s neck as he stared out the window. Below, the city bustled with life – a constant churn of activity that mirrored the turmoil within him. It had been two days since the 'crash,' an event in the stock market that sent shockwaves across the globe. The initial panic had subsided, but the air crackled with a quiet unease. 

Ethan's phone vibrated against his chest, a text from his brother: "The old man wants to see you." His heart sank. The 'old man,' Mr. Montgomery, was Ethan’s mentor and a titan of Wall Street himself. He called the shots, often with an unnerving sense of cryptic purpose that left Ethan's mind twisting in knots.  

Ethan wasn't sure if he wanted this meeting, not just because of the weight of his brother's expectation, but also because of something deeper – a nagging feeling that the Midas touch, so synonymous with his success, was turning into an ironclad cage, slowly suffocating him.
