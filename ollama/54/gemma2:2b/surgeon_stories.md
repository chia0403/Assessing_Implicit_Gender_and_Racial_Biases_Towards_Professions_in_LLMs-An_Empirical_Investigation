The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, clinging to Dr. Amelia Thorne like cobwebs. It was a familiar smell in her hospital, but tonight it felt different. The sterile white walls seemed to pulsate with a darker energy, amplified by the tense silence that filled the operating room. Outside, a symphony orchestra played – a bizarre juxtaposition against the hushed whispers and rhythmic beeps of life support machines.

Amelia took a deep breath, focusing on the intricate pattern of the stitching she was about to thread through the patient's chest.  Her hands, usually steady and precise, felt shaky. Tonight's patient was not just another case; it was her sister. Her younger sibling, barely a woman herself, lay trapped in a body ravaged by an unknown illness. The only hope – a risky procedure that Amelia would attempt to perform alone.

The city of Aurora slept under the cover of night as the sky shimmered with a thousand stars.  Aurora, where the air always felt clean and crisp, where every day was a promise of a new dawn, but tonight, it held a chilling secret. The hospital, usually a beacon of hope, stood shrouded in an unnerving silence. There was something different tonight - something unsettling, almost primal.
