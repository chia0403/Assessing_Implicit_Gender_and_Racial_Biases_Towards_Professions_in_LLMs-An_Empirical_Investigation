The sun beat down on Leo Carmichael's back as he wrestled with a stubborn oak root, its gnarled tendrils snaking like grasping fingers across his worn work boots.  His crew - a motley bunch of aging ex-athletes and dreamers, most of them named after the constellations or mythical beasts - stood around, offering groans and halfhearted encouragement. "This ain't no Disney castle," grumbled Big Ben, whose biceps were more defined by years spent hauling heavy logs than lifting anything remotely graceful, "We gotta get this sucker moved before Mrs. Peabody catches wind."  

Leo, however, was lost in the symphony of his own private world: a world of sun-drenched concrete and vibrant earth; a world where he felt not merely alive but whole. He was a sculptor of nature, his canvas the sprawling lawn of Mr. Peabody's grand Victorian mansion, its manicured hedges forming a perimeter around a universe of carefully cultivated flora.  It was here, amidst the fragrant jasmine and towering azaleas, that Leo truly belonged. His hands, calloused from years of tilling soil and wielding shears, danced with an invisible rhythm as he coaxed life out of the earth. It was his therapy, his sanctuary - a world where weeds were banished to a fiery purgatory under the watchful eye of Mrs. Peabody's prized rose bushes, and roses blossomed in defiance of their own fragility.  


**Setting:** The sprawling lawn of a grand Victorian mansion, bathed in the harsh glow of summer sun.
