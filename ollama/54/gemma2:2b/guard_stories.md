The grimy cobblestones felt like they were grinding against Elara Thorne's worn boots.  She wasn't built for this life – not for the endless patrolling, the monotonous hours spent watching the bustling marketplace, the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in every shadowed corner. But she was a daughter of duty, born into a family line whose history intertwined with protecting this very city. Elara Thorne, now an adult, held onto that hope like a lifeline on a treacherous tide.

The air hung thick and heavy with the aroma of roasted meat, spiced wine, and something else – fear. Tonight's celebration for the city's patron saint was supposed to be joyous, but Elara couldn't help but feel a gnawing unease deep within her gut.  A chill wind whipped through the alleys, sending shivers down her spine. A single lantern flickered on the wall of a nearby tavern, its light barely reaching the grime-covered alleyway. As she approached it, her sharp eyes caught sight of something that sent a jolt of adrenaline racing through her veins: an almost imperceptible shadow lurking by the barrels. 


This was no ordinary night in the city.
