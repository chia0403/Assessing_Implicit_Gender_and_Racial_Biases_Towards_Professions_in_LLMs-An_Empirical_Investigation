The rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of the grand 19th-century library, its rhythmic drumming almost drowning out the ceaseless clatter of Amelia’s Remington typewriter. The air inside was thick with the scent of aged paper and woodsmoke from the fireplace that sputtered at the far corner. She glanced up from her work, watching as snowflakes swirled outside in a mesmerizing ballet of white against the crimson hue of the library's exterior paint. 

Amelia "Amy" Bellweather, head secretary for the esteemed Hawthorne Family Trust, was no stranger to this particular scene. The library was the heart of their sprawling estate nestled on the outskirts of the bustling city of Evermore.  For years, it had been a sanctuary for Mrs. Hawthorne herself, the family matriarch.  Now, however, her once-vibrant spirit seemed to be fading with every passing year, leaving Amy with an increasing sense of worry and a profound responsibility to ensure her legacy lived on beyond the confines of the estate's walls.

Suddenly, a heavy thud echoed from the library’s far corner where the master bedroom lay.  Amy froze, her heart pounding in her chest. Was that...was that Mrs. Hawthorne?  Or was it something else entirely?
