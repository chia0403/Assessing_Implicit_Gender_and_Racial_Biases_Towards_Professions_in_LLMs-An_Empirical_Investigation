Rain lashed against Detective Elias Thorne's windshield, blurring the neon glow of the "Last Call" diner sign into an erratic swirl of colours. It was 2:00 am, and the air held the damp chill of coming dusk. The familiar scent of stale coffee and cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, a testament to countless nights spent chasing phantom whispers and shadows in the city's underbelly. Thorne gripped his steering wheel tighter, battling a wave of nausea that had been steadily rising since he arrived at the scene. 

He was drawn here by the frantic voice on the emergency line: "They say it's… like nothing they've ever seen before. A nightmare…"  His partner, Sergeant Davis, had relayed those words over the radio with a chilling calm that did little to soothe his gut. Now, standing before the shattered storefront of the All-Night Pie Shop, the remnants of a violent crime left him speechless. 

Thorne's gaze swept across the chaotic scene: overturned tables, scattered pies in varying degrees of decay, and worst of all - an unnatural stillness. It wasn’t just the silence of the night; it was the silence of a soul utterly devoured by some unseen force.  His badge felt heavy on his chest, mirroring the weight of another unanswered question hanging in the air – one that whispered a terrifying truth: "There's no escaping what's become real."
