The flickering neon sign above "Night Owl Counseling" cast an almost apologetic glow over Dr. Ethan Winters' worn leather armchair. Rain pattered against the stained glass window depicting a forlorn figure clutching a crescent moon, its reflection shimmering in the dim lamplight. Outside, a storm raged, each gust of wind seeming to echo the tumult within Ethan's own mind. 

He sat there, lost in a kaleidoscope of past traumas - his own and those he was tasked with helping, all swirling together in a chaotic vortex.  Ethan, known for his gentle demeanor and patient approach, felt himself slipping into an abyss of self-doubt. It was the kind of storm that threatened to engulf him completely, leaving only the stark reality of his crumbling career. His office - once teeming with hopeful clients seeking solace in the dark hours of night - now held a desolate silence. He hadn't had a single session for weeks. 

Ethan was a man drowning in empathy, a counselor who believed in offering support even when he himself felt lost and adrift. Yet, the storm inside him threatened to drown out everything he cherished about his profession â€“ the ability to help others navigate their darkest nights.  He looked at the clock, its ticking sound amplified by the pounding of rain outside, each tick a reminder of time slipping away, each minute etching a deeper layer of despair onto the canvas of his life. 


**Setting:** A rundown office building in a gritty urban area with neon signs and heavy raindrops. The storm is a backdrop for emotional turmoil within Dr. Ethan Winters, a counseling psychologist facing his own internal struggles as he tries to connect with his clients' pain.
