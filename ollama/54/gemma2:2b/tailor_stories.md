The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's workshop, turning the air thick with the scent of thread, cedarwood polish, and sweat. The familiar whirring of his spinning wheel was muted by the relentless buzz of flies that seemed to congregate around the open windows like a summer thunderstorm.  His hands, calloused and strong from years of manipulating fabric, moved deftly across the fine cloth he'd been working with for hours – a shimmering crimson silk doublet. Each stitch brought him closer to completing the masterpiece that would be Elias Thorne’s next commission - a gift from the Duke himself, who was rumored to be tired of his wife’s suffocatingly elegant gowns and longed for a change of pace. 

**Setting:** A small, cramped workshop nestled in the cobblestone alleyways of a bustling city center. The air hangs thick with the aroma of wood polish and fresh fabric. Sunlight streams through the single window, casting long shadows on Elias' worn tools.  The walls are lined with shelves laden with thread spools and antique sewing equipment, remnants of years spent mastering his craft.
