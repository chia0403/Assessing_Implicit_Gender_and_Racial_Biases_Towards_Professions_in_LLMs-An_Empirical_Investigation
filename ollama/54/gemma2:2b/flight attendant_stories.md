## The Ballad of Amelia "Amy" Moon

**Opening:** 

The midday sun beat down on the tarmac, reflecting off the countless metallic glint of the aircraft scattered like fallen stars across the vast desert landscape.  Inside Flight 735, the air was thick with a heady mix of stale coffee and recycled cabin air.  Amelia "Amy" Moon, her silver name tag hanging crookedly from her neck, sighed as she adjusted the tiny oxygen mask over the sleeping face of Mrs. Peterson, whose snoring sounded like an angry badger struggling to climb a mountain.  The plane was about to touch down in New Delhi, and already Amy felt the familiar tingle of apprehension. 

**Setting:**

Flight 735 is a Boeing 747 en route from London, England to Delhi, India. The flight takes place during the early hours of an afternoon - approximately 1:00 pm GMT.  The passengers on board are a mix of nationalities and social classes, including business travelers, tourists, and diplomats - all bound for the vibrant chaos of New Delhi.
