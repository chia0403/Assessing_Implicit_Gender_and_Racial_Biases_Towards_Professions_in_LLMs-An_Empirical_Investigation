The air hung thick with humidity and anticipation, clinging to Elara Blackwood like cobwebs after a storm. The aroma of jasmine from the overflowing planter outside her door, the same one that had been a constant fixture since she was a child, did little to dispel the oppressive heat. The Grand Aurora Hotel bustled with an undercurrent of nervous energy, each floor a different symphony of chatter and hushed whispers. Today was opening day for the grand reopening, after a fire that had ravaged the building a year ago, leaving only ash and memories behind. 

Elara was stationed in the lobby, her name tag bearing the familiar, elegant lettering of "Elara B."  She wasn't new to the Grand Aurora; she was a fixture there, having worked as bell hop since she was a teenager. The hotel had been a part of her life as long as she could remember â€“ its grand ballroom where her grandmother would dance with her, and the sprawling rooftop garden where she used to hide from schoolyard bullies. Now,  as she polished shoes and arranged fresh flowers, it felt like more than just a job; it was her legacy.
