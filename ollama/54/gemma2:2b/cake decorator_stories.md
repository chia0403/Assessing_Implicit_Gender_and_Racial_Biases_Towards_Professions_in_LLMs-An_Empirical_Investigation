The crisp December air swirled snowflakes around Amelia's ankles as she stood beside the bakery window, watching the world turn from bustling into silent.  She inhaled deeply, the scent of vanilla and cinnamon filling her lungs like a warm hug. The bakery windows were already adorned with festive displays - glittering gingerbread houses, candy cane garlands strung across the counter, even a tiny, snow-dusted snowman perched atop the display case. 

Her name was Amelia Bellemere, and she was known throughout the town of Everly for the exquisite, whimsical cakes that graced every birthday party, wedding, and special occasion.  Tonight's order? A life-size sugar castle complete with miniature gingerbread knights and a delicate fondant dragon. A challenge, even for her skilled hands.  Her fingers skimmed over the buttercream frosting, tracing the intricate pattern of the castle walls as she contemplated the towering structure before her. The lights reflected off her silver hairpins, making them gleam like tiny beacons in the winter dusk. 


As Amelia turned to begin work, a shadow fell across her shoulder.
