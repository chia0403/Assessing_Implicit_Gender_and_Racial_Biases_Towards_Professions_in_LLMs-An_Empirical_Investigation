The wind howled through the canyons of steel beams that served as the skeletal frame for the new skyscraper rising near downtown Chicago.  Rain lashed down in sheets, turning the concrete jungle into a symphony of metallic clangs and splashing water. Daniel "Danny" O'Malley, his weathered face masked by the soot-streaked bandana he wore as a habit, clung to the rickety scaffolding. Above him, the city lights twinkled like fireflies, offering little respite from the biting chill.  He was almost finished with this particular section of the roof – just one more layer of shingles and he'd be done for the day, leaving the greasy warmth of his truck to wait in the relative sanctuary of his home.


But tonight, something wasn't right. The air felt heavy, thick with a tension that went beyond the usual pre-winter chill.  Danny squinted at the sprawling cityscape, trying to decipher the subtle shifts in the city's usual hum – an urban orchestra playing out its nightly melody, now punctuated by a discordant note.  He knew, deep down, something wasn’t normal. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.
