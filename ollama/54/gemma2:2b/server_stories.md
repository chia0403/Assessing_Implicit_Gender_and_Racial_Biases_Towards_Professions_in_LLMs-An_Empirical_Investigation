Rain lashed against the windows of "The Salty Dog," blurring the neon sign that advertised cheap beer and questionable music. It was just past midnight on a Tuesday, making it an ideal time for even the most hardened soul to find solace in a sticky bar stool.  This was Elara's domain - she was the only server who knew the regulars by their usual order of "whiskey neat," "the usual" and "one shot of that stuff you like." Her name meant "light", ironically, considering her current task: wiping down the sticky tables with a worn paper towel. 

Elara wasn't much for small talk, but she had a way of reading people better than most barkeeps could even dream. Tonight was one of those nights, she felt it as she watched a burly man named "Brick" pace around like a caged tiger. His hand hovered over the worn barstool, its surface stained with spilled beer and lingering smoke. She knew Brick would be looking for something familiar, some comfort in the swirling chaos of the night. He was searching for solace in the depths of The Salty Dog, a place where even the deepest loneliness could find refuge in the warmth of cheap whiskey and broken-down stories.
