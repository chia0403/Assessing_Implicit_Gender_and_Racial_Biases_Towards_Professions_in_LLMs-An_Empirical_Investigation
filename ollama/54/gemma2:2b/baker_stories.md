The air hung thick with the scent of cinnamon and burnt sugar, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Amelia's anxieties. Tonight, however, even the familiar warmth of her bakery in Montmartre couldn't quell the gnawing unease in her stomach.  Her eyes darted between the towering oven door and the flickering gas lights lining the cobblestone street outside, each passing shadow a fleeting phantom that danced with her own burgeoning fears. 

Amelia, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, was known as "La Petite Souris" (The Little Mouse) amongst her regulars. Her tiny bakery, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a bustling newsstand, was more than just a place to buy pastries; it was a refuge for weary artists, writers, and dreamers – all seeking solace in the warmth of her hearth and the comfort of freshly baked bread. Tonight, however, she felt an unnerving hollowness. 

Her gaze fell on the unfinished pastry tray resting on the counter, its glazed apple tarts gleaming with an almost mocking promise. It was a perfect replica of the one she’d seen in a dusty old Parisian cookbook – a recipe passed down through generations from her grandmother. But something felt different tonight; the recipe didn't quite seem to belong, and Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that it was hiding a secret, waiting to be unleashed.
