The late afternoon sun slanted through the glass panes of the aviary, painting shimmering squares across the wooden floor where Eloise "Ellie" Thistlewick knelt. The air hummed with the gentle chatter of her charges: a gaggle of bantams strutting amongst each other, a pair of boisterous parrots squabbling over a stray seed, and a majestic peacock whose feathers seemed to catch the light like stained glass. Ellie sighed, her eyes trailing the graceful arc of the peacock's tail as she adjusted its water dish. A lifetime dedicated to caring for these feathered creatures had given her a strange sort of peace, one that resonated more deeply than any human friendship could. 

Today, however, the usual serenity was tinged with worry. The usually vibrant plumage of the peacocks, especially the majestic male known as Azurewing, seemed dulled, and his normally boisterous calls were muffled, replaced by a mournful silence. Ellie’s heart sank. This wasn't just any bird; this was Mr. Azurewing, whose iridescent feathers were rumored to hold secrets whispered by the wind from far away lands.  Her job wasn't merely tending these animals – it was about protecting them, and understanding the language of their silent cries.
