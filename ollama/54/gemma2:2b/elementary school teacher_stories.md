## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  Oakwood Elementary School, a stately brick building with ivy creeping up its walls and a sprawling playground behind it. It’s a quiet autumn day in October, leaves crackling underfoot as Ms. Amelia Hawthorne carefully organizes her classroom library. 

**Character:**  Ms. Amelia Hawthorne, thirty-five years old, possesses the kind of warmth that melts even the coldest winter days. She is known for her sunny disposition and her love of classic literature, but this year, something feels different. The walls of Oakwood seem to whisper secrets, mirroring the anxieties that are bubbling inside Ms. Hawthorne.  

**Opening:** 

Ms. Hawthorne straightened a copy of "The Phantom Tollbooth" on its designated shelf, its worn cover whispering back her own tired thoughts. Another long month in Oakwood. Long months filled with sing-song tests and endless stacks of papers, long nights spent grading essays that felt like trying to decipher an ancient code. The once joyous thrill of teaching had faded into a weary acceptance, the silence of the room suddenly feeling suffocating. 

She glanced at the clock. The bell would soon ring, signaling the start of another day in the maze of childhood lives she was tasked with navigating. As she picked up her worn satchel, she felt a shiver down her spine. Something wasn't right. A strange, unsettling silence had filled the air since yesterday’s incident, and now it seemed to pulse at the edges of every whisper from the classroom walls, like a secret waiting to be unleashed.
