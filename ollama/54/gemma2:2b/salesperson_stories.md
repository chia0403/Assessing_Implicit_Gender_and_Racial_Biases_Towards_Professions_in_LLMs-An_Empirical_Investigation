The neon sign outside "Diamond Dreams" practically throbbed with an inner life of its own, pulsating in sync with Amelia's own racing heart. It was her third night on the floor, and already she felt the pressure mounting like a diamond under the weight of a thousand-carat microscope. The cramped confines of the Manhattan showroom had always been a challenge, but tonight, the air hung heavy with anticipation – the kind that came with a potential five-figure sale. 

Her name was Amelia Dubois, and she wasn't your average saleswoman. She'd carved her career from passion rather than commission; every day she walked into this diamond mine of glittering facades, ready to unearth their secrets and help them shine brighter.  Tonight, the subject was a dazzling emerald ring:  a masterpiece of history whispered through its centuries-old stone. 

The door creaked open, revealing Mrs. Vandermeer, her face as sharp as any vintage cut crystal. Amelia straightened her smile; she'd mastered the art of anticipating her client's needs with more than just charm – she knew how to listen. "You're Amelia, I presume?"  Mrs. Vandermeer asked in a voice like ice and silk.  "I trust you'll understand my request for an unconventional display."
