The humid Charleston air clung to Amelia "Amy" Beaumont like a second skin as she stepped out onto her porch. The salty breeze carried with it the faint scent of blooming honeysuckle and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead. A thick layer of humidity pressed down on Amy, mirroring the weight in her chest. For the last three months, business had been drier than a week-old grits breakfast. Her usual clientele – the stately old ladies and grumpy men who lived for decades and held their life insurance policies with the same reverence they held for their rocking chairs - were strangely absent. 

Amy's worn leather briefcase felt heavier than usual as she made her way through the quaint streets of Charleston, its cobblestones worn smooth by generations of footsteps. The once bustling city square now resembled a ghost town.  Her office was on King Street, tucked away in a building with faded red brick and peeling paint. Even the squirrels seemed more wary than usual, their bushy tails twitching nervously beneath the old oak trees that lined the street. 

Amy sighed. Today, she had to meet Mr. Hayes – her most challenging client, a gruff but undeniably wealthy businessman who owned an entire island off the coast of South Carolina. The kind of man who wore his wealth like a badge and whose life insurance policy was more than just a sum; it held the weight of his legacy, a legacy that could only be understood by someone who knew the language of money and loss –  a language Amy desperately needed to learn if she wanted to stay afloat in this unforgiving business.
