The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia “Amy” Thorne’s head like a swarm of angry bees as she meticulously filed down the edge of Mrs. Henderson's chipped stiletto. It was 8:00 PM on Friday, her usual quiet before the weekend rush at ‘Nails & Nosh’, a charmingly quaint nail salon tucked away on Magnolia Street in the heart of Savannah. The humid air hung heavy in the shop, thick with the scent of citrus polish and Mrs. Henderson’s lavender perfume. 

It was the kind of night where the Spanish moss draped from the oak trees outside seemed to sway with a quiet melancholy, its shadows dancing across the worn linoleum floor. Amy inhaled deeply, her eyes closed for a moment, savoring the peace before she was whisked away by the chaos of manicures and pedicures. 

This wasn’t just about polishing nails and shaping cuticles – this was her sanctuary, her haven. Here, amidst the clatter of filing implements and the gentle murmurs of happy customers, Amy found a sense of purpose that resonated with her soul. As she finished Mrs. Henderson's polish for the night, a small, intricate silver dragonfly ornament caught her eye on a display shelf. Its wings were adorned with tiny diamonds that sparkled like fallen stars.  A silent pang of yearning tugged at her heart – was this what she yearned for? A life beyond just manicures and nail art.
