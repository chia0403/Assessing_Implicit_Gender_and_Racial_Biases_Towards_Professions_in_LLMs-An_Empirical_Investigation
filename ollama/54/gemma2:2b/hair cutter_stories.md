The air in "Scissors & Steam" was thick with the scent of jasmine shampoo and old dreams. A wisp of steam escaped from the iron-shaped vent as Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back tight under her worn cap, hummed along to Frank Sinatra on the record player. The faded turquoise paint chipped at the edges of the salon's walls, mirroring the age and resilience of the community it served - a haven for generations of women escaping the confines of their lives, seeking a moment of quiet, or a fierce declaration of their own style. 

It was Tuesday afternoon, usually the busiest day in Amy’s life – after all, every woman's hair needed a touch of magic on Tuesdays, and she was a master at it. The salon doors swung open with the familiar creak, ushering in Mrs. Petrov, her hands trembling slightly as she clutched a crumpled photograph. Her eyes, usually bright blue under years of fatigue, were clouded with worry.
