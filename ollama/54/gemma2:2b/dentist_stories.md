## Setting: The Frowntown Dental Clinic

**The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee.**  Inside the cramped office of Dr. Amelia Thorne, sunlight streamed through an aging window on to a chipped countertop littered with miniature rubber models of smiling teeth. Even after years in practice, the sight still filled her with a peculiar mix of satisfaction and melancholy. It was a reflection of Frowntown itself – a place where progress seemed to have bypassed them completely, a town seemingly frozen in time.

**Dr. Amelia Thorne**, whose name was whispered with both reverence and fear by the townsfolk she treated, sat hunched over her latest case file. Her weathered hands, capable of crafting intricate restorations as deftly as dismantling old fears, fidgeted nervously. A tremor ran through them as she reread the notes from Mrs. Peabody's last appointment. Not just a dental issue this time; Mrs. Peabody was in a state of utter despair, blaming her toothache on an inexplicable curse plaguing their family for generations. 

This was no ordinary case – it felt like an old wound had opened up, threatening to swallow Amelia whole. This wasn't about restoring teeth, not anymore.  It was about battling the shadows of a life she’d built in Frowntown - a life intertwined with its secrets and mysteries.
