## The Sweetest Poison

**Setting:** A bustling seaside town in Maine, USA. Cobblestone streets wind their way between Victorian homes adorned with brightly coloured shutters, where seagulls cry overhead and salty air hangs thick with the smell of lobster rolls. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Alcott, better known as "Amy" to her friends and patients alike.  She's a dietician at The Shoreline Wellness Center, a charming haven tucked away in a quiet corner of town. Amy runs her practice with an unwavering dedication to healthy eating, her heart overflowing with the desire to help people achieve their health goals. However, even the sweetest recipes can sometimes turn sour when hidden secrets lurk beneath the surface.

**Story Opening:** 
The salty spray from the ocean kissed Amelia's cheeks as she watched a young boy struggle through his first meal of the day at the seaside boardwalk. He was perched on a rickety wooden bench, eyes brimming with tears and fingers stained red from spilled ketchup. A group of older kids nearby were giggling, tossing fries in the air like confetti. "He hasn't touched a single bite," Amelia mumbled under her breath, picking up a stray leaflet for The Shoreline Wellness Center.  
"You know," a voice chirped behind her, "Sometimes the biggest obstacle isn't the food itself, but the memories it holds." It was Mrs. Patterson, a local matriarch known for her hearty breakfasts and even more hearty gossip. 

Amy sighed inwardly. She knew this boy. His father had passed away suddenly last year, leaving him adrift in a sea of grief.  He wouldn't touch anything that reminded him of his father, but the guilt was eating away at Amelia. Her own struggles with loss echoed within her. Today, she needed to unravel the threads of this boy's story and find the path to true healing, one bite at a time.
