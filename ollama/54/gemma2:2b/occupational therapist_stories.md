## The Whisper of Broken Wings

**Setting:**  A bustling city park in the heart of Chicago, Illinois. A vibrant tapestry of colors, sounds, and smells greets the eye: blooming cherry blossoms, the rhythmic thrum of a street performer's guitar, the smell of freshly-made popcorn wafting from the nearby concession stand. 
**Main character:** Elara Thorne, DPT

Elara Thorne adjusted her satchel, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip.  She was already behind schedule, and she could feel it - the nervous hum of anxiety vibrating in her chest. The aroma of hotdogs and sunscreen seemed to mock her as she entered the park's designated children's play area, a whimsical haven of colorful swings, slides, and climbing structures. 

Elara's eyes skimmed over the activity around her: a boy with mud splattered knees clinging to his mother's legs, a gaggle of giggling girls chasing each other between the jungle gym and sandbox, but there was one corner that feltâ€¦off. A small boy, maybe six years old, sat alone on a bench, clutching a crumpled tissue in his fist. His eyes were wide with distress, reflecting the storm clouds gathering in the sky. 

"Need a helping hand?" Elara asked softly, her voice soothing like balm on raw wounds.
