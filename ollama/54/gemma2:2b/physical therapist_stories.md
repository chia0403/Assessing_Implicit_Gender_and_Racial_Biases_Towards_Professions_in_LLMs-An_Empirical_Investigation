## The Weight of Words

**Setting:** A quaint seaside town called Oakhaven, nestled between rolling hills and the crashing waves of the Atlantic.  The air hums with the constant drone of seagulls and the scent of salt lingers on everything from the cobblestone streets to the weathered wooden houses.

**Character:** Elara Thorne, a woman whose name is as elegant and strong as her will. At 38, Elara is a renowned physical therapist, known for her empathy and ability to see beyond the broken bones and muscle tears that plague her patients.  Her office, nestled within an old apothecary on Maple Street, oozes with a calming aura - filled with dried herbs, antique books, and carefully crafted wooden frames containing images of restored bodies. 

**Opening:** "The weight is all you carry," Elara murmured, her gaze fixed on the weathered face before her.  It was Mr. O'Malley, his eyes sunken like a hollowed-out sea shell, and his hands trembling as he held a worn photograph. The woman in it, a silhouette against the bright summer sun, seemed to radiate warmth that was sadly absent from the man himself. 

“The weight of words,” Elara finished, her voice soft but firm, as she leaned back in her chair.  “It’s heavier than you can imagine."
