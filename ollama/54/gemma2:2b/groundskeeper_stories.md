The crisp autumn air nipped at Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's nose as she stood amidst the vibrant tapestry of the Blackwood Manor estate. Sunlight slanted through the ancient oak leaves that draped the sprawling lawns like crimson tapestries, dappling the earth in emerald and gold hues. The silence was broken only by the rustle of her gloves against the worn wooden bench, her gaze sweeping across the meticulously manicured gardens. 

Ellie's hands, scarred with years of honest work and seasoned with the scents of countless plants, smoothed the rough bark of a centuries-old maple.  She knew each leaf, each root, every inch of this land like she knew the lines on her own face. Blackwood Manor, once a majestic estate now whispered with forgotten grandeur, held a quiet beauty in its decay - a beauty that Ellie was sworn to protect.
