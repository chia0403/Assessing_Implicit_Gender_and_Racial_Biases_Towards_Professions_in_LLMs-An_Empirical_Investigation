Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of New Orleans, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside her office in the French Quarter, gazing out at the vibrant nightlife that was just beginning to stir. A renowned registered dietitian with a specialization in nutrition therapy for chronic disease management, Lexi had spent years honing her skills and building a reputation as one of the city's top experts in her field.

Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street near Jackson Square, was a cozy haven filled with the warm scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soothing sounds of jazz music. It was here that Lexi spent most of her days working with patients from all walks of life, helping them navigate the complex world of nutrition and health.

Tonight, however, Lexi's mind was elsewhere. She had received a cryptic message earlier in the day from an old friend, Dr. Julian Saint Clair, who had gone missing several weeks ago under mysterious circumstances. The note had been brief, but its contents had sent a shiver down Lexi's spine: "Meet me at Caf√© du Monde at midnight. Come alone."

With a sense of trepidation and curiosity, Lexi slipped her phone into her purse and headed out into the night, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her deep into the heart of New Orleans' dark underbelly, where secrets and lies waited around every corner.
