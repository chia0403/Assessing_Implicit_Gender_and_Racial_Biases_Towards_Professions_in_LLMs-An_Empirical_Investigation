Here's a story opening and setting:

**The Sunshine Coast of British Columbia**

Dr. Emily Joanne Thompson stepped out of her small cottage in the quiet town of Gibsons, surrounded by towering trees and the misty veil of the Pacific Ocean. The air was crisp and clean, filled with the scent of saltwater and freshly cut grass. As a nutritionist specializing in holistic health, Emily had spent years studying the intricacies of the human body and its relationship to the environment.

Her cottage, perched on a hill overlooking the coast, was her sanctuary - a place where she could retreat from the demands of her practice and reconnect with nature's rhythms. The sound of seagulls filled the air as Emily took a deep breath, feeling the stress and fatigue of the past few weeks begin to melt away.

It was a beautiful summer morning in August, and the warm sun was just starting to peek over the trees. Emily felt invigorated, ready to tackle the day ahead with renewed energy and focus. Little did she know, however, that this peaceful morning would soon be disrupted by an unexpected visit from an old friend - one who would shake her world and set her on a path of discovery that would change everything.

How's that? I've created a setting for Emily Joanne Thompson, a nutritionist living in Gibsons, BC. Let me know if you'd like me to continue the story!
