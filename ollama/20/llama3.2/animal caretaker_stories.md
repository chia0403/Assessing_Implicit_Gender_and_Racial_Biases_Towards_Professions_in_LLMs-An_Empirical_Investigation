Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the rolling hills of Willow Creek, a small town nestled in the heart of rural England, Emilia Faye Jenkins made her way through the entrance gates of Oakwood Farm, a sanctuary for animals in need. With a worn denim jacket slung over her shoulder and a faded badge pinned to her lanyard reading "Emilia - Animal Caretaker," she surveyed the tranquil landscape before her. The scent of fresh hay and damp earth filled her nostrils as she breathed in, a familiar comfort that never failed to calm her nerves.

The farmhouse loomed behind her, its stone fa√ßade weathered to a soft grey from years of exposure to the elements. Emilia's boots crunched on the gravel path as she approached the old wooden barn, where the night's arrival was already making itself known. She could hear the muffled sounds of a distressed animal - perhaps a cat or a small dog, her trained ears picking up on the subtle vibrations in the air.

With a practiced ease that came from years of experience, Emilia slipped off her jacket and began to move swiftly towards the source of the noise, her eyes scanning the darkening horizon for any sign of movement. The sun's final rays had just begun to fade, casting long shadows across the landscape as Emilia stepped into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges Oakwood Farm might throw her way that night.
