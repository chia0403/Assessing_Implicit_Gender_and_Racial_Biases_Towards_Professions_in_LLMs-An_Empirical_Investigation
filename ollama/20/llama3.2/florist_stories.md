Emilia had inherited the family business from her grandmother, who had passed away just a year ago. The shop had been a staple in the community for decades, and Emilia took pride in carrying on the tradition of creating beautiful arrangements that brought joy to the townspeople. She loved nothing more than selecting the perfect blooms to complement each customer's unique style and story.
