Here's a potential story opening:

---

Detective Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the stormy dock, the wind whipping her short brown hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the dark waters of Lake Michigan. The city lights of New Haven reflected off the ripples, casting an eerie glow over the deserted pier. It was a night like any other in this small Midwestern town, where the only sounds were the creaking of old wooden pilings and the distant hum of a lone car driving by.

As a detective with the New Haven Police Department, Lexi had seen her fair share of crimes, but there was something about this case that had her gut twisted into knots. A local businessman, Richard Langley, had been found dead on the dock earlier that night, his body cold and stiff from the chill of the lake air.

Lexi's eyes scanned the area, taking in the scattered trash and debris that littered the dock. She knew that Langley was a wealthy and influential man, with many secrets hidden behind his polished smile and tailored suits. But now, he was just another victim, leaving behind a tangled web of motives and suspects that Lexi was determined to unravel.

With her eyes fixed on the water, Lexi felt a shiver run down her spine as she whispered a silent promise to herself: she would find out what had happened to Richard Langley, no matter how long it took or who was involved.
