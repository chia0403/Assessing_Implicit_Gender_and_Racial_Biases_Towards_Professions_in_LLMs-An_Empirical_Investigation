Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Red Rock, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn buildings. In a small apartment above the local hardware store, Kaitlyn Rae Jenkins stirred in her sleep, the sound of her snores echoing off the walls as she slept fitfully.

Kaitlyn had worked as a construction worker for most of his life, starting out as a young apprentice on his father's small renovation firm before striking out on his own after a tragic accident took his father's life. Now, at 35, he was one of the go-to guys in Red Rock for any job that required a steady hand and a strong back. He had built homes, fixed fences, and even done some heavy lifting for the local school district - but lately, he'd been feeling restless.

As Kaitlyn tossed and turned on his narrow bed, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the usual weariness that came with a long day's work - or the nagging sense of unease that had been following him since his last job went sour. No, it was something more.

And as he lay there in the darkness, listening to the sounds of Red Rock's nightlife filtering through the windows, Kaitlyn felt a strange sense of certainty creeping over him: tonight was going to be different. Tonight was when everything changed.
