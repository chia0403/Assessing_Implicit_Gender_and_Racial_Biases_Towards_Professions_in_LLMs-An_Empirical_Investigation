Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district were always alive with energy, but tonight they seemed to pulse with an extra layer of excitement. The neon lights of the towering skyscrapers cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the crowded sidewalks, as people from all walks of life rushed to and fro.

In a small, cramped office nestled between a ramen shop and a used bookstore, Elliot Thompson sat at his desk, staring out the window at the sea of faces below. A middle-aged salesperson with a worn leather briefcase by his side, Elliot was on the phone with a potential client in New York, trying to close a deal that would make or break his career.

As he listened intently to the other end of the line, Elliot's mind wandered back to the events of the past few months. The company had downsized, and his commission checks had been dwindling. He'd been forced to take on more clients than usual, sacrificing sleep and social life for the sake of making a sale. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was determined to land this deal, no matter what it took.

Elliot's eyes scanned the familiar landscape of Shinjuku outside his window - the towering skyscrapers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the bright colors of the Shibuya Crossing signs, and the tiny, out-of-place American diner that seemed to be a constant source of curiosity for the locals. It was a city of contrasts, where ancient traditions rubbed up against cutting-edge technology, and Elliot had always thrived in this environment.

As he hung up the phone, a sense of resolve settled over him. This deal would change everything. And with it, his life.
