Here's a potential story opening and setting for a tale about a rugged roofer:

---

The storm had passed, leaving behind a trail of debris and shattered dreams. For Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled and seasoned roofer with over two decades of experience, the weather was just another day on the job. His eyes, a piercing blue that seemed to bore into those he met, scanned the ravaged landscape as he climbed down from the ladder, his worn leather gloves clutched tightly around the jagged edge of a broken shingle.

Hawkins lived in the small town of Ravenswood, perched precariously on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. The town's history was etched into every weathered board and crumbling stone, and its residents had learned to rely on their wits and their hands to make ends meet. For Hawk, that meant being a jack-of-all-trades, with his trusty trowel and an arsenal of curses at the ready.

As he descended into the soggy streets, the smell of wet earth and damp wood filled his nostrils, transporting him back to a time when life was simpler, and the only worries were the ones that mattered most: work, family, and the next big storm. Little did Hawk know, however, that this particular tempest would bring with it more than just rain and wind – it would unleash a chain of events that would test his mettle, challenge his resolve, and push him to confront the demons he'd been trying to keep hidden for so long.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the deserted streets, as if the very darkness itself was conspiring against Hawk. The wind whispered secrets in his ear, reminding him that even in a world that seemed to have gone mad, there were still stories waiting to be told – and he was ready to listen.
