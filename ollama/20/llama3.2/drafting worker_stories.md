Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the dockyards, shrouding the streets of Newhaven in a damp, gray mist that clung to everything like a bad omen. It was a chill autumn morning in 1888, and the town was stirring from its slumber as the sounds of hammering and chiseling echoed through the narrow alleys.

In his small workshop above the docks, Emrys Ffynnon ap Rhys sat hunched over his drafting table, his eyes fixed intently on the intricate plans laid out before him. A skilled draftsman and engineer by trade, Emrys was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to bring even the most fanciful ideas to life. His clients came from all walks of life - shipbuilders, engineers, architects - but it was his work on the prestigious Golden Anchor Line that had made him a household name in Newhaven.

As he worked, Emrys's mind wandered back to the letter he had received just yesterday from the line's managing director, Mr. Harrington. The letter had been brief, but its implications were far-reaching: the Golden Anchor Line was looking to expand its operations into new territories, and they wanted Emrys to lead a team of designers and engineers on a high-stakes project to build a new shipyard in the distant port city of Calcutta.

The thought sent a thrill through Emrys's veins as he began to scribble down notes and rough estimates for the proposed project. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take him across the globe, into treacherous waters, and against the clock.
