Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Private Investigator Emilia Ruth Wilson stepped out of her office, a small, cramped space above a used bookstore in the University District. The neon sign that read "Ruth Wilson Investigations" flickered to life, casting a gaudy glow over the wet pavement.

Emilia lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the familiar sting of nicotine coursing through her veins. She'd seen it all in this city - the desperation, the deceit, the heartbreak. But there was something about this case that had her gut twisted into knots.

It started with a phone call from an anonymous source, claiming to have information about Emilia's estranged sister, Sophia. Sophia had gone missing five years ago, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a trail of unanswered questions. The police had given up on the case, but Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As she exhaled a plume of smoke into the chill evening air, Emilia gazed out at the drizzly streets, her mind racing with possibilities. She knew she had to start digging, and fast. The rain pounded against her trench coat like a drumbeat, urging her forward into the unknown.
