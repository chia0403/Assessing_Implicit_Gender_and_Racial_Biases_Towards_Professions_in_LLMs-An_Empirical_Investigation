Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the dusty small town of Red Rock, Arizona, but already the heat was suffocating. Highway worker, Everett Rylan "Ev" Jackson, was already sipping on his coffee as he loaded up his truck with gear for the day's maintenance work.

As Ev fired up the engine, a faint smell of diesel and asphalt wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of creosote bush that grew in abundance along the side of Highway 60. The desert landscape stretched out before him like an endless canvas of sand, rock, and cactus, with only the occasional dot of civilization to break up the monotony.

Ev had been working on this stretch of highway for five years now, and he knew every inch of it by heart. He'd seen the sun rise over these dunes more times than he could count, and yet each morning still brought a sense of excitement and anticipation as he set out to tackle whatever challenges the day would bring.

As he pulled away from the truck stop, Ev caught sight of the worn sign that marked the entrance to Red Rock: "Population 700. Population 700, give or take a few stragglers." He smiled to himself; it was always the same story in this town â€“ a small community bound together by a shared sense of resilience and determination.

Ev's thoughts were interrupted by the crackle of his two-way radio as Dispatch called out to him: "Jackson, 60-12 is looking a little rough. You good to check it out?" Ev nodded mentally; he was more than ready for whatever lay ahead on this hot Arizona morning.
