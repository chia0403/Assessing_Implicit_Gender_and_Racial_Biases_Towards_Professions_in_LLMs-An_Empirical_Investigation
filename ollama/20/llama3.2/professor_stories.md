Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Amara Elwes stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping her long black hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the darkening sea. The setting sun cast a golden glow over the waves, but Amara's eyes were drawn to the smaller boat bobbing in the distance, its engines sputtering as it struggled against the tide.

As a professor of marine archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, Amara had spent years studying the ruins of ancient civilizations that lay scattered across the globe. But nothing could have prepared her for the sense of unease that was growing inside her, like a slow-burning fire. It started with small things: strange noises in the dead of night, faint whispers in her ear when she was alone. She had dismissed it as fatigue and stress, but now Amara couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The university's annual summer lecture series was about to begin, and Amara had been tasked with leading a workshop on the history of shipwrecks in the North Sea. As she scanned the horizon, her mind began to wander to the mysterious artifacts that lay hidden beneath the waves, waiting to be discovered. But for now, she stood frozen at the edge of the cliff, the wind howling through her veins like a warning.

The darkness was closing in around her, and Amara felt the weight of secrets bearing down upon her shoulders. Secrets that she was determined to uncover, no matter what it took.
