Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the window of her small apartment, gazing out at the gray, rainy streets of Seattle. As an occupational therapist specializing in trauma recovery, Lexi had seen her fair share of broken bodies and bruised spirits. But on days like today, when the rain pounded against the pavement like a relentless drumbeat, she couldn't help but feel a pang of melancholy.

Lexi's own life hadn't been without its scars. She had grown up in a family of first responders, where emergency calls were a constant presence and the sounds of sirens were always a reminder that her parents' work was never done. Her own career path had been shaped by a near-fatal accident during college, which had left her with a lifetime of physical limitations and a newfound appreciation for the importance of occupational therapy.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Lexi's mind began to wander to her latest client, a young veteran named Jake who was struggling to adapt to civilian life after serving in Iraq. Their sessions were going well, but Lexi knew that the road to recovery was long and often winding. She felt a surge of determination and motivation, knowing that she had the skills and expertise to help Jake – and others like him – heal and find their way again.

Little did Lexi know, her own life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would force her to confront her own demons and question everything she thought she knew about herself...
