Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit interior of "Serenity Springs" Massage Therapy was like a warm hug on a cold winter's night. Soft candlelight danced across the walls, casting a soothing glow over the plush armchairs and the skilled hands that worked their magic on clients' tense muscles. Among them was Emilia Rose Thompson, a talented massage therapist with a gift for easing even the most stubborn knots.

As she finished up a session with a nervous corporate climber, Emilia took a deep breath, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail, and stepped out of the massage room to begin prepping for the evening's schedule. The scent of essential oils and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of soft jazz music playing in the background.

It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to snuggle up by the fire with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But Emilia wasn't here for relaxation; she was here to face her own demons head-on. Tonight marked the one-year anniversary of her brother's passing, and as she prepared to work through her emotions, she couldn't shake the feeling that this special night would be different â€“ that something was stirring beneath the surface, waiting to spill out into her life like a tidal wave.

Little did Emilia know, the arrival of a new client would change everything.
