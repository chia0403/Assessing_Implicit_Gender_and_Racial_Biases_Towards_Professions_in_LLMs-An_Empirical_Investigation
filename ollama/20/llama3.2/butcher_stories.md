The snowflakes fell gently onto the bustling streets of Ravenshire, casting a serene silence over the quaint town nestled in the heart of the Whispering Woods. The year was 1888, and the villagers were busy preparing for the annual Harvest Festival, which would take place on the autumnal equinox.

In the midst of this festive preparations, Emilia "Mia" Thompson stood at her family's butchery, carefully trimming the excess fat from a slab of beef. As the town's most skilled butcher, Mia took pride in her work, knowing that her cuts of meat would be the centerpiece for many a celebratory feast.

The scent of fresh meat and woodsmoke wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of hammering on metal outside. The sign above the shop creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Thompson's Fine Meats" in bold, golden letters. Mia's father, Edward Thompson, had founded the business over a decade ago, and Mia had grown up learning the intricacies of traditional butchery from him.

As she worked, Mia's mind wandered to the upcoming festival. She had spent weeks perfecting her recipes for the harvest-themed specials: venison steaks with wild mushroom sauce, roasted turkey breast with sage and apple stuffing, and of course, the obligatory prime rib for the festival's grand feast. But amidst the excitement, a nagging sense of unease lingered at the edge of her consciousness. Something was off in Ravenshire, something that Mia couldn't quite put her finger on.

And yet, as she expertly tied the beef with a length of twine, a sudden chill ran down her spine. It was as if the wind had carried a message, one that only she could hear: "Be careful, Mia. Something is coming."
