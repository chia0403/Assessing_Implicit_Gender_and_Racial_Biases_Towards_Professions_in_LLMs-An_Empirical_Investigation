Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist groups were beginning to filter into the city, their footsteps echoing off the intricately carved facades of the temples and monuments. Amidst the throngs of visitors, one guide stood out: Drusilla Elara Amari, a seasoned tour guide with an encyclopedic knowledge of Petra's history and secrets.

As she led her group of students on a winding path through the city's narrow streets, Drusilla's eyes scanned the crowds, searching for any signs of excitement or curiosity. It was going to be a long day, and she had already spotted at least two groups of rowdy college kids getting into trouble near the Monastery.

Despite her practiced air of detachment, however, Drusilla couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had received a cryptic message from an old friend earlier that morning, hinting at some kind of hidden treasure or artifact deep within the city's labyrinthine passageways. The message had been brief and vague, but it had sparked something in Drusilla - a sense of adventure, perhaps, or a reminder of why she had first fallen in love with Petra all those years ago.

As she navigated the crowded streets, Drusilla couldn't help but wonder what secrets Petra still held, waiting to be uncovered by a curious guide like herself. Little did she know that today was going to be a day that would change everything.
