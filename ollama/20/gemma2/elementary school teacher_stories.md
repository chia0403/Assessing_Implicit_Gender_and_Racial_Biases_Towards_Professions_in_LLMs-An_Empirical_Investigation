The morning sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Finch's classroom, illuminating swirling motes of dust that danced in its warmth.  Eleanor, as she was known to her students, surveyed the room with a practiced eye. Crayon shavings littered the floor like fallen confetti after a particularly enthusiastic art project. A half-finished model volcano loomed precariously on a shelf, threatening to spew imaginary lava onto unsuspecting textbooks. And from the corner, a chorus of excited chatter erupted as five-year-olds jostled for position by the reading nook, eager for their daily dose of fairy tales and fantastical beasts.

Eleanor smiled, her heart swelling with that familiar mix of exhaustion and exhilaration that came with being responsible for thirty pint-sized humans on a Wednesday morning in late April.  This was her tenth year teaching at Maplewood Elementary, and while the routine held comforting familiarity, each day promised something new â€“ a burst of unexpected laughter, a moment of profound understanding, or perhaps even a particularly ingenious rendition of "The Wheels on the Bus" that would leave her giggling uncontrollably.
