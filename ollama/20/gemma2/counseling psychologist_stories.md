The air in Dr. Evelyn Abernathy's office smelled faintly of lavender and old paperbacks. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. Outside, the city buzzed with its usual chaotic symphony – car horns, distant sirens, the rhythmic rumble of construction. But within these four walls, there was a fragile stillness, a space dedicated to the messy human experience. 

Evelyn sat behind her worn, oak desk, fingers tapping a staccato rhythm against the polished surface. Her patient, a young woman named Clara, had been late again. Evelyn wasn't particularly annoyed; chronic lateness often went hand-in-hand with anxiety, a frequent visitor in this office. She glanced at the clock – 10:15 AM – and sighed softly.  Perhaps Clara was lost in the labyrinth of her own thoughts, battling the internal storm that brought her to this very room.

Evelyn adjusted her glasses, a thin silver band that reflected the sunlight like a miniature mirror. Her gaze drifted to the shelves lining the wall, crammed with books on psychology, sociology, and self-help. Each volume held within its pages the potential to unravel the mysteries of the human mind, to offer solace or guidance to those lost in its depths.  


This was Evelyn's sanctuary, her haven from the whirlwind of life outside. And for now, it would be a safe space for Clara, too.
