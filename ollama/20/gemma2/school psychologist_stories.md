Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her thoughts. Outside, the world was cloaked in a grey twilight, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Eleanor was staring at the file on her desk: "Jackson Hayes - Possible Self-Harm." She knew Jackson - he was quiet, often withdrawn, and always seemed to carry an invisible weight on his slim shoulders. 

Her office, usually a haven of calming colors and softly humming white noise, felt claustrophobic tonight.  The worn rug beneath her feet muffled the clatter of raindrops against the windowpane, but the relentless drumming still resonated in Eleanor's bones. She had seen countless troubled children in her years as a school psychologist at Hawthorne Middle School, but something about Jackson’s case chilled her to the core. His drawings, once filled with vibrant colors and whimsical creatures, were now stark black and white sketches of shadows and empty spaces.  


The phone on her desk buzzed, pulling Eleanor back to the present. It was Mrs. Peterson, Jackson's English teacher, her voice tight with worry. "Eleanor, I just... I don't know what's happening with him. He barely spoke in class today."

Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation ahead. She had to help Jackson before he slipped further into the darkness. 


The storm outside raged on, a symphony of wind and rain, but Eleanor knew the real battle was about to begin – one fought not with swords and shields, but with understanding, compassion, and unwavering hope.
