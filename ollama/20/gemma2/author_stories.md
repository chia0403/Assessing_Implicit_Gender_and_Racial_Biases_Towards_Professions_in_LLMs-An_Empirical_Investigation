The rain hammered against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Juniper Bellweather's heart.  Lightning cracked across the bruised sky, momentarily illuminating the chaos of her workspace: stacks of paper reaching for the ceiling, overturned teacups, and a half-eaten bag of Werther's Originals abandoned on a dusty writing desk. 

Amelia, usually calm and collected like a porcelain doll, was a hurricane trapped in her own mind. Her latest novel, "The Clockmaker's Daughter," due next month, lay unfinished and mocking her from the center of it all.  Her characters refused to cooperate, their motivations as murky as the storm outside. The deadline loomed closer with each passing hour, and Amelia felt herself slipping into a panic that threatened to consume her entirely.


The attic, a converted space above her grandmother's quaint bookstore in the sleepy seaside town of Saltwind Bay, had always been her sanctuary.  But now, it felt more like a prison, the silence broken only by the relentless downpour and the ticking of an old grandfather clock that seemed to mock her every failing.
