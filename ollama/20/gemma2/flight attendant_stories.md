The recycled air of the Boeing 747 hummed with the low thrum of engines and the murmur of restless passengers. Eleanor Genevieve "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted her navy blue uniform, smoothing down the crisp white collar that felt more like armor than clothing. She took a deep breath, the scent of stale coffee and airplane disinfectant filling her lungs, a familiar perfume of travel and transience.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cloudscape, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and purple as they hurtled towards Frankfurt. Ellie scanned the cabin, her eyes lingering on a young girl with wide, inquisitive eyes clutching a worn teddy bear, a businessman frantically trying to close a laptop deal by his window seat, and an elderly couple whispering soft words of love in a language she couldn't decipher. Each passenger carried their own story, a fleeting glimpse into a world beyond the confines of this metal bird hurtling through the sky. 


Ellie was used to it, the constant churn of faces, the patchwork tapestry of lives woven together by circumstance and the shared experience of flight. She found comfort in the routine, in the practiced smile she offered every passenger boarding the plane, the reassuring words she spoke during turbulence, the gentle guidance she provided when someone needed help. 

But tonight, Ellie felt a prickle of unease, a nagging sense that something was different. It started with a flicker in her peripheral vision, a fleeting image she couldn't quite place. Then it was the hushed whispers among the crew, their voices laced with a tension she'd never heard before. 


As the plane descended towards Frankfurt, Ellie felt a knot tightening in her stomach. She wasn't sure what was coming, but she knew, with a chilling certainty, that this flight wouldn't be ordinary.
