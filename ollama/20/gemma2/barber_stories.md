The humid August air hung heavy in Barnaby Finch's barbershop, thick with the scent of bay rum and sweat. Flies buzzed lazily around the antique brass fan that barely stirred the stagnant air. Outside, on Elm Street, the midday sun beat down on the cracked pavement, turning the world into a shimmering mirage. 

Barnaby, his name as long and winding as the intricate beard designs he crafted for his clients, wiped sweat from his brow with a grimy handkerchief. He glanced at the clock, its pendulum swinging like a metronome marking the slow crawl of time. Three o'clock. Not a single customer all afternoon.  It was a far cry from the bustling mornings, when Barnaby's clippers sang and his scissors danced as he transformed scruffy faces into works of art. 


But this was Elm Street, after all, a sleepy town that seemed to sleep even in summer. The folks here had settled into their routines like roots growing deep in the earth. Change, for them, was as rare as a bluebird in winter.
