The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and sweat in Eloise Beatrice Cartwright’s tiny workroom. Outside, the August sun beat down on the cobblestones of Edinburgh’s Old Town, turning the narrow lane into a shimmering mirage. Inside, however, it was cool and shaded, the only sound the rhythmic click of Eloise’s shears as she snipped at a bolt of emerald silk.  Her fingers, calloused but nimble, danced over the fabric, coaxing life into its folds. She was creating a dress for Lady Sinclair, a grand affair with cascading ruffles and a train that would sweep across the dance floor at the upcoming Highland Ball. 

Eloise wasn’t just a dressmaker; she was an artist. Each seam, each bead, each meticulously placed stitch told a story, whispered secrets of love, loss, ambition, and joy. But lately, her own life felt as plain as unbleached linen – dull and threadbare. She yearned for something more, a splash of color in the tapestry of her days.
