The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay as Eliza Beatrice Finch waded through the knee-deep seawater. Her camera bag, usually filled with bright lenses and the comforting weight of her Canon 5D Mark IV, felt unusually light. It was half empty, its contents sacrificed to the ever-present tide that gnawed at the edges of Port Haven. Eliza had come here seeking solace, a place where the cacophony of city life couldn't reach her, where silence reigned and the only sounds were the crashing waves and the mournful cries of gulls. 

Port Haven, once a bustling fishing port, was now a ghost town clinging to the jagged cliffs overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic. Its weather-beaten houses huddled together like forgotten memories, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin. Rusted fishing boats lay beached on the sand, silent witnesses to a bygone era of industry and hope. Eliza had heard tales of its melancholy beauty, whispered in hushed tones by weathered fishermen who spoke of a magic that lingered in the salty air, a haunting allure that drew some back time and again. 


Eliza hoped it would draw her out of the darkness too.
