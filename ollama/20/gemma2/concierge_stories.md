The gilded cage of The Grand Aurora Hotel hummed with a low, perpetual buzz. Eleanor "Ellie" Antoinette Dubois, head concierge extraordinaire, could practically taste the simmering tensions in the air as she adjusted her crisp white uniform and surveyed the bustling lobby. 

It was always like this on Wednesdays: the day the annual International Concours d'Elegance car show rolled into town.  The usual symphony of clinking champagne flutes and polite chatter from visiting dignitaries would be drowned out by the roar of engines, the scent of premium fuel oil, and a palpable air of competitive ambition.

Ellie, however, thrived on the chaos. She was the conductor of this luxurious orchestra, ensuring every guest's whim, no matter how extravagant, was met with effortless grace. Tonight, she knew, would be no different.
