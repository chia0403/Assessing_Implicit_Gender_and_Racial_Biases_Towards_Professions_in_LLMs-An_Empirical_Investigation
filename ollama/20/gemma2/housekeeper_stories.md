The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, lingering aroma of Earl Grey tea. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously dusted the antique gramophone, its brass horn gleaming under the warm glow of the afternoon sun streaming through the bay window. Her movements were precise, practiced, almost a silent ballet of cleanliness in the grand drawing-room of Blackwood Manor. 

Blackwood Manor was a Victorian behemoth, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic. Its once vibrant facade had succumbed to years of salt spray and neglect, leaving behind faded grandeur and whispers of forgotten stories. Amelia knew every creak of its aged floorboards, every shadow cast by the peeling wallpaper, every secret tucked away in its dusty nooks. She was, after all, more than just a housekeeper; she was Blackwood Manor's silent guardian, its keeper of memories.
