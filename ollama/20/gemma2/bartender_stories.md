The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation. Neon flickered across the chipped Formica countertop, casting long, distorted shadows on the faces gathered there - a motley crew of insomniacs, dreamers, and the plain exhausted. Behind the bar, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, known to everyone simply as "Amy," polished a glass with practiced ease, her brow furrowed in concentration.  

The Mug was more than just a dive bar; it was a haven for the forgotten souls of Willow Creek, a town where dreams went to die and hope was a luxury few could afford. Amy, with her tired eyes and perpetually messy bun, understood them all. She'd seen their hopes rise and fall like the cheap whiskey shots she poured. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, like the air itself held a hidden tension, waiting to burst. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amy looked up, expecting to see the usual regulars - grizzled truckers, weary waitresses, and the occasional lost tourist. Instead, she saw him. A stranger, tall and shrouded in shadow, with eyes that burned like embers in the dim light.
