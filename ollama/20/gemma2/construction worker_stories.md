The morning sun sliced through the gaps in Amelia "Amy" Rose's worn canvas work jacket, stabbing at her exposed skin with icy precision.  She squinted against the glare, pulling the dusty brim of her cap lower over her forehead as she surveyed the skeletal remains of what was supposed to be a gleaming new high-rise hotel. The skeleton of steel and glass clawed at the cloudless sky, its twisted framework a monument to ambition and delayed progress. 

Amy ran a calloused hand along the rough metal beam beneath her feet, feeling the vibration of the jackhammer pounding in rhythm from across the construction site. Dust motes danced in the morning light, each one a tiny testament to the relentless effort required to build something from nothing. She inhaled deeply, the air thick with the scent of fresh concrete and diesel fumes – a symphony unique to her world. 

This was Amy's domain: the chaotic ballet of hammers, cranes, and welding torches, where sweat mingled with determination and ambition hung heavy in the air. Today, like every day, she would be another cog in this massive machine, another hand shaping the city’s future one bolt at a time.
