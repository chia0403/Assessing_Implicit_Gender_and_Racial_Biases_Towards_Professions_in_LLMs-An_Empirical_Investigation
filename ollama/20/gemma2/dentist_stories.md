The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming dental chairs in her office. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and cinnamon-flavored toothpaste, a scent she usually found comforting but today seemed to amplify the tightness in her chest. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock, its digital face flashing 8:05 AM. Her first appointment was due any minute. Yet,  the waiting room remained empty, a strange silence hanging heavy in the space. She wasn't used to this. Usually, by now, her receptionist, Brenda, would be ushering in patients, the familiar murmur of greetings and coughs filling the air. 

But today, something was different. The phone lay silent on the desk, its blinking light a mocking reminder of its inactivity. Even the rhythmic whirring of the air conditioning seemed off-key, as if mirroring the unease that gnawed at Eleanor's insides. She tried to shake off the feeling, reminding herself it was just a Tuesday morning. A busy Tuesday morning would come soon enough. 


Eleanor Vance adjusted her glasses and took a deep breath, trying to center herself before the day truly began. This wasn't unusual for her; she had built a reputation as the calmest dentist in town, even with patients who were terrified of needles and drills. But today,  a creeping sense of dread threatened to unravel that composure.
