The humid July air hung heavy over Oxford, clinging to Professor Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne like a damp shroud. Rain pattered against the leaded panes of her office window, blurring the ancient elms that lined Broad Street into watercolor smudges. Eleanor, perched precariously on a stool behind her desk, felt the familiar ache in her right shoulder, a constant reminder of the years spent hunched over dusty manuscripts and brittle pages. 

Her world was one of parchment and ink, of forgotten languages and ancient stories whispered across millennia. She lived among the ghosts of scholars past, their ideas swirling around her like unseen currents. Today, however, even the comforting weight of history couldn't quite drown out the nagging unease that had settled over her like a shroud. The phone call earlier that day had thrown a wrench into her carefully curated world, and now, as she stared at the swirling rain outside, Eleanor felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her chest.  


Something was different this time. Something was wrong.
