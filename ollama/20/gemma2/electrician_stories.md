The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the smell of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Sweat beaded on Tobias Finch’s brow as he tightened the last wire on Mrs. Henderson's faulty chandelier. The old woman had been fretting about it all week, claiming it was haunted – a superstition Tobias politely dismissed as “cranky wiring”. The truth was, the antique fixture pulsed with a strange energy, a faint hum that vibrated in his teeth even through his thick work gloves. 

Tobias wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead.  He glanced around Mrs. Henderson’s Victorian home, a rambling behemoth filled with dusty antiques and faded grandeur. Sunlight streamed through the leaded glass windows, casting long shadows that danced across the worn floral carpet. This house held secrets, Tobias could feel it – whispers in the drafts, sighs in the floorboards. He just hoped they weren't connected to that unsettling hum.
