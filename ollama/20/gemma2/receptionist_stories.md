The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune over Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s head as she meticulously straightened the stacks of brochures on the reception desk. Each one was aligned with military precision – travel guides to the left, local restaurant menus to the right, pamphlets about dental hygiene in the middle. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma for those who frequented the "Open Doors" clinic. Amelia had learned to ignore it.

Located on a dusty side street in a forgotten corner of Chicago, Open Doors was a haven for lost souls – people grappling with homelessness, addiction, or simply life’s relentless punches. Amelia was the first face they encountered, a beacon of calm amidst the storm. Her smile, though practiced, was genuine, and her voice, laced with Southern drawl despite growing up in this city's harsh concrete jungle, held an unexpected warmth.  

Behind the reception desk, she wasn’t just Amelia; she was the gatekeeper, the confidante, the temporary anchor for those who needed it most.
