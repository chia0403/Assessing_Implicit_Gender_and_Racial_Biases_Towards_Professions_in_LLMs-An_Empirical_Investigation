The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn linoleum floor of the guidance office. It was the kind of light that seemed to amplify every creak of the aging building and every sigh of frustration from the students shuffling through her door.  Eleanor leaned back in her chair, the springs protesting with a groan, and watched Amelia Peterson pace across the room, a tight knot of anxiety etched on her face. 

Amelia was the third student this morning to come bursting into Eleanor's office, eyes brimming with tears and a whirlwind of anxieties about college applications.  The air hung heavy with desperation, not just from Amelia but from all the other students facing their own unique hurdles - academic pressure, family expectations, crippling self-doubt. 

Eleanor sighed, smoothing down her tweed skirt. Another year, another wave of teenage angst crashing over her small office on the second floor of Westbridge High.  She wished she had a magic wand to alleviate their fears, but all she had was a well-worn copy of "The College Handbook," a listening ear, and a lifetime's worth of experience navigating the treacherous waters of adolescence.
