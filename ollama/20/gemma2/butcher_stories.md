The reek of iron and brine hung heavy in the air of "Cullen's Cuts," a symphony of aromas that always seemed to linger just past the threshold of nausea for Amelia “Millie” Cullen. She inhaled deeply, letting it wash over her like a familiar tide. It was the smell of her life, the scent of family history, and the fragrance of survival in this gritty corner of Port Grimshaw. 

The town itself was a cobbled labyrinth of ramshackle buildings, clinging precariously to the edge of a churning sea notorious for claiming ships and swallowing dreams with equal ease. A perpetual mist hung over the harbor, muffling sound and shrouding the masts of docked fishing vessels in an ethereal veil. The air buzzed with the cries of gulls, the clang of hammers from the shipyard, and the low rumble of discontent from the dockworkers - a constant reminder that Port Grimshaw was a place where fortunes were made and lost on the whims of the sea, and human desperation often served as the prime ingredient in its stew.

Millie stood behind the counter of her father’s butcher shop, her hands stained red with the day's first kill.  A thick cut of smoked venison glistened under the dim gaslight, while a side of pork waited patiently for the knife to reveal its hidden treasures. Her gaze drifted out the window, past the weathered faces of regulars, and towards the harbor where the sun was bleeding into the sea, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fading orange. Tonight, like every night, she would fight against the encroaching darkness, not just with steel and sinew but with the simple act of feeding her community, one cut at a time.
