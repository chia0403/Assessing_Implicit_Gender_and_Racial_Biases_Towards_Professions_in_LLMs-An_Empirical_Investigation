The Grand Astoria Hotel was an ocean liner of brick and glass, eternally tethered to the bustling heart of New York City. Its lobby, a symphony of marble and mahogany, echoed with the rhythmic click-clack of roller suitcases and the hushed murmur of conversations in languages both familiar and exotic.  

At the heart of this elegant chaos stood Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew, a bell hop whose uniform was as crisp and meticulously starched as his demeanor. He navigated the throngs of guests with the practiced ease of a seasoned conductor, eyes ever vigilant for luggage requiring his attention. Teddy wasn't just carrying bags; he was carrying stories. Every suitcase held a fragment of a life unfolding - a honeymooners' dream tucked in a worn steamer trunk, a journalist's research spilling from a battered duffel bag, an actress's carefully curated wardrobe hinting at the glamour awaiting her on stage. 


Teddy took pride in being an invisible thread woven through these narratives, a silent observer privy to the ebb and flow of human experience within the gilded cage of the Grand Astoria.
