The air hung thick with the scent of desperation and cheap cologne in the cavernous showroom. Rain lashed against the glass walls, mimicking the rhythm of Amelia Josephine Thorne's anxieties as she paced before a display of dusty, overpriced suits. It was closing time on a Friday in January â€“ a graveyard shift for any salesperson, let alone one whose name echoed with expectations far beyond her meager commission checks.

Amelia, a petite woman with eyes that held a flicker of defiance beneath their weariness, stared at the reflection in the mirrored wall. Her own suit, borrowed from her sister and two sizes too big, felt as heavy as her sales quota. It was going to be another week without hitting target, another week of wondering if this gig was truly the "stepping stone" her parents had promised it would be. But tonight, she wasn't just fighting for a bonus; she was fighting against the crushing weight of their disappointment. 


The rain intensified, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia. Tonight, something was going to change.
