The sun beat down on Silas Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's neck like an anvil, each drop of sweat clinging to his already grimy skin.  He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of dirt across his forehead. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 87, whipping up tiny tornadoes of gravel and loose debris that stung his exposed arms. The heat shimmered off the endless expanse of Montana plains, blurring the horizon into a hazy canvas of burnt orange and dusty blue.  Bart squinted at the line of cars creeping along in the distance, each one a metal speck against the vast emptiness. He shifted his weight from one tired leg to the other, the familiar ache in his knees reminding him of all the years spent bending over this unforgiving road.

Today, like every day, Bart's job was simple: patch potholes, clear debris, and keep the artery of Montana moving.  But out here, on this stretch of Highway 87 that snaked through nowhere, simple could quickly turn dangerous.  The solitude was a double-edged sword â€“ it allowed for quiet contemplation, but also bred an unsettling sense of isolation.  Today, Bart felt that isolation pressing in, heavier than the summer heat. Something wasn't right.
