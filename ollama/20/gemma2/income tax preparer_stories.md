The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Beatrice Amelia "Bea" Hawthorne's meticulously organized desk. Papers were stacked in neat pyramids, each labelled with colorful sticky notes: "W-2s," "1099s," "Deductions." The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - a potent mix Bea had grown accustomed to during tax season.  

Her office, tucked away in a beige strip mall on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa, was far from glamorous. But for Bea, it was a sanctuary. Here, amidst the labyrinthine world of forms and regulations, she found purpose. She thrived on untangling financial knots, finding loopholes, and delivering her clients their hard-earned refunds with a flourish. This year, though, something felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the usual chaos, a premonition that this tax season wouldn't be just another run of the mill grind.
