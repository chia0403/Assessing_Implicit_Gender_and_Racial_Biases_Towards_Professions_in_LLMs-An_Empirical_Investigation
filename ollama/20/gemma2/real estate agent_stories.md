The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of the Victorian mansion, casting long shadows that danced across the worn Persian rugs. Amelia “Amy” Blackwood adjusted her crisp white blouse, smoothing out a wrinkle with a practiced flick of her wrist. The air hung thick with the scent of stale perfume and forgotten dreams, a poignant reminder of the house's troubled past. 

Amy surveyed the scene: peeling wallpaper adorned with faded floral patterns, cobwebs clinging to ornate chandeliers, and a grand staircase leading up to shadowed balconies.  She sighed, feeling the weight of this listing settle on her shoulders like a lead apron. The Blackwood estate had been passed down through generations of the same family, each owner leaving their mark – or perhaps, their scars – upon its walls. It was Amy's job to convince someone that amidst the decay, there was still beauty waiting to be unearthed, potential whispering in the creaking floorboards.


The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sprawling mansion into an eerie twilight.  This was her chance to turn this house of whispers into a haven for new memories.
