The greasy spoon diner smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation, a scent Amelia "Amy" Harper had come to associate with her job as a probation officer in this forgotten corner of Nevada.  

She sat at the worn booth, nursing a lukewarm cup of tea and watching the dust motes dance in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy window. Across the table, Daniel “Danny” Reyes, a lanky young man with eyes that held too much weariness for his twenty years, fidgeted with his hands. This was Danny’s third time meeting her in this diner – his probation meetings always seemed to end up here. He claimed it was his favorite place, but Amy suspected he just couldn't afford anywhere else.

The Nevada desert stretched out behind the diner, a shimmering expanse of burnt orange and faded blue under the relentless sun.  A tumbleweed skittered across the cracked asphalt parking lot, a lone figure in the desolate landscape. This town, Dust Devil Junction, was a place where dreams went to die, and Amy found herself wondering if Danny’s were already dust.
