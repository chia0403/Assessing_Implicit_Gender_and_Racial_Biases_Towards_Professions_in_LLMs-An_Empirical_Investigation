The dew clung to Jedediah Bartholomew's boots like tiny, crystalline teeth as he pushed his rusty mower through the long grass. The air was thick with the scent of freshly cut clover and the muffled drone of bees lazily pollinating the vibrant sunflowers dotting the landscape. Jedediah, his calloused hands gripping the handlebars, squinted at the rising sun, its pale light filtering through the canopy of ancient oaks lining the perimeter of Evermore Cemetery.  

It was a quiet morning, even for a cemetery. The usual symphony of chirping birds and rustling leaves was absent, replaced by an unsettling stillness that pressed down on Jedediah like a shroud. This particular corner of Evermore, reserved for the forgotten and unclaimed, always had a different air about it â€“ a hushed melancholy that seemed to seep from the weathered headstones themselves. 


But today, something felt...off.
