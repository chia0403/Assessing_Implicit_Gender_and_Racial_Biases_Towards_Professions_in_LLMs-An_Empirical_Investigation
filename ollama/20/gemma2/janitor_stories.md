The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor across the dusty linoleum floor. Agnes Petunia Butterfield, or Aggie as she preferred, pushed her mop bucket down the deserted hallway of the Grand Majestic Theater. The air smelled faintly of popcorn and stale dreams, a scent that clung to the aging velvet curtains like a ghostly perfume. 

Outside, the city throbbed with life. Cars honked, sirens wailed, but inside the theater, only Aggie’s footsteps echoed in the cavernous space. She felt a pang of loneliness, as she often did at this hour. The grandeur of the once-vibrant stage, now draped in cobwebs and dust sheets, felt like a constant reminder of what had been lost. 


But tonight, something was different. A flicker of movement caught Aggie’s eye in the darkened wings.
