The morning sun, still shy behind the eastern hills, cast long shadows across Amelia Beatrice Lavender's meticulously pruned rose bushes. Dew clung to her faded denim overalls like tiny diamonds, sparkling under the growing light. The air, crisp with the promise of a spring day, carried the scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass.  Amelia tugged her straw hat lower on her brow, shielding her eyes as she surveyed the sprawling lawn of the Blackwood Manor estate. This wasn't just any garden; it was a symphony of nature, meticulously curated over decades by generations of Blackwoods. Amelia felt both a thrill and a weight of responsibility knowing she was tasked with preserving this legacy, blade by delicate blade. 


The manor itself loomed behind her, a majestic Victorian mansion, its dark silhouette framed against the sunrise.  Gargoyles perched on its turrets like silent sentinels, their stone eyes watching as Amelia began her day's work. A symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds provided the soundtrack to her labor, a soothing counterpoint to the rustle of shears and the clink of tools against the earth.
