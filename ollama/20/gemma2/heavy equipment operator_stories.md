The sun beat down on Amelia "Ace" Montgomery's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging her eyes as she wrestled with the controls of the 30-ton excavator.  Around her, dust billowed from the parched earth like a desert mirage. The Arizona landscape stretched out before her in a tapestry of ochre and burnt sienna, punctuated by skeletal Joshua trees clinging to life against the unforgiving heat. The air was thick with the drone of machinery and the gruff calls of construction foremen. Aceâ€™s hands were calloused, but nimble on the levers, guiding the excavator's massive bucket with practiced precision.  She was carving a new path through this dusty wasteland, shaping it into the future of Phoenix: a sprawling network of highways, factories, and concrete dreams. But beneath the relentless work, a gnawing discontent pulsed within Ace, whispering of a life beyond the dust and roar of progress. 


The setting is a construction site on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona during the summer months. The year is 2023.
