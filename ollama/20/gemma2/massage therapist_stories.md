The bell above the door tinkled its familiar melody as Amelia Rose Hawthorne ushered in another client into her haven of tranquility. Her small studio, nestled on a quiet side street in Portland, was a sanctuary from the city's bustling chaos.  

Warm, honeyed light filtered through sheer curtains, illuminating shelves lined with aromatherapy oils and Himalayan salt lamps. The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung in the air, mingling with the gentle hum of a Tibetan singing bowl. Amelia herself radiated calm; her auburn braid cascaded down her back, framing a face etched with kindness and focus. She moved with a practiced grace, guiding the newcomer towards the massage table draped in soft, lilac linens. 

"Welcome," Amelia said, her voice a soothing murmur. "Take your time settling in."


The client, a tall man with shoulders hunched like a weary pack mule, nodded silently, his eyes already closed as he sank into the plush surface. His tense muscles spoke volumes â€“ Amelia knew before he even uttered a word that this wasn't just another day at the office for him.
