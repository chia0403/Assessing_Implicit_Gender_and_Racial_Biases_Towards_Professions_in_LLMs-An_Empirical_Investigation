The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and hay, a familiar perfume that Dr. Elara Blackwood had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years at Willow Creek Animal Hospital. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air, and casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. A chorus of barks and meows echoed from various kennels lining the walls, punctuated by the occasional squawk of a distressed parrot. 

Elara sat perched on a stool behind the reception desk, her fingers tapping impatiently against the worn counter. The morning had been a whirlwind of emergencies: a frantic tabby with a tangled tail, a limping golden retriever suspected of having swallowed a rogue tennis ball, and an elderly beagle struggling to breathe. Now, she was waiting for Mrs. Hawthorne, a sweet, elderly woman who always brought her fluffy Persian, Mittens, in for his annual checkup. 

But today felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Elara's spine, like a sixth sense tingling with an impending storm.  


The setting is a rural animal hospital called Willow Creek Animal Hospital nestled on the outskirts of a small town, where the pace of life is slower and the residents deeply care for their animals.
