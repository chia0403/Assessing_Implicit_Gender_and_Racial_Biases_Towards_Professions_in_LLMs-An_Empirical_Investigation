The stale scent of ambition hung heavy in Bartholomew Alistair Finch's office, a miasma clinging to the plush carpet and expensive mahogany desk. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of Manhattan, but Bart saw only the green ticker tape scrolling across his multiple monitors, each line a tiny heartbeat of the market. He felt it pulsing through him, a current of potential, of risk, of dizzying possibility. 

His tailored suit, the silk tie a perfect shade of crimson against his pale skin, felt like armor in this gladiatorial arena he called work. Today was different though. The air crackled with anticipation, not just the usual nervous energy that permeated Wall Street. A rumor had been swirling all morning - whispers of a seismic shift, a game-changer about to upend everything they knew. 

Bart, ever the pragmatist, tried to ignore it, focusing on his spreadsheets and phone calls. But the tremor in the air grew stronger with each passing hour, pulling him closer to the edge of the unknown, like a moth drawn to a flickering flame.  


This was going to be a day Bart wouldn't soon forget.
