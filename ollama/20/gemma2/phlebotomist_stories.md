The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Celeste Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the antiseptic-scented room. It was 7:45 AM, just five minutes until her shift started in the hematology department of St. Jude’s Hospital.  A symphony of coughs and beeps emanated from the adjoining wards, a constant reminder of the fragility of life that Amy encountered every day.  

She ran a hand through her auburn hair, already feeling the familiar tension building in her shoulders. It was always like this – a strange blend of anticipation and dread. 

Amelia wasn't afraid of needles, not exactly. She’d mastered the art of drawing blood with precision and grace, becoming a beacon of calm in a room often filled with anxiety. But there was something about the sheer vulnerability of her patients that weighed on her, especially those facing their own mortality. Today, she had a particularly challenging case – Mr. Johnson, an octogenarian diagnosed with leukemia, who notoriously hated needles. 

Taking a deep breath, Amy adjusted her lilac scrubs and steeled herself for another day in the trenches. It wasn't glamorous, but it was her calling.  She saw herself as more than just a phlebotomist; she was a silent confidante, a steady hand in the storm of illness.  


What awaited Mr. Johnson and Amelia on this morning? That remained to be seen.
