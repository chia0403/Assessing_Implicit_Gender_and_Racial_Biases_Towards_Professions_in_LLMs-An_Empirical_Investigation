The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Kyros, sending sand stinging into Sergeant Aella Brighthammer’s visor. She squinted through the grit, scanning the endless horizon for any sign of movement. It was nearly dusk, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms against the rust-colored dunes. The sun, a bleeding wound on the western sky, promised little warmth as it dipped below the jagged teeth of the Crimson Peaks.

Aella tightened her grip on the hilt of her broadsword, its metal surface cold against her palm. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, quickly swallowed by the encroaching darkness. She was alone – the last sentinel at Outpost Seven, a solitary outpost nestled precariously on the edge of the Whisper Desert, where civilization met the untamed wilderness.  For months, she had patrolled these barren lands, guarding against raiders, rogue creatures, and worse – anything that dared to cross the border between the known world and the forbidden expanse beyond. Tonight, however, a creeping unease gnawed at her gut. The silence felt too heavy, too expectant. As if something watched from the shadows, waiting for its moment to strike.
