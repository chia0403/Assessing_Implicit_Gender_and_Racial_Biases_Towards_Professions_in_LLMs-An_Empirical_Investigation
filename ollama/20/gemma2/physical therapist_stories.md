The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of disinfectant. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Aurora Wellness Center, casting warm squares on the polished hardwood floor.  Within one of these squares, Amelia "Amy" Rosewater stretched her arms, a deep breath escaping her lips. Her reflection, framed by unruly auburn curls, stared back at her from the expansive mirror lining one wall.

Amy loved this time of day: the quiet hum of the waiting room, the sun's promise of warmth against the chill of the morning, and the anticipation of helping another person find relief, rediscovering movement. 

Today, she was expecting a new patient: Liam Carter, a young architect who had suffered a severe back injury in a construction accident. The details were still hazy - Amy preferred to focus on what she could do, not dwell on what had been done. She imagined Liam hunched over his desk, unable to lift his tools, unable to sketch the soaring structures that danced in his mind. 

As she straightened her navy scrubs, a sense of purpose settled over her. It was more than just treating injuries; it was about rebuilding lives, piece by aching piece.
