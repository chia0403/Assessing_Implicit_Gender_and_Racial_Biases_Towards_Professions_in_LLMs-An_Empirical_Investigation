The air hung thick with the scent of garlic and simmering tomato sauce, punctuated by the sharp tang of cleaning solution used liberally on sticky tables in "Luigi's Little Italy."  Emilia Rose Visconti, her name tag pinned precariously to her worn denim apron, fought to keep a smile plastered on her face as she weaved through the throngs of lunchtime patrons.

The restaurant was tucked away on a side street, just off the bustling main drag of Elmwood Avenue. Its faded red awning and chipped paint hinted at its age, but the warmth emanating from within drew in crowds seeking comfort food and an escape from the city's relentless pace. 


Emilia loved the rhythm of Luigi's.  The clatter of plates, the murmur of conversations, the laughter bubbling over like a pot of tomato sauce â€“ it was a symphony of chaos she knew by heart. Today, however, the music felt off-key. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as a new kind of tension crackled in the air, heavier than the usual lunchtime rush.
