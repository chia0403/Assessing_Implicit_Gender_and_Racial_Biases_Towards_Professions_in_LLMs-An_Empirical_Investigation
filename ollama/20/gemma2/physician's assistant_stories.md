The flickering neon sign outside cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Harperâ€™s tired face as she stepped out of the clinic. A biting wind whipped through the deserted parking lot, carrying with it the tang of salt and the distant roar of the ocean. The Coastal Community Clinic was tucked away on a desolate stretch of Highway 101, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching wilderness of the Oregon coast.  Amelia shivered, pulling her thin jacket tighter around herself. Another long day, another parade of patients with ailments ranging from chronic pain to seasonal depression. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was fulfilling. Helping those who often felt forgotten, lost in the vast expanse of this rugged coastline, gave Amelia a sense of purpose. Tonight, however, all she craved was a hot shower and a cup of tea that wouldn't taste like disinfectant.  As she reached for her keys, a flash of movement caught her eye. A pair of headlights cut through the darkness, slowly approaching from the north. The car pulled to a halt near the clinic's entrance, its engine sputtering like a dying beast. A tall figure emerged from the driver's seat, shrouded in shadow. Amelia hesitated, a prickle of unease running down her spine. She was alone out here, far from the comforting hum of the town just miles away.
