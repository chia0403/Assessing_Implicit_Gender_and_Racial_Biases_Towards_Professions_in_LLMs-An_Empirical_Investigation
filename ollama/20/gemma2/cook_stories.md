The air in "Chez Colette" hung heavy with the scent of simmering garlic, rosemary, and thyme, a symphony of aromas that usually brought Elara Beaumont, head chef and owner, immense satisfaction. Tonight, however, the fragrance felt oppressive, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  

Her little bistro, tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of Vieux Lyon, was usually bustling at this hour. The rhythmic clatter of plates, animated French chatter, and the gentle murmur of wine glasses clinking created a comforting hum. But tonight, the space remained stubbornly quiet, save for the low tick of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. A single candle flickered on a table near the window, casting long, dancing shadows across the empty chairs.

Elara pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the front door, peering out at the deserted street. A thin drizzle began to fall, mirroring the downpour of worry threatening to engulf her. Tonight was her anniversary gala, the one night each year when "Chez Colette" truly shone, a celebration of her culinary artistry and the love poured into every dish she crafted. Yet tonight, there were no reservations, no excited whispers of anticipation, only an unsettling emptiness that gnawed at her soul.
