The sun beat down on Jasper Flint's back, its heat shimmering off the dusty sandstone he was shaping. His worn leather apron, stained with years of chisel dust and sweat, offered little respite from the unforgiving glare.  He squinted, wiping his brow with a rough linen rag. A bead of sweat traced its way down his temple, disappearing into the stubble that shadowed his jawline. He adjusted his spectacles, pushing them further up his nose, and surveyed his work. 

Jasper Flint, born and raised in the shadow of Mount Cinder, had been carving stone since he could hold a chisel. His workshop, nestled on the dusty outskirts of Emberfall, was a testament to his craft. Rough-hewn tools hung from the walls, alongside shelves stacked with unfinished projects: sculptures frozen mid-flight, intricate mosaic tiles, and even a half-completed bust of the town's esteemed mayor, known for his surprisingly fleshy nose. The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and stone dust, a familiar comfort to Jasper. But today, a sense of unease lingered.  

Emberfall was on edge. Whispers of strange happenings in the nearby mountains had begun to circulate. Legends, dismissed as bedtime stories by most, were suddenly taken seriously. A chill settled over Jasper's heart as he thought about his son, Liam, who loved exploring the foothills.


The setting sun cast long shadows across the workshop, turning the dust motes into dancing specters. It was time to head home. As Jasper locked up, a distant cry echoed through the valley, sharp and unsettling. He hesitated, his hand hovering over the latch. Was it just a hawk? Or somethingâ€¦ else?  A shiver ran down his spine, and he pulled his collar tighter against the gathering dusk. Whatever was happening in those mountains, it was time to find out.
