The rusty pipes groaned like ancient bones as Thomas "Tom" Fitzwilliam wrestled with the stubborn wrench. Sweat beaded on his forehead, mingling with the grime that permanently clung to his overalls. He grunted, the sound lost in the cacophony of dripping faucets and clanging metal pipes echoing through Mrs. Peabody's Victorian kitchen. 

The air hung thick with the scent of lemon polish and mildew. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Tom scanned the chaotic scene: a half-finished jigsaw puzzle sprawled on the table, a stack of yellowed cookbooks precariously balanced on a chair, and a vase overflowing with wilting daffodils. 

He was in his element - surrounded by the intricate labyrinthine world of pipes, valves, and fixtures that dictated the flow of water in this crumbling, yet charming, old house.  Mrs. Peabody, perched on a stool at her kitchen counter, sipped tea and muttered under her breath about young people these days, never learning how to fix things properly. Tom knew she meant well; heâ€™d been coming here for years, fixing everything from leaky faucets to burst pipes, forming a peculiar bond with the eccentric old woman who seemed to treat him like a wayward grandson. 


But today, this was no ordinary plumbing emergency.  This time, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, and as Tom turned his attention back to the stubborn pipe, he swore he saw a flicker of movement in the reflection of the polished brass faucet - something that shouldn't be there.
