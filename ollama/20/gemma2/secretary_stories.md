The scent of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eloise Amelia Blackwood. Her fingers flew across the keys of her vintage typewriter, a rhythmic clacking punctuating the otherwise hushed office. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the glass panes of Mr. Henderson's sprawling penthouse suite. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of grey and yellow. Eloise paused, taking a sip of lukewarm tea from her chipped porcelain mug. She glanced at the clock – 5:30 pm. Just another five minutes before she could escape this paper-prison and dive into the chaotic beauty of the city's nightlife. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, a feeling she couldn’t quite place.  

Mr. Henderson, a reclusive billionaire with a reputation for eccentricities, hadn’t left his study all day. The faint hum of his antique radio drifted from behind the closed mahogany door, adding to the unsettling atmosphere. Eloise sighed, pushing away her unease. It was probably just the storm brewing outside.  Still, a shadow of doubt lingered in her mind, whispering that tonight would be anything but ordinary.
