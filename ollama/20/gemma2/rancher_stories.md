The dust devils danced across the cracked earth like phantoms, their swirling skirts kicking up gritty memories with each whirl.  They were a constant in this unforgiving landscape, as was the relentless sun that beat down on Jebediah "Jeb" McClain's weathered face. He squinted, his eyes narrowed against the glare reflecting off the vast expanse of parched land stretching before him - his land. The Double R Ranch, named for his father and grandfather, had been in the family for generations. It wasnâ€™t much anymore, a shadow of its former glory.

The drought had lingered for three years, stealing the moisture from the soil like a vampire draining its victim. Jeb's once vibrant herd had dwindled, leaving him with a handful of stubborn cattle that grazed listlessly on brittle stalks of dried grass. The air was thick with the silence of despair, punctuated only by the occasional mournful moo and the rustle of wind through dead leaves. 

Jeb ran a calloused hand over his jaw, feeling the rough stubble scratch against his skin. He needed rain. He needed it desperately.  But the sky remained an endless expanse of unforgiving blue, mocking him with its emptiness. The future stretched before him as bleak and barren as the land he called home.
