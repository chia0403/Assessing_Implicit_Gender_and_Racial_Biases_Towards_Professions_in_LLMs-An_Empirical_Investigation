The scent of pine needles and damp earth clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He breathed it in deeply as he sat perched on his usual stump, chewing on a stick of cinnamon gum and watching the sunrise paint the towering redwoods with hues of orange and gold. The forest floor was still shrouded in mist, its tendrils snaking between the colossal trees like ethereal serpents. 

Elias wasn't just watching the sunrise; he was feeling it.  It pulsed through him, a quiet hum of energy that resonated with the ancient lifeblood coursing through these giants. He knew each gnarled branch, every moss-covered knothole, every whisper of wind rustling through the leaves. This forest was his cathedral, its silence a symphony, and he, the humble acolyte. 

Today, though, there was a discordant note in the melody. A distant whirring sound, like a mechanical insect, shattered the peace. Elias squinted into the distance, his brow furrowing as the hum grew louder. He knew that sound. It meant change was coming, and it wasn't of the natural kind. 


The setting:  A sprawling old-growth redwood forest in Northern California, untouched for centuries until now.
