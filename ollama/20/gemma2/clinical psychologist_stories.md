The sterile white walls hummed with the faint thrum of fluorescent lights, casting an anemic glow over Dr. Eleanor Beaumont's office. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape outside into a watercolor mess. Eleanor sat behind her desk, its surface littered with scattered files and half-empty coffee mugs, her gaze fixed on the man seated across from her. 

He was young, maybe early twenties, dressed in clothes that were too big for him, swallowed by oversized jeans and a faded band t-shirt. His hands, clasped tightly together in his lap, trembled slightly.  His eyes, a deep pool of sadness framed by unruly dark hair, darted around the room, never settling for long on anything, least of all Eleanor. This was Liam Davies, her newest patient, referred to her by the local crisis hotline after a frantic call from his mother. He had been exhibiting erratic behavior, isolating himself from friends and family, and speaking of things that sent shivers down even Eleanor's spine.  

The rain intensified, drumming a relentless rhythm against the glass.  Eleanor leaned forward, her voice a calm murmur in the hushed room. 

"Liam, you mentioned feeling like...like something was wrong with your head?" she asked gently. He flinched at the sound of his own name, his eyes widening for a moment before darting away again. The story had begun.
