The scent of hay and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Willowbrook as she made her rounds through the stable. Dawn was just breaking, casting long shadows across the cobblestones as roosters crowed their morning greetings from atop weathered fences. The chill of the early hours still clung to the air, biting at Elara's cheeks despite the thick woolen cloak wrapped around her shoulders. 

Her gloved hands gently stroked the flank of a chestnut mare named Willow, coaxing a soft whinny in response. Willow was one of Elara’s favorites, a gentle giant with soulful eyes and a penchant for leaning into Elara's touch as if seeking solace.  Elara’s heart swelled with affection; each animal entrusted to her care held a unique place within the tapestry of their shared lives at Meadowbrook Farm. 


From tending to injured wild animals brought in by villagers to ensuring the well-being of the farm's livestock, Elara was responsible for every creature that called Meadowbrook home. It wasn't always easy – dealing with stubborn beasts, unexpected illnesses, and the occasional territorial dispute required patience and quick thinking – but Elara wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. This sanctuary, nestled on the outskirts of a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering forests, was her haven, her purpose.
