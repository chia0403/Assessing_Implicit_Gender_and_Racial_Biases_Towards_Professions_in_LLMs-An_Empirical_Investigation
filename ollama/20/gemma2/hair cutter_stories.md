The hum of the clippers was as familiar to Elara Blackwood as her own heartbeat. Every Tuesday afternoon, the small shop on Oak Street transformed into a symphony of buzzing shears and whirring vacuums. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating strands of auburn, chestnut, and platinum that drifted like fallen leaves on the worn wooden floor. Elara, her hands nimble and swift despite years spent wielding them, expertly sculpted another man's hair into a neat fade. 

Her clientele was a patchwork of regulars – the retired postman with his salt-and-pepper sideburns, the young artist with perpetually dyed locks, and Mrs. Henderson, whose daily gossip filled the shop as much as her perfume did. Elara knew them all by name, their faces etched in memory alongside the stories they shared. It was a quiet life, predictable yet comforting, like a well-worn armchair on a rainy day. But today, something felt different. A nervous energy crackled beneath the familiar hum of the clippers, a feeling that pulled at Elara’s senses like a stray thread unraveling a tapestry.  


A bell chimed, signaling the arrival of a new customer. A tall figure with a fedora casting shadows over their face stepped into the light. For the first time in years, Elara felt an unexpected thrill, a prickle of anticipation that had nothing to do with the familiar routine of hairdressing and everything to do with the unknown.
