Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Rosalind Anya Blackwood's dental practice, blurring the view of the quaint cobblestone street below. The rhythmic clatter mingled with the low hum of the sterilization unit, creating a soundtrack to Rosalind's mounting anxiety.

Her usual Tuesday afternoon calm had been shattered by an unexpected phone call – a summons from her estranged grandmother, Agnes Blackwood, the formidable matriarch of their sprawling family and keeper of countless secrets.  Agnes, who hadn't spoken to Rosalind in over five years, now lay ill, and desired Rosalind’s presence at Blackwood Manor, the imposing Victorian mansion overlooking the stormy Scottish coastline.

Rosalind stared at her reflection in the stainless steel instrument tray – a woman on the cusp of thirty, with hazel eyes that mirrored the turbulent skies outside, and auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid. Her grandmother's call had stirred long-dormant emotions: resentment for years of emotional distance, curiosity about the reason for this sudden reconciliation, and a nagging sense of foreboding.

As the phone continued to buzz with unanswered calls from worried patients rescheduled due to the storm, Rosalind knew she couldn't ignore her grandmother's plea. Gathering her courage, she grabbed her raincoat and braced herself for the journey into the heart of her family’s past.
