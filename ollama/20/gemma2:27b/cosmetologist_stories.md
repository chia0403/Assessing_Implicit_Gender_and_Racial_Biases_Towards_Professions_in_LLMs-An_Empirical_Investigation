The scent of lavender and almond hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of bleach and the warm sweetness of vanilla.  Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes adjusted the antique brass magnifying lamp above her client's head, its soft glow illuminating the delicate strands framing Mrs. Henderson's worried face. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the pastel-hued houses lining Elm Street, turning the sidewalks into shimmering mirages. But inside "Curl Up & Dye," a cozy salon tucked between a vintage bookstore and a boisterous pizzeria, time seemed to slow.

Esme, her dark hair pulled back in a neat braid, carefully maneuvered a brush through Mrs. Henderson's silvering curls. The woman's anxieties about her upcoming granddaughter's wedding had been pouring out all morning, interspersed with Esme's soothing reassurances and expert advice on the perfect shade of rose gold for the occasion.  

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, momentarily silencing Mrs. Henderson's worries. A tall figure with a shock of crimson hair and eyes that shimmered like emeralds stepped inside, disrupting the tranquil atmosphere.
