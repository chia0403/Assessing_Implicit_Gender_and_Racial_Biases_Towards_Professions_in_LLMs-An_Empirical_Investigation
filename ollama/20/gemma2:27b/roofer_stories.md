The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thornton's weathered neck, turning his skin the color of burnished copper. He gripped the edge of the slate shingle, sweat slicking his calloused palm, and wrestled it into place with practiced ease.  Below him, the sprawling Victorian mansion hummed with activity. Movers bustled in and out, lugging furniture past manicured rose bushes. Eli ignored them, his focus narrowed to the precise angle of the shingle, the rhythmic thudding of his hammer a steady counterpoint to the distant chatter. 

This wasn't just any roof; it was the crown jewel of Oakhaven Manor, a relic from a time when craftsmanship meant something more than speed and efficiency. Eli took pride in restoring its former glory, breathing new life into the weathered slates and aging timbers. He knew every nuance of this ancient roof, every dip and swell telling a silent story of storms weathered and seasons passed.

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease snaked down his spine as he paused to catch his breath.  From deep within the house, a muffled thud echoed, followed by an eerie silence. It was the kind of silence that swallowed sound and seemed to press against Eli's ears. He strained to listen, heart thumping a nervous tattoo against his ribs.
