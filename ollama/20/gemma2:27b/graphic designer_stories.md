Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elara Finch's cramped studio apartment, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in her chest.  The deadline for the "Save Our Wetlands" campaign was looming, a mere 48 hours away, and Elara was staring blankly at a screen filled with half-formed ideas and rejected concepts.

Today, even the comforting scent of her jasmine tea couldn't pierce the fog of anxiety clouding her mind. Elara, with her fiery red curls often escaping their haphazard bun and eyes that shone with both fierce determination and a hint of melancholy, needed a spark.  She needed something, anything, to ignite the dormant creativity within her.
