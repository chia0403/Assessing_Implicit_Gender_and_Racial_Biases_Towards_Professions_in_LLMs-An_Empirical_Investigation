Smoke snaked across the pre-dawn sky, twisting like a phantom serpent against the bruised purple and orange hues of sunrise.  Captain Elias "Eli" Thorne coughed, pulling his collar tighter against the biting wind that whipped through the alleyway behind the abandoned warehouse. Flames licked hungrily at the rusted corrugated iron roof, sending sparks swirling upwards like miniature fireworks.

The heat was already intense, radiating a tangible presence even from this distance. Eli instinctively adjusted his helmet, checking the straps before turning to his crew. "Alright folks," he barked, his voice gravelly with fatigue but firm with authority. "Let's get in there and do what we do best." 

The alley behind the derelict building reeked of charred wood and acrid smoke. Eli, a veteran firefighter with ten years under his belt, knew this smell well â€“ it was the smell of danger, the smell of adrenaline, the smell of a job to be done.
