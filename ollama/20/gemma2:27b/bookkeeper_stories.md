Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew Quill's cramped office, blurring the already faded lettering on his sign: "Quill & Co., Bookkeeping Services."  The rhythmic drumming was a counterpoint to the relentless tap-tap-tap of Bartholomew's fingers against the worn keys of his ancient adding machine. He squinted at the ledger before him, rows and columns of numbers swimming in the dim light cast by a single sputtering bulb. 

Bartholomew Quill wasn't a man given to whimsy or excitement.  He preferred the comforting predictability of debits and credits, the satisfying balance of accounts. Yet, tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the back of his neck, as though someone was watching him from the rain-swept alleyway outside. He shifted in his chair, trying to ignore the feeling. 

Just then, a sharp rap on the door echoed through the room. Bartholomew froze, his heart pounding an erratic tattoo against his ribs. He hadn't had a visitor in months, not since Mr. Grimshaw, the haberdasher, had come complaining about a discrepancy in his inventory.  Who could it be, at this late hour, braving the storm?
