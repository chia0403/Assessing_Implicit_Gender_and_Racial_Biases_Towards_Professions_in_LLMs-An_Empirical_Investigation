The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Elias Thorne's workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature fireflies. The scent of sawdust and pine hung heavy, mingled with the sweet aroma of beeswax polish. Outside, the town of Oakhaven bustled with the sounds of a summer evening: children's laughter echoing from the park across the street, the clatter of dishes from the diner next door, and the distant clang of the blacksmith hammering away at his forge.

Elias Thorne, a man whose hands were as calloused as ancient oak and whose eyes held the wisdom of centuries spent in wood, ran a weathered fingertip over the smooth surface of a rocking chair he was crafting. He'd been working on it for weeks, painstakingly carving intricate floral patterns into the armrests and seatback. It was destined for Mrs. Hawthorne, the kindly baker who always slipped him an extra cinnamon bun with his morning coffee.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping at the workshop door startled Elias from his reverie. He wiped his brow with a rag, leaving a streak of sawdust across his forehead, and made his way to the entrance. As he opened the door, a gust of wind swept in, carrying the scent of rain and the anxious face of young Samuel Finch, the town crier's apprentice.

"Mr. Thorne," Samuel gasped, his freckled face pale beneath his mop of red hair. "There's been a...a terrible accident at the mill."
