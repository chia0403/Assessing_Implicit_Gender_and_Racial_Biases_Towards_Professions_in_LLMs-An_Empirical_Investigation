The flickering fluorescent lights above cast long, skeletal shadows across Dr. Eliza Cavendish’s cluttered desk. Files overflowed from their folders, threatening to spill onto the worn carpet. Outside her office window, the relentless drizzle of Seattle seemed to mirror the storm brewing inside her.

Eliza traced a finger along a faded photograph – a young woman with haunting eyes and a smile tinged with sadness. This was Amelia Harding, the latest victim in a string of bizarre murders plaguing the city. Each crime scene held the same chilling signature: a single white rose placed meticulously upon the chest of the deceased.

The police were stumped, calling it the work of a copycat killer mimicking notorious unsolved cases. But Eliza, with her keen understanding of the criminal mind, suspected something deeper was at play. This wasn't mere imitation; there was an artistry, a macabre intentionality woven into each meticulously staged tableau. 


Eliza took a deep breath, steeling herself for the task ahead. She had to delve into the darkest corners of Amelia Harding’s life, sift through her memories and anxieties, hoping to find a clue that would lead them to the killer lurking in the shadows.
