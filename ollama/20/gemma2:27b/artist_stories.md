The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elara Finch's studio, each drop a tiny hammer blow to her already frayed nerves. She stared out the grimy window, watching the world dissolve into a watercolour blur of greys and blues. Her easel stood forlornly in the corner, its canvas blank, mocking her inability to translate the stormy landscape outside onto its surface. 

Elara's studio was a converted shipping container perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the churning North Sea. Inside, it was a chaotic symphony of paint tubes, crumpled sketches, and half-finished sculptures, all illuminated by a single bare bulb that cast long, eerie shadows across the floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil paints and turpentine, tinged with a hint of salt spray from the relentless waves crashing below.
