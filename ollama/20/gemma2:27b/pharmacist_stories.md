The bell above the pharmacy door chimed a mournful tune as Eliza Cavendish adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of "Cavendish Chemist" into an ethereal haze. It was a Tuesday evening in November, the kind where the air felt heavy with impending doom. Eliza sighed. Tuesdays were usually slow, but tonight even the cough syrup seemed to be gathering dust on the shelves. 

Eliza's grandfather, Harold Cavendish, had opened this pharmacy decades ago, its warm wood and comforting scent of lavender a haven for generations in their small coastal town. But lately, the footfall had dwindled. Chain pharmacies with bright lights and endless aisles of brightly coloured products were slowly stealing her customers away. Eliza worried about the future, about carrying on her grandfather's legacy amidst the relentless tide of modernity.

Just then, the door creaked open again, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow. A shiver ran down Eliza's spine. The late hour and the stormy night had already put her nerves on edge.
