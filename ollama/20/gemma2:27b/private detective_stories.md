Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside him. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows across the cluttered room. Empty coffee cups littered his desk, testament to a sleepless night spent poring over a case that had more twists and turns than a labyrinth. He was Elias Thorne, a private investigator who'd seen enough of the city's underbelly to know better than to trust appearances. 

A woman, shrouded in a rain-soaked trench coat, stood hesitantly in the doorway, her face obscured by the shadows. The bell above the door jingled mournfully as she stepped inside, bringing with her the scent of damp wool and something else...fear. Elias straightened in his chair, pushing away a file marked "The Crimson Canary" â€“ a case that was proving to be more trouble than it was worth. He looked at the woman, his gaze sharp and unwavering.

"You must be Ms. Evelyn Hawthorne," he said, his voice gravelly from years of cigarette smoke and late nights. "Please, have a seat."
