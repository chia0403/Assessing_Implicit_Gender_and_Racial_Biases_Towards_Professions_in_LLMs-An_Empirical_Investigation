Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, blurring the already dim streetlights outside into halos of sickly yellow. The air inside was thick with the scent of antiseptic and something faintly herbal, likely wafting from the simmering pot of rosemary tea Mrs. Petrovna always kept on the stove in the back room. Elias sighed, running a hand through his perpetually unkempt dark hair.

His clinic, nestled in the heart of Prague's Old Town, was usually bustling with patients seeking relief from ailments both mundane and mysterious. Tonight, however, it was eerily silent. Even the rats that occasionally scurried through the floorboards seemed to have retreated to their hidden nests, intimidated by the relentless downpour. Elias stared at the empty waiting room chairs, wondering if the storm had kept people home or if something else entirely was at play.

He'd been feeling a growing unease for days now, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck that he couldn't quite explain. It wasn't just the recent spate of strange illnesses plaguing the city – feverish dreams, hallucinations, sudden paralysis – but something deeper, a sense that the world was tilting on its axis. 

A sharp knock at the door startled him from his reverie. Elias straightened his rumpled coat and strode towards the entrance, curiosity warring with apprehension. Who would be out in this weather? And what secrets might they bring with them?
