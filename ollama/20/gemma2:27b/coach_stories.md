The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty baseball diamond. Sweat stung Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's eyes as she barked instructions to her ragtag team of ten-year-olds. The Wildcats were down by five runs in the bottom of the sixth inning, and the scoreboard glared like a judgemental eye. Amy chewed on her lip, scanning the field for any flicker of hope amongst her young charges. They were tired, discouraged, their shoulders slumped under the weight of repeated strikeouts and fumbled catches. 

This wasn't how Amy envisioned this season going. She had hoped to inspire these kids, to instill in them a love for the game that burned as bright as her own childhood passion. Instead, they seemed content to just go through the motions, their eyes glazed over with apathy. But Amy Cartwright refused to give up.

She strode onto the field, clapping her hands sharply to break the despondent silence. "Alright Wildcats," she said, her voice firm but encouraging. "We're not done yet. One run at a time, that's all we need."
