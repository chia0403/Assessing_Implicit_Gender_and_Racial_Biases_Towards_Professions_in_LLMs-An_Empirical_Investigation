Rain lashed against the arched windows of Professor Augustine Blackwood's study, blurring the already fading twilight into an impressionistic smear of grey and purple. The scent of damp earth and old parchment mingled in the air, a familiar perfume that had always comforted him. Yet tonight, even the comforting aroma couldn't dispel the knot of unease twisting in his gut.

His desk, usually a haven of organized chaos, was strewn with maps, dusty tomes, and cryptic notes scribbled on scraps of paper.  In the center lay an artifact – a tarnished silver amulet shaped like a snarling wolf's head – pulsing with an unsettling warmth despite its age. It had arrived anonymously that morning, tucked amongst the usual scholarly mail, and it felt...wrong.

Augustine Blackwood, renowned scholar of ancient lore and forgotten civilizations, was no stranger to unusual objects. But this amulet, with its eerie glow and unsettling energy, whispered of something far older, far darker than anything he'd encountered before.
