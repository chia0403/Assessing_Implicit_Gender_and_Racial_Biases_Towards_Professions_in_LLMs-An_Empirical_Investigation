The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Nail, drowning out the mournful blues melody spilling from the jukebox. Eliza "Ellie" Moreau hunched further into her threadbare coat, trying to ignore the chill that seeped through the flimsy fabric and into her bones. This ramshackle bar on the edge of Port Blossom, a once-thriving fishing town now clinging desperately to the frayed edges of its former glory, was as bleak as Ellie's current prospects.

Her notebook lay open on the sticky table, filled with scribbled notes about dwindling fish stocks, a looming factory closure, and whispers of a shadowy corporation buying up swathes of coastline. These were stories begging to be told, but finding an outlet for them seemed impossible. Newspapers were folding left and right, their editors more interested in clickbait headlines than hard-hitting investigative journalism.

Ellie sighed, taking a swig from her lukewarm beer. She needed a break, a chance to clear her head and maybe find some inspiration. But with rent due and the refrigerator emptier than a politician's promises, breaks were a luxury she couldn't afford. 

Suddenly, a gruff voice broke through the haze of cigarette smoke and stale beer. "Heard you're lookin' for a story, Miss Moreau."
