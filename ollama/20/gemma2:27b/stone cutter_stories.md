The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's hunched shoulders, turning his sweat-slicked linen shirt to parchment. He squinted through the dust motes dancing in the air, meticulously chipping away at the rough granite block before him. The rhythmic clang of his chisel against stone was a familiar lullaby, one he'd been hearing since childhood.  

Silas worked in the shadow of the Great Spire, its colossal peak piercing the cloudless sky. He was just one amongst dozens of other stone cutters toiling away in the sprawling quarry that sprawled at the foot of this ancient monument. The Spire, they said, held the secrets of their ancestors, its interior a labyrinth of forgotten chambers and cryptic carvings. But Silas had never been allowed inside. That privilege belonged to the Scribes, those who deciphered the ancient tongue etched into the stone, and the Guardians, whose duty it was to protect the Spire's mysteries from outsiders.

Today, however, felt different. A tremor ran through the granite as Silas struck a particularly stubborn chunk, sending shards scattering around him like glittering stars. The air itself seemed to hum with an unseen energy, a premonition of something momentous about to unfold.
