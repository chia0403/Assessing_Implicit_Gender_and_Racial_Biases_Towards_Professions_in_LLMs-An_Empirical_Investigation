The rusty scent of aviation fuel hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Captain Evangeline "Eve" Thorne.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky above the ramshackle airstrip in shades of apricot and rose, casting long shadows from the weathered hangars that dotted the perimeter. Eve, her flight suit rumpled but her eyes sharp and alert, ran a gloved hand over the battered fuselage of her aging Cessna 172.  

This wasn't the sleek, modern jet she'd once flown for a major airline. This was her life now – transporting supplies to remote villages nestled deep in the Amazon rainforest. It was a far cry from the glamorous international routes she used to navigate, but Eve had found solace in this rugged, unpredictable landscape and the people who depended on her deliveries. 


Today's cargo: medical supplies for a small indigenous community battling a sudden outbreak of malaria. The urgency weighed heavily on Eve, reminding her why she chose this path – to make a difference, even if it was one flight, one village at a time.
