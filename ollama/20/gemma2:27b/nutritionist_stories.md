Rain lashed against the windowpanes of The Nourished Seed, blurring the vibrant mural of overflowing fruit baskets that adorned the wall. Emilia Thorne sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear.

The quaint little café-cum-nutrition clinic was usually bustling with the aroma of freshly brewed herbal teas and the cheerful chatter of clients seeking Emilia's guidance. But today, the storm had kept everyone at bay, leaving Emilia alone with a stack of unopened recipe books and a growing sense of unease. It wasn’t just the gloomy weather; something felt off. A nagging intuition whispered in her ear, urging her to pay attention.

Emilia glanced at the clock. 2:47 pm. Her last appointment had cancelled earlier that morning, leaving an unexpected gap in her schedule.  She was about to start organizing her pantry when a sharp rap on the door startled her. Peeking through the frosted glass, she saw a figure silhouetted against the grey backdrop – tall, cloaked in a heavy raincoat, with a hood obscuring their face. Emilia hesitated for a moment, a shiver running down her spine. Who would be out in this weather?
