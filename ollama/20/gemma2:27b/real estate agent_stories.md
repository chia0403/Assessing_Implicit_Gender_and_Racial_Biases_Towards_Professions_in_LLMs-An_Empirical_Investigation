The relentless Miami sun beat down on Amelia Cortez's shoulders as she surveyed the pastel pink stucco house, its faded glory whispering tales of bygone glamour. Bougainvillea, bursting with magenta blooms, clawed at the crumbling facade, desperately clinging to life like Amelia herself. This listing was her last hope. Three months without a sale and the whispers in the office were starting to sound like pronouncements. "Amelia Cortez," they'd murmur behind cupped hands, "she can't close anything anymore. Remember that timeâ€¦"

The air hung thick with humidity, punctuated by the shrill cry of a nearby parrot and the distant rumble of thunder. Amelia knew a downpour was imminent, adding another layer of urgency to her task. This house, with its cracked mosaic tiles and overgrown pool, needed more than just a buyer; it needed someone who could see past the peeling paint and broken promises to the heart that still beat beneath.
