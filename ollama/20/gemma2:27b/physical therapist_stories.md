Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Rose Cartwright's clinic, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into watercolor washes. The cozy space, usually filled with the rhythmic squeak of exercise machines and the encouraging murmur of Amelia's voice, was eerily quiet this afternoon. Only the ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence, each tick a reminder of the minutes slipping by.

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, stared out at the stormy landscape, anxiety gnawing at her stomach. Her newest patient, Mr. Elias Thorne, was due any minute for his first session following a severe skiing accident. He was a renowned novelist, and Amelia knew the pressure she faced to help him regain mobility â€“ both physical and mental. 

The bell above the door chimed softly, jolting Amelia from her thoughts. A tall figure, shrouded in a dark wool coat, stood hesitantly in the doorway, his face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat. This was Mr. Thorne.
