Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, mirroring the turmoil in Amelia Grace Hawthorne's chest. The sterile scent of disinfectant couldn't mask the underlying odor of despair that seemed to cling to the worn linoleum floors and faded floral wallpaper.  Amelia gripped the clipboard tighter, her knuckles bone-white against the weathered plastic. Room 212 held a new patient - a young woman named Clara who had suffered a debilitating stroke.

Amelia, known for her unwavering optimism and gentle touch, felt a familiar pang of anxiety. Every new patient was a fresh challenge, a puzzle to be solved with empathy, patience, and the right exercises. But Clara's case felt different, heavier somehow. The reports spoke of a vibrant artist, her world now confined to a bedridden existence. Could Amelia help reignite the spark in Clara's eyes, guide her back to the canvas she loved so dearly?
