Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-colored water. The air inside the cramped radio shack was thick with the smell of ozone and burnt solder. Elias Blackwood, his forehead slick with sweat despite the chill, squinted at the tangled mess of wires before him. He gripped the soldering iron tighter, its heat radiating through the calloused pads of his fingers. Outside, thunder rumbled like a leviathan stirring in the depths, momentarily drowning out the static hiss emanating from the battered receiver on his workbench.

Elias wasn't fazed by the storm raging outside. Storms were commonplace in this isolated fishing village nestled on the craggy shores of Newfoundland. He was used to the howling wind and crashing waves that often threatened to swallow the ramshackle houses perched precariously on the cliffs. But tonight, Elias had a different storm brewing inside him â€“ a storm of frustration and mounting anxiety. The radio silence from his father's fishing trawler, "The Mariner's Daughter," was stretching into its third day, and every tick of the clock felt like a hammer blow to his heart. 

He needed to fix this radio, and fast. His father's life depended on it.
