The pungent smell of peroxide hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of jasmine from Elodie Moreau's diffuser. It was Wednesday afternoon, typically Elodie's busiest day, but the salon felt strangely empty. Only Mrs. Delacroix, her silver curls permed to perfection, occupied one of the plush velvet chairs, flipping through a well-worn copy of "Elle" magazine.

Elodie surveyed the scene with a sigh. The usual cacophony of gossip and hairdryers was replaced by an unsettling silence. Even Coco Chanel, Elodie's sassy Siamese cat who usually held court on the reception desk, seemed subdued, her emerald eyes narrowed in contemplation.  Something felt off, a prickling sensation at the back of Elodie's neck that whispered of trouble brewing. 


The setting is: **Elodie's Hair Salon**, a charming boutique tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the heart of Paris. The salon is decorated with vintage posters of iconic French actresses and an eclectic mix of antique furniture, giving it a warm and inviting atmosphere.
