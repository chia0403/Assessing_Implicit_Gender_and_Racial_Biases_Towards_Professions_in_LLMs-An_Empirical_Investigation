The biting wind whipped through the crumbling stone archway, carrying with it the tang of salt from the sea and the acrid scent of burning oil.  Elara Thorne clutched her woolen cloak tighter around her shoulders, her gloved fingers numb despite the thick leather. Above, a sliver of moon peeked through the bruised sky, casting long, unsettling shadows across the cobblestone courtyard.

The once-grand castle now stood as a skeletal reminder of its former glory, its towers crumbling and overgrown with ivy. Cracks snaked through the walls like jagged veins, whispering tales of forgotten battles and fading grandeur. 

Elara shifted her weight on her feet, her boots crunching on the frost-covered stones. For five years, she had been tasked with guarding this decaying relic, a penance for a crime she swore she didn't commit. Five years of solitude, broken only by the howling wind and the occasional scuttling rat. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine, whispering warnings in the icy breeze.
