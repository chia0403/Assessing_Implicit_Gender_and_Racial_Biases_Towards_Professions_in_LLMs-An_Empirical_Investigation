Rain hammered against the warped glass pane above the bar, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. The neon "Open" sign flickered nervously, casting long shadows across Silas Montgomery's worn mahogany counter. He idly polished a dusty shot glass, his reflection staring back – weary eyes framed by salt-and-pepper hair, a face etched with lines that spoke of too many late nights and too much heartache.

The Salty Siren wasn't exactly bustling tonight. In fact, it was Silas and one lone customer huddled against the storm: a woman cloaked in shadows at the far end of the bar, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. She nursed a single glass of bourbon, swirling the amber liquid with a thoughtful frown.

Silas knew better than to pry. The Salty Siren was a haven for secrets, and he, its keeper. Every creak of the floorboards, every murmur of conversation carried the weight of unspoken stories. But tonight, something in the air felt different – charged, electric. The silence between them wasn't empty; it crackled with anticipation, as though the storm raging outside mirrored a tempest brewing within the woman herself. 

He leaned against the counter, his gaze lingering on her gloved hand gripping the glass. A glint of silver caught his eye - a ring adorned with an unusual crest, an emblem he couldn't quite place.  And then, the woman spoke, her voice low and husky, like velvet rubbed raw. "Mr. Montgomery," she said, her eyes finally meeting his, "I believe we have business to discuss."
