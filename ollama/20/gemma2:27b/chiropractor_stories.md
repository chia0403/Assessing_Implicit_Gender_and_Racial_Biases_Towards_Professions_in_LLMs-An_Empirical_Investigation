The flickering neon sign outside cast an oily sheen across Dr. Elias Thorne's tired face. "Thorne Chiropractic: Align Yourself With Wellness" it proclaimed in bright purple and green letters – colours that Elias secretly found nauseating.  Rain lashed against the windows of his small office, nestled on a side street choked with potholes and overflowing trash bins. It was the kind of night that made you want to curl up under a heavy blanket and forget about the world, but Elias had patients to see.

Tonight, however, he wasn't anticipating the usual parade of desk jockeys with crick necks and weekend warriors nursing sprained ankles. He'd received a call earlier, cryptic and urgent, from someone who simply identified themselves as "The Raven." The Raven claimed to have information vital to Elias's well-being and insisted on meeting at precisely 8:00 pm.  Elias glanced at the clock – 7:55.

He smoothed down his rumpled shirt and straightened the framed diplomas on his wall, feeling a prickle of unease he couldn't quite explain. What kind of information could someone have about a chiropractor like him? He was, after all, just a man who helped people feel a little better, one adjustment at a time.
