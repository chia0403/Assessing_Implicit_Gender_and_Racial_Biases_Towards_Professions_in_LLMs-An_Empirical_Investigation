The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the conveyor belt littered with half-eaten candy bars and dented cans of soup. The smell of stale popcorn and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of desperation that clung to every customer who shuffled through her lane at the Save-Rite Supermart. It was Tuesday afternoon, which meant the post-lunch rush had subsided, leaving Evelyn alone with the ghosts of overflowing shopping carts and crumpled coupons.

She sighed, tapping a perfectly manicured fingernail against the chipped plastic surface of her register. Five more hours until she could escape this fluorescent purgatory and crawl into bed with a trashy romance novel and a pint of overpriced ice cream.  

Just then, the automatic doors hissed open, admitting a gust of wind that ruffled Evelyn's carefully coiffed hair and carried with it the scent of rain-soaked asphalt and something else...something unfamiliar, almost exotic.
