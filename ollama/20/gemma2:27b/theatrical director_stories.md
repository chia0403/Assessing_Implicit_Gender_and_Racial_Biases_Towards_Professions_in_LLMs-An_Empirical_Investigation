The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams in the cavernous Grand Blackwood Theatre.  Moonlight spilled through the grimy skylight, illuminating motes dancing above the rows of dusty velvet seats.  Seraphina Thorne, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun that defied the chaos around her, paced across the stage, a frown etched on her usually animated face.

Grand Blackwood, once a jewel of the city's theatre scene, had fallen into disrepair. The ornate plasterwork was cracked and peeling, the stage floor creaked ominously underfoot, and cobwebs draped the gilded balconies like spectral shrouds.  Yet, Seraphina saw past the decay. She envisioned the vibrant tapestry of light and shadow, the echoing applause of a full house, the raw power of human emotion unleashed on this stage.
