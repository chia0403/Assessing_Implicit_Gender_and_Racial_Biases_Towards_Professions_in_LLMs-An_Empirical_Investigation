The bell above the door tinkled merrily, announcing the arrival of another customer into Primrose & Bloom. Eleanor Ainsworth glanced up from her painstaking arrangement of lilies, their creamy white petals tinged with the faintest blush of pink. A gust of wind rattled the windowpane, sending autumn leaves swirling across the cobblestone street outside.

Eleanor's shop, nestled in a quaint corner of Edinburgh's Old Town, was a haven of fragrance and color. Walls lined with vintage botanical prints overlooked overflowing baskets brimming with roses, peonies, and hydrangeas. The air hummed with the quiet symphony of buzzing bees trapped within glass terrariums, their honey-sweet scent mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly tilled soil from Eleanor's rooftop garden.  

But today, a chill hung in the air heavier than the approaching November drizzle. News of the sudden illness spreading through the city had reached even this secluded corner. Fear was as palpable as the scent of lilies.
