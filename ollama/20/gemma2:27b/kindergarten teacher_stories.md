The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Beatrice Finchley.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows of her classroom, illuminating dust motes dancing above rows of brightly colored tables and chairs, each one meticulously labelled with a hand-drawn picture. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of cicadas punctuated the lazy hum of summer. It was the first day back after a long break, and Eleanor's kindergarten class was abuzz with nervous energy. 

Twenty pairs of wide, curious eyes followed her every move as she unpacked boxes overflowing with fresh supplies - construction paper in shades brighter than rainbows, googly eyes begging to be stuck onto everything, and enough glitter to rival a disco ball.  Eleanor smiled warmly, her heart brimming with the familiar anticipation of a new school year. This was her passion, this space filled with boundless imagination and the sweet, sticky fingerprints of tiny humans on their way to discovering the world.
