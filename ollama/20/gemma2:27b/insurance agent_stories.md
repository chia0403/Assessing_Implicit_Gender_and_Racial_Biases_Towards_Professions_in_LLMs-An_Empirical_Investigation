Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the frantic drumming of his fingers on the mahogany desk. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Finch & Featherstone: Insurance You Can Trust," cast an unsettling green glow across the room, highlighting the stacks of unpaid claims and overdue policy renewals precariously balanced on his desk. 

Alistair Finch, a man whose neatly combed silver hair couldn't quite conceal the worry lines etched into his forehead, sighed deeply. He'd been in this business for thirty years, weathering every storm imaginable â€“ from floods to fires to freak hailstorms that decimated entire towns. But this one felt different. This current economic downturn was sucking the life out of Finch & Featherstone, leaving Alistair clinging to the tattered threads of his once-thriving agency. 


Today, he had a meeting with Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, an elderly widow whose husband's life insurance policy was nearing its end. She was desperate for the payout, relying on it to cover mounting medical bills and keep a roof over her head. Alistair knew he couldn't offer her much hope. The company they used, once a stalwart in the industry, had recently filed for bankruptcy, leaving countless clients like Mrs. Davenport hanging by a thread.
