The rain hammered against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the relentless hammering in Amelia Rose Callahan's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile sheen on the worn linoleum floors and echoing the anxiety buzzing in her veins. Tonight was no ordinary night shift. Tonight, she was responsible for Room 304 - the isolation ward holding young Michael Sullivan, a boy who had been infected with a rare, aggressive virus.

Amelia tugged at her surgical mask, its thin fabric offering little comfort against the fear that clung to her like a second skin. This wasn't just another case of influenza or pneumonia. This was something unknown, something potentially deadly. 


Let me know if you'd like me to continue the story! I can develop the scene further, introduce other characters, and explore Amelia's motivations and anxieties.
