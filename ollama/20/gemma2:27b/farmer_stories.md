The sun, already a bruised peach on the horizon, cast long shadows across Silas Blackwood's fields. The air was thick with the damp smell of earth and ripening barley, punctuated by the insistent chirping of crickets hidden in the tall grass. Silas, his face weathered like ancient granite, surveyed his land with a critical eye.  

He tugged at the collar of his worn denim shirt, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The harvest was upon him, a time of both promise and peril. A good yield would mean enough to buy new seed for next season, perhaps even fix that leaky roof on the barn. But if the rains came too early, or the blight crept into the barleyâ€¦ Silas pushed the thought away. He had weathered storms before; he would weather this one too.

His calloused hand tightened around the worn wooden handle of his hoe as he turned towards the farmhouse, its silhouette outlined against the fading twilight. The smell of woodsmoke and roasting potatoes drifted from the chimney, a comforting aroma that promised a warm meal and a few hours' rest before the long day ahead began anew.
