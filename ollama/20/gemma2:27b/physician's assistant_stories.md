The relentless desert sun beat down on the dusty canvas tent, turning the interior into a sweltering sauna. Elara Khan, PA-C, wiped the sweat from her brow with a grimy rag, cursing herself for forgetting the sunscreen yet again. Outside, the ceaseless drone of cicadas punctuated the occasional cough and groan from the makeshift infirmary she'd set up in the heart of the refugee camp.

Elara scanned the rows of cots, each occupied by weary faces etched with hardship and longing. A young boy clutched his emaciated chest, his breaths shallow and pained. An elderly woman lay still, her eyes vacant, a fever burning bright on her forehead. Elara's heart ached for them all, for the unseen wounds that mirrored the physical ones. These weren't just patients; they were survivors carrying the weight of war, displacement, and unimaginable loss.

This wasn't the sterile environment of the city hospital she'd trained in. This was raw, unforgiving reality. The sandstorm last week had ravaged their already meager supplies, leaving Elara with little more than bandages, painkillers, and her unwavering determination.  But even as exhaustion gnawed at her bones and doubt whispered insidious thoughts, Elara knew she couldn't give up. These people needed her. They were counting on her.
