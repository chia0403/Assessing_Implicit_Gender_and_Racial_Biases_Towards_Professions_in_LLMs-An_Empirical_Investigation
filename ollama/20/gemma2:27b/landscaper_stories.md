The humid Florida air hung thick, clinging to Elias Finch like a second skin as he wrestled with a stubborn hibiscus bush. Sweat beaded on his brow and stung his eyes, blurring the already vibrant colors of the tropical garden around him. He could smell the salt tang of the nearby ocean mingling with the sweet scent of jasmine, a heady combination that usually calmed him. Today, however, Elias felt anything but calm.

His client, Mrs. Delacroix, was known for her exacting standards and icy demeanor. The hibiscus bush, which he'd carefully pruned just last week, had apparently offended her sensibilities by drooping slightly in the afternoon sun. Now, Elias found himself re-shaping it under her watchful gaze, each snip of his shears accompanied by a pointed sigh from Mrs. Delacroix.  He glanced up at the ornate Victorian mansion looming behind her, its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispering tales of faded glory. This wasn't just any landscaping job; it was an attempt to restore a piece of Palm Beach history, one hibiscus bush at a time.

Elias wondered if heâ€™d bitten off more than he could chew.
