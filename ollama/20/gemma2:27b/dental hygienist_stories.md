Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Nguyen's Dental Practice, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolour. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne sighed, idly tracing the outline of a chipped molar on the patient chart in front of her.

The rhythmic tapping of the cleaning tool seemed to echo the drumming rain, a monotonous counterpoint to the hushed murmurings coming from Dr. Nguyen's office down the hall. It was Tuesday afternoon, and the usual flurry of patients had dwindled to a trickle thanks to the storm raging outside. Eleanor usually relished these quiet moments, a chance to catch her breath between appointments, but today a restlessness gnawed at her.

She glanced at the clock: 3:47 pm. Only twenty-three minutes until closing time.  Eleanor's gaze drifted back to the chart, her mind wandering from molars to matters far more intriguing. Lately, she'd been plagued by a recurring dream â€“ a vivid tapestry of cobblestone streets and ornate buildings bathed in warm sunlight. In this dreamscape, Eleanor wasn't a dental hygienist but an adventurer, exploring hidden alleyways and uncovering forgotten treasures.


The sudden clattering of instruments from Dr. Nguyen's office snapped her back to reality. Another patient, no doubt arriving just before the storm worsened. Eleanor straightened her uniform, bracing herself for another hour of scaling and polishing, all while yearning for the adventures that awaited her only in dreams.
