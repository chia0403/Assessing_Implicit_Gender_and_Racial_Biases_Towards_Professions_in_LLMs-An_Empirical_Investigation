The recycled air hummed a tired tune as Elara Esperanza Reyes adjusted her crimson scarf, a splash of colour against the sterile white of the cabin. Outside, the world was a blur of clouds, illuminated by the pale sliver of a dawn moon.  Elara inhaled deeply, trying to conjure the scent of jasmine and fresh bread from her childhood in Manila instead of the faint metallic tang that permeated every inch of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

It was supposed to be a routine transatlantic flight – Tokyo to London – but Elara could already feel the prickle of unease crawling up her spine. Something felt off, like an unspoken tension humming beneath the surface of polite smiles and pre-flight chatter. Perhaps it was the unusually empty seats in business class, or the way the pilot's voice had faltered slightly during the safety announcement. Whatever it was, Elara knew one thing: this wasn't going to be a boring flight.
