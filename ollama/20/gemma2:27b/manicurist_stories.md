The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender, swirling around Elara Bellweather like an invisible perfume. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Elara's Elegance," painting shimmering squares on the worn floral rug.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled down Clark Street, but inside, all was calm, punctuated by the gentle clinking of nail polish bottles and the rhythmic rasp of Elara's file against a client's acrylic tips.

Today, however, the usual tranquility was disturbed. A man sat in her oversized, velvet armchair â€“ an anomaly amidst the sea of manicured hands and gossip magazines. He fidgeted nervously, his expensive leather shoes tapping against the floorboards. His name was Julian Thorne, and he wasn't here for a manicure.
