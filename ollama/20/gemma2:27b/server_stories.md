The clatter of plates, the sizzle of fajitas, and the incessant murmur of hungry patrons formed the familiar symphony of El Fuego Grill. Emilia Reyes navigated the crowded floor with practiced ease, her tray laden with steaming burritos and frosty margaritas. The air hung thick with the scent of cumin, cilantro, and sizzling onions, a heady aroma that both comforted and exhausted her after a long shift. Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz felt different. A strange tension thrummed beneath the surface, making Emilia's already-aching feet feel even heavier.

It wasn't just the overflowing reservations or the unusually boisterous crowd; it was something else entirely, an unseen force that prickled at her skin. As she weaved through tables laden with half-eaten plates and overflowing baskets of chips, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that someone – or something – was watching her.
