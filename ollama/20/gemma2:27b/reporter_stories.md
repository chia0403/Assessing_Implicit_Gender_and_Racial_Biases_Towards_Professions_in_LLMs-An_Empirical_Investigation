Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug café, a cacophony that mirrored the storm brewing in Elara Finch's gut.  She hunched over a lukewarm coffee, the chipped ceramic mug warming her fingers more than the bitter brew inside. Through the grimy windowpane, neon reflections from the liquor store across the street danced with the shadows cast by the flickering streetlight. This wasn't the glamorous world of investigative journalism Elara had dreamt of as a kid poring over dusty newspapers in her grandfather's attic.

She was stuck in Dust Devil, Arizona, population 2,347 (and dwindling), chasing leads on a story that smelled fishier than last week's tuna casserole at The Rusty Mug. The town council had been suspiciously quiet about the sudden closure of the copper mine – Dust Devil's only source of income – and Elara was determined to uncover what they were hiding.  

But something felt off.  The locals, normally quick with gossip and gripes, clammed up when she mentioned the mine. Their eyes darted away, their smiles strained. Even Old Man Riley, who usually regaled her with tales of UFO sightings over a plate of greasy fries, just grunted and mumbled about needing to "fix his fence".  Elara knew this town had secrets, but what were they, and why were they so fiercely guarded?
