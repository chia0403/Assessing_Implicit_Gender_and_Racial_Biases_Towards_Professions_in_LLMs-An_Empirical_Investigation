The Parisian air hung thick with exhaust fumes and the scent of Gauloises cigarettes as Antoine Moreau surveyed the chaos unfolding on the cobblestone street. Camera cranes groaned, electricians wrestled with tangled cords, and extras in ill-fitting 18th-century garb shuffled impatiently beneath the glare of hot studio lights. Antoine ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, feeling the familiar tension knotting in his shoulders.

This was supposed to be a simple scene â€“ a carriage chase through the winding streets of pre-revolutionary Paris. But nothing ever went according to plan on Antoine's sets. Today's challenge: a runaway horse with a penchant for biting extras and an inexplicable fear of cobblestones.


The setting: **A narrow, cobblestone street in the heart of Montmartre, Paris. Sunlight streams through gaps in centuries-old buildings, casting long shadows across the scene.**
