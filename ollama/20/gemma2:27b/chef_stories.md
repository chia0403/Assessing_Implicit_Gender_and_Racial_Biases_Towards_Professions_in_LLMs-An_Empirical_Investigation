The scent of caramelized onions hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of lemon zest and the earthy warmth of roasting garlic.  Esme Evangeline Dubois, her brow furrowed in concentration, stirred a bubbling pot of creamy tomato basil soup.  Her small restaurant, "Le Petit Coq," nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Montmartre, Paris, hummed with activity. 

The late afternoon sun streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. The clatter of cutlery mingled with the lively chatter of patrons and the rhythmic thumping of Esme's cleaver against the butcher block. Tonight was a full house, a testament to her culinary artistry and the warm, welcoming atmosphere she cultivated within Le Petit Coq's walls. 


But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Esme's spine as she glanced at the clock, its hands approaching six o'clock.  A shadow seemed to have fallen over her usually bright kitchen, a premonition she couldn't quite place.  And then, a sharp rap on the back door sent a shiver through her.
