Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Elias Finch's cramped apartment, mirroring the storm brewing within him. Lines of code swam before his tired eyes, each one a testament to the endless hours he'd poured into this project. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale ramen, remnants of a programmer's solitary existence. Elias, a gaunt man with unruly dark hair perpetually threatening to spill over his forehead, ran a hand through it in frustration. His fingers danced across the keyboard, attempting to untangle a stubborn bug that threatened to derail weeks of work. Outside, the city groaned under the weight of the downpour, its neon lights reflecting off the slick asphalt like fractured jewels. But Elias barely registered the urban symphony; his world had shrunk to the flickering glow of his monitor and the relentless ticking of the clock.

Tonight, he needed a breakthrough. Tonight, Project Nightingale needed to take flight.
