Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew Quince's tiny office, blurring the already-faded cityscape beyond. The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, a counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tap of Bartholomew's fingers on his ancient adding machine. Stacks of invoices towered precariously around him, their edges softened by years of neglect and dust. Bartholomew, a man whose appearance mirrored the drabness of his surroundings – greying hair perpetually slicked back, a rumpled suit that had seen better decades, and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose – sighed deeply. The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air. Tonight, he knew, was going to be a long one.

The clock ticked past midnight, its metallic clang echoing through the silent room. Bartholomew rubbed his weary eyes, the numbers swimming before him. He had been poring over the books for "Chez Antoinette," a struggling French bistro down the street, for hours. Their owner, a fiery redhead named Madame Dubois, was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Bartholomew was her only hope.  He needed to find some way to balance their books, to conjure order from chaos, before it was too late.
