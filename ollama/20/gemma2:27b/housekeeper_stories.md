Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Blackwood Manor, each drop like a tiny hammer blow against the already decaying glass. Agatha Thistlewick, her silver braid snagged on a loose thread of her worn woolen shawl, trudged up the crumbling stone steps, wishing she’d brought her umbrella.  The manor loomed above her, a hulking shadow against the bruised twilight sky. Its once-proud facade was now shrouded in ivy and neglect, the windows like vacant eyes staring out at the stormy night. Agatha sighed. Another week, another mountain of dust bunnies and forgotten memories to conquer within those cold, echoing walls. She wasn't sure what kept her coming back – perhaps it was the meager wage, or maybe a perverse curiosity about the secrets whispered to be hidden within Blackwood Manor’s depths. Whatever the reason, Agatha Thistlewick was its sole caretaker, a solitary sentinel against the encroaching decay.
