The sun beat down on Silas "Mac" McAlister's neck as he wrestled the excavator arm into position. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy outline of the Nevada desert stretching beyond the construction site. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the futile efforts to keep the air clean within his cab. 

Mac grunted, maneuvering the massive claw with practiced ease. He'd been operating heavy machinery since he was old enough to reach the pedals, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. This project, however, was different. It wasn't just another highway expansion or dam construction.  This time, they were excavating a vast, empty plain rumored to hold secrets older than humanity itself. 

The air crackled with an unseen energy, making the hairs on Mac's arms stand on end. Local legends spoke of buried cities and forgotten gods, whispers he'd always dismissed as folklore. Yet, standing amidst the raw earth, watching the excavator claw unearth layers of time, a flicker of unease ignited within him.

What exactly were they digging up?
