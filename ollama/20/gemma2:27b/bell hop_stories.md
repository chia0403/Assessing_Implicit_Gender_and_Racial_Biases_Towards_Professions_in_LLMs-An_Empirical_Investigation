The Grand Blackwood Hotel stood like a hulking Victorian giant against the stormy London sky. Rain lashed against its stained-glass windows, momentarily obscuring the gaslights that flickered on the cobbled street below. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax and damp wool. A fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the polished marble floor of the grand lobby.

Bartholomew "Bart" Quince, a bellhop with unruly ginger hair and freckles splashed across his nose like spilled ink, braced himself against the wind as he wrestled a trunk through the double doors. He was barely five foot six, but what Bart lacked in height he made up for in tenacity. 

A wave of icy air followed him in, carrying the scent of ozone and wet pavement.  He set the trunk down with a grunt, wincing as his back protested the weight. Bart glanced at the ornate clock above the reception desk; it was nearly midnight. Another long shift done. He just hoped tonight wouldn't involve any more demanding guests like Mrs. Featherstonehaugh, who insisted on her luggage being carried up seven flights of stairs, "with utmost care for my embroidered linens!" 

As he straightened up to face a new arrival, Bart couldn't help but feel a prickle of curiosity. The newcomer was shrouded in a long black coat and hat, their face obscured by shadows. Bart extended a hand towards the figure, his smile tinged with polite exhaustion. "Welcome to the Grand Blackwood, sir. May I assist you with your luggage?"
