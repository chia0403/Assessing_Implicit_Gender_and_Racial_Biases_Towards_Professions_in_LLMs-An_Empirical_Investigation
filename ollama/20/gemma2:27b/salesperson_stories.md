The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of jasmine and frying oil, a heady combination that usually invigorated Elias Thorne. Today, however, it did little to pierce the fog of dread settling over him. The midday sun beat down on the bustling marketplace of Marrakech, reflecting off the brass lanterns and shimmering silks that spilled from overflowing stalls. Tourists bartered for intricately woven carpets, their voices a rising tide against the rhythmic chanting of street vendors hawking spices and dates. Elias, usually energized by the vibrant chaos, felt his stomach twist with anxiety. Today was crucial. He needed to make a sale, a big one. His livelihood depended on it. 


He adjusted the heavy satchel slung over his shoulder, its contents – exquisite hand-blown glass lanterns from the nearby town of Fès – rattling softly. Elias knew he had something special: intricate designs in sapphire blue and emerald green shimmered within the frosted glass, casting ethereal patterns when lit. He just needed to find the right buyer, someone who could appreciate their beauty and value.
