Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into halos of yellow. The siren, a banshee wail in the storm, echoed off rain-slicked buildings, their neon signs momentarily swallowed by flashes of lightning.  Inside, Amelia "Em" Rodriguez gripped the gurney railing, her knuckles white as she braced against the lurching vehicle. Her heart pounded in sync with the ambulance's erratic rhythm, a counterpoint to the steady beep of the monitor beside her.

On the gurney lay Mr. Tanaka, his face pale and drawn, his breath shallow and raspy. A crimson stain bloomed on his shirt, spreading like a morbid flower across his chest. Em fought back the rising tide of adrenaline, focusing instead on the rhythmic squeeze of the manual bag valve mask she pumped, forcing air into Mr. Tanaka's struggling lungs. 

Tonight was shaping up to be one for the books - a night where even the storm mirrored the chaos brewing within her.
