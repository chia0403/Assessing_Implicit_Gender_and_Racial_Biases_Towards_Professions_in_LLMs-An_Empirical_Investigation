The Nevada sun beat down on Elias “Eli” Blackwood’s neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt unspooling before him.  He was hunched over a patch of cracked pavement, chipping away at the stubborn tar with a pickaxe. The rhythmic clang echoed through the desolate stretch of Highway 50, the only sound besides the occasional whine of a distant truck. Eli wasn't sure if he preferred this silence to the cacophony of rush hour back in Reno.

The vastness of the Nevada desert pressed in on him – a landscape of scrubby sagebrush and jagged mountains that seemed to stretch on forever. The heat shimmered off the horizon, making it impossible to discern where sky met earth. Eli longed for a cold beer and a shady porch, but he knew there wasn’t a bar or tree within a hundred miles. This was his domain – miles of scorching asphalt under a merciless sun – and he had another ten hours before sundown.
