Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Justice for All" law firm, blurring the neon sign outside into a sickly yellow smear. Inside, Emilia Ramirez, paralegal extraordinaire (at least in her own mind), hunched over a mountain of case files, her brow furrowed in concentration. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a cocktail familiar to anyone who'd spent more than five minutes in this rundown office.

Emilia wasn't sure what was worse: the leaky roof that threatened to drown her paperwork at any moment, or the mounting pile of eviction notices stacked precariously on her desk.  Each one represented a family facing homelessness, their futures hanging by a thread as thin as the worn carpet beneath her feet.  Today, however, there was something else weighing heavily on Emilia's mind - a cryptic message left on her answering machine that morning: "Meet me at the Blue Flamingo, midnight. Don't be late."
