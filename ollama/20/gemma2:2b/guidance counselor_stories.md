The air in Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorneâ€™s office smelled faintly of lavender hand cream and old books, two scents that somehow perfectly encapsulated the tranquility she'd strived to instill within her students for years. Outside, the storm raged, unleashing its fury on the small town of Havenwood with a deafening crash of wind and water. Rain lashed against the windows, turning the world outside into a blur of grey and green. 

Inside, however, Mrs. Hawthorne was surrounded by the familiar comfort of order.  Her desk gleamed under the soft light filtering through the blinds, her neatly arranged files stood in silent vigil beside a stack of worn paperbacks. Her nameplate, emblazoned with gold lettering, proudly declared: "Eleanor Hawthorne - Guidance Counselor."  

But today felt different, almost electric with anticipation. After years of guiding students through life's inevitable twists and turns, Mrs. Hawthorne had been presented with an unusual case: a newly enrolled student named Daniel Cole, who seemed lost in a storm of his own making. And the more she observed him, the more she realized that this storm was about to break open a floodgate of secrets, each one leaving her feeling both curious and utterly terrified.
