Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic tapping on the receiver in Theodore "Teddy" Cartwright's hands.  The air inside his cramped workshop was thick with static, not from a distant thunderstorm, but from years of accumulated memories - the hiss of old radios, the smell of ozone from countless repairs.  Outside, a storm raged, howling like a banshee against the aged wooden walls of his home studio.

Teddy's fingers traced the worn leather cord of his antique radio, its dials still singing an eerie song after decades of silence. He had dedicated his life to deciphering the intricate language of the unseen - coaxing sounds out of crackling wires and restoring voices that were lost, all within the confines of this cramped, cluttered workshop.  Tonight, though, something felt different, a prickle of anxiety crawling up Teddy's spine as he strained to pick up a faint signal on his rig.  It wasn't just the storm â€“ it was something more, something... desperate.
