The 7th floor office felt more like an abandoned tomb than a symbol of financial power.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the cracked blinds, highlighting the faded grandeur of mahogany desks and ornate grandfather clocks.  All eyes on the street, it seemed, were glued to the screen displaying a live market feed; all except for Arthur “Ace” Reynolds.  He sat at his desk, surrounded by a mountain of documents, the silence only broken by the ticking of an antique clock that seemed to mock him with its relentless rhythm.

Arthur, or Ace as everyone knew him (even if he secretly loathed it), was a seasoned stock broker. His name whispered in hushed tones amongst the city’s high-rollers and tycoons. His sharp wit, his uncanny ability to read markets like an open book, and his ruthless ambition had propelled him from a scrappy kid from Jersey to a titan of Wall Street.  But lately, Ace felt adrift. The thrill he used to find in the market's ebb and flow was fading, replaced by a creeping unease that gnawed at his gut like a hungry rat.  The whispers started weeks ago; about a sudden crash in a sector he hadn’t even noticed. It felt like a betrayal of trust from the very system he had built himself around. 

His eyes finally drifted to the antique clock, its minute hand ticking inexorably towards midnight. Tonight was the night. The culmination of his years of meticulous planning and the quiet whispers in the back alleys of New York’s underworld were going to come to life.   Tonight, Ace would play a game that could make him or break him - a game he hadn't played since he was a kid.  He had one hand on the lever, and his breath hitched as he stared at the button; the one that would either set off a chain of events, or end it all.
