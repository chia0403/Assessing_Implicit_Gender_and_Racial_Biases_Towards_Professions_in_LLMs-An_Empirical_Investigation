## Story Opening:

**Setting:** The harsh light of dawn cast long shadows across the jagged mountainside where Arlo Stonehammerâ€™s workshop was nestled.  A chill wind whipped through the valley, carrying with it the biting smell of snowmelt and ancient granite. 

**Character:** Arlo Stonehammer, his weathered face etched with years spent wrestling with unforgiving stone, surveyed the pile of rubble before him. For three generations, his family had honed their craft within these walls, chipping away at mountains to carve out the very fabric of this rugged landscape. But now, even the ancient granite seemed to be mocking Arlo's dwindling hope.  His younger brother, Finn, would inherit the workshop. 

**Opening Lines:** "It's time," he muttered to himself, his voice barely a rasp against the wind's icy bite. A heavy weight settled in his chest, heavier than the stones that had become his lifeblood.  He picked up a chipped chisel, its familiar feel almost soothing in the midst of his mounting despair. The mountain held secrets, he knew it. Secrets whispered in the howl of the wind, etched into the very rock itself. Tonight, he would finally unravel them.
