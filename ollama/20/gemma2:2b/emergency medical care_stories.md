Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the ambulance bay, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Daniel's heart. The air inside was thick with the tang of bleach and the sterile scent of disinfectant. It clung to him like a second skin, his uniform stiff from years of wear. He straightened the brim of his cap, the rain dripping onto his forehead. His name tag read "Daniel Pierce."

He glanced at the door again, the familiar weight of anticipation settling in his chest. Tonight, it wasn't just another call; it was something different. A storm of chaos had been unleashed on this small coastal town, and Daniel knew he wouldn't be able to escape its grip for too long.  The dispatcher's voice crackled through the static-filled radio as he heard her say: "Pierce, we have a major incident at the marina. Multiple casualties, possible building collapse."

It was just past midnight when he pulled up to the scene. The dilapidated brick and wood structure of the marina had been ripped apart by the storm surge, leaving jagged debris strewn across the ravaged landscape. A single beam, twisted like an angry serpent's tail, jutted precariously out from beneath a mangled awning, seemingly holding onto the remnants of the building's roof. 

Daniel approached cautiously, his headlamp cutting through the thick fog and shadows cast by the storm.  His boots sank into the mud, a symphony of groaning wood and crashing waves merging in the background. He could already see flashes of red and yellow - the emergency lights of his fellow EMTs, their faces etched with grim determination as they battled the elements and chaos that had engulfed the scene.
