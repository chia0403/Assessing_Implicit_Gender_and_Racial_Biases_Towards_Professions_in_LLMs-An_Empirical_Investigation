The moon hung like a bruised plum in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows from the towering spires of Citadel Veridia.  The wind whipped through the cobbled alleyways, carrying with it the scent of brine and despair that clung to the city's underbelly. Here, nestled amongst the ramshackle buildings and pungent refuse bins, stood Garron Delacroix, his weathered face etched with weariness as he scanned the crumbling brick wall for stray eyes. 

Garron was the last line of defense for Veridia's eastern gate - a duty he took seriously, even when the weight of it felt like chains on his soul.  He had sworn an oath to protect the innocent, but sometimes, innocence tasted bitter in a city shrouded in shadows and secrets. Tonight, the air thrummed with unease â€“ whispers about strange happenings near the docks, about a shadow moving under the cover of night, leaving behind a trail of fear and paranoia. As he tightened his grip on his rusted sword hilt, Garron's gaze lingered on the dark, swirling mist rolling in from the sea.  It held a chilling promise, like a whisper promising doom, before revealing something far more sinister.
