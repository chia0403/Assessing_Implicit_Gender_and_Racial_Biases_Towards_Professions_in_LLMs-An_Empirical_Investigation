## Story Opening:

The relentless Texan sun beat down on **Travis "Red" Dalton's** worn face, turning the sweat already slicking his brow to thick beads of moisture.  He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving greasy streaks across his weathered skin. The air hung heavy and still over the miles of asphalt stretching out before him, a monotonous ribbon of beige stretching as far as the eye could see under the oppressive sky. 

Red shifted his weight from one calloused foot to the other, his gaze sweeping across the construction site. It was almost noon, a time when even the toughest men in this desolate stretch of Interstate 10  craved shade and some semblance of normalcy. He'd been on the job for years now, the rhythm of the highway becoming almost like a heartbeat - a relentless hum that marked his existence.

He pulled out his trusty canteen, the familiar metal feel grounding him even as he wondered about the woman waiting for him back in Weatherby's Grill, her smile brighter than the sun on the day.  Today, he would finish laying down the last stretch of concrete before they could finally close off the new bypass, a feat he felt a surge of pride in. Yet, the endless stretches of asphalt and the suffocating heat were starting to get to him - just another ordinary Tuesday in the land where everything was as vast and unremarkable as the highway itself.
