## The Clogged Catacombs

**Setting:** 1930s London -  A labyrinth of damp, dank tunnels under the bustling metropolis. Cobwebs drape like shrouds over forgotten pipes, and flickering gaslight casts dancing shadows on grimy walls adorned with peeling paint.  The air hangs thick with the stench of sewage and stagnant water.

**Character:** 
* **Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:** A gruff, stoic man with hands weathered by years of wrenching and twisting in the city's underbelly. Bart is a plumber of few words, his silence broken only by the occasional curse or groan as he wrestles with stubborn pipes. His worn uniform, stained with grease and grime, speaks of countless hours spent battling leaks, clogs, and the ever-present fear of rats.

**Story Opening:** 

Rain lashed against the grimy window of Bartholomew Higgins' tiny flat above the gasworks, its steady drumbeat mimicking the hammering in his chest. Bart hunched over a steaming mug of tepid tea, staring at the worn photographs pinned to the wall. A woman with wide, sparkling eyes beamed back from one;  another showed her beaming with a young man, both bathed in light from what seemed like a joyous day. The faces felt like mirages now, lost in the grey haze that settled over him every time he remembered their smiles. It was only five years since Eliza had left for America, leaving behind not just a gaping hole in his life but also the promise of her return -  a promise that seemed as distant and impossible as the whispers of ghosts that haunted these very catacombs below. 
He took another sip of tea, the bitter taste clinging to his throat like a reminder. The phone rang abruptly, shattering the unsettling silence. A weary voice on the other end, thick with London grit, spoke of a new job:  a clogged drain in one of those forgotten tunnels beneath the city's heart, the kind that whispered tales of old secrets and unknown dangers. 
"Anything but another dead-end," Bart muttered, his gaze shifting towards the photos again. "Another chance to get things right."
