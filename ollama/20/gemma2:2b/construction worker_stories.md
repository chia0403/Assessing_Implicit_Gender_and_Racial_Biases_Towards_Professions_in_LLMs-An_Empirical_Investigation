The humid Florida air clung to Elias "Eli" Perez like an unwelcome second skin.  Sweat beaded on his brow as he surveyed the towering skeleton of the new apartment complex, its steel frame rising stark against the relentless blue sky. He shifted his weight from one foot to another, the worn leather soles squeaking on the concrete floor of the construction site. The sun was already sinking towards the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, but Eli felt a chill run down his spine despite the summer heat. 

The foreman called out over the din of hammers and saws, "Eli, check those beams again! Make sure they're plumb."  Eli grimaced – always a stickler for detail, even when it seemed like an exercise in futility. He’d known the feeling of being judged since he was a kid, back when his dad would sigh at him after another “off-kilter” brick wall that Eli had built as practice. But this construction project felt different, heavier than just bricks and beams. There was a weight to it, like something unseen but undeniably present, pressing down on Eli’s chest. 

He took a deep breath, the salty tang of sea air reminding him of his family's old fishing shack on the coast. It was here, on these very shores, that he had found solace in the rhythm of the waves and the quiet rustle of the wind through the mangroves. Now, as he looked at the towering structure, Eli couldn't help but feel adrift, like a small boat caught in a storm he didn’t understand.  The city lights, like distant stars, were starting to twinkle on the horizon, mirroring the unease that was settling deep within him.
