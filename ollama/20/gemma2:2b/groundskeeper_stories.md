## Story Opening: 

The late afternoon sun, already bleeding into the fiery hues of dusk, cast long, distorted shadows across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  A gentle breeze rustled through the ancient oaks lining the property, carrying with it a faint scent of rosemary and damp earth. It was a smell that usually filled Arlo Thorne with a sense of peace, but tonight, it only served to amplify the knot of anxiety in his stomach. 

Arlo Thorne had been the groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for over twenty years, ensuring its verdant beauty remained undisturbed. He knew every wrinkle on every oak tree and every hidden path within the sprawling estate.  He'd seen countless weddings, joyous birthdays, and sorrowful funerals unfold beneath the very branches he tended to. But tonight felt different. Tonight, something was off. 

A heavy silence hung in the air, broken only by the occasional chirp of a cricket or the distant call of a lonely owl. Arlo stared into the vast expanse of his beloved garden, a knot tightening in his chest. There were no signs of trouble, just an unsettling sense of wrongness that whispered its secrets in his ear.
