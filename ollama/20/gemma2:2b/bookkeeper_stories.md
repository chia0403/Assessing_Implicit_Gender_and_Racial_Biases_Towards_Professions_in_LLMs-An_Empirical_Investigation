Rain lashed against the shop windows like angry fists, each gust bringing with it a fresh assault of sleet and wind. Inside, Elara Thorne meticulously shuffled through invoices, her fingers tracing the neat lines of ledgers as she counted yet another month's worth of transactions for Thornton & Sons Ltd. The hum of the old, oil-filled heater did little to warm the air; its lonely song was punctuated only by the rhythmic clacking of Elara's keys and the occasional sigh of an overworked wind chime. 

For years, her small corner office in the bustling heart of the town had been a haven from the chaos of the outside world. Her days were a symphony of numbers, each figure a carefully placed note in a musical score that told the story of Thornton & Sons' fortunes - its ebb and flow, its upswings and downturns. But even her most meticulous calculations couldn't quell the growing unease churning in Elara's stomach. 

Tonight, the storm seemed to mirror the turmoil within her soul; an unsettling mix of anxiety and a creeping sense that something was amiss. Something big was about to happen, she just didn't know what it would be. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, hung heavy with anticipation.
