The bell above the door chimed its weary welcome as Cassandra "Cassie" Beaumont stepped into Sunnyside Diner.  It was 7:30 am, a time when most people still dreamt of sunrise instead of greasy spoon breakfast, but she was already facing a mountain of crumpled bills and lukewarm coffee. The fluorescent lights hummed in the same tired symphony they'd been playing for years. This wasn't exactly her dream job, though Cassie had learned to turn its mundane routine into a comfortable rhythm. 

The diner's worn red booths and Formica tables were a familiar sight.  Cassie loved the scent of sizzling bacon and the sound of the clattering coffee machine. Each day felt like an old song; the same order patterns, the same customer faces, but somehow, each day was still different, with new challenges to face. The diner was not just a workplace for Cassie; it was an anchor in her world.
