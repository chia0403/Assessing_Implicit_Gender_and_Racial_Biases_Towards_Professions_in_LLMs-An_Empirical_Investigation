## The Case of Mr. Fitzwilliam

**Setting:** A dilapidated brownstone on the edge of Baltimore's bustling Harbor District, shrouded in fog thick enough to obscure streetlights. 

**Character:**  Mr. Charles "Chuck" Henderson, a veteran Probation Officer known for his meticulousness and gruff demeanor, is meticulously checking the meager belongings left behind by Mr. Fitzwilliam – an aging poet who’d been caught with illegal drugs during a routine check-in.

His office at the Baltimore County Courthouse was already overflowing with paperwork – probation reports, client intake forms, and case notes piled high like forgotten promises.  He ran a hand through his thinning hair, weariness settling in his weary eyes that had witnessed more than their fair share of human failures.  Mr. Fitzwilliam’s case wasn’t the worst he'd encountered, not by any stretch – but it was something else entirely.

The poet, a recluse who lived his life behind the façade of words and poems, had been battling an unseen enemy for years: his own demons, which seemed to have found their way out in more ways than one. 


**Opening:** 
"Mr. Fitzwilliam," Chuck growled, staring at the man's worn-out coat as if trying to pierce through it and find a shred of truth hidden within its fabric.  He leaned closer, peering into the man's haunted eyes. “You’re going to have a hell of a lot more explaining to do than just recite your favorite sonnets." 

Chuck was about to begin the arduous task of navigating Mr. Fitzwilliam's convoluted world when the man suddenly muttered a word under his breath – "Cove."  A shiver ran down Chuck's spine, and he turned towards the only visible window in the room, its pane clouded with the city’s early morning fog. 
The words echoed in the silence like a forgotten melody, an unseen chord played on a dusty piano. Something was off.  Something deeper than just another probation violation.  Chuck's pulse quickened, the case suddenly feeling more dangerous and intriguing than he had ever imagined. He knew – somehow – that this wouldn’t be just another bureaucratic hurdle. This was about to get real.
