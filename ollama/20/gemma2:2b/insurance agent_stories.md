Rain lashed against the office windows of Ethan "Ace" Sterling Insurance, mirroring the chaotic storm brewing inside him. A knot of anxiety tightened in his stomach as he glanced at the clock, its hands ticking away the seconds until his monthly meeting with Mr. Peabody, their most demanding client. Ace hated these meetings; the man's voice always grated on him like nails against a chalkboard.  

**Setting:**

Aceâ€™s office was tucked away in a quiet corner of downtown Chicago, a relic from the roaring twenties it once represented. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and leatherbound books, reminders of the time before the tech boom that had turned insurance into a digital battlefield. 

**Main Character:**

Ethan "Ace" Sterling - an insurance agent who felt like he was stuck in a dead-end life. His father's legacy, built on trust and discretion over decades, had become more of a burden than a source of pride. Ace just wanted to be someone else, anything but the stoic face of his family name that everyone looked to for answers.
