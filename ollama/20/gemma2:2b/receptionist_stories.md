The worn linoleum floor groaned beneath Amelia's heels as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other, idly tracing patterns in the dust that clung precariously to the ceiling tiles. It was 7:01 am, and the air hung thick with anticipation – the kind that only precedes a tidal wave of anxiety-fueled chaos.  "Mrs. Hawthorne's due any minute," she muttered under her breath, clutching a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee. Her name was Amelia Hayes, and for the past ten years, she'd been the silent sentinel at the entrance to Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic – an office that hummed with the hushed whispers of medical mysteries and the occasional bursts of panicked yelps. 

The clock ticked relentlessly on the wall, each second a tiny hammer blow against Amelia’s already throbbing headache. She was the last line of defense between the world’s anxieties and Dr. Thorne's patients; her job wasn't glamorous, but it was vital.  As the minutes crawled by, she felt a cold dread settle over her like the January fog rolling into the city. Not just any patient was due to walk through those doors; Mrs. Hawthorne held secrets that were woven into the very fabric of Dr. Thorne’s practice. And with every passing second, Amelia wondered what truly lay beyond the veil of calm exterior and sterile white walls.
