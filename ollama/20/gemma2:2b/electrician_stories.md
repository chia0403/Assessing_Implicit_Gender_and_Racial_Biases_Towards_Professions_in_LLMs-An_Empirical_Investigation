The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Ezra Thorne like a second skin as he navigated the labyrinthine underbelly of the city's old power grid. Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light filtering from frayed ductwork, illuminating the grimy metal skeletons of transformers and the rusted carcasses of forgotten cables. The air was alive with buzzing, humming, and clicking – a symphony conducted by Ezra's own worn-down toolbox. This city, its arteries choked with years of neglect, had become his canvas, his own personal art project. 

Ezra, a seasoned electrician with hands that knew every inch of an electrical circuit, worked on a building where the past whispered through the crumbling brickwork. The building itself was a forgotten relic – a Victorian mansion now used as a workshop by an eccentric artist named Silas, known for his intricate sculptures crafted from salvaged metal scraps.  For years, Ezra had been brought in to troubleshoot Silas's increasingly outlandish projects, each one more bizarre and wild than the last: a life-sized mechanical owl fueled by wind power, a clockwork dragon powered by a battery of discarded batteries, a fantastical robot that danced to silent symphonies.

Tonight, however, something felt different. Ezra felt an unexpected tension in the air, a sense of unease like a single strand of frayed wire leading him somewhere he couldn't quite reach. The silence in the mansion was deafening, almost suffocating, and his usual familiarity with the building felt alien.
