## Setting: The Whispering Meadow

The air hung thick with dew, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Bell's calloused hands as she surveyed her meadow. Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy of ancient willow trees, cast long, dappled shadows across the patchwork of wild oats and clover, punctuated by the neat rows of her father’s heirloom squash. The Whispering Meadow was a place of contrasts – wild beauty existing cheek-by-jowl with the quiet dignity of order.  The wind rustled through the willow leaves, whispering tales of forgotten seasons and whispered secrets only Amy's grandmother could understand.

But today, there was a tension in the air, like a threadbare blanket pulled taut before being tossed into the washing machine – a premonition that felt heavier than usual. The meadow, normally a symphony of birdsong, held its breath under the weight of an unsettling silence.
