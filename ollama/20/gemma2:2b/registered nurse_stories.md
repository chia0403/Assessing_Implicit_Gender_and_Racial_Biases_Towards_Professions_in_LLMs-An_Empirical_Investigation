## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of blood – an unwelcome cocktail Amelia "Amy" Carter was all too familiar with.  Her scrubs were already stained from the last patient she'd cared for - a woman whose face had been etched with fear, not pain. Amy sighed, pushing her thick hair back as she stepped into the dimly lit hallway of Mercy General Hospital. Outside, a storm raged – rain lashing against the windows like an angry fist. Inside, however, there was an unsettling calm, almost suffocating in its quietude.

**Setting:** 

Mercy General Hospital, a sprawling, imposing building that stood at the edge of the city like a sentinel guarding the wounded. Its facade was a stark testament to the weight and sorrow it housed – chipped paint, cracked pavement, and shadows cast by flickering fluorescent lights. The hospital's history ran deep; whispers of past traumas lingered in its halls like ghosts from the dark corners of forgotten stories.

**Main Character:**

Amelia "Amy" Carter, a registered nurse with years of experience at Mercy General, known for her quiet strength and unwavering compassion. While she possessed a calm demeanor, Amy harbored an unspoken fear that lay buried deep within – a fear rooted in a tragic accident from her past which she desperately tried to outrun as she navigated the treacherous terrain of medicine.
