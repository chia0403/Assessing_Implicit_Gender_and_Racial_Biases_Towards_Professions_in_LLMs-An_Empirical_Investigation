The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Winthrop's head, casting long shadows across the worn vinyl chairs in the waiting room. Outside, the air was thick with humidity and the promise of rain. It was 3:15 pm on a Wednesday,  the hour when the veins of weary patients became increasingly pronounced, their faces taut with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation.

Amy, her long auburn hair tucked neatly under a surgical cap, felt the familiar sting of anxiety as she reached for the vial of crimson liquid in her bag. It was almost time to start her shift at Mercy General Hospital. She'd been a phlebotomist there for five years, and despite the constant stream of blood draws and the ever-present scent of antiseptic, she never grew tired of seeing the resilience and vulnerability etched onto the faces of her patients.

Today, however, a new case had thrown Amy into a spiral of anxiety. Mr. Henderson, a stoic man with a past shrouded in sorrow, was scheduled for his routine bloodwork and needed an IV insertion to administer medication.  Amy knew that this procedure could be especially sensitive given Mr. Henderson's history, and she worried about how he might react. It wasn’t just the physical discomfort of being poked and prodded – it was the weight of his unspoken anxieties and fears that haunted her.
