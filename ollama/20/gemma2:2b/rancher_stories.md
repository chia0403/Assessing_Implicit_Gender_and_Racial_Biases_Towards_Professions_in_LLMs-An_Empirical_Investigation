The wind whipped across Willow Creek Ranch, carrying with it the scent of dry earth and distant pine needles.  A thick veil of dust clung to everything, settling like a sigh on the weathered faces of the cattle as they grazed in the parched landscape. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the vast plains into a shimmering mirage. This was where Elijah "Eli" Hayes lived and breathed, his boots dusty, his hat pulled low, shielding him from the relentless glare.  He had been tending to this land since he was just a boy, inheriting it from his father - an inheritance that held both blessing and burden. The land was fertile enough for a life of simple luxury, yet harsh enough to test the mettle of even the most resilient soul. 

Eli squinted at the horizon, where the sky stretched into a dusty purple expanse. He knew the drought had been dragging on for months now, the water table dropping like a stone in his grandfather's well. A tremor ran through him as he thought about his fatherâ€™s grave at the old homestead just beyond the creek - a reminder of how fleeting life could be and how deeply rooted he was to this land that felt more familiar than anything else.
