The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia's auburn hair around her face as she stood on the clifftop, gazing out over the endless grey expanse of the Irish Sea.  It was a day where even the sky seemed to hold its breath, a canvas only partially filled with the dull blue of fading light.  Amelia shifted her weight from one foot to the other, the worn leather of her satchel rubbing against her ankle.  In it lay the palette that held all the colours of her heart, and tonight, those colours would be poured onto the rough-hewn wood of a barn stall. 

Her easel was set upon a rickety wooden platform that had been lovingly built by her late grandfather. The only sound apart from the wind's mournful song was the persistent creak of the rusted metal frame holding Amelia's canvas, an imposing image of a stormy sea captured in its stark black and white.  Amelia’s name wasn't just Amelia; it was a testament to the vastness of her ambition - the only daughter of three children, she had inherited not just her grandfather's talent but also his quiet dedication to her craft. 

Tonight, though, even her artistic heart felt weighed down by something more than the endless grey.  She was supposed to paint the barn, a structure that housed the memories of a life lived and lost. A place where Amelia had found solace, where she’d first discovered the power of colours beyond the mundane. 

But tonight, as the setting sun dipped below the horizon and swallowed the last vestiges of light, Amelia's easel remained stubbornly empty.
