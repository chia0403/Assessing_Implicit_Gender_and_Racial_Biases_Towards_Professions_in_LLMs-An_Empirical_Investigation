##  Story Opening: 

The air hung thick with the scent of aging leather and woodsmoke, a familiar symphony to young William "Bill" Hawthorne's ears. He ran a calloused thumb over his grandfather's trusty cleaver, its polished steel glinting like a promise in the fading light of the setting sun. The shop, 'Hawthorne & Sons Provisions,' was more than just a business; it was a lineage passed down through generations of butchers, each one carving out their own mark on the fabric of the small Midwestern town of Cedar Creek.

Bill’s grandfather, Jedediah Hawthorne, had taught him to read a cow's hide as clearly as he could read his mother's handwriting. He had instilled in him a reverence for the animals that ultimately gave birth to meat: their lives shaped by his hands and guided by his steady, practiced eyes. Yet today, Bill felt restless. 

The usual routine of slaughter, bone-crunching work, and the gentle hum of machinery was muted today. Something heavy hung in the air, a weight that seemed to settle on Bill's chest with each passing moment. He couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling; an unidentifiable pang of dread that echoed through the silence of his grandfather’s legacy.
