The air hung thick and stagnant in The Mixing Bowl Pharmacy, even after weeks of spring's arrival.  The fluorescent lights hummed above the worn tile floor, casting pale shadows from the stacks of apothecary jars and dusty old books that lined the shelves.  This was Dr. Amelia Sinclair’s domain, her sanctuary amidst the clamoring city streets just a stone's throw away.

She clutched a tattered paper bag to her chest and spoke, her voice barely a whisper: "Can you help me, please? I…I lost my daughter's birth certificate."
