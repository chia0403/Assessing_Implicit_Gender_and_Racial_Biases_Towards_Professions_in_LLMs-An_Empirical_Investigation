The crisp autumn air was alive with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  A thin sheen of rain clung to the cobblestone streets of Prague's Old Town Square, reflecting the pale glow of gas lamps in an ethereal dance of light and shadow. This was where Evelyn "Eve" Thorne, a concierge whose sharp eyes saw more than most people dared see, found her daily solace. 

Eve stood regally at the entrance to the grand Hotel Dandelion, her perfectly manicured hands clutching a worn leather-bound copy of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis." The hotel, with its ornate facade and whispering histories of wealth and heartbreak, was more than just a building; it was an ecosystem, teeming with secrets and desires.  For Eve, who'd been born into the life of a concierge, her job was to decipher these whispers, ensure smooth transitions between the worlds within these walls, and ultimately protect those who walked through its doors - even if it meant venturing into the heart of darkness. 


The bell above the door chimed, announcing an unexpected visitor. Eve's eyes narrowed as she saw a young woman in flowing black attire, her face shrouded by a wide-brimmed hat. The air thrummed with a palpable tension that only someone like Eve could perceive â€“ this wasn't just a new arrival; it was a storm about to break over the hotel.
