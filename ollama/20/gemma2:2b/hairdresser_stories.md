The neon "Bella's Hair Affair" sign hummed like a tired bee trapped in a jar as Amelia straightened her apron, a sigh escaping her lips with each rustle of the white fabric. The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of hairspray and lavender shampoo, a perfume she’d grown accustomed to over the past decade of running this tiny salon tucked away on Elm Street. It was Wednesday, which meant a steady stream of regulars like the fiery redhead Mrs. Henderson who always complained about her scalp itching after a week in the Arizona sun, or Mr. Rodriguez with his perpetually-confused hair that just wouldn’t settle, no matter how many times Amelia tried to tame it.

Today's challenge, however, was different. The door chimed like a silver bell as a woman stepped inside, tall and imposing in a sharp tailored suit. Her hair, jet black with highlights of copper, was pulled back tightly, revealing the sharp angularity of her cheekbones and a determined glint in her jade-green eyes that Amelia could only describe as piercing. 

"Amelia," she stated with a clipped tone, barely looking at the woman's face behind the salon chair where she sat, "This is about more than just cutting my hair."
