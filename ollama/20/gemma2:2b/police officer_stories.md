Rain hammered against Detective Liam O'Connell's trench coat as he huddled in his patrol car, its headlights cutting through the swirling greyness. The wind whipped strands of rain-dampened hair across his face, blurring his vision and making the already tight knot in his stomach feel like it was tightening further with each passing second. The scene was set: an overflowing dumpster behind a closed liquor store, littered with empty bottles and a lone, crumpled newspaper.  The headline screamed “Citywide Power Outage Leaves Thousands in Darkness,” but Liam knew there was something else at play here, something more sinister beneath the mundane chaos of a storm-ravaged night. 

The city of Aurora Heights had fallen into darkness about an hour ago, leaving its streets deserted and shrouded in an unsettling twilight.  Liam's beat covered the lower end of town, the heart of the industrial zone where the city’s problems seemed to fester most intensely. He was a man known for his stoic demeanor, his relentless pursuit of justice, and a thick layer of cynicism that kept him afloat amidst the endless sea of human frailty.  Tonight, though, even he felt a creeping sense of unease. 

A chill wind sent another wave of rain cascading across Liam’s window, prompting him to close his eyes briefly for a fleeting moment. The case was a tangled mess: a missing woman, her last known location near this liquor store, and an unsettling amount of suspicious activity on the surveillance footage that had been recovered from a nearby business. 

Liam needed answers, fast. But Aurora Heights held its secrets tightly against the harsh realities of the city’s underbelly. Tonight, he knew, it was just going to be another night in the storm.
