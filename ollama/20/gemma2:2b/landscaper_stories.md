The air hung thick with the aroma of freshly cut grass and blooming honeysuckle as Elias "El" Thorne navigated his way through Mrs. Peabody's meticulously manicured rose garden. It was his favorite part of the job - the gentle symphony of bees buzzing between blossoms, the soft rustle of leaves in a summer breeze, the feel of warm earth under his calloused hands. His trusty clippers, forged from generations of family tradition and honed to perfection by El himself, hummed gently as he trimmed back unruly stems. This suburban paradise was a stark contrast to the concrete jungles where he'd once roamed as a city boy.  It wasn't just about the pretty flowers or manicured lawns, though; it was about the lives hidden within their vibrant embrace, the quiet dramas unfolding amidst the carefully curated spaces â€“ like the elderly Mrs. Peabody who lived alone and whose garden served as a beacon of hope in her otherwise solitary world. 

But today, something felt off. The usual serene hum of the garden seemed to have been replaced with an unnerving silence, broken only by the distant cawing of crows. El paused, his eyes catching a glint of something silver beneath the rose bush at the far end of the garden. He knelt down, careful not to disturb the delicate petals beneath his fingertips.
