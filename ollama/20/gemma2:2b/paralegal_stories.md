## Story Opening: 

Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the cramped office, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia's anxiety in her chest.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the meticulously organized files strewn across her desk. Papers with names like "Johnson v. Smith" and "Garcia Legal Services" seemed to pile up constantly, each one holding the weight of a human story begging for justice. Amelia, though, was more familiar with the legal system's cold, calculating machinery than the nuances of actual human lives. She was a paralegal, her world confined within the dusty pages of contract law and the sterile atmosphere of a corporate law firm. 

**Setting:** A mid-sized city in the American Northeast during the rainy season. The city is gritty, with towering office buildings juxtaposed against older brick row houses that seem to whisper stories of their own.

**Main Character Name:** Amelia "Amy" Carter
