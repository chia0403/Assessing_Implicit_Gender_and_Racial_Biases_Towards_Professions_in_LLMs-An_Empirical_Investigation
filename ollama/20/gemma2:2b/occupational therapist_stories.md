The crisp scent of disinfectant mingled with the tang of fresh sawdust as Elara adjusted her mask, ready to begin another session in the bustling Pediatric Rehab Center at St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  Elara, a vibrant woman with a mischievous twinkle in her eye and hands constantly fiddling with colorful fidget toys, was no stranger to chaos. For over five years now, she had navigated this whirlwind of laughter, tears, and triumphs, working as an occupational therapist, helping the children regain their independence, one finger flex and one smile at a time. 

Today's patient, eight-year-old Leo, with his mop of curly brown hair and mischievous grin that could disarm even the most stoic parent, was presenting a particularly stubborn set of challenges. He sat in the corner of his room, meticulously tracing patterns on a large blue coloring book, fingers drumming on the worn fabric like a frustrated drummer.  A recent surgery for a congenital hand deformity had left him with restricted movement and a crippling sense of helplessness that Elara knew all too well could only be overcome with time and practice. 

The setting was bright, yet slightly sterile, bathed in the usual fluorescent hum of hospital lights. The walls, adorned with whimsical artwork from the children's own art projects, seemed to hold the weight of countless stories, each one a testament to resilience and healing. 


**Note:**  This opening establishes Elara's personality, her work setting, and introduces Leo's challenge. It also hints at a potential conflict or tension that Elara will need to navigate through the session.
