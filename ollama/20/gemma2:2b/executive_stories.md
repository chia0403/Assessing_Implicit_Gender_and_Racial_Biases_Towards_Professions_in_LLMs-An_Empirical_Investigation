Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's office at Zenith Corporation HQ. Outside, Seattle was a churning symphony of grey and wind. Inside, Evie stared out at it all, a frown etching itself deeper into her already tired features. Her usually crisp white shirt seemed to have absorbed some of the city’s melancholy, its stark lines contrasting with the storm-clouds swirling in her mind. 

Evie was no stranger to pressure. This wasn't just another quarterly review; this was Zenith's upcoming IPO. The future of the company – and the lives of thousands of employees – rested on her shoulders. The air crackled with a tension that went beyond the storm outside, a palpable feeling of being trapped in an avalanche of expectations. 

The clock ticked relentlessly past 5 PM, its metallic ticking echoing the growing panic within her. Her assistant, Amelia, had called for the third time today. "Ms. Thorne," she said patiently, voice as thin and controlled as steel, "the board is demanding a decision on Project Phoenix." 

Evie's gaze fell to the pile of unread emails threatening to engulf her like a digital tsunami. The project – a revolutionary new tech platform aimed at disrupting the global market – was already shrouded in controversy. A leak had gone public, accusing them of stealing proprietary information from their competitors.  The board expected answers, and Evie’s were fast running out of time.
