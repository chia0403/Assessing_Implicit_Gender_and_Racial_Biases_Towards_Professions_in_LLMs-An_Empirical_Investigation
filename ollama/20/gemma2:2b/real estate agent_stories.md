The air in San Francisco hung heavy with fog, clinging to Magnolia Avenue like damp wool.  Amelia "Amy" Davenport, her auburn hair escaping its ponytail as she adjusted her navy blazer, stepped onto the porch of the Victorian mansion with an almost tangible sigh. 1730 Delancey was a behemoth - two stories tall, a facade that screamed history and elegance. It had a kind of melancholic charm Amy found intoxicating, but it also held a deep unease in its shadowed corners.

Her clients, the widowed Mrs. Beaumont, were notoriously private. Amy’s job wasn't simply to sell the house; it was to understand its ghosts – the echoes of a life lived and lost, the whispers of past joys and heartbreaks.  As she took in the stately archway leading into the foyer, a shiver ran down her spine, a feeling amplified by the low hum that seemed to emanate from the old Victorian’s very foundation. It was this kind of mystery, this undeniable sense of the unknown, that kept Amy hooked on real estate, and tonight, she was determined to unravel the secrets of 1730 Delancey.
