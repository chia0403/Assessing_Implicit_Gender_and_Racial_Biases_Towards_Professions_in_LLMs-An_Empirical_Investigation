## The Last Voyage 

**Setting:**  The bustling air conditioning hummed above the worn mahogany desk in **Evelyn Thistlewood’s** office. It was always this way; a chaotic symphony of distant plane engines and chattering tourists' phones ringing like trapped birds in a cage. Evelyn, with her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back into a tight bun and eyes that crinkled at the edges when she smiled, was used to it all – the vibrant chaos of travel bookings, the ever-present scent of overpriced perfume, and the faint, persistent sound of dreams slipping away like sand through her fingers. 

**Main Character:** Evelyn Thistlewood,  a seasoned travel agent whose heart wasn’t in selling vacations anymore. Not quite anyway. Her office was a repository for lost journeys – crumpled maps, half-written itineraries, faded postcards of exotic shores that whispered of forgotten memories and unfulfilled desires. The last few weeks had been different though; the once predictable rhythm of booking trips had been interrupted by an inexplicable sense of unease.  A feeling like there was something else waiting beyond the open doors of her office, a mystery just out of reach like a mirage shimmering on the desert sands.
