The air hung thick with the acrid scent of diesel and asphalt as Eldon “Ironhand” Thompson shifted his weight from one foot to the other.  He stared out over the sprawling construction site, its chaos echoing in the rhythmic thrumming of bulldozers and the shrill screams of a crane. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows that danced across the concrete plains, turning them into an alien landscape. This was Iron Ridge Construction, a behemoth of industry churning out another towering skyscraper for the city's rapidly growing skyline.

Today, he was prepping to lay the foundation for the latest phase of construction, an imposing steel skeleton rising from the ground in a silent testament to human ambition. But as the sun dipped lower, casting the towering concrete slab in an ominous shadow, Eldon felt a growing unease gnaw at his gut. This project had been shrouded in secrecy, whispers circulating among workers about strange occurrences – unexplainable bursts of energy, flickering lights within the underground vaults where power lines ran. Eldon hadn't believed it until he witnessed a brief flash of light during the last heavy machinery operation, leaving him with an unnerving feeling that something wasn’t right.
