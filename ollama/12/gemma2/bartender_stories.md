The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Spigot" cast an ethereal glow across Amelia Rose Davenport's face as she polished glasses. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation. A haze of cigarette smoke hung low, illuminated by the dim amber light that filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from a forgotten mythology. 

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid and emerald eyes shadowed with fatigue, wiped down the counter with practiced movements. The Spigot was her refuge, a haven built on cheap liquor, bad jokes, and the unspoken stories whispered between patrons huddled in their booths. Tonight, however, felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the surface of the usual Friday night chaos.  


Amelia knew something was about to break.
