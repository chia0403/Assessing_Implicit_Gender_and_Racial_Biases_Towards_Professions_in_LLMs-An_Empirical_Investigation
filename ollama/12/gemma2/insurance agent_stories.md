Rain lashed against the windshield of Amelia Beatrice Harrington’s vintage Volvo, blurring the neon signs of downtown Elmwood into hazy streaks. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping her auburn hair around her face and making the wipers struggle to keep up. Amelia sighed, adjusting the collar of her crisp white blouse. Another storm brewing in Elmwood, just like another potential catastrophe waiting to happen in one of her client’s lives.

She was about to reach for her phone and call the latest addition to her ever-growing list – a jittery young woman named Fiona who insisted on "life insurance that could cover a unicorn stampede" - when the radio crackled to life. A news bulletin, urgent and breathless, cut through the static: "Breaking News: A massive power outage has hit Elmwood. Authorities are urging residents to remain indoors..." 

Amelia’s eyebrows shot up. This was more than just another Tuesday night in Elmwood. Something felt… off.  


**Setting:** Elmwood, a quaint, slightly rundown town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The town is known for its charming Victorian architecture, quirky residents, and an overabundance of antique shops. It’s also notoriously prone to strange occurrences and unusual weather patterns.
