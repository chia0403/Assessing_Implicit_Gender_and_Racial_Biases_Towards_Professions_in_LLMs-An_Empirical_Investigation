The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth. Sunbeams slanted through the ancient oaks lining the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, casting dancing shadows on the meticulously manicured lawns.  

Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne adjusted his straw hat, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. He hummed a jaunty tune as he steered his worn, red wheelbarrow down the gravel path, the rhythmic crunch of the stones accompanying his melody. A lifetime spent tending to these grounds had etched every twist and turn into his memory, every bloom and shadow a familiar friend.  He knew each rosebush by name, could predict the crocus's arrival with uncanny accuracy, and possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of every weed that dared to sprout within Blackwood Manor's boundaries. 


Teddy was more than just a groundskeeper; he was the heart and soul of this sprawling estate, a silent guardian whispering secrets to the wind and tending to the needs of the manor like a devoted confidante.
