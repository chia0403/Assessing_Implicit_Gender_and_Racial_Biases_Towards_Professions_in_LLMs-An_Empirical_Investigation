The humid July air clung to Penelope Willowbrook like a second skin as she stepped out onto the manicured lawn of 28 Maple Drive.  Butterflies danced in her stomach, a familiar flutter that always accompanied a showing. But this one felt different. The Victorian mansion, all gingerbread trim and looming turrets, seemed to radiate an unsettling stillness. Even the chirping sparrows seemed hesitant, flitting nervously between branches.

Penelope adjusted the collar of her crisp linen blazer, smoothing down the wrinkles.  She’d been in real estate for five years, successfully navigating the ups and downs of the market, but this house felt…off. 


The "For Sale" sign had been up for months, the listing boasting original hardwood floors, stained-glass windows, and a sprawling garden ripe with heirloom roses. Yet, there were no open houses, no eager potential buyers. Penelope had sensed a chill in the property’s history from her initial phone call with the estate lawyer, Mrs. Agatha Finch, who seemed more concerned about finding the "right" buyer than simply selling the house. 

Penelope straightened her spine and inhaled deeply, steeling herself for whatever secrets lay within those old walls.  It was time to show 28 Maple Drive. Time to see if its charm outweighed its shadows.
