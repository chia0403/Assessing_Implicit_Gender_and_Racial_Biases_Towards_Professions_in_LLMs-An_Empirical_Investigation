The rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne's seaside clinic, mimicking the relentless throb in her own head. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the waves into a frenzy that crashed against the cliffs with thunderous booms.  Inside, the small waiting room was eerily still, save for the tick-tock of a grandfather clock perched by the fireplace. Amy slumped further into her worn leather armchair, clutching a lukewarm mug of tea that had long since gone cold.

Her clinic, nestled on a windswept cliff overlooking the desolate beauty of the North Sea coast in Cornwall, England, was usually a haven of peace and quiet. But tonight, the storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within her. 


Three months ago, she’d received the news – her brother, Liam, diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. The diagnosis had shattered their once-impenetrable bond, leaving Amy adrift in a sea of helplessness.  

Now, as she stared into the flickering firelight, all she could think about was Liam, his familiar laugh echoing in her ears, and the desperate hope that gnawed at her – that somehow, some way, she could find a cure for him.
