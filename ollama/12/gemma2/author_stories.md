The air in Eleanor Persephone Bellweatherâ€™s study hung thick with the scent of old parchment and Earl Grey tea. Rain lashed against the mullioned windows, casting dancing shadows across her cluttered desk. A half-written manuscript lay before her, its pages filled with ink stains and crumpled notes, a testament to the writer's block that had gripped her for weeks. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mimicking the turmoil raging within Eleanor. 

Her latest novel, a gothic thriller set in the crumbling ruins of an ancient abbey, had promised to be her magnum opus. But now, staring at the blank page, she felt utterly lost. The characters refused to speak, the plotline stuttered and sputtered, and inspiration seemed to have vanished into thin air.  Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her fiery red curls that threatened to escape their messy bun. Maybe, just maybe, a change of scenery was what she needed. 


The setting is Eleanor's study in an old, rambling Victorian house nestled on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, England. The year is 1937.
