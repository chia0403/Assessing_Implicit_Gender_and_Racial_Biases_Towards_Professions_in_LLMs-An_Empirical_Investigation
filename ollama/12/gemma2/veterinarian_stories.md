The pungent scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of fear. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Beaumont's small veterinary clinic, illuminating dust motes dancing in its beam. Outside, the humid Louisiana summer hummed with cicadas and the drone of a distant lawnmower. Inside, it was a symphony of whimpers and agitated barks. 

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. A calico cat yowled from its carrier, its frantic claws scratching against the wire mesh. A golden retriever whined softly on the examination table, his tail tucked between his legs. A young girl, no older than seven, clung to her mother's leg, tears streaming down her face as she watched a hamster being gently prodded by Eleanor's assistant. 

It was going to be a long day.
