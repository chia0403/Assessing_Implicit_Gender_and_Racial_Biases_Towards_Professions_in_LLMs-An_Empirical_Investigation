The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Periwinkle, their pale glow casting a sickly sheen on the chipped linoleum floor. It was 3:17 p.m.,  and the "Grand Re-Opening" banner strung haphazardly across the front of the dusty convenience store still held onto its optimistic cheer despite the sparse trickle of customers. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eyes and idly straightening the price tags on a shelf of discount candy. This was Day Three of the "Re-Opening," and she was beginning to doubt if there would be a "Day Four."

Her name tag, which read "Amelia - Cashier extraordinaire" in glittery pink lettering, felt ironically mocking. Extraordinary? The only extraordinary thing about this job was the sheer boredom.  She longed for something more, some spark of excitement in her monotonous routine. Then again, what else could she expect from a dead-end job at a convenience store on the outskirts of Dustbowl Creek, Wyoming?
