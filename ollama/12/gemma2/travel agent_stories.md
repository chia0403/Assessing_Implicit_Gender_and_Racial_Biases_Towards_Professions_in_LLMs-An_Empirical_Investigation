The air in Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick’s office was thick with the scent of jasmine tea and unfulfilled dreams.  A travel magazine lay open on her desk, its glossy pages showcasing sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains, each image mocking Amelia's current reality: a cramped third-floor cubicle overlooking a perpetually grey Birmingham street. 

Amelia sighed, pushing aside a pile of brochures advertising "Exotic Getaways" that felt about as exotic as the local supermarket’s produce aisle. Her phone rang, breaking her melancholic reverie. It was Mrs. Perkins, requesting a trip to “somewhere warm and relaxing,” her voice trembling with unspoken desperation.  

Amelia knew exactly where she wanted to be, gazing out at sapphire waters instead of grime-coated windows. She just needed the courage to take the plunge herself. 


**Setting:** A small, cluttered travel agency in Birmingham, England. The year is 2023. Outside, the dreary British weather casts a perpetual gloom over the city, contrasting sharply with the vibrant escapism advertised within the office walls.
