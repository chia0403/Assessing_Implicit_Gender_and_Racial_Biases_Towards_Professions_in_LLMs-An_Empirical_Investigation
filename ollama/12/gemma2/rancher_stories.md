The sun beat down on Clara Amelia Bradshaw's neck as she surveyed her cattle herd from atop the weathered fence post. Dust devils danced across the parched plains, mocking the cracked earth that stretched before her. This stretch of Texas was unforgiving, beauty hiding beneath layers of relentless heat and unrelenting drought. The bluebonnets that had once carpeted the land were now brittle reminders of a more generous season, their faded petals clinging desperately to withered stems.  

Clara chewed on a piece of straw, her gaze fixed on a lone cow lagging behind the herd. She knew her animals better than she knew herself, and this one, Buttercup, looked unwell. Clara sighed, the worry etching lines deeper into her tanned face. 


Buttercup was more than just another head of cattle; she was a legacy, passed down from Clara's grandmother. The Bradshaw Ranch had weathered many storms, but this drought threatened to be its greatest challenge yet.
