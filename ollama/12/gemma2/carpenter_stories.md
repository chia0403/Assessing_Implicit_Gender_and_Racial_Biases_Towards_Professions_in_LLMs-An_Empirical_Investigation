The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Jasper Thorne as he measured a length of cedar. Sunlight streamed through the open barn door, painting stripes across his workbench, illuminating the intricate carving tools laid out beside him. Outside, the wind rustled through the tall pines that encircled Thorne's workshop, nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. A symphony of birdsong filled the air, punctuated by the occasional distant caw of a crow. 

Jasper, a man weathered by time and toil, his hands calloused yet capable of delicate artistry, ran a thumb over the smooth grain of the wood. He was working on a commission – a cradle for a newborn, requested by a young couple expecting their first child. It was more than just a job; it was a story waiting to be told in wood, imbued with love and hope. 


His mind drifted to the expectant parents, his heart swelling with a warmth that had little to do with the midday sun filtering through the barn. Their faces, etched with worry and anticipation, haunted him – a reminder of the weight he carried on his shoulders.
