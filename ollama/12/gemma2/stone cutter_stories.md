The morning mist clung to the valley like a spectral shroud, obscuring the jagged peaks that encircled their small village nestled in the foothills of the Dragon Spine mountains. Dewdrops, fat and glistening, hung heavy on the blades of grass, waiting for the sun to coax them into shimmering diamonds. It was just this kind of morning – quiet, contemplative, perfect for working stone. 

Alden Thornewood adjusted his leather apron, its surface worn smooth by years of handling rough granite and polished marble. He ran a calloused thumb over the chisel resting beside him, feeling its familiar weight in his hand.  Each day, he carved his stories into the world, transforming unyielding rock into objects of beauty and function. Today, he was working on a commission for Lord Elmsworth – a grand fountain to grace the newly rebuilt village square. It was a significant undertaking, one that would take weeks to complete, but Alden relished the challenge. His mind buzzed with visions of cascading water, intricate carvings of mythical beasts, and smooth, polished surfaces reflecting the sky like a fractured mirror. He took a deep breath, inhaling the crisp mountain air, and began his work.
