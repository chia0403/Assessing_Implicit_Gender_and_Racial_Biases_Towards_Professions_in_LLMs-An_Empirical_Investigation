The scent of lavender polish lingered in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's nostrils as she surveyed the grand foyer. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Each pane depicted a different scene from Arthurian legend: King Arthur drawing Excalibur, Guinevere weeping by a fountain, Lancelot battling Mordred. It was all so terribly beautiful, so tragically out of reach for someone like Amelia.

She tugged her faded blue uniform tighter against the chill that always seemed to permeate the grand halls of Blackwood Manor. The manor was as imposing and aloof as its owner, Lord Alistair Blackwood, a recluse rumored to be haunted by the past. His grief over the loss of his wife, Lady Eleanor, had transformed the once lively manor into a tomb of memories. It fell upon Amelia, along with the aging butler, Mr. Finch, to keep this fading tapestry of grandeur from unraveling entirely. 


Amelia sighed and straightened the antique silver vase holding a single withered lily, its petals mirroring the faded glory of the Blackwood legacy. Another day, another layer of dust to be conquered, another silent sigh of longing echoing through the empty halls.
