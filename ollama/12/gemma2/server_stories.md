The steam from the cappuccino swirled around Amelia Clementine's face like a phantom waltz. She inhaled the rich aroma, letting it momentarily distract her from the chaos unfolding around her at 'Chez Pierre'. 

It was Friday night – prime time in this bustling French bistro nestled on a cobbled street in downtown Savannah. Tourists jostled for space with locals, their chatter mixing with the clatter of cutlery and the rhythmic clinking of wine glasses. Amelia navigated the throng like a seasoned sailor, her worn ballet flats silent against the checkered floor. 

Her notepad was already filled with orders, scribbled in hurried shorthand: "steak frites pour deux," "creme brulee, no sugar," "another glass of the Chardonnay." She smiled at each customer, offering apologies for the wait and reassurance that their meals would be worth it. But beneath her professional facade, Amelia felt the familiar tightness in her chest – a mix of anxiety and exhaustion. The tips were good tonight, she knew, but the long hours and demanding customers were taking their toll.
