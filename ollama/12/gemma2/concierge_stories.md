The lobby of The Grand Magnolia shimmered under a sky bruised with the approaching storm. Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows, throwing fractured rainbows across the polished marble floor.  A grand piano sat silent in the corner, its ivory keys reflecting the flickering gaslight. 

Eleanor Beatrice Davenport, or Ellie as she preferred, surveyed the scene from behind the ornate concierge desk. A crimson shawl draped her shoulders, a splash of warmth against the cool air swirling through the lobby. Her smile was practiced, welcoming, but Ellie couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled over The Grand Magnolia like a shroud. This wasnâ€™t just another storm; this felt different.

Ellie adjusted her pearl earrings, their soft shimmer catching in the dim light. A gust of wind rattled the glass doors, sending a shiver down her spine. It wouldn't be long now before the power flickered and died, leaving them cloaked in darkness. And when that happened, Ellie knew, things would get interesting.
