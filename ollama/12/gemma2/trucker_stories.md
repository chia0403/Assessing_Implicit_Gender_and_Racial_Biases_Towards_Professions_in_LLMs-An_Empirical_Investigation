The engine rumbled like a tired bear, its breath clouding the windshield in wisps of steam. Outside, the Kansas plains stretched endlessly, a sea of amber grass rippling under the pale November sun. Inside the cab of his Peterbilt, Bartholomew "Bear" Jackson scratched at the salt-and-pepper stubble on his chin, squinting at the GPS screen. Another hundred miles to Amarillo, another night spent hunched over a greasy diner table, the smell of stale coffee and regret clinging to him like a second skin. 

Bartholomew wasn't sure what he was running from anymore, just that the open road was the only place he felt truly free. The endless highway offered anonymity, a chance to shed the weight of his past like an old coat. He could be anyone out here, "Bear" Jackson, the trucker, a man who lived by the rhythm of the engine and the neon glow of roadside diners.
