The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick, casting a sterile glow on the rows of beige chairs that lined the waiting room. It was just past nine, the start of the dreaded Monday morning rush at St. Jude’s Medical Center's hematology department. The air, thick with antiseptic and apprehension, buzzed with low murmurs as patients shifted nervously in their seats. Amelia, her name tag neatly pinned on her crisp blue scrubs, leaned against the counter, a familiar ache blooming in her lower back. 

She was used to this scene, the predictable chaos of needles and vials, blood tests and worried faces. Yet, today felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, like an unseen hand brushing against her neck. It wasn’t just the usual Monday morning jitters; it was a feeling that something…off was about to happen. Amelia took a deep breath, trying to shake off the premonition, and reached for the appointment book. She had thirty-five patients waiting, each with their own story, their own anxieties etched on their faces.  

The first name in the book stared back at her: Mr. Silas Finch.
