The stale scent of liniment and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Amelia Grace Hawthorne. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of her practice, "Hawthorne Spine & Align," illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny, effervescent ghosts. The rhythmic whirring of the ceiling fan was the only sound besides the gentle clinking of antique teacups as Mrs. Henderson, her receptionist, meticulously polished each one.

Amelia had inherited this cozy Victorian building from her grandmother, a renowned healer who had paved the way for Amelia's own practice nestled in the heart of sleepy Maple Creek. The town was known more for its maple syrup festivals and quaint bed & breakfasts than for high-stress careers, but that didn't mean people didn't need adjustments. In fact, Amelia often found herself treating a steady stream of folks â€“ farmers with aching backs from long days in the fields, office workers hunched over laptops battling the modern day ailments, even the occasional restless spirit drawn to Maple Creek seeking solace and alignment. 

Today, however, was different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than usual. Amelia glanced at Mrs. Henderson, who was unusually silent, her brow furrowed as she stared out the window. Amelia knew something was amiss, but before she could ask, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival.
