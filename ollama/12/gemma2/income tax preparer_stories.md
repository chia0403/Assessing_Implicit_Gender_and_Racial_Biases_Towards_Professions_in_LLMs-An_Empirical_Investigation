The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's head, casting a pale, sterile glow over the stacks of crumpled receipts and half-filled forms that littered her desk. The air in her small office smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma this time of year. Tax season was always a whirlwind, a chaotic ballet of numbers, deadlines, and anxious clients, but this year felt different. Bea could feel it in the pit of her stomach, a knot of unease that tightened with each ringing phone. 


Bea’s office, tucked away on the second floor of a rundown strip mall in suburban Baltimore, was anything but glamorous. Wallpaper peeling at the edges, mismatched furniture, and a single potted fern struggling to survive by the window painted a picture of modest means. But for Bea, it was home – her sanctuary from the storm of numbers that threatened to consume her every waking moment. She knew these forms inside and out, each line a puzzle piece she could fit with ease. Tax season wasn't just a job for Bea, it was an intricate dance she performed year after year, striving for order in a world that often felt chaotic.  

But this year, the usual routine felt off-kilter, like a wrong note in a familiar song. The phone seemed to ring more incessantly, each call bringing with it a new story, a new anxiety. And Bea couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change – something big.
