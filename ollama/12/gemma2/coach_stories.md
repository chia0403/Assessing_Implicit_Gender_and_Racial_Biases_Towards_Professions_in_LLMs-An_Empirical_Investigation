The humid Louisiana air hung heavy over Coach Henrietta “Hetty” Beaumont’s shoulders as she surveyed the field. The practice was supposed to start in ten minutes, but her team, the Bayou Bengals, were scattered like dandelion seeds across the dew-covered grass. Some were sprawled beneath a spindly oak, others tossed a ragged football back and forth, their laughter swallowed by the cicadas’ relentless symphony.  

Hetty let out a sigh, tugging at the collar of her faded purple LSU shirt. This wasn't exactly how she envisioned starting her second season as head coach. The Bengals were a ragtag bunch, more accustomed to dodging crawfish traps than tackling receivers. But Hetty believed in them, saw a flicker of potential beneath their languid summer attitude.  

She adjusted her visor and strode onto the field, her worn leather cleats crunching on the damp grass. It was time to get this team moving, both on and off the field. 


**Setting:** A sweltering Louisiana afternoon, on a dusty football field in a small rural town, surrounded by towering cypress trees and the humid air thick with the buzz of cicadas.
