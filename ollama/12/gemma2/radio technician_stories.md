The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Millie" Everly like a second skin as she hunched over the crackling radio receiver.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the faint numbers etched onto the worn metal casing. Outside, cicadas droned their relentless chorus, punctuated by the occasional screech of an owl. The rusty screen door of the shack creaked in the evening breeze, casting dancing shadows across the cluttered workbench beside Millie.

This ramshackle workshop, nestled on the edge of a forgotten dirt road deep within the Oconee National Forest, was Millie's sanctuary. Here, amidst a symphony of static and sputtering transistors, she felt truly alive.  Her calloused fingers danced over the wires and knobs with practiced ease, coaxing whispers from the ether. 

Tonight, however, the silence was deafening.  The radio, usually humming with distant chatter and snippets of news broadcasts, lay stubbornly quiet. A prickle of unease crawled up Millie's spine. Something was wrong. Very wrong.
