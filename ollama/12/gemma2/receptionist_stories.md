The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Rose's head, casting a sterile glow over the beige-carpeted waiting room. It was always eerily quiet in Dr. Albright's office, save for the incessant ticking of the antique clock perched precariously on the wall. Today was no different. Amy sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she scrolled through emails on her ancient desktop computer.  Another day, another string of appointments for existential dread and mild anxiety. At least it wasn't Tuesday, when Mrs. Henderson came in with her collection of worry stones and insisted on discussing the astrological alignment with Amy. 

The waiting room was small, a cramped space filled with overstuffed armchairs that smelled faintly of mothballs and desperation. A potted fern, perpetually wilting, sat forlornly in the corner, its drooping fronds mirroring the mood of the patients who rarely left smiling.  


Amy leaned back in her own chair, the worn leather creaking beneath her weight. This office felt like a tomb, waiting for someone to finally pull down the curtain on this monotonous routine. But until then, she had appointments to usher and tissues to dispense.
