The smoky haze clung to Amelia "Amy" Rose like a second skin as she stepped onto the cramped stage of The Rusty Nail. The air throbbed with bass, punctuated by cheers and clinking glasses from the dimly lit crowd, their faces blurred in the kaleidoscope of coloured lights.  The stage itself was barely wider than a bed, adorned with faded posters of forgotten bands and chipped paint that whispered tales of countless nights like this one – nights filled with dreams, desperation, and just enough cheap whiskey to fuel them both. 

Amy gripped her well-worn acoustic guitar, its wood worn smooth by years of calloused fingers and fervent strumming. This was her haven, The Rusty Nail, a dive bar tucked away on the edge of town where ambition went to die and raw talent dared to breathe.  She could hear the murmurings stop as she approached the mic stand, their collective gaze heavy with expectation, laced with a flicker of something more – hope perhaps, or maybe just the promise of another good story to tell at dawn. 


Tonight, Amy Rose was determined to write her own story.
