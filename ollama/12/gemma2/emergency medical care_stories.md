The insistent wail of sirens sliced through the humid July air, echoing off the grimy brick walls of Detroit’s Delray neighborhood.  Amelia "Amy" Grace-Rivera gripped the steering wheel of the ambulance, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already dim streetlights into hazy orbs. Amy, a seasoned EMT with five years under her belt, had seen it all – from fender benders to heart attacks to the occasional drug overdose. But tonight felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a sense of impending chaos.

“Dispatch, this is 17-Bravo,” Amy’s voice was calm, professional, “We’re approaching the scene on Gratiot and Canfield. Reports of a large fight?”

The crackle of static responded.  “Affirmative, 17-Bravo. Multiple victims reported, possible weapons involved. Proceed with caution.”

Amy swallowed, her stomach clenching. She glanced at Marcus, the rookie paramedic riding shotgun. His face was pale, reflecting the flickering red and blue lights on the dashboard. He gripped his bag, knuckles mirroring Amy’s own. This wasn't your typical Friday night shift.  This felt like a storm brewing. And they were right in its path.
