The sun beat down on Amelia Thistlewick's back like an ironclad fist. Sweat stung her eyes as she wrestled with the stubborn tangle of morning glories choking the tomato plants.  

Her farm, Thistlewick Acres, lay nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, a tapestry of emerald fields and vibrant wildflowers stitched together by dusty dirt roads. The air was thick with the scent of ripe peaches and freshly cut hay, punctuated by the lazy buzz of bees working diligently among the clover patches. But Amelia felt none of the peace that usually permeated the valley on these sun-drenched mornings. A knot of worry tightened in her stomach every time she glanced at the withered corn stalks swaying listlessly in the breeze - a stark reminder of the drought that had gripped their land for weeks.  


This year, unlike any other, felt different. Amelia needed to succeed. Her family's future depended on it.
