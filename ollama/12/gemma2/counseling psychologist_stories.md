The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Beaumont’s window, mirroring the tumult in her own heart. Her small office, tucked away on the second floor of an old brick building downtown, usually felt like a sanctuary. Today, it was suffocatingly claustrophobic. The scent of lavender candles, normally calming, now felt cloying. 

Amelia rubbed her temples, trying to quell the persistent ache behind her eyes.  Her phone buzzed – another message from her sister, demanding an update on their mother’s increasingly erratic behavior. Amelia sighed. Dealing with her own family issues while simultaneously guiding others through theirs was proving to be a Sisyphean task.

She glanced at the clock: 4:30 pm. Just thirty minutes until her last appointment of the day, a young man named Ethan who'd been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. He was usually quiet, but there was an underlying desperation in his emails that hinted at something more profound. Amelia hoped she could offer him some solace before the deluge outside reached its peak. 


**Setting:** A small, cluttered counseling office on the second floor of a historic brick building in a bustling downtown area. The city is caught in a heavy rainstorm, mirroring the emotional turmoil within the office.
