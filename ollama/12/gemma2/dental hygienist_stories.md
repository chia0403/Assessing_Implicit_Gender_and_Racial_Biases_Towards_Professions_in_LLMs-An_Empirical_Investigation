The insistent hum of the suction motor was the soundtrack to Amelia Rose Harper's life. It vibrated through her hands, up her arms, and settled into her bones like a familiar heartbeat.  She adjusted the angled mirror, catching a glimpse of Mrs. Henderson’s perpetually worried frown in the reflection. 

Amelia worked at Aspen Dental in the bustling heart of Denver, Colorado, a city she loved for its grit and sunshine. The clinic itself was a symphony of sterile white, the scent of antiseptic mingling with a faint whiff of cinnamon-flavored mouthwash. A steady stream of patients flowed through, each carrying their own anxieties and stories – from chipped teeth from bike accidents to missing molars lost in the throes of teenage rebellion. Amelia had seen it all, and she handled it with calm efficiency, her years as a dental hygienist having honed her into an instrument of peace and painless procedures. 


Today, however, something felt different.  The hum of the suction seemed louder, Mrs. Henderson’s frown appeared deeper, and a prickle of unease danced at the edge of Amelia's awareness. As she reached for the floss, a sudden, inexplicable chill swept through the room.
