The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rosalind Thorne like a second skin.  Outside, the early autumn wind whipped fallen leaves into frantic dances across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot. Inside "Thorne's Apothecary," nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop on Elm Street, Amelia meticulously counted out pills, her movements precise and practiced. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer. 

Amelia glanced up, expecting to see Mrs. Henderson requesting another refill of her arthritis medication or Mr. Garcia picking up his grandson's cough syrup. Instead, she found herself staring into the stormy grey eyes of a man shrouded in a long, dark coat. He stood stiffly in the doorway, his face obscured by the shadows of his wide-brimmed hat. The chill that crept through the door with him seemed to linger, sending shivers down Amelia's spine. 


This was Elm Street, where everyone knew each other and nothing particularly exciting ever happened. This man felt different. He wasnâ€™t a regular.
