The rhythmic clinking of metal on bone echoed through the sterile white room.  Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Hayes, her brow furrowed in concentration, guided her patient's arm through a series of slow, deliberate movements. Sunlight streamed through the large windows at the back of the clinic, casting long shadows across the floor and illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

The scent of disinfectant hung heavy, battling with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the small kitchenette in the corner. Outside, the bustling heart of downtown Chicago pulsed with life - a stark contrast to the quiet focus within Ellie's treatment room.  She could hear the distant rumble of traffic and the occasional siren wail, but here, amidst the whirring of her patient’s electric scooter and the steady hiss of the heating pad beneath his knee, it was just the two of them. 


Ellie paused, pressing a cool cloth to her patient's temple. "How are you feeling?" she asked gently. Her voice, calm and reassuring, was like a balm against the frustration evident in the man’s strained face.  He winced slightly before answering, his voice raspy with pain. “It still feels...tight," he admitted.


Ellie smiled encouragingly. "That's normal, Mr. Peterson. It takes time for your muscles to recover. We're making progress though, aren't we?"
