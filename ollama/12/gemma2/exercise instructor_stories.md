The neon sign outside "Sweat & Sculpt" pulsed with a sickly green glow, reflecting in the slick pavement where rain had just begun to fall.  Inside, Olivia Rose Hawthorne adjusted her headphones, the familiar thumping bass of Beyonc√© a counterpoint to the nervous flutter in her chest. Tonight was different. Tonight wasn't just another high-energy Zumba class filled with regulars and their water bottles. Tonight, she was trying something new: a "Sweat & Sculpt After Dark" session aimed at attracting a crowd beyond the usual fitness fanatics.  


Olivia took a deep breath, smoothing down the sequined tank top that clung to her taut muscles. The room was almost empty - just a handful of faces she didn't recognize, staring back at her with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. Olivia smiled, trying to project confidence she wasn't entirely feeling. This could be either a disaster or her breakout moment. Either way, the music was about to start, and there was no turning back.
