The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Josephine "Amy" Bellweather's head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rows of gleaming, overpriced kitchen appliances. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, drumming her fingers against the chipped enamel of a display refrigerator. The store was nearly empty, a Friday afternoon lull just before the weekend rush began.  

Amy adjusted her smile – a practiced expression honed over years of pushing unwanted features and inflated prices on unsuspecting customers. It felt like wallpaper at this point, painted onto her face every morning before entering this appliance purgatory. 

She glanced at the digital clock ticking above the manager's office door: 3:57 pm. Just three minutes until she could escape into the familiar chaos of the Friday evening commute, a symphony of screeching brakes and impatient horns that was somehow more soothing than this sterile silence.


This was Appliances Plus, a sprawling store on the outskirts of Elmwood, California – a town where dreams went to die alongside their outdated refrigerators.
