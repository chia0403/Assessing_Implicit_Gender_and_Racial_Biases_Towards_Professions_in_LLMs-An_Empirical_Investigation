The aroma of lavender oil and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of "Shear Delight."  Elara Willowbrook, her auburn braids looped neatly around her head like fragrant vines, expertly maneuvered her shears through a cascade of silver curls. She hummed along to the old jazz record spinning on the turntable, a familiar tune that usually calmed even the most anxious clients. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced across her skin, and the usual comforting rhythm of the scissors seemed off-key. 

Outside, the once vibrant street of Elmwood Avenue was shrouded in an unnatural mist. The shop's windows, normally reflecting a kaleidoscope of colors from the bustling city life, were now opaque, reflecting only the dim glow of Elaraâ€™s lamp and the unsettling greyness outside. A shiver ran down her spine, leaving goosebumps on her arms despite the warmth of the salon.


What started as an ordinary Tuesday morning was quickly turning into something... unusual.
