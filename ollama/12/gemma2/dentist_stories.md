The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Evelyn Aster's cluttered desk. Tiny instruments lay scattered like fallen soldiers, each gleaming with an eerie sheen after being scrubbed clean by her assistant. The air hung thick with the antiseptic scent of mouthwash and the faint metallic tang of blood – a reminder that beneath the veneer of calm, this was the battleground where she fought cavities and anxieties, one tooth at a time. 

Outside, the bustling heart of downtown Chicago throbbed with its usual frenetic energy. But within the confines of her cozy practice, tucked away on a quiet side street, Dr. Aster found solace in the predictable rhythm of drill against enamel, the gentle whirring of suction tubes, and the murmured anxieties of her patients.  

It was during one such murmur, a tale of misplaced dentures and childhood fears, that she heard it – a faint, almost imperceptible clinking sound coming from the back room. Her brow furrowed. She hadn't heard anything like that before. And in Dr. Aster’s world, nothing went unnoticed.
