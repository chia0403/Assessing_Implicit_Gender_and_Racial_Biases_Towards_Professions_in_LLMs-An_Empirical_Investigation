The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill seeping through the ancient oak walls of Willow Creek Spa. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, each drop exploding into a miniature geyser on the moss-covered roof outside. Inside, the warm glow of Himalayan salt lamps cast a soft amber light on Amelia Rosethorn's nimble fingers as they worked their magic. 

Amelia wasn't just a massage therapist; she was a sculptor of flesh and bone, a weaver of tension and release. Her clients often left her little haven feeling like reborn beings, their shoulders lighter, their minds clear, their spirits buoyed by the gentle touch of her hands. 


But tonight, Amelia felt a knot of unease tightening in her own chest, a sense of foreboding that had nothing to do with the tempest raging outside. It was the first time she'd ever experienced such an undercurrent of dread before a client arrived. The air crackled with anticipation, and the normally soothing atmosphere seemed charged with a strange, almost electric energy.
