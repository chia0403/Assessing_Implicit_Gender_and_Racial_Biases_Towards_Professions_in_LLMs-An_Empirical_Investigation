The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sterile glow over the cramped office. It was one of those Tuesday afternoons where the air felt thick with unspoken anxieties, a palpable weight settling on every desk and chair in the bustling school counseling center. Outside, the April sun dripped through the dusty windows, painting vibrant streaks across the worn carpet. 

Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reviewed Sarah Miller's file, tapped her pen against her clipboard.  Sarah, a bright but withdrawn eighth-grader, had been exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior - sudden outbursts of anger, unexplained absences from class, and an unsettling obsession with shadows. Eleanor knew this was more than typical teenage angst. There was a darkness lurking beneath the surface, and she needed to find it before it consumed Sarah entirely.  


The door creaked open, shattering the tense silence, and a lanky boy with hesitant eyes stood in the doorway. He clutched a worn paperback to his chest, its cover depicting a desolate landscape under a blood-red sky. It was Michael Davies, and Eleanor knew this wouldn't be just another routine session. This boy carried the weight of secrets, and she felt a chill crawl down her spine as he spoke. "Ms. Vance," he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights, "I think something bad is going to happen."
