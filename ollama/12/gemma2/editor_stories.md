A plume of steam rose from the overflowing trash bin beside her as she wrestled with her umbrella against the relentless Manchester drizzle. Inside "Words & Wonders," the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

A symphony of keyboard clicks and frustrated sighs echoed from the cubicles behind her, a soundtrack to the slow demise of dreams in this forgotten corner of literary purgatory.
