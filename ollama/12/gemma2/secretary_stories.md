The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Evelyn Beatrice Finch's manicured nails against her cherrywood desk was the only sound disturbing the hushed stillness of Mr. Hawthorne's office. Outside, the rain lashed against the towering windows of the grand Art Deco building, blurring the already hazy city lights into a watercolour wash. The air inside was thick with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco, remnants of Mr. Hawthorne's afternoon cigar. Evelyn glanced at her wristwatch - 5:27 pm. Just another twenty-three minutes until she could escape this tomb of mahogany and brass and disappear into the anonymity of the teeming city streets. She sighed, smoothing the crisp lines of her navy skirt and reaching for a fresh cup of tea from the ornate silver pot perched on her desk.  


This was Evelyn's life - the dutiful secretary to the renowned art collector and philanthropist, Mr. Theodore Hawthorne. A life of quiet efficiency, meticulously kept files, and the occasional thrilling glimpse into the world of exclusive galleries and lavish parties. But tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a palpable shift that made the hairs on Evelyn's neck stand on end.
