The air in "Mort & Cleaver" was thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. Not the metallic tang of blood, no - this was the warmth of roasted garlic mingling with clove-studded beef, all seasoned by the ever-present whisper of sawdust from the worn cutting block. A symphony only a butcher could truly appreciate. 

Bartholomew "Mort" McTavish knew every note in that orchestra. His calloused hands, stained crimson and ochre by years of carving and prepping, moved with practiced grace across the glistening slabs of meat laid out on his counter. His apron, embroidered with a whimsical caricature of a cleaver chomping a rib-eye, was more than just fabric; it was a badge of honor, a testament to his craft. 

Outside, the sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of Alder's End, casting long shadows across the ramshackle shops lining High Street. Mort, however, existed in his own world - a butcher's paradise where each cut held a story, and every bone was imbued with history.  Little did he know, that familiar symphony would soon be punctuated by a discordant note - one that threatened to shatter the peaceful rhythm of his life.
