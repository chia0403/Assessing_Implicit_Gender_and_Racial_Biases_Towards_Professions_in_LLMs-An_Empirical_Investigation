The rhythmic beeping of heart monitors was like a lullaby to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, a melody she'd come to know better than her own heartbeat.  Her shift in the intensive care unit at Mercy General Hospital in Seattle was just starting, and already the air hung heavy with a mix of antiseptic and anxiety. Outside, the city was awakening, but inside these walls, life was a fragile dance played out on beds lined with wires and tubes. Amelia ran a hand through her dark hair, catching a stray curl that escaped from its braid. The faint scent of lavender hand sanitizer clung to her scrubs, a comforting reminder that she was prepared, ready to face whatever the day might bring. 


Her gaze fell upon Mr. Davies, an elderly man admitted yesterday after a cardiac arrest. His monitorâ€™s rhythm was erratic, a jittery line wavering precariously between life and death. Amelia knew his family would be arriving soon. She could only hope she had enough strength to give them the same calm reassurance that she gave herself.
