The air hung thick with the smell of graphite and sweat in the cavernous Drafting Hall. Sunlight struggled to penetrate through the grime-coated skylights, casting long, dancing shadows across the rows of desks where dozens of young men hunched over their drawing boards. A symphony of scratchy pencils, whirring gears on drafting machines, and hushed whispers filled the space, punctuated by the occasional exasperated sigh from a frustrated draftsman.

Among them sat Elias Nathaniel Finchley, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously sketched the intricate lines of a new steam engine design. At nineteen, Elias was already considered a prodigy amongst his peers, known for his keen eye for detail and unwavering dedication to precision. But today, the familiar rhythm of drafting felt off-kilter. A knot of anxiety tightened in his stomach, fueled by a strange restlessness that refused to be ignored.  

Elias glanced up at the imposing clock on the far wall â€“ precisely 3:00 pm. Only three hours until the final review with Mr. Beaumont, the Head Engineer, and the chance to showcase his latest creation. A shiver of anticipation ran down his spine. This was it. His ticket out of this dusty hall, into a future where he could design magnificent machines that would change the world.
