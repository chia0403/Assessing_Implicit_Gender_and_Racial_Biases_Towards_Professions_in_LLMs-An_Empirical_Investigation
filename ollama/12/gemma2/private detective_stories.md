Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, each drop exploding in a miniature burst against the dust-coated glass. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an anemic green glow across the worn linoleum floor and swirling cigarette smoke that hung thick in the air. 

Bart himself was hunched over his desk, a half-empty bottle of rye sweating beside him, its amber liquid mirroring the sickly light filtering through the haze. His trench coat, once a symbol of suave mystery, now sagged with dampness and neglect. He idly swirled the ice in his glass, watching it melt into oblivion, much like his latest case.  

The office was nestled on a forgotten side street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. The air smelled of stale beer, desperation, and the faint tang of beignets from the nearby bakery. This wasn't the glamorous world of noir fiction; this was the real deal, where dreams went to die, and hope drowned in a sea of bourbon. 


Bart sighed, pushing away the empty bottle with a weary groan. His current client – a jittery young woman named Evangeline LeDoux – had vanished hours ago, leaving only a cryptic note and a trail of unanswered questions.  

A knock on the door startled him, breaking the suffocating silence. He knew this wasn't going to be an easy night.
