The stale scent of burnt coffee hung thick in the air of Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes' office. It wasn't that she didn't like coffee; it was just that her mornings were perpetually rushed. Today was no different. Ellie, a woman forged from years of battling bureaucratic red tape and unruly clients, wrestled with the tangle of her auburn hair as she scanned through case files on her desk. Outside, a storm raged across Omaha, Nebraska, wind howling like a pack of feral dogs against the windows of the probation office building. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already bleak cityscape beyond. 

Ellie sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. The case file before her belonged to Damien Thorne, a young man she'd been assigned just last week. He was on probation for petty theft, but there was something about his eyes in their first meeting - a flicker of desperation beneath the defiance - that had set Ellie on edge. 


She glanced at the rain-streaked clock. It was 8:57 am, and Damien's appointment was scheduled for nine. The storm wasn't letting up, and Ellie knew he probably wouldn't make it. He might be facing a court date if he missed his probation check-in, which would only worsen his situation.
