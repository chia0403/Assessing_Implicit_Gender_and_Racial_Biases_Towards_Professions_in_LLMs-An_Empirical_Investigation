The rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the relentless rhythm of Dr. Evelyn Alistair's thoughts. Her office, normally a sanctuary of calming neutrals, felt oppressive tonight, the dim glow of the Himalayan salt lamp doing little to dispel the gloom. She stared at the file before her: "Johnathon Hayes - Anxiety and Insomnia." Another case, another soul grappling with the invisible demons that plagued their minds. Johnathon's story was common enough – a high-powered executive spiraling under the weight of relentless expectations, his sleep sacrificed at the altar of success. Yet, something about his eyes in the photograph, a flicker of desperate hope amidst the exhaustion, tugged at Evelyn's empathy. 

She was stationed on the 12th floor of a sleek glass building overlooking Central Park, the city lights blurring through the rain like a kaleidoscope of fleeting dreams. The skyscrapers around her seemed to reach for the storm-ridden sky, each window a silent witness to untold stories – tales of ambition, heartbreak, and everything in between. Evelyn's work, she often thought, was like navigating this urban labyrinth, guiding lost souls towards a semblance of peace amidst the cacophony. But tonight, the city felt less like a tapestry of life and more like a reflection of her own internal storm.
