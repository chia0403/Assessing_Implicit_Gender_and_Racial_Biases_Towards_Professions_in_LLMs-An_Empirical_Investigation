The stale scent of antiseptic and regret hung heavy in the air of interrogation room 3B. Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted her glasses, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she surveyed the scene. The man before her, Michael Garrison, slumped in the chair like a discarded marionette, his eyes vacant and unseeing.  His normally neatly combed dark hair was now tousled, strands clinging to his forehead with an oily sheen that mirrored the desperation etched on his face. 

Eleanor had been called in after the initial police interrogation hit a wall. Garrison, accused of murdering his wife, remained stubbornly silent, his only response a mumbled "I don't remember" that echoed through the stark, fluorescent-lit room like a broken record. She knew the truth was buried somewhere within those impenetrable walls, just waiting for her to chip away at them with the tools of her trade â€“ observation, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human psyche.  

The city outside hummed with oblivious life, a stark contrast to the chilling silence that blanketed this room. Outside, it was the vibrant heart of Chicago, a metropolis buzzing with energy and possibility. But inside these walls, Eleanor found herself facing a different kind of darkness, one that threatened to consume both her subject and, perhaps, herself.
