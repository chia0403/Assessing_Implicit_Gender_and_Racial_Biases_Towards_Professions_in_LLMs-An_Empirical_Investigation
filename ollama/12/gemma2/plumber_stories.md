Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam's van, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of sound that echoed his own pounding heart. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against the worn leather, as he wrestled the van through the flooded backstreets of Port Hope, Nova Scotia.  

The air was thick with the smell of salt and wet seaweed, mingled with the acrid tang of diesel fuel from passing trucks struggling to navigate the slick roads. The streetlights cast a sickly yellow glow that barely pierced the swirling mist, making it difficult to see even the potholes lurking beneath the rushing water. 

Bart was on his way to Mrs. MacAllister's, an elderly woman who lived in one of the quaint, weathered houses perched precariously on the edge of the harbour.  Her call had come just after the storm began – a burst pipe threatening to flood her basement. A simple job, normally, but with the roads like this and the wind howling like a banshee, Bart wasn't feeling so confident. This storm was unlike any he’d seen before, and he couldn't shake the feeling that things were about to get worse.
