The humid Georgia air clung to Elias "Eli"  Montgomery like a damp shroud as he climbed the rickety ladder, his heavy toolbox bumping against his hip with every rung. The porch light flickered precariously above him, casting dancing shadows across the peeling paint of the Victorian mansion. 

He grimaced. This wasn't the kind of restoration project Eli usually took on. He was more accustomed to rewiring tired apartments and troubleshooting faulty circuits in strip malls. But the old house had a certain charm, even in its dilapidated state, and Mrs. Hathaway, the owner, had offered him a hefty sum for his troubles.

Eli gripped the frayed wiring with calloused hands, inspecting the exposed copper strands for any sign of damage. The smell of mildew and damp earth filled his nostrils as he peered into the darkness beyond the porch light's feeble glow. A chill ran down his spine despite the summer heat. 


He was alone, surrounded by shadows, and the only sound was the creaking of the old house settling around him. This wasnâ€™t just a wiring problem; it felt like something else lurked within those darkened walls, waiting to be discovered.
