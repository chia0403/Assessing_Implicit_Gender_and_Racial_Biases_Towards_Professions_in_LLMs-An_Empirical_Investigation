The air in Eliza Blackwood's atelier hummed with the low thrum of her sewing machine, punctuated by the occasional sharp snip of shears. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing above bolts of silk and velvet draped across vintage dress forms. The scent of lavender sachets mingled with the sharper tang of freshly cut fabric, creating a uniquely Eliza fragrance.

Eliza herself was a whirlwind of motion. Her nimble fingers danced across the delicate ivory lace she was embroidering, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously stitched tiny pearls onto the bodice of a wedding gown. Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh buzzed with life, but here, within the comforting confines of her atelier, time seemed to slow, dictated by the rhythm of needle and thread. 

But today, even the soothing hum of Eliza's world couldn't drown out the insistent rapping on her door.  A knot tightened in Eliza's stomach. She knew who it was before she even glanced at the frosted glass panel. It was time for a reckoning.
