The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Hawthorne's neck, turning his already-ruddy skin crimson. Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes as he wrestled a stubborn wisteria vine into submission. Eli wasn't one for complaining – calloused hands and sun-bleached hair were badges of honor in his world. But today, even the whispering breeze through the ancient oak trees couldn't quell the oppressive heat emanating from the cobblestone courtyard of Mrs. Cavendish's Victorian manor. 

Eli surveyed his work: a riotous tangle of lavender, roses, and rosemary bordered by vibrant boxwoods, all meticulously sculpted to frame the ornate fountain at its center. He inhaled deeply, the sweet scent of blooming jasmine mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil. This was his sanctuary – transforming neglected patches into flourishing havens, breathing life into spaces forgotten by time.
