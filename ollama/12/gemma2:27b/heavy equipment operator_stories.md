The rusty sun bled across the horizon, painting the sky in bruised oranges and sickly yellows. The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Elias "Eli" Thorne like a damp shroud as he maneuvered his aging Caterpillar D9 bulldozer through the overgrown scrubland. Sweat slicked his calloused hands on the controls, his brow furrowed beneath the brim of his faded trucker cap. He could smell the ozone tang of distant lightning, a harbinger of the afternoon storms that were a constant threat during the rainy season in the Florida Everglades. 

Eli squinted at the GPS unit mounted on the dashboard, its screen flickering with the digital outline of the canal he was tasked with digging.  This stretch was proving particularly stubborn, riddled with hidden pockets of limestone and dense root systems that stubbornly clung to the earth. He muttered a curse under his breath as the dozer shuddered, its massive blade encountering another immovable obstacle. It was going to be a long day.
