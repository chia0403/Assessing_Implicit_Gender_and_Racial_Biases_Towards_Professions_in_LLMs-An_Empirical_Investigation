Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Brighton's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of artificial strawberry from the yogurt parfait she was supposed to be recommending to her client. Amelia, a registered dietician with a passion for whole foods and honest eating, grimaced at the sugary concoction. This wasn't what she envisioned when she opened "Nourish & Thrive" â€“ a quaint little practice nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, dedicated to helping people build healthier relationships with food.  

Instead, she was facing Mrs. Henrietta Peabody, a formidable woman with perfectly coiffed silver hair and an unwavering belief that happiness came packaged in brightly colored containers labeled "Low Fat!" and "Sugar Free!". Amelia knew convincing Mrs. Peabody that real food held the key to well-being would be an uphill battle. But Amelia was determined. She believed everyone deserved the chance to taste true nourishment, not just empty calories disguised as health.
