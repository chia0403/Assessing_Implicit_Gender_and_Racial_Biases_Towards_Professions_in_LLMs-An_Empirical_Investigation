Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the insistent throb in her own temples. It was the kind of dreary November afternoon that made even the most vibrant soul crave a hot bath and a good book.  Eleanor, however, was far from craving relaxation. A stack of patient files sat precariously on her desk, each representing another aching back, stiff neck, or misaligned hip she needed to soothe. 

Her clinic, nestled in a charming, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian building in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, usually buzzed with the comforting click of adjustments and the low murmur of conversations about posture and lifestyle. Today, however, it felt eerily quiet. The only sound besides the relentless rain was the ticking of an antique grandfather clock in the corner, its mournful chimes adding to the already melancholic atmosphere. 


Eleanor sighed, her gaze drawn to a framed photograph on her desk: a younger version of herself grinning broadly alongside her mentor, Dr. Evelyn Albright. Evelyn's wisdom and gentle touch had inspired Eleanor's own journey into chiropractic care.  As she stared at the picture, a pang of longing for simpler times washed over her. Lately, it felt like every adjustment was met with resistance, every attempt at holistic healing dismissed as "woo-woo" by some skeptical patients.
