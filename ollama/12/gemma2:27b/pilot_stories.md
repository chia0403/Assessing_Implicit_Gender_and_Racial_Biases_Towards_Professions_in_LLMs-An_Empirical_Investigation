The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Himalayas, painting the snow-capped summits in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple. Amelia "Ace" Chandra wrestled the aging Cessna 172 through a turbulent pocket of air, her knuckles white against the yoke. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping snow across the windshield, obscuring visibility. She was flying blind, relying solely on her instruments and years of experience navigating treacherous Himalayan weather patterns.

Ace's mission: to deliver medical supplies to a remote village nestled deep within the mountain range. A storm had cut off access for weeks, leaving the villagers desperate for medicine. Ace, known for her unwavering courage and ability to land in the most improbable locations, was their only hope.
