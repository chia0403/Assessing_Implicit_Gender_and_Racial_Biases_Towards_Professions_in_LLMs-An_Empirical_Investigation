The acrid stench of smoke stung Alistair Finch's nostrils even before the deafening wail of the sirens pierced the stillness of the pre-dawn hour. He jolted upright in his cot, adrenaline already surging through him. Another call. Another chance to dance with the devil in the heart of a roaring inferno.  Alistair scrambled into his turnout gear, the familiar weight comforting against his skin. Outside, the red and blue lights painted swirling patterns on the rain-slicked asphalt. He climbed aboard Engine 23, joining the rest of his crew – their faces grim but resolute under the flickering emergency lights.

Tonight's call: a three-story apartment building ablaze in the city’s industrial district. Alistair gripped the steel handrail as the engine roared to life, the rhythmic clatter of its diesel engine a steady heartbeat against the symphony of sirens growing louder with each passing block. He braced himself for the chaos that awaited them.
