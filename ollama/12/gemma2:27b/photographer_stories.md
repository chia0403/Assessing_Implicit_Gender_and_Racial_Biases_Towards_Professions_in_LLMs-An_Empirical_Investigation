Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon signs of Akihabara into impressionistic strokes of pink, blue, and green. Inside the cramped apartment, the air hung heavy with the scent of instant ramen and stale cigarette smoke. Kenji Nakamura sighed, setting down his well-worn camera on a cluttered table beside empty energy drink cans and overflowing ashtrays.  

Kenji wasn't known for success. He'd dreamed of capturing Tokyo's vibrant soul in photographs that would make people see the city anew, but reality had delivered a string of dead-end jobs shooting stock photos of ramen bowls and corporate headshots devoid of personality. Tonight, however, was different. He'd received an anonymous email, promising him access to something "truly extraordinary," something worth risking his meagre savings on.  

The email only provided a time and a cryptic location: midnight at the abandoned Hanayashiki amusement park, a decaying relic of Tokyo's past, where rusted Ferris wheels groaned in the wind like mournful ghosts. Kenjiâ€™s heart pounded with a mixture of trepidation and excitement. This was his chance, he knew it.  This was a story begging to be told.
