The air hung thick with the scent of garlic butter and desperation. Amelia Rose "Rosie" Diaz balanced precariously on her heels, navigating the crowded Friday night chaos of Luigi's Pizzeria. The red-and-white checkered tablecloths were stained with marinara sauce, the laughter of families punctuated by the clatter of forks and plates, and Rosie's smile felt stretched thin enough to snap.

Tonight was double shift, which meant she wouldn't see her tiny apartment until well past midnight. Rent was due next week, and her meager savings weren't looking too promising.  She longed for a different life, one where she wasn't dodging elbows and spilled soda, but the reality of being a waitress in this bustling Italian joint was all she had right now. 

As Rosie weaved between tables, she caught the eye of Mr. Esposito, Luigi's gruff, but secretly kindhearted, owner. He raised a bushy eyebrow, silently reminding her that Table Six needed their order taken, stat. Rosie sighed inwardly and straightened her apron, bracing herself for another round of "Can I get extra cheese?" and "Is this pepperoni?" questions.
