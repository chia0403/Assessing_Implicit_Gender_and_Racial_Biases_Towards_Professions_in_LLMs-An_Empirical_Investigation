The rusty hiss of static filled Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's ears as she tightened a loose connection on the ancient Zenith Transoceanic receiver.  Dust motes danced in the pale afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windows of her cramped workshop, illuminating the tangle of wires and vacuum tubes that sprawled across her workbench like metallic vines. The air hung heavy with the scent of solder and ozone, a familiar aroma that always brought a strange sense of comfort to Amy.

Her shop, nestled in the heart of a decaying industrial district on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, was a haven for forgotten technologies. Here, amongst the stacks of vintage radios, gramophones, and Bakelite telephones, Amy breathed life back into relics of a bygone era. Today's patient was a hulking behemoth from the 1930s, its mahogany cabinet adorned with intricate carvings and an inscription that read "Symphony in Sound."

But something wasn't right. Despite her best efforts, the receiver stubbornly refused to pick up anything but the incessant hiss. As Amy leaned closer, straining to hear through the cacophony, a faint whisper, barely audible above the static, tickled her ear. It was a voice, distorted and ethereal, speaking in a language she didn't recognize.
