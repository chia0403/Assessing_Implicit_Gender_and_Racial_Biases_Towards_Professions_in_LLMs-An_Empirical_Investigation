The rusted clang of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' wrench echoed through the cavernous basement. Damp air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and something distinctly metallic, making Bart wrinkle his nose beneath his worn leather cap. He was knee-deep in tangled copper pipes, wrestling with a stubborn drainpipe that refused to budge. A symphony of dripping water played against the concrete floor, each drop like a mocking drumbeat against his already frayed nerves.

Bart squinted at the mess before him. This Victorian mansion, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the stormy North Sea, was proving to be his most challenging job yet. The pipes were a tangled labyrinth, seemingly designed by a madman with an unhealthy obsession for brass fittings and impossible angles.  He hadn't even begun tackling the ancient boiler that wheezed like a consumptive dragon in the corner. 

Bart sighed, wiping sweat from his brow with a grimy hand. He knew this job was going to be a long one.
