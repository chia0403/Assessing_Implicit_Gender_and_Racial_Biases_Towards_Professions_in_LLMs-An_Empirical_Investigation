The aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lemon-scented cleaner that Mrs. Henderson, the building manager, insisted on using despite its unsettling chemical tang. Amelia Thistlewick sighed and pushed a stray curl behind her ear, wincing as the cheap plastic clip dug into her scalp. 

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of Bartholomew & Sons accounting firm, the sun beat down relentlessly on the asphalt jungle of downtown Chicago. The city buzzed with its usual frenetic energy, oblivious to Amelia's simmering frustration. She tapped a chipped fingernail against her desk, the rhythmic clicking the only sound in the cavernous, echoing office. Mr. Bartholomew, their portly and perpetually flustered boss, was away at a "crucial" client meeting, leaving Amelia alone with stacks of invoices taller than she was.

A bead of sweat trickled down Amelia's temple. Today was Friday, the day she usually escaped her paper prison for a blissful weekend filled with walks in Lincoln Park and stolen slices of deep-dish pizza. But today, the universe seemed determined to keep her chained to her desk.

Just then, the phone rang, its shrill whine slicing through the tense silence like a rusty saw blade. Amelia braced herself. It was probably another irate client complaining about a misplaced decimal point or demanding an immediate refund. She picked up the receiver, plastering on her most professional smile even though the caller couldn't see it.

"Bartholomew & Sons, Amelia Thistlewick speaking," she chirped, already dreading what awaited her on the other end of the line.
