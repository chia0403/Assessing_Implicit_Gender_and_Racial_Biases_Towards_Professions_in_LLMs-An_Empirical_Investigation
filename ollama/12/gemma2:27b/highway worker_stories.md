The Nevada sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched before him. He squinted, adjusting the brim of his battered Stetson, and wiped the back of his hand across his forehead, smearing grime and sunscreen into a grimy paste. Around him, the desert hummed with cicadas and the distant whine of eighteen-wheelers rumbling down Highway 95.

Silas was patching potholes near the desolate ghost town of Rhyolite, his work punctuated by the rhythmic thud of the asphalt tamper and the occasional honk from impatient drivers. It wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills and allowed him to escape the claustrophobia of city life. Out here, under the vast expanse of sky, Silas felt a sense of peace he couldn't find anywhere else.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease snaked its way up his spine as he stared at the endless horizon. The silence between the cicadas seemed louder, the wind carrying a whisper that sounded suspiciously like a name... his name.
