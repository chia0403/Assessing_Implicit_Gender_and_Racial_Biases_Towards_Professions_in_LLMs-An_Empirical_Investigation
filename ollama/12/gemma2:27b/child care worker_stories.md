The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sugary sweetness of fruit snacks and something faintly sour - probably spit-up. Eloise Cartwright sighed, tucking a stray curl behind her ear as she surveyed the chaos of the playroom. Building blocks lay scattered across the floor like fallen dominoes, a rogue stuffed giraffe peeked out from under a table, and a chorus of giggles erupted from the corner where three toddlers were engaged in an elaborate game involving a plastic tea set and a mountain of cushions.

Eloise loved her job at Little Wonders Daycare, she truly did. She adored the endless energy of the children, their boundless curiosity, and the joy they found in the simplest things. But some days, like today, the sheer volume of it all felt overwhelming.  Just then, little Maya, a girl with bright eyes and a penchant for pulling Eloise's hair, toddled over, clutching a handful of crayons. "Eloise," she declared, her voice thick with toddler lisp, "me color! You color too?" 


Eloise knelt down, meeting Maya's gaze. "Of course, I'll color with you," she said with a smile, taking a crayon from the outstretched hand and joining Maya on the floor. For a moment, amidst the chaos, there was peace. Just two friends, sharing a simple joy. But Eloise knew that peace wouldn't last long. Soon enough, the tea party would erupt into a full-blown tantrum, someone would inevitably discover the forbidden cookie jar, and the cycle of delightful mayhem would begin anew.
