The wind whispered secrets through the stalks of golden wheat, rustling them like an old woman shaking out her shawl. Elias Blackwood squinted at the horizon, where the ochre sky bled into the emerald hills. A storm was brewing, he could smell it - a sharp, metallic tang in the air. He'd need to get the sheep sheltered before the first drops fell.

Elias wasn't a man who liked storms, not since the one that had ripped through his farm ten years ago, tearing down the barn and claiming his wife. He still remembered her laugh echoing through the fields, as bright and clear as a robin's song. Now, only silence greeted him, punctuated by the mournful caw of crows circling overhead. 

He tightened his grip on his weathered walking stick, its wood worn smooth from years of use. The farm was all he had left - a patchwork of rolling hills dotted with fields of barley and oats, a ramshackle farmhouse perched precariously on the edge of a ravine, and the memories that clung to him like burrs. He had vowed to keep it going, for himself and for her memory. 

But lately, things had been hard. The rains were unpredictable, the soil stubborn, and the price of grain dwindling. Elias knew he couldn't go on like this forever.  He needed a change, a spark of hope in the endless cycle of sowing and reaping. He just didn't know where to find it.
