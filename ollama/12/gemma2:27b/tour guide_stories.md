The midday sun beat down on Elara Nightingale's shoulders as she ushered her group of bewildered tourists towards the crumbling archway. Dust devils danced in the parched courtyard beyond, swirling around the weathered sandstone columns that held up the sky like skeletal fingers. This was Petra, ancient city carved into the rose-colored cliffs of Jordan, and Elara, a woman whose lineage stretched back to the Nabataean traders who once thrived here, felt a familiar pang of pride mixed with melancholy.

"Through this archway," she announced in her crisp, accented English, gesturing towards the imposing structure, "lies the Siq, the only entrance to Petra. Prepare yourselves for a journey unlike any other."


Her group, a motley crew of selfie-stick wielding retirees and wide-eyed college students, shuffled forward tentatively, their expressions a mixture of anticipation and apprehension. Elara smiled inwardly. They wouldn't forget this day. Petra had that effect on people.
