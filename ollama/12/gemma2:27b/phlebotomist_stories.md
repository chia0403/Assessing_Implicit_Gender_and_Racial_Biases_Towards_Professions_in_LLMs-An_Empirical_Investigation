The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor.  ElizaBeth "Eli" Ramirez tapped her pen against the clipboard, the sound sharp in the otherwise silent waiting room. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly, baking the asphalt parking lot into shimmering waves of heat. Inside, however, the air conditioner battled valiantly against the desert's relentless assault, creating a cool oasis within the sterile walls of Desert Oasis Medical Labs. 

Eli sighed. It was another slow Tuesday morning.  She'd already drawn blood from three elderly patients for routine checkups and a grumpy teenager who swore he fainted at the sight of needles (though his flushed cheeks and sweaty brow told a different story). The silence, punctuated only by the occasional cough or rustle of a magazine, pressed in on her like the desert heat outside.

She longed for something more exciting than the monotonous routine of veins and vials.  Maybe today someone would walk through that door with a mysterious ailment, their blood holding clues to a forgotten disease or an undiagnosed condition. Maybe today she'd be part of something bigger than just filling test tubes.
