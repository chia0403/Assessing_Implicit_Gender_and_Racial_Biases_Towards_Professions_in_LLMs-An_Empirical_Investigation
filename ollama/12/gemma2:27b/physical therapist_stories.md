Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The cramped space, tucked away in the back corner of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, felt suffocating tonight. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionist painting, their cheerful glow mocking Eleanor's current mood. She stared at the file in front of her: Mr. Thomas Blackwood, 58, quadriplegic after a motorcycle accident.  His case was complex, his recovery uncertain, and Eleanor, despite being one of the most skilled physical therapists in the city, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach. This wasn't just another patient; this felt personal.

The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lilies from the bouquet on her desk â€“ a gift from Mrs. Blackwood, filled with hopeful whispers and desperate pleas for Eleanor to work her magic. The weight of those expectations pressed down on Eleanor like a lead blanket. Could she truly help Mr. Blackwood regain his life? Or was this another case destined to end in heartbreak?
