The scent of damp earth mingled with the sharp tang of pine needles as Theodore Bartholomew "Theo" Finch crouched beside a bed of rhododendrons, meticulously pruning away dead blooms. Dawn painted the sky in soft hues of pink and lavender, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor. Theo hummed a tuneless melody, his weathered hands working with practiced ease.

Blackwood Manor, perched atop a craggy hill overlooking the churning North Atlantic, was more than just Theo's workplace; it was his sanctuary. For twenty years, he had tended to its sprawling gardens, finding solace in the rhythm of nature and the quiet solitude the manor offered. The imposing gothic structure itself held an air of mystery, with its gargoyle-studded turrets and ivy-choked walls whispering tales of a bygone era.
