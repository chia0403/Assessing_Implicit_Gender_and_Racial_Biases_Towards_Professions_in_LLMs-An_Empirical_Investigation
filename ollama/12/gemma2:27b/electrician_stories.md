Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Finch's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the symphony of clanging tools and whirring motors. The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and hot solder, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp wood and dust. Outside, the late summer storm raged, plunging the world into an oppressive grey.

Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously soldered a delicate circuit board under the harsh glare of a single work lamp. His calloused fingers moved with the practiced grace of a surgeon, carefully weaving copper threads onto the intricate pathways of the board.  The workshop, crammed full of spare parts, tools, and half-finished projects, was his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the chaos of the world outside and lose himself in the satisfying hum of electricity. 

But tonight, even Elias couldn't ignore the insistent ringing of his phone. He wiped his hands on a rag, grumbling under his breath as he answered. "Elias Finch, electrician extraordinaire," he said wryly, "what can I do for you?" The voice on the other end was frantic, pleading. It was Mrs. Hawthorne from Elmwood Manor, and her power had gone out again.
