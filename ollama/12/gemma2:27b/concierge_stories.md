The scent of lilies and lemon polish hung heavy in the air of The Grand Meridian Hotel, a fragrance Eleanor Beaumont had come to associate with both luxury and quiet desperation. From her post behind the mahogany concierge desk, she surveyed the glittering lobby: marble floors reflecting the afternoon sun streaming through arched windows, plush velvet armchairs occupied by impeccably dressed guests scrolling on their phones, a string quartet playing Vivaldi with an air of detached melancholy. Eleanor knew this symphony well; it was the soundtrack to countless forgotten anniversaries, clandestine meetings, and broken hearts.  

Today, however, a discordant note threatened to disrupt the carefully orchestrated peace. A young woman, her face stained with tears, clutched a crumpled letter at the foot of the grand staircase. Her sobs echoed through the hushed lobby, drawing curious glances from the other guests. Eleanor watched as she sank onto a nearby bench, shoulders shaking with silent despair. This was a problem Eleanor Beaumont knew how to solve. She adjusted her perfectly coiffed bun, straightened the crimson silk scarf framing her neck, and rose from her chair.
