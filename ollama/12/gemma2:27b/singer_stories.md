The air hung thick and humid in the back alley of The Blue Moon Saloon, smelling of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and desperation.  Neon signs flickered erratically, casting an unsettling purple glow on the overflowing dumpster and the lone figure hunched over a battered guitar case. This was Seraphina "Sera" Delacroix's stage - not the one bathed in spotlights she dreamed of, but the one carved out by necessity.

Sera strummed a melancholic melody, her voice, husky with unshed tears, weaving tales of lost love and shattered dreams. Her audience tonight consisted of two stray cats fighting over a discarded chicken bone and a cockroach scuttling across the grimy brick wall. Yet, Sera sang as if she were facing a stadium full of adoring fans, pouring her soul into every note.
