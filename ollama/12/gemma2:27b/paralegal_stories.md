Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law office, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Cartwright's chest. Stacks of files towered precariously on her desk, each representing another desperate soul seeking justice in this tangled web we called the legal system.

Her heart yearned for something more meaningful, something that ignited a spark within her.
