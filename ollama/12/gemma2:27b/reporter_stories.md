Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the 'Lucky Clover' bar sign across the street. Inside the cramped newsroom, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee. Amelia "Amy" Chen, her auburn hair escaping its perpetually messy bun, tapped away furiously at her ancient typewriter, ignoring the insistent drip from a leak above her desk.  

The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows across the faded map of Gotham City pinned to the wall behind her. A city known for its glittering skyscrapers and shadowy underbelly, Gotham was a place where ambition could soar and dreams could crumble beneath the weight of corruption. And Amy Chen, a reporter for the struggling 'Gotham Gazette', was determined to expose the truth, one gritty story at a time.

Tonight, however, she wasn't chasing leads or digging through dusty archives. Tonight, she was facing a deadline â€“ a particularly brutal one imposed by her chain-smoking editor, Mr. Gallagher. He wanted a story on the recent string of seemingly random disappearances plaguing the city's poorest districts. A story Amy suspected held more than met the eye.
