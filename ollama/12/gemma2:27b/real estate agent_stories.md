The humid Charleston air clung to Evangeline "Evie" Beaumont like a second skin as she navigated the cobblestone streets, her heels clicking a staccato rhythm against the uneven stones. The scent of jasmine and saltwater battled for dominance in the air, a fragrant reminder of the city's unique charm. Above, Spanish moss dripped from ancient live oaks, casting intricate shadows that danced across the historic houses lining Rainbow Row. Evie, however, was too preoccupied to appreciate the picturesque scene.

She had just received a frantic call from Mrs. Clementine Davenport, her most demanding client, whose dream Charleston mansion seemed to be slipping through her perfectly manicured fingers. The property, a grand antebellum home with a wraparound porch overlooking the Battery, was facing stiff competition from another buyer – one rumored to be willing to pay well above asking price. Evie's heart pounded with a mixture of anxiety and determination. She needed to pull out all the stops if she wanted to secure this deal for Mrs. Davenport, whose unwavering belief in Evie’s abilities fueled her own ambition.

But as Evie approached the grand wrought iron gates guarding the Davenport mansion, a shiver of unease ran down her spine. Something felt off. The normally bustling street seemed eerily quiet, and an unnatural stillness hung in the air. A low fog, uncharacteristic for this time of year, rolled in from the harbor, obscuring the distant rooftops and casting an ominous pall over the city. Evie paused, a sudden premonition prickling at her senses. This wasn't just another real estate negotiation. Something else was at play here, something she couldn’t quite grasp but instinctively knew would change everything.
