The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the mingled scents of cheap whiskey and spilled beer. Neon lights cast an unsteady glow on the worn mahogany bar top, reflecting off the countless rings left by forgotten glasses. It was Tuesday night at The Rusty Tap, a dimly lit dive bar tucked away on the wrong side of Bleecker Street, where dreams came to drown in amber liquid and regret festered like week-old beer. 

Behind the bar, Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley, his salt-and-pepper hair perpetually dusted with sawdust from his off-hours carpentry gigs, expertly swirled a glass of scotch. He was a fixture at The Rusty Tap, a gruff but kindhearted man who knew everyone's drink and every heartbreak they carried. Tonight, the usual motley crew was assembled: Old Man Higgins nursing a glass of rye and lamenting the state of the world; Ruby, the fiery redhead with a voice like gravel and stories that could make saints blush; and Finn, the perpetually anxious poet who scribbled verses on napkins between sips of his lukewarm beer.  

But tonight felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the smoke itself. Bart sensed it as soon as a stranger walked through the door, their silhouette obscured by the flickering neon sign outside.
