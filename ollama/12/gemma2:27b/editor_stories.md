Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Penelope Albright, her brow furrowed in concentration, chewed on the end of a red pen, circling a particularly awkward phrase in the manuscript sprawled across her desk. The air in her cramped apartment office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, both emanating from Penelope herself. 

Penelope wasn't your typical editor. While others might revel in the polished prose and elegant structure of a well-written novel, she thrived on chaos. She saw beauty in the flawed, the rambling, the downright atrocious. Her specialty was taking diamonds in the rough - manuscripts riddled with clich√©s, plot holes, and questionable grammar - and polishing them into something resembling literature.  Tonight's project, however, was proving to be a particularly stubborn gem.
