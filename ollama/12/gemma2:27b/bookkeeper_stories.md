The aroma of stale coffee and ancient paper hung heavy in the air of Bartholomew Quill's cramped office. Sunlight strained through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing above ledgers overflowing with faded ink. Bartholomew himself, a man built like a well-worn armchair with spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously cross-referenced entries from a leather-bound journal, his tongue poking out in concentration.

The year was 1899, and London bustled outside, a symphony of carriage wheels and hawkers' cries. But within the sanctuary of his office above Mrs. Higgins' bakery, Bartholomew Quill existed in a world governed by numbers and balance sheets. He was the silent guardian of fortunes, the meticulous chronicler of pounds shillings and pence, a man who found solace not in society's whirlwind, but in the ordered tranquility of ledgers and receipts.

Today, however, an unexpected envelope sat upon his cluttered desk, interrupting Bartholomew's usual rhythm. The wax seal bore an unfamiliar crest â€“ a silver griffin entwined around a quill. Curiosity battled with caution as Bartholomew slowly broke the seal, revealing a handwritten note within.
