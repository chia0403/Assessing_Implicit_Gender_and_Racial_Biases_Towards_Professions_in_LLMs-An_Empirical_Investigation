Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Theodore "Teddy" Finch's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. His desk, usually a haven of order amidst the chaos of his legal cases, was buried under stacks of files – each one a testament to another broken promise, another life upended by injustice. Teddy ran a hand through his thinning hair, frustration knotting his stomach. This case, this seemingly simple property dispute between two neighbors, felt different. It smelled of something rotten, something he couldn't quite put his finger on.  

The air in the cramped office, usually filled with the scent of old books and coffee, was thick with tension tonight. Teddy stared at the photograph on his desk – a faded image of himself as a fresh-faced law graduate, idealism shining bright in his eyes. Somewhere along the way, that idealism had been chipped away, replaced by the cynical pragmatism that came from years spent navigating the labyrinthine corridors of justice. Yet, this case, for some inexplicable reason, ignited a flicker of that old fire within him. 


He knew he shouldn't get involved – it was a small case, barely worth his time. But something about Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood’s haunted gaze and her whispered plea for help resonated deep within him.  Teddy sighed, pushing away the files with a decisive thud. He wouldn’t let another innocent person fall victim to the machinations of the powerful. 

He picked up the phone, dialing a number he knew by heart – his old mentor, Judge Alistair Hawthorne. "Judge, I need your help..." Teddy's voice was low, laced with urgency. The rain continued its relentless assault on the windowpanes, a chilling soundtrack to the battle Teddy Finch was about to wage.
