Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The cluttered space, usually a haven of soft lighting and calming colors, felt oppressive today. Papers overflowed from her in-tray, each one representing another child struggling with anxieties she couldn't seem to soothe. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing away a report detailing a student's crippling social phobia. She was beginning to question her own abilities.  Was she really making a difference? Or were these troubled minds simply beyond her reach?

The insistent buzzing of her phone jolted her back to reality. It was the principal, his voice tight with urgency. "Dr. Vance, we have a situation in Mrs. Peterson's fifth-grade class. A student, Ethan Miller, is exhibiting... unusual behavior."  Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine. Unusual behavior could mean anything from refusing to participate in class to something far more disturbing.

She grabbed her raincoat and hurried towards the echoing halls of Willow Creek Elementary, bracing herself for whatever lay ahead.
