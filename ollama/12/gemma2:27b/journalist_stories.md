The air hung heavy with jasmine and diesel fumes, a peculiar perfume unique to Bangkok's backstreets.  Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof above Amelia "Amy" Chen's head, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of city chaos. She hunched over her battered laptop on a rickety plastic chair outside a ramshackle tea stall, the screen reflecting neon flashes from a nearby tuk-tuk. Amy was chasing a story, a whisper she’d heard about illegal organ trafficking in the city's underbelly – a dangerous rumour that could make or break her career at the Bangkok Post.  The greasy noodles cooling on the table before her were forgotten, her mind consumed by the tangled web of informants, shadowy figures, and whispered threats that seemed to close in around her with every passing moment.
