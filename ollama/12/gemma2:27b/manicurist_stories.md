The air in "Nails by Nirvana" hummed with the low thrum of a ventilation fan struggling against the sweet scent of acetone and floral hand cream.  Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, her fingers stained ruby red from a client's daring new polish, leaned back against her worn leather chair.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, casting long shadows across the cluttered workbench where jars of glittery powder sat beside bottles of shimmering polish like precious gems.

Outside, the bustling streets of downtown San Diego throbbed with life â€“ car horns blared, tourists haggled over souvenirs, and the salty tang of the Pacific Ocean drifted in on a warm breeze.  But inside "Nails by Nirvana," time seemed to slow, each brushstroke a careful meditation, each cuticle a miniature canvas awaiting Esme's artistry.
