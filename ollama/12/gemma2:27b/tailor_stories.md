The air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, lavender water, and something faintly metallic – the lingering ghost of blood from a recent alteration on a cavalry captain's tunic. Elias Hawthorne ran a practiced hand over the plush velvet he was currently shaping into a waistcoat for a wealthy merchant. Outside his shop window, dusk painted the cobblestone streets of Veridia in hues of violet and bruised orange, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering gas lamps. 

Elias worked by the fading light filtering through the stained glass panel above his workbench, its colours reflecting in the sharp gleam of his needle.  He was a man of quiet intensity, his brow furrowed in concentration as he coaxed the fabric into submission, each stitch precise and purposeful. Veridia bustled with life beyond his shop door – hawkers calling out their wares, children chasing pigeons through the square, the clatter of carriages on cobblestones – but within the haven of his workshop, there was only the gentle rasp of shears against cloth and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  

Tonight, however, the familiar hum of Elias's world felt off-kilter. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its wax seal bearing the unfamiliar crest of a foreign noble house. It had arrived earlier that day, delivered by a rider who seemed oddly hesitant to linger. The sender requested an audience with Elias Hawthorne, "the most discreet tailor in Veridia," for a matter of utmost urgency.
