Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. The flickering gas lamp cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating the threadbare tapestry depicting a mythical healer tending to a wounded gryphon - a relic from a time when hope still lingered in this forsaken corner of Veridia. Elias ran a weary hand through his greying hair, the weight of another fruitless day settling heavy on his shoulders.

The air hung thick with the cloying scent of lavender and despair. His meager supplies dwindled with each passing hour, unable to combat the relentless tide of sickness that plagued the city's impoverished districts. Outside, the guttural cries of the infected echoed through the rain-swept alleys, a chilling testament to his failing abilities. 

Tonight, however, was different. A desperate plea had arrived at his doorstep, carried on the wings of a ragged messenger - a request from the opulent Citadel district for Dr. Elias Thorne, the "Miracle Worker" as they dared to call him. A flicker of defiance ignited in Elias's weary eyes. Perhaps tonight, he could still salvage something from the wreckage of his hope.
