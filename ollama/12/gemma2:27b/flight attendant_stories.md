Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 747, mirroring the turbulence churning in Eliza Marie Beaumont's stomach.  She gripped the galley cart tighter as it rattled precariously on the uneven tarmac. The flashing red lights outside painted menacing shadows across the cramped space, highlighting the worry etched onto the faces of her fellow flight attendants.

Eliza smoothed down her crisp blue uniform and forced a smile. Today was supposed to be a routine transatlantic flight from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Now, with winds howling like banshees and lightning illuminating the sky in jagged streaks, it felt anything but.  A voice crackled over the intercom, announcing a delay due to "unforeseen weather conditions." 

Eliza sighed internally. This was not how she'd envisioned her first solo flight as lead attendant after years of diligently climbing the ranks. Her dream had always been to soar above the clouds, bringing smiles and comfort to passengers; instead, she felt anchored to the ground by a storm brewing both outside and within.
