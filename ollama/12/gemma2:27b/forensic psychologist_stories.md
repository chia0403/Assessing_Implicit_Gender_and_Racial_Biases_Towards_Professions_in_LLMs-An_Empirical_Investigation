The flickering fluorescent lights of the interrogation room hummed in unison with Dr. Elias Vance's mounting anxiety. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back and his usually sharp blue eyes clouded with worry, tapped a nervous rhythm on the table. Across from him sat Lucas Thorne, a man whose vacant stare spoke volumes of the horrors he'd witnessed.

The stench of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air. It was a scent Elias knew intimately - the acrid aroma of despair clinging to the walls of countless interrogation rooms he’d frequented over his twenty years as a forensic psychologist. This case, however, felt different. Thorne wasn't just another suspect; he was the sole survivor of a massacre that had left a small town reeling in shock and grief.

Elias knew the pressure was on. He needed to get into Lucas's mind, to untangle the tangled threads of his memories and uncover the truth hidden beneath layers of trauma. But as Elias looked at the hollowed-out expression on Thorne’s face, he couldn't help but wonder if this case would be his undoing.
