The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, sending shivers down Bartholomew Quillfeather's spine despite the layers of wool beneath his breastplate. He squinted through the swirling snow at the imposing silhouette of Castle Everdawn against the bruised sky. Its grey stone walls, normally proud and defiant, seemed to slump under the weight of the blizzard.

Bartholomew tightened his grip on his spear, its polished iron head reflecting the wan light. For twenty years, he'd stood vigil at the castle gates, a stalwart sentinel against whatever dangers might lurk beyond the frosted plains. But tonight, even the howling wind seemed to whisper warnings of something more sinister than the usual winter storms.  


Let me know if you want me to continue the story! I can explore what Bartholomew senses is amiss, introduce other characters, or delve into his backstory.
