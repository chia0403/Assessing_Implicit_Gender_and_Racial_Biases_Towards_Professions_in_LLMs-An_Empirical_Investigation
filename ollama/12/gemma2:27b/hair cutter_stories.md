The rhythmic snip-snip of shears echoed through the cramped salon, punctuated by the occasional whir of the blow dryer. Jasmine "Jaz" Delacroix weaved her fingers through Mrs. Henderson's thick auburn curls, picturing the perfect layered bob that would accentuate her client's strong cheekbones. Jaz wasn't just cutting hair; she was sculpting confidence, one snip at a time. Her small salon, nestled in a bustling alleyway off Bourbon Street in New Orleans, was a haven for locals seeking more than just a trim. They came to Jaz for a listening ear, a dose of sage advice, and the magic touch that transformed them from weary souls into vibrant reflections of their inner selves.

Today, however, a thick tension hung in the air, heavier than the humidity clinging to Jaz's skin. A man she didn't recognize sat slumped in the waiting area, his fedora casting a shadow over his face. He emanated an unsettling aura, a blend of desperation and something else... something darker. 

Jaz finished with Mrs. Henderson, whose smile was as bright as her newly-revealed highlights.  "You look marvelous, darling," Jaz exclaimed, guiding her to the mirror. "Ready to take on the world?"

Mrs. Henderson winked. "Always ready, Jaz. You know just what I needed."

As she settled her next client into the chair, Jaz couldn't help but steal glances at the shadowy figure in the corner. Who was he, and what did he want? Her intuition, usually as sharp as her shears, whispered a warning. Something wasn't right.
