Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the frantic drumming in Eliza Bethany Cartwright's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie pallor over the usually bustling Emergency Room. A storm surge had hammered the coast, sending a wave of injured patients crashing through the doors. Eliza, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun and her scrubs damp with sweat, navigated the chaos with practiced efficiency. Her heart ached for each face etched with pain, each labored breath, each desperate plea for help. But tonight, she felt a prickle of unease beneath the familiar adrenaline rush. Something was different. 

It started with a whispered rumour amongst the staff - an inexplicable increase in patients suffering from bizarre, almost impossible symptoms: sudden paralysis, unexplained hallucinations, and seizures that defied conventional medicine. Eliza dismissed it initially as stress-induced paranoia, but as she witnessed these cases firsthand, doubt began to gnaw at her certainty. The ER was a battlefield tonight, and Eliza, the seasoned warrior nurse, found herself facing an enemy she couldn't identify, let alone fight.
