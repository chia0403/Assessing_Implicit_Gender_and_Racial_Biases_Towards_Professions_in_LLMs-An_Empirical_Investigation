Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the weary glass. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered surgical suite.  Dr. Elias Thorne scrubbed his hands with a ferocious intensity, the rhythmic rasp of brush against skin a counterpoint to the storm raging outside. He could smell the antiseptic soap mingling with the faint metallic tang of blood – a familiar scent that both repelled and strangely comforted him. 

Tonight was different. Tonight, he wasn't facing a routine appendectomy or repairing a fractured femur. Tonight, he held the fate of young Amelia Rossi in his hands, a girl barely fifteen who was fighting for her life against a rare and aggressive form of leukemia.  The weight of responsibility pressed down on him like a physical burden. 

He glanced at the monitor displaying Amelia's vital signs – a flickering beacon in the dimly lit room. Her heart rate was erratic, her blood pressure dangerously low. Time was running out.
