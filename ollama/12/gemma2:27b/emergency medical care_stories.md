Rain lashed against the ambulance window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging crookedly above Joe's Diner. Inside the vehicle, Beatrice "Bea" Alvarez chewed on her thumbnail, her dark eyes reflecting the strobing red and blue lights outside. The call had been vague: a possible medical emergency at a rural address down a muddy back road. Bea, a seasoned EMT with five years under her belt, was already bracing herself for anything - from a twisted ankle to something far more serious. 

The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of fear and stale coffee, a familiar scent in Bea's line of work. She tightened her grip on the gurney straps, her knuckles white against the worn fabric. Her partner, a fresh-faced rookie named Liam, nervously adjusted his stethoscope for the tenth time. The quiet hum of the engine and the relentless drumming of rain seemed to amplify the tension coiled within the ambulance.  

They were approaching the address now, a solitary farmhouse dimly illuminated by a single flickering porch light. Bea felt a prickle of unease as they pulled into the muddy driveway, the headlights illuminating a scene that seemed strangely still.
