The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Winthrop's head, casting an anemic glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bytes." The air smelled faintly of burnt popcorn and disappointment, a combination unique to discount electronics stores. Eleanor sighed, her fingers drumming a restless tattoo against the worn counter. It was 3:47 pm on a Tuesday, and the only other customer in sight was a man rummaging through a bin of mismatched phone chargers, muttering curses under his breath.

Eleanor wasn't sure what she'd expected when she took this job. Maybe excitement? The thrill of connecting people with their technological desires? Instead, she got endless lines of grumpy customers arguing over warranties, sticky keyboards, and the existential dread of finding a charger that actually fit their ancient phone model. Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along her spine. It was as if the store itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
