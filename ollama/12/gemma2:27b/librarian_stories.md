Rain hammered against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray.  The air inside hung heavy with the scent of aging paper and dust motes danced in the weak beams filtering through the gloom. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted her spectacles and peered over the towering stacks of leather-bound volumes. 

Eleanor had been the Head Librarian of Grand Blackwood for nearly three decades, a guardian of forgotten tales and dusty secrets. The library itself was a labyrinthine behemoth, its stone walls etched with cryptic symbols and adorned with faded portraits of long-dead scholars. Today, however, Eleanor felt a chill creep down her spine that went beyond the damp autumn air. Something wasn't right.

A faint scratching sound echoed from the depths of the Restricted Section, a place forbidden to all but the most dedicated researchers.  Eleanor, her heart pounding in her chest, knew she had to investigate. The library held many mysteries, but this one felt different, imbued with an unsettling energy that whispered of danger and forgotten lore.
