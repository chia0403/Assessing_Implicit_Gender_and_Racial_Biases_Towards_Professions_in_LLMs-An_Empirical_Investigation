Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Thorne's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of files piled precariously on her desk. It was 6:02 pm, long past quitting time, and Amelia was hunched over yet another case file - this one belonging to Marcus "Mac" Delaney, a young man recently released from prison for petty theft. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. Mac's record wasn't pretty, but there was something about his haunted blue eyes and quiet demeanor that made her want to believe in him. But the fact that he hadn't shown up for his mandatory meeting today gnawed at her conscience.  Was he simply overwhelmed? Or had he already slipped back into old habits?


The gritty reality of probation work weighed heavily on Amelia. Situated in a dilapidated building on the outskirts of New Orleans, the office was a constant reminder of the city's struggle with poverty and crime.  Outside, the air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, a bittersweet fragrance that seemed to mock the harshness of her daily grind.
