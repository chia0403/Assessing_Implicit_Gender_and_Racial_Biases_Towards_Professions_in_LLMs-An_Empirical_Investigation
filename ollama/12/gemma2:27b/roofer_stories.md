The midday sun hammered down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck as he wrestled a stubborn shingle into place. Sweat trickled into his eyes, stinging like tiny wasps. Below him, the city stretched out in its usual chaotic symphony: car horns blaring, sirens wailing, distant shouts echoing through the concrete canyons. Eli ignored it all, focusing on the task at hand. He needed to finish this roof before the afternoon thunderstorm rolled in, or he'd be fighting a losing battle against leaking tar and slippery shingles.

This particular house, perched precariously on a steep hill overlooking a tangle of freeway on-ramps, was an older Victorian with ornate gingerbread trim that Eli secretly envied. His own apartment building was a stark concrete box, devoid of charm. He sighed, picturing himself sitting on this house's wide porch, sipping lemonade and enjoying the view â€“ a luxury he could only dream of.
