Rain lashed against the shop windows, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Elara Blackwood. Petals from a dozen wilting lilies lay scattered across her workbench like fallen soldiers, a testament to the day's disastrous deliveries. A delivery truck had broken down, delaying the arrival of fresh stock, leaving Elara with a pitiful selection for her biggest order yet - the wedding bouquet of renowned socialite Vivian Sinclair.

Elara's floral shop, "Blooming Thyme," nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh, was usually a haven of vibrant colour and intoxicating fragrance. Today, however, it felt more like a greenhouse in perpetual twilight. The air hung heavy with the sweet, cloying scent of decay, mirroring Elara's own sense of despair. 


Vivian Sinclair wouldn't tolerate wilted lilies.  Elara needed a miracle, and fast.
