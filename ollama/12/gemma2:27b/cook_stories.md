It was a sanctuary, a place where the rhythm of her life synced with the rising of the dough and the gentle clinking of measuring spoons. Today, however, a tremor of unease ran through Elodie as she worked. A letter had arrived yesterday, its contents cryptic and unsettling, hinting at a long-forgotten family secret that threatened to unravel everything she held dear.
