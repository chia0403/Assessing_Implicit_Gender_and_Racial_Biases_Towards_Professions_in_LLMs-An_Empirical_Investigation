Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's dental office, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond.  A low rumble of thunder echoed through the empty waiting room, momentarily drowning out the mournful saxophone melody drifting from Ellie's antique radio. It was a Tuesday evening, and the storm had chased away all but one appointment: Mrs. Beatrice Hawthorne, a formidable octogenarian with dentures that clicked louder than a metronome gone haywire. 

Ellie sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The quiet wasn't unwelcome â€“ it gave her time to reflect on the day's frustrating encounters and the ever-present weight of student loan debt. But tonight, something else gnawed at her: a sense of unease she couldn't quite place. It was as though the storm itself were whispering secrets into the cracks of her old Victorian office building.
