Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow drumming out a chaotic rhythm.  Emilia Alvarez sighed, watching the grey curtain outside her window. The power flickered, plunging the small waiting room into momentary darkness before sputtering back to life. Her patients wouldn't be coming today. Not with this weather. 

She ran a hand over the worn surface of her desk, feeling the familiar grooves carved by years of use. Emilia had poured her heart and soul into this community clinic in rural Oaxaca. It wasn’t fancy – just two rooms converted from an old store – but it was the only place for miles offering occupational therapy to those who needed it most. 

Today, however, the silence felt heavier than usual. A pang of loneliness pierced Emilia's chest. She missed the laughter of children learning new skills, the determined grip of an elderly man regaining his strength, the quiet gratitude in a farmer’s eyes as he managed to hold his tools again.
