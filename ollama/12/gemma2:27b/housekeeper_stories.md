Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Blackwood Manor, mimicking the relentless hammering in Elara Finch's chest. The sprawling Victorian mansion, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the stormy North Sea, felt as oppressive and forbidding as the weather itself. Dust motes danced in the pale shaft of moonlight filtering through the grimy windowpane, illuminating Elara's worn face, etched with years of toil and unspoken sorrow.  

She gripped the handle of her battered cleaning trolley, its rusty wheels squeaking a mournful protest against the ancient oak floorboards. Each creak seemed to amplify the unsettling silence that permeated the house â€“ a silence broken only by the howling wind and the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock in the hallway, counting down the seconds until Elara faced her dreaded task: cleaning the master bedroom, a room forever frozen in time since its occupant's untimely demise.
