The midday sun beat down on the dusty courtyard, baking the sandstone slabs until they radiated heat. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, chipped away at a massive block of limestone, sending shards flying into the air like glittering rain. The rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel echoed through the silent yard, punctuated only by the occasional grunt as he shifted his weight.

Elias' workshop, nestled on the edge of the bustling port city of Aethelgard, was a haven of controlled chaos. Tools hung from the walls in neat rows, their worn handles testament to years of dedicated use. Half-finished statues and ornate columns stood frozen in time, waiting for Elias' skilled hand to breathe life into them. Yet, today, his mind wasn't on the graceful curves of a cherub or the powerful stance of a warrior king. His thoughts were consumed by the shadowed alleyway he’d glimpsed earlier that morning – an alley where fear hung thick in the air and whispers promised danger.
