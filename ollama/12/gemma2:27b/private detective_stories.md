The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face in alternating stripes of pink and purple. Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of her office building, a steady rhythm that matched the pounding headache threatening to split her skull. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale coffee – a familiar cocktail for any private investigator worth their salt. 

Amy swiveled in her creaky chair, the springs protesting with a groan. A single bulb illuminated her cluttered desk, its yellow glow illuminating stacks of dusty case files, overflowing ashtrays, and a half-eaten tuna sandwich perched precariously on the edge. She tapped a fingernail against the worn surface of her desk calendar – December 12th. Another Christmas Eve was looming, and she still hadn't figured out how to pay rent this month.

Amy snatched up the receiver, bracing herself for whatever desperate plea or shady proposition awaited her on the other end. "Hawthorne Investigations," she growled, her voice laced with cynicism. "What can I do for you?"
