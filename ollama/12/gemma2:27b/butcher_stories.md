The air in Bartholomew "Butcher Bart" Higgins' shop hung heavy with the scent of iron and clove. Dawn light filtered through the grime-coated windows, painting streaks of dusty gold across the marble counter. Bart himself, his apron stained a permanent patchwork of crimson and ochre, surveyed the day's bounty with a practiced eye. Loins of venison, plump chickens strung like ruby necklaces, and slabs of beef marbled like celestial maps â€“ each piece spoke its story silently, a testament to life taken and transformed.

But today, the familiar rhythm felt off. A gnawing unease burrowed beneath Bart's burly frame, whispering warnings he couldn't decipher.  As he reached for his cleaver, the bell above the door tinkled, announcing a customer just as the first drops of rain began to splatter against the cobblestone street outside.
