Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of "Goodman's Apothecary," blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, Eleanor Goodman meticulously counted out tiny blue capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic click-clack of the pill dispenser was the only sound breaking the hushed silence, punctuated occasionally by the groan of settling pipes and the mournful howl of wind whistling through the alleyway.  Eleanor's normally tidy white coat was speckled with faint droplets of rain, testament to her hurried dash from the bus stop. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and chamomile, a soothing counterpoint to the stormy night raging outside.

As Eleanor finished filling the prescription, her gaze wandered towards the old grandfather clock in the corner. Its hands neared midnight, a stark reminder that she was alone again in the apothecary, a place her late father had built from scratch and bequeathed to her with unwavering faith.
