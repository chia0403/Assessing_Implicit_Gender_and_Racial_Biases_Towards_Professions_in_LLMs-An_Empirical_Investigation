Grease stained his hands, a badge of honor Elara "Ellie" Diaz wore with pride. The air in Diaz Auto hung thick with the scent of gasoline, motor oil, and something faintly metallic - the smell of a well-loved garage. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above Ellie's workbench.

Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt of Route 66. A lone tumbleweed skittered past, its dusty form a ghostly reminder of the harsh landscape that stretched beyond the town of Harmony Springs. Ellie wiped her brow with a grease-smeared rag, listening to the rhythmic clang of tools and the hum of the old compressor in the corner. Today was slow, which suited her just fine. It gave her time to think, to tinker, and to dream of something bigger than fixing busted engines in this dusty desert town.
