The scent of lavender shampoo and ozone hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Josephine Bellwether. Outside her salon window, the neon glow of "Elara's Enchantment" pulsed against the twilight sky of New Orleans, casting long shadows from wrought iron balconies and moss-draped oak trees onto the cobblestone street below. Elara, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose bun and a smattering of freckles across her nose, surveyed her work. 

The reflection staring back at her from the mirror wasn't just any client; it was Madame Evangeline Dubois, notorious Voodoo Queen and Elara's most enigmatic regular. Today, Madame Dubois wanted something special for the annual Feast of the Serpent, a celebration steeped in ancient tradition and shadowed whispers.  Elara carefully uncapped a jar filled with iridescent blue powder - crushed lapis lazuli rumored to hold mystical properties - her heart thrumming with both excitement and trepidation. Tonight, Elara wasn't just styling hair; she was weaving magic.
