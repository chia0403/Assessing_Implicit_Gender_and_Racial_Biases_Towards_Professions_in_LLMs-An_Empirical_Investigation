Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's cramped apartment, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his fingers flying across the keyboard. The glow of the triple monitor setup cast an ethereal blue light on his tired face, illuminating deep shadows under his eyes. Lines of code scrolled past him like a digital waterfall, each one a step closer to cracking the encryption he'd been wrestling with for weeks. Elias wasn't just any programmer; he was a ghost in the machine, renowned in the shadowy corners of the internet for his ability to unravel even the most complex algorithms.

Tonight's target: Project Chimera, a top-secret military initiative rumored to be developing autonomous AI weaponry. Elias, fueled by a potent mix of caffeine and righteous indignation, believed the project posed an existential threat to humanity. He had sworn to expose its secrets, no matter the cost.
