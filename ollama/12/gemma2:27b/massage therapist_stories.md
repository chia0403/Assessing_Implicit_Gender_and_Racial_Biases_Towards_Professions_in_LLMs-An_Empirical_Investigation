Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Tranquility Touch," blurring the neon sign outside into an abstract smear of pink and purple. Inside, Eleanor Rosalind Finch meticulously arranged polished river stones on a tray, their cool smoothness a soothing counterpoint to the storm raging beyond. The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, battling the metallic tang that crept in from the downpour. 

Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the glass for a moment before dissolving into nothingness. Business was slow tonight, a testament to the weather's ferocity and the fact that most people preferred their relaxation indoors, not braving the elements for a massage. But Eleanor didn't mind the quiet. It gave her time to center herself, to feel the energy of the room humming around her, a tranquil sanctuary amidst the chaos.
