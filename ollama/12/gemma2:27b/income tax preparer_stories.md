The air in Evelyn Beatrice "Eve" Carmichael's tiny office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

The fluorescent lights inside hummed incessantly, adding to the already palpable tension. Eve, perched behind her cluttered desk, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and sighed. This was always the busiest time of year, a whirlwind of W-2s, 1099s, and deductions both legitimate and dubious. But this year felt different. Something in the air, a prickling unease, told Eve that she was about to encounter a client unlike any she'd met before.
