## Story Opening: 

The stale air of the waiting room hung heavy like a shroud as Evelyn Pierce, Probation Officer number 47, adjusted her glasses nervously.  A single fluorescent bulb cast an anemic glow on the worn-out carpet, doing little to dispel the oppressive sense of unease she felt. The name “Michael Thorne” echoed in her ears, a name once youthful promise, now tinged with tragedy and despair, whispered into the void by the crackling of the intercom. 

Evelyn’s breath hitched as the door opened, ushering in a boy barely more than a teenager. Michael Thorne’s face was pale, his eyes downcast, hidden behind a mop of messy brown hair that seemed to absorb all light and color. A thin canvas bag slung over his shoulder held its secrets close. Evelyn's heart sank as she noted the faint blue bruise blooming on his left cheekbone – a physical reminder of a story far too brutal for someone so young. 


**Setting:**

A cramped probation office in a run-down neighborhood near Chicago. The year is 2023.  The building, once a grand hotel, now housed underprivileged youth and their troubled realities, echoing with the ghosts of its past glory. 


**Main Character:** Evelyn Pierce, a veteran probation officer known for her unwavering compassion and sharp intuition. She's worn down by years in the trenches of societal inequities, but still carries an unyielding belief that even the lost can be found, one step at a time.
