The city hummed with a chaotic symphony of sirens, construction noise, and street vendors hawking their wares.  Rain hammered down on the neon-soaked streets of Neon City, turning the once vibrant cityscape into a bleak reflection of its inhabitants' hopes and dreams. 

This was the domain of Amelia "Amy" Thorne, an investigative journalist whose tenacity had earned her the respect – and occasional scorn – of many a power player in this concrete jungle.  Her battered laptop perched precariously on a rickety table outside a dingy karaoke bar - one she knew held secrets as deep as its smoky atmosphere. 

Tonight, Amy was drawn to the bar not for the music (or the dubious quality of the last whiskey shot) but for the man behind the curtain: "Mr. Whisper," a shadowy figure whispered to have connections to the city's underbelly and pockets of criminal activity. She had spent months chasing rumors of his involvement in illegal gambling rings and black market drug operations, hoping to unearth the truth. 

Tonight, she was close.
