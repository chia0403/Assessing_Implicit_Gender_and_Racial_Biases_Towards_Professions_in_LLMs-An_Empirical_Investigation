## Story Opening: 

The air hung thick and heavy in Dr. Amelia Hayes’ office, even with the windows open. The scent of cedarwood incense from her diffuser was battling a persistent wave of damp earth and petrichor that clung to the city's relentless humidity. Outside, the storm raged – rain hammering against the glass panes like tiny drums, its rhythm echoing the frantic beat in Amelia's chest. 

**Setting:** A modern, bright-lit office located in a residential building complex within the sprawling urban sprawl of Chicago. The space was designed to feel calming and welcoming, but despite the efforts of her interior designer husband, it still felt somehow off-kilter tonight.  Perhaps it was the storm's fury or the weight of another late-night session with a client she found herself inexplicably drawn to. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia Hayes - A talented and compassionate counseling psychologist who specialized in trauma recovery. She had a reputation for her empathetic approach, but lately, something felt… different.  Her usual ability to connect with people seemed strained, the weight of unseen worries pressing down on both her patients and herself. Tonight was particularly challenging as she awaited the arrival of Liam, a young man struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder from a harrowing experience.
