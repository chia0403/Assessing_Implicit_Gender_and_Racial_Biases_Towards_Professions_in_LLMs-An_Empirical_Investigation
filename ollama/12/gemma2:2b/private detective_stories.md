The neon sign outside "The Faded Rose" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-soaked street.  Rain hammered down in sheets, turning the alleyway into a murky maze of shadows and glistening puddles.  Inside, the air smelled faintly of stale cigarettes and cheap perfume, punctuated by the sharp tang of gin.  Dust motes danced lazily in the single shaft of light from the dim bulb overhead, illuminating a man sitting at a worn leather table: Roderick "Rory" Thorne, private investigator. 

His trench coat was pulled tight against the chill wind, damp clinging to its fabric as he swirled the ice-filled glass of whiskey. The case file lay open on the table, its pages filled with faded photographs and cryptic notes scrawled in a hurried hand.  A woman’s face stared back at him from one, her eyes wide with fear. His client, a nervous young woman named Clara, had only given him this one image: a portrait of a man in a fedora, holding a briefcase. "He needs to be stopped," she'd said, voice trembling. “Before it’s too late.”  The words echoed hollowly in Rory’s mind as he gazed out the rain-streaked window, the city lights blurring into an indistinguishable swirl of color and shadow. Tonight, he was going after shadows.
