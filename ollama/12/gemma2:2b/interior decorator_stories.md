Rain lashed against the high windows of Atelier Rouge, blurring the Parisian cityscape into streaks of charcoal and silver. The scent of old wood polish and lavender lingered in the air, a comforting but familiar fragrance to the woman currently grappling with a pile of velvet curtains like a mountain climber facing Everest. 

"Amelia Dubois," she muttered, tugging at a cascade of crimson fabric. "Don't tell me I'm supposed to be a magician now." Her emerald eyes narrowed as the unruly curtains resisted her attempts to tame them. It was late, and Amelia had been wrestling with this particular client’s aesthetic for hours - each attempt only adding another layer of complexity to the already tangled web she’d woven. 

She was used to being the orchestrator in grand spaces - not some stagecoach-bound charmer on a Parisian street corner. But life had a habit of surprising her, and lately, that surprise had taken the form of eccentric clients with peculiar tastes, a love for vintage teacups, and an uncanny ability to create chaos. 

Tonight, the client was a flamboyant widow named Madame Moreau - a woman who insisted on mixing antique silver with modern art, her home a kaleidoscope of contradictions that challenged Amelia’s very definition of design.  As she stood amidst the storm, pondering her next move, Amelia sighed and surveyed the room with its swirling pattern of colour and chaos.
