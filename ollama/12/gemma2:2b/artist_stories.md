The air hung thick with sea salt and the scent of decaying seaweed, clinging to Coralia's worn canvas bag like a phantom limb. The sky above was bruised purple and orange, mirroring the melancholy that perpetually resided in her heart – an ache she couldn't quite explain but knew clung to her artistic soul as surely as paint clings to her brush. 

Coralia "Coral" Thorne sat at the edge of a weathered pier, her worn sketchbook open, its pages filled with charcoal sketches of sea creatures: sleek, graceful dolphins playing in frothy waves; shy, ethereal jellyfish pulsing beneath the surface; and majestic whales breaching the water, their forms echoing against the crashing waves. But none of them matched the swirling storm brewing inside her chest – a tempest she could only unleash onto the canvas, where vibrant strokes of color danced to the rhythm of her emotions. 

She was drawn to the edge of the pier, seeking solace in the rhythmic crash of the waves as if their melancholic symphony could somehow soothe the internal turmoil within.  The harbor town, nestled between rugged cliffs and the churning sea, held a certain kind of haunting beauty - a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of her life back in the bustling metropolis.
