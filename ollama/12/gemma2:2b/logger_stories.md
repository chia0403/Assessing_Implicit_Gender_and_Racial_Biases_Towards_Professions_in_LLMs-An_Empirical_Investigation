## The Whispering Woods

The morning mist clung to the ancient pines like a shroud, its tendrils of cold clinging to the air as it rose from the forest floor.  Even beneath the thin layer of sunlight filtering through the boughs, the woods held their own kind of chill. A biting wind whistled through the skeletal branches, rattling loose leaves that skittered down to the forest floor, where they lay dormant like forgotten memories under a blanket of damp earth. 

The name etched on his worn leather cap was **Thomas Blackwood**, and for fifty years he had called these woods home. He moved with the quiet grace of a predator in his element, the axe at his hip a familiar weight. The scent of pine and sap clung to him like a second skin, as weathered and familiar as the bark of the trees themselves. Today, however, was different. A feeling of unease settled deep within Thomas, a prickle on the back of his neck that echoed the rustle of unseen leaves in the wind. 

The forest whispered its secrets to him, but these weren't the comforting sounds of birdsong or rustling squirrels. These were whispers of fear and a deep-seated sadness that seemed to hang heavy over the trees. Today, Blackwood felt he wasnâ€™t just working within the woods; he was navigating a labyrinth of ancient magic.
