Rain hammered against the windows of Serenity Spa, each drop exploding in miniature rainbows across the glass.  Inside, Evelyn "Ellie" Reed ran a calloused thumb over her worn rosary beads as she surveyed the empty waiting room. The aroma of lavender and sandalwood battled with the persistent scent of rain and damp earth from the city outside, creating a peculiar blend that always felt comforting to Ellie. She'd inherited the spa from her grandmother years ago,  and for now, it was just her. Tonight, however, there was an unusual buzz in the air, a sort of anticipatory tension that made Ellie's eyes prickle like a fresh daisy in springtime. It wouldn't be a usual Friday night â€“ and it wouldn't be a peaceful one.

Ellie had always prided herself on creating spaces for people to unwind and find solace. Tonight, though, the weight of something deeper settled upon her, thicker than any storm cloud.  It was as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something, or someone. 


 **Setting:** A cozy, traditional spa in a quiet neighbourhood of a bustling city. The exterior has faded paint and chipped tiles, but the interior boasts elegant floral patterns on chairs, soft music playing softly in the background, and an aroma of calm and relaxation emanating from the massage oils and candles.  

**Character:** Ellie Reed - Warmth and kindness radiate from her as she interacts with clients, though a deep well of inner strength runs beneath the surface. She's known for her gentle touch and ability to understand people on a deeper level, even during difficult times.
