The early morning air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia Hawthorne like an unwanted second skin as she stepped onto the weathered wooden porch. The salty tang of the ocean breeze mingled with the smell of woodsmoke from the nearby houses, creating a unique aroma unique to this coastal town of Seahaven. Amelia's feet sank slightly into the worn steps, her gaze sweeping across the familiar scene: the faded paint on Mrs. Peabody's swing set, the chipped flagstone wall of Old Man Fisher’s cottage, and the lone lighthouse standing guard at the edge of the harbor. This was her world, this small town she knew better than she knew herself, a place where lives were intertwined and time seemed to move slower.

Seahaven was not the bustling metropolis Amelia had dreamed of when she graduated from PT school. But there's something about the steady rhythm of everyday life here that brought a sense of peace she hadn’t expected. She loved her job at Seahaven Rehabilitation Center - helping injured individuals regain their independence and re-enter a world they once thought was beyond reach. Yet, today, even the familiar faces and routines seemed to press down on Amelia like an unwelcome weight. 

The day's first patient was already waiting, his wife by his side, both wearing expressions of quiet desperation that Amelia knew all too well. Her job was often a balancing act: between pushing patients physically and emotionally through their rehabilitation journey while finding solace in the shared moments of vulnerability, hope, and resilience. Today, she felt the weight of it, not just on her shoulders but in the stagnant air itself.
