## Story Opening:

**Setting:** The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation in Ms. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's cramped office.  It was the kind of space that wouldn't exist on a Pinterest board, but one she somehow managed to keep afloat amidst the constant barrage of paperwork and ever-widening abyss of unpaid bills. 

**Character:** Ellie Ainsworth, her face lined with years of facing down grief, loss, and insurance claims in equal measure, sat hunched over her desk. A wave of despair washed over her as she flipped through yet another stack of forms: the aftermath of a wildfire that had decimated an entire neighborhood, leaving behind only charred memories and an ocean of paperwork.

The weight of it all seemed to press down on Ellie's chest, mimicking the heavy thud of the phone receiver against her desk after each call. It was never easy dealing with victims, especially after having lost her husband, James, in a similar tragedy years ago. 

Today's calls were particularly taxing.  One woman had lost everything - her home, her family's history, even the memories she'd built into every corner of the house. Another man was barely coping as his young daughter’s favorite stuffed animal lay amidst the smoke-filled ashes.


**Open:** 

“There are no words,” Ellie muttered to herself, her voice thick with emotion and a weary resignation that had long become her constant companion. The phone rang again, its shrill tone cutting through the dense silence of the room. It was another call. Another life shattered. And another reminder of the vastness of the storm that raged around them all.
