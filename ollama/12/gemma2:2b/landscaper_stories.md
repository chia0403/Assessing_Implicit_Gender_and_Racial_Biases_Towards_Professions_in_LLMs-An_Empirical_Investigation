The relentless August sun beat down on Silas Hawthorne's worn neck as he surveyed his latest canvas: Mrs. Peabody’s meticulously manicured backyard.  Silas wasn’t much for flowery epitaphs about "life's beauty," but the way she’d meticulously pruned her hydrangeas into a perfect, symmetrical cone was almost hypnotic. It reminded him of the kind of control he aimed to bring to his own chaotic life - if only there were more than just weeds and wild vines to tame.  

The city's sprawl was a symphony of concrete and glass, yet here, in the quiet cul-de-sac bordered by ancient oak trees that whispered secrets from generations past, lay Mrs. Peabody’s world – neatly trimmed hedges, flowerbeds in perfect rows, even an air of quiet dignity in her stone-faced demeanor.  Silas, with his faded work clothes and hands calloused from years of toil, felt like a misplaced puzzle piece amongst the carefully crafted order. 

The only music in this scene was the whine of his lawnmower, its rhythm a slow, monotonous counterpoint to the chirping of unseen crickets. But the hum was beginning to feel less like a song and more like a lullaby for him - one that he needed, desperately, to wake up from.
