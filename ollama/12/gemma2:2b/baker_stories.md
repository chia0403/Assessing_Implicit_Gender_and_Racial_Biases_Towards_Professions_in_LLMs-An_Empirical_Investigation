## Opening:

The scent of sugar and spice hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elara's worn apron like a second skin.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her tiny bakery, painting stripes of warmth across the flour-dusted counters and the wooden table where she stood, kneading dough with an almost meditative focus. Outside, the bustling town of Oakhaven hummed with its usual pre-dawn energy. But inside, the silence was absolute, broken only by the rhythmic thump of Elara's hands against the dough.

**Setting:** 

Elara's bakery, "The Sugarplum," nestled in a quiet corner of Oakhaven. The shop looked like it had belonged to her family for generations - its faded paint, chipped windowpanes and worn-out signboard all held whispers of time. A large oak table, remnants of an old grandfather clock, sat tucked under the counter where pastries were displayed, their sugared tops glistening in the morning light. 

**Main character:**  Elara Blackwood
