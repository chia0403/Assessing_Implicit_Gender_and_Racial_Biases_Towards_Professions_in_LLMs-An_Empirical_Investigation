The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and desperation in the lobby of the Grand Zephyr Hotel.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced through the grime-covered window, illuminating the forlorn visage of Percival "Percy" Worthington, a young man barely past his twenty first summer, who stood slumped behind the bell stand. He ran a callused thumb across a threadbare jacket pocket, fingers trailing over the crumpled photograph inside â€“ a picture of two smiling faces, one of a girl with mischievous eyes and the other of a man with a proud grin, forever etched in memory as the reason Percy kept going.  

**Setting:** The Grand Zephyr Hotel, once a shining monument to prosperity in Chicago's vibrant Art Deco era, was now a shell of its former glory. The plush carpets were faded and worn; floral wallpaper peeled from the walls like scabs; and the grand elevator still creaked with a disconcerting whine that echoed through the empty halls, a haunting reminder of its once-proud past. Percy knew every nook and cranny of this decaying palace: the worn mahogany desk in the manager's office where he had watched countless weary travelers check in for their ill-fated journeys; the dusty piano by the fire escape where he would often lose himself in forgotten tunes; and the back entrance, a secret passage through which he once glimpsed his father disappearing into a shadowy world of deceit.  
 
**Main character:** Percival Worthington (Percy) - A bellhop at the Grand Zephyr Hotel with dreams bigger than the crumbling hotel itself, and a heart heavy with unrequited love for Amelia "Em" Thorne, a woman whose beauty and wit were as intoxicating as the faded glamour of the hotel's past.
