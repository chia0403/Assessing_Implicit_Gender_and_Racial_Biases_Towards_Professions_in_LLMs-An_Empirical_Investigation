The dusty wind whipped through the open expanse of land, tugging at the worn leather of Caleb Hawthorne's chaps as he surveyed his cattle herd.  He ran a calloused hand across his weathered face, tracing the lines etched by years under the unforgiving Arizona sun.  This land, this vast canvas dotted with hardy trees and rolling hills, was his lifeblood. The air hung thick with the scent of sagebrush and the distant hum of crickets. At sunset, the sky bled from shades of crimson to bruised purple, a spectacularly violent painting that mirrored the storm brewing inside Caleb's chest. 

His gaze drifted towards the distant silhouette of Dusty Ridge, a landmark his family had tended for generations.  He could almost feel his grandfather's presence there, a spectral echo of wisdom and stoic acceptance in the face of hardship.  But tonight, his heart felt heavier than any drought-stricken earth or blistering sun.  His niece, Lily, was due to arrive tomorrow with her new husband, a young man from the east coast seeking fortune and adventure.  He'd chosen to stay silent, not wanting to dampen her excitement, but the weight of unspoken expectations pressed down on him like the relentless pressure of a monsoon.
