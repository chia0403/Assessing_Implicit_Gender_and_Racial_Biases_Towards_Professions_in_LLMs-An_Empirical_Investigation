##  The Open House

**Setting:** A sweltering July afternoon in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. The air hangs heavy with humidity and the scent of salt from the nearby ocean. Victorian homes, their paint peeling like sunburned skin, line cobbled streets, casting long shadows in the late afternoon light. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Amy" Hayes, a woman whose vibrant red hair is perpetually escaping its elaborate updo. She's known in Charleston as a formidable real estate agent who can charm her way into any buyer's heart (or at least their wallet). But Amy harbors a secret: she has never left the city that feels more like home to her than anything else. 

The sign on the front gate reads "Welcome Home" in faded script, but it feels anything but welcoming today. Dust coats the once elegant foyer of The Magnolia Manor - a stately Victorian mansion that Amelia had just listed for a grieving widow, whose husband passed away in the very room she's standing in now, leaving her alone with an inheritance far more complex than the house itself.

**What will happen? Will Amy be able to see beyond the grief and help the widow sell her home?  Or will she let it consume her, like the city's humidity?**
