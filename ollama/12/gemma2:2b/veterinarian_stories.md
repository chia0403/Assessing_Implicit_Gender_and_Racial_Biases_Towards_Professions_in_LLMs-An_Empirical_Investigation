The air hung thick with the scent of hay and disinfectant in Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic,  a symphony of chirps, meows, and low grumbles from the assorted animals within. His calloused hands deftly lifted a trembling tabby cat, its emerald eyes wide with fear, while his warm smile reassured the feline. This was a Friday afternoon, usually calm, in the sleepy countryside town of Oakhaven. It wasn't until Dr. Thorne had stepped out of his office onto his front porch that the silence shattered into the harsh rhythm of an approaching storm.

He pulled on his worn leather coat, its familiar scent blending with the earthy aroma of the storm clouds rolling in from the east, and stared out at the vast green fields that normally bathed his world in a gentle, golden light. Oakhaven was a place where time seemed to flow differently, with its own quiet heartbeat, but even in its serenity, Elias Thorne knew a wildness lived beneath the surface.
