The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous symphony above Amelia Hayes' head, their harsh glare highlighting the dust motes swirling in the air like miniature galaxies. She surveyed her office – a stark contrast to the vibrant hues and whimsical murals decorating most elementary school classrooms. This was the heart of Elmwood Elementary, where childhood dreams bloomed amidst broken crayons and spilled juice boxes.  

Amelia's gaze settled on a young boy with an unruly mop of hair sitting slumped in the corner, clutching a crumpled paper airplane. He looked lost, his blue eyes mirroring the endless churn of anxieties within the chaotic world he navigated daily. Amelia, like a silent beacon, had arrived with years of training and her unique skill set to help navigate that world – one step at a time.
