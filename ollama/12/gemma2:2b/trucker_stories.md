The dusty Texas plains stretched before Clayton "Clay" Miller like an endless canvas of browns and tans, dotted with prickly pear cacti and wind-battered tumbleweeds. The air hung heavy, thick with heat and the promise of dust devils that danced on the horizon.  He shifted in his worn leather seat of the '87 Peterbilts, its growl a familiar lullaby to Clay's weary soul. A symphony of tires rolling, the whine of the engine, and the distant rumble of a herd moving across the plain filled the silence that followed the radio's static-filled chatter.  

Clay squinted at the sun-baked sky, the harsh glare reflecting off his tired eyes. His truck was packed - more than usual; he'd been hauling more freight than usual lately. Every inch of it was a testament to his life: the worn leather seat, the faded map pinned on the dashboard, the dented toolbox tucked away under the sleeper berth.  His destination lay somewhere in the heart of Oklahoma, but tonight, Clay just wanted to get out of the endless stretches and find a quiet corner where he could read about horseshoes - a man's best friend, he always said.  But there was something else stirring within him: an itch at the back of his neck, an unsettling feeling that this trip, like all the others before it, would lead somewhere unexpected.
