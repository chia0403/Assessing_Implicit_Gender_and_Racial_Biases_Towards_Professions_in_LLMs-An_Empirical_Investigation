The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and burnt rubber, a familiar scent in Dr. Elias Thorne's nostrils.  He crouched beside the crumpled body on the asphalt, his gloved hands tracing the uneven contours of the man’s chest. The streetlights cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe like living things under the moonless night sky.  The city's symphony of sirens and honking horns was a jarring counterpoint to the silence that filled the air now, a silence as heavy as the weight of the unseen burden he carried. 

Elias, known affectionately by his fellow paramedics as "Thor," was no stranger to grief's harsh embrace. He’d seen too many faces twisted into masks of pain, heard too many heart-wrenching stories – all etched against the canvas of time and circumstance in the brutal play of life and death.  He ran a calloused thumb across his own weathered face, trying to erase the image of the man's vacant gaze from his mind. This was just another day on the unforgiving city streets, another life lost to the cruel whims of fate that often seemed to operate outside of human understanding.
