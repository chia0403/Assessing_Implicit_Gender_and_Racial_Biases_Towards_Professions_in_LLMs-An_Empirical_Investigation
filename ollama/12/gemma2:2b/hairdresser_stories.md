The morning mist clung to the cobblestones of Albion Street like an exhausted lover's embrace, swirling slowly in its ethereal chill. Even for an early November day, it was unusually damp. Amelia Thorne, owner and sole operator of "A Touch of Glamour," sighed as she watched her reflection in the salon window – a pale cloud amongst the grey sky mirrored on her once-vibrant hair. 

The bell above the door chimed, signaling the arrival of a customer. It was always the same face that first peeked through the doorway: Mrs. Henderson's youthful eyes, still holding the sparkle Amelia had long ago lost in her own reflection, followed by a hesitant smile. This morning, however, it was not just her usual routine hair appointment that had Amelia’s mind occupied. A flyer for an old-fashioned beauty competition, pinned to the door, had caught her eye and stirred a forgotten longing inside her heart - a yearning for something more than just hairstyling. 

"Amelia," Mrs. Henderson called out, stepping closer. "You look like you've seen a ghost!"
