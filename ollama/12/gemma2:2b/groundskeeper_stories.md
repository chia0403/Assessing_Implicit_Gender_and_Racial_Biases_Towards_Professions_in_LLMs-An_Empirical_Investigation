## The Whispering Garden

The morning mist clung to Blackwood Manor like a phantom's breath, swirling around the gnarled roots of ancient oaks that bordered the crumbling façade of the estate.  This was no ordinary garden; this was where Mr. Silas Blackwood's grief seeped into the very earth, turning fertile soil into a choking miasma. 

Silas Blackwood, known affectionately by everyone as "Sully" – a name he’d earned through years spent tending the sprawling grounds of the manor - was an enigma wrapped in worn flannel and dirt stains.  He moved with a measured grace, his hands calloused yet gentle as he tended to the neglected rose bushes that clung to life with a stubbornness bordering on desperation. He could make the roses bloom again, if only for the memory of her smile. 

The whispers started subtly – a rustle in the wind chimes, an unseen draft swirling around the old well, a sigh echoing through the ancient oak trees where Mrs. Blackwood used to sit and read to him as a boy. Today, however, they were louder, more insistent. The air throbbed with unspoken sorrow, a weight pressing down on Sully's shoulders like a heavy cloak.  And something else, a strange, tingling sensation in his fingers that made his heart skip a beat.
