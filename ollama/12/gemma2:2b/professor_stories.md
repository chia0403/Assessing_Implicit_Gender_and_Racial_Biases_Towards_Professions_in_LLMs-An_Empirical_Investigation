The air inside was thick with the scent of old books and forgotten dreams, all swirling around the worn leather desk where she sat, staring at the crumbling photograph in her hand.  Evelyn's gaze lingered on a smiling face - young Amelia Ainsworth, a girl whose laughter filled the room with warmth even as it did now hold only a chilling echo of what once was. The year was 1948, and Amelia's spirit had become another ghost story to haunt the annals of her family's legacy.
