Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Amelia Blackwood's Cozy Corner daycare, mimicking the furious drumming of six-year-old Leo's heart.  Outside, winds howled like banshees in an old, creaking house on Willow Street. Inside, however, a strange calm reigned. The children were scattered across the playroom – Toby was building a precarious tower of blocks that threatened to collapse at any moment, Maya was lost in a world of pretend-sewing with her oversized dress-up doll, and little Finn lay sprawled on his back in the sunbeam, humming an unknown song.  Amelia knelt by a table piled high with colorful felt pieces, meticulously stitching together a patchwork quilt for the upcoming charity auction. But even as she worked, her eyes couldn't escape Leo, who stood near the door with wide, worried eyes, his tiny body trembling. 

Leo was one of Amelia's most spirited charges. His infectious giggle and mischievous grin were constant companions in the chaos that was her daycare.  But lately, he had been unusually quiet, his usual zest for life dimmed by an unknown worry. This morning, he had woken up with a cough that wouldn't quit and seemed perpetually worried about something. Amelia knew he needed to share his burden, but Leo was notoriously private. 

"You know you can tell me anything, right?" she asked him gently, her voice laced with the kind of calming authority only years of experience could provide. "It’s a safe place here."
