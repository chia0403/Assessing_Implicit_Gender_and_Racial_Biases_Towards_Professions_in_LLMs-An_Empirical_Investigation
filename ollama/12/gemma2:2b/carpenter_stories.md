## The Smell of Pine

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling cobblestone streets of Almendra, Spain.  Sweat clung to Tobias Bell's brow as he hammered a last nail into a new plank of oak, his calloused hands moving with the precision born from decades spent wielding a hammer. His workshop, nestled at the edge of the marketplace, was a symphony of wood shavings and sawdust, the air thick with the comforting scent of pine and fresh timber.

Tobias wasn’t just any carpenter; he was known as "El Artesano" - The Craftsman.  He built not just furniture but stories into his work. A rocking chair whispered tales of childhood to children who nestled in its embrace. A dining table held memories of family feasts, laughter echoing through the years. Every piece he crafted had a soul, imbued with Tobias's quiet wisdom and love for the craft. 

But tonight, even the familiar warmth of the workshop couldn’t soothe the unease gnawing at Tobias's gut.  The air was heavy, filled with whispers of a storm brewing on the horizon. Almendra's usual vibrance felt muted, its laughter stifled by an approaching dread. The town’s old clock tower chimed midnight, each toll echoing like a warning bell in the stillness of the night.
