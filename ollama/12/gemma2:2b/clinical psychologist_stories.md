## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A quaint, ivy-covered Victorian house in the coastal town of Havenwood, England. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Thorne's practice, echoing the internal turmoil she was struggling with. 

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Thorne closed her eyes, picturing the image that had haunted her all week: a swirling vortex of blues and grays, the same colors as the storm outside. It reminded her of the case she had been working on for months - a young woman, Annabelle, who’d become increasingly erratic since losing her husband in a sudden accident. The police investigation was closed, deeming it an accidental drowning, but Eleanor knew something felt off.

Annabelle’s family, shrouded in sorrow and denial, refused to open up about their past. It was as if the walls themselves held back the truth - a chilling silence pressing down on Dr. Thorne like an oppressive fog. "It's just a rough patch," her own therapist had suggested, but Eleanor couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something deeply buried in the woman’s memories, something that needed unraveling before she could truly understand Annabelle’s descent into despair.  As the rain drummed on the roof like tiny hearts beating against stone, Dr. Thorne took a deep breath and opened her file. The woman's journey to understanding herself had only just begun.

**Main Character:** Dr. Eleanor Thorne
