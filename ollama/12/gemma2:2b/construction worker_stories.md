Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the diner, each drop drumming out a hesitant rhythm on the tin.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the worn vinyl booths. A lone figure hunched over his lukewarm coffee, the steam rising like a ghostly apparition in the oppressive air of early December. His name was Elias Thorne, and for the past three years, he'd been building, or rebuilding, something else: the memory of what it meant to be home. 

His boots were heavy, each step echoing through the empty diner as he navigated the worn floorboards. He had a half-finished order from Mr. McArthur, a new addition to the aging building's roof that seemed to loom over him like a grumpy, weather-beaten crow. Eliasâ€™ hands, calloused and strong, tightened around his coffee cup.  The job was simple enough: replace a section of damaged shingles. But in the city, where concrete replaced earth and steel replaced sky, this felt almost sacrilegious. This small act of mending meant something else entirely to him.
