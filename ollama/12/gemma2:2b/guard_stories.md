The wind whipped through the ancient stone arches of Castle Atheria, howling a mournful tune against the crumbling façade.  Rain lashed down like icy needles, blurring the already fading glow of the dying sun behind the storm clouds. Within the fortress's heart, where shadows danced and whispers clung to the air, stood Gareth Thorne, his cloak pulled tight around him. The damp chill seeped through even the thickest fabric, mirroring the unease that settled in his stomach like a lead weight. 

Gareth was a guard, his duty etched into his very being –  to protect the innocent and defy the darkness that lurked on the edges of every passing night. But tonight, a shiver ran down his spine deeper than any chill from the rain. It wasn't just the storm; it was the weight of unspoken words clinging to the air like smoke. 

He adjusted his helm, its metal glinting faintly in the dimness of the tower room. A silent prayer for strength echoed in his mind: "Lord, guide my hand and keep me steadfast."  He knew he wasn't alone. The castle walls held secrets whispered on the wind, and tonight, they promised to unravel something dangerous.
