The air hung thick with the scent of granite and dust, heavy as a shroud even in the midday sun. It clung to Elias Thorne's lungs, each inhalation reminding him that he was truly living amongst stones, crafting them into something more than just raw material.  He knelt before his worktable, a rough-hewn oak slab the size of a small wagon wheel, where a half-carved dragon lay still and silent under the harsh glare of the workshop's single window. The face remained elusive, trapped in a dance between the jagged edges he was carving and the stubborn lines left by time.  

Elias Thorne was as much an artisan of stone as his father and grandfather before him. His lineage had been woven into the very fabric of the city-state of Aethelgard since its foundation. But unlike his predecessors, Elias wasn't content with simply hewing to tradition. He yearned for something more, something that defied the limitations of their craft.  

His workshop, nestled within the bustling market district, was a symphony of rough edges and sharp tools. The city hummed outside, a ceaseless cacophony of merchants hawking wares and children playing in the cobbled streets. Yet, inside its humble walls, Elias wrestled with his artistic heart, each cut and chisel stroke a silent plea for expression.  His life felt like a canvas, waiting to be painted with something more than mere practicality.
