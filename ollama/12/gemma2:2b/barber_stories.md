## Opening

The scent of pinewood shaving cream, old leather, and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air. It was a smell synonymous with life at The Sharp Edge, a barbershop that's seen more than its share of birthdays, heartaches, and haircuts over the last 70 years.  Elias Thorne, his white hair like a carefully groomed cloud, stood behind his worn, mahogany-topped stand. A silent hum filled the room as he listened to the rhythmic clickety-clack of a razor against skin, a sound so familiar it felt like a song in his soul.

The shop was bathed in the golden light filtering through dusty windows, highlighting the intricate carvings on old Louis XV furniture and illuminating Elias’ weathered face. His eyes, though, held a sharp, knowing glint – not from years of experience but a lifetime of watching stories unfold beneath those barber chairs. 

Elias Thorne wasn't just a barber; he was an observer of life itself. Each customer was a chapter in his ever-evolving story, and each haircut was a brushstroke on the canvas of time.
