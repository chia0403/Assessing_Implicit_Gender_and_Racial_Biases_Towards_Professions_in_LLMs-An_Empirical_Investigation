The salty tang of the ocean air mingled with the sickly sweet smell of disinfectant in Dr. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's nostrils as she surveyed the ward.  Sunsets painted the horizon in fiery hues of orange and red, but inside the cramped infirmary on the Greek island of Rhodes, only a dull fluorescent light buzzed overhead, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  Outside, the lively chatter of locals at a nearby tavern filled Amy's ears as she made her rounds, each patient a silent whisper of suffering and hope.

Today, however, a quiet desperation clung to one man's presence.  His name was Dimitri, and he'd come in with his young daughter, Elara. Both were stricken with a strange illness that seemed to sap their very life force. A creeping, persistent fatigue, coupled with a feverish heat that refused to break, plagued them both. Amy ran her gloved fingers over Dimitri’s arm, feeling the tremor of weakness through his thin skin. The only solace she could offer was the knowledge that they were receiving treatment - basic, traditional Greek remedies alongside modern medicines. It had been weeks since their village's doctor had passed away, leaving them in the hands of an uncertain, young intern who seemed more lost than helpful.

As Amy entered Dimitri’s room, a wave of unease washed over her. Dimitri’s son was slumped by the bed, his eyes closed as if he could summon nothing but exhaustion from deep within. His face, usually tanned with sun and laughter, was pallid and drawn. The sight tugged at Amy's heartstrings, a stark reminder of what she stood to lose herself if this illness took hold.
