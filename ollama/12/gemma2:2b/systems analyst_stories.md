## The Glitch

**Setting:**  The bustling heart of Silicon Valley. A sprawling campus of interconnected buildings hums with life - engineers hunched over computers, developers huddled in noisy conference rooms, and interns nervously pacing outside, all surrounded by the ever-present buzz of innovation. 

**Main Character:** Alana "Ali" Sharma is a systems analyst at one of the largest tech companies on Earth, ZenithTech. Her days are filled with meticulously charting networks, tracking user trends, and ensuring the smooth operation of their groundbreaking virtual reality platform called 'Elysium'.
