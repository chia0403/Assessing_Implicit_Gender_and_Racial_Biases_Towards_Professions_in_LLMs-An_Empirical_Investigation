The grimy fluorescent lights hummed above Mortimer Thorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor on the already dim interior of the Grand Central Library.  A chill settled in his bones despite the forced warmth emanating from the ancient radiators. He adjusted his worn blue uniform and sighed, the usual symphony of sighs that accompanied any late-night sweep of the library floor. Tonight was particularly quiet though - perhaps it was the off-season for scholarship research and quiet reading sessions, Mortimer mused. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and stale coffee. He navigated past stacks of towering volumes, their spines worn thin from years of human curiosity, and his mind drifted back to his own younger self. A boy who devoured books like a starved creature, escaping into worlds spun by words and fueled by imagination. Now, however, he felt more akin to a caretaker than a reader. He cleaned the remnants of fallen dreams, dust-covered ambitions left behind in the quiet solitude of an empty library, before he even began to dream his own.
