## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A decaying Victorian mansion nestled deep in the rolling hills outside of Salem, Massachusetts. Known locally as "The Widow Blackwood's Estate," the building oozed melancholy with its peeling paint, gnarled branches clawing at storm clouds, and the constant whisper of secrets carried on the wind. 

**Main Character:** Elara Thorne, DPT,  a young occupational therapist who had traded bustling city life for the eerie silence of this forgotten manor. Elara's heart was full of compassion, but her head buzzed with a nagging sense of unease. She wouldn't be surprised if she started seeing shadows move on the wall or heard the echo of laughter in deserted halls. 

**Opening:**  "Mrs. Blackwood used to say this house had a soul," Elara mumbled to herself, gazing down at a weathered rocking chair swaying gently beside her makeshift treatment room. "A strong one." The old woman’s words echoed in her mind, but what was left of the house's soul seemed lost and fragmented like glass scattered across the floorboards.  She rubbed the rough wooden surface of the rocking chair with callused hands, tracing a memory of its past life: the rhythmic rocking of a baby, a comforting presence, an echo of warmth against the chill of the aging mansion. 

As Elara began to unpack her bags, she noticed a faint hum emanating from somewhere in the depths of the house. A chilling whisper, like wind rustling through dead leaves, sent goosebumps crawling up her arms.  She looked around the room – a small space with faded floral wallpaper and a dusty window overlooking the overgrown garden – but saw no source of the sound. 

"Just my imagination," Elara murmured, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. But even as she spoke, a sense of foreboding settled on her like a shroud. She knew this house had secrets, whispering stories of lives lived and lost within its walls, and she was about to be caught in the undertow of that ghostly history.
