The mahogany doors of the HÃ´tel de la Paix whispered closed behind Estelle Durand, their resonance echoing through the silent hallway. Moonlight spilled through the stained-glass windows, painting geometric patterns on her worn silk scarf as she crossed the threshold. The air was thick with the scent of lavender and old money, a potent cocktail that always clung to the walls of this Parisian gem. Estelle, known throughout the city's elite for her sharp wit and even sharper tongue, would navigate these gilded halls with ease. 

Tonight's assignment, however, felt different. A nervous energy hummed beneath her usual practiced calm as she took in the scene before her: a young man, barely out of his teens, sat slumped on a plush velvet armchair, his face etched with fear. The tension was palpable, heavy and suffocating. His name, whispered only a few words at a time by an equally anxious-looking group of men gathered in the corner, was Gabriel Marchand.  His father's disappearance had left a void that seemed to stretch wider than any Parisian alleyway, casting shadows across the once vibrant life of their family. 

As Estelle looked at him, she realized something; this case wasn't just about retrieving a missing person - it held a weight of secrets, hidden agendas, and long-buried resentments. This was going to be more difficult than usual, especially since Gabriel himself seemed to have no idea what he wanted.
