The pungent aroma of blood-soaked meat hung thick in the air, like an invisible hand clutching at Elias Thorne's throat.  His shop, "Thorne & Son," nestled between a dusty bookshop and a grumpy old apothecary in the heart of Saltwind City, was usually a symphony of chopping, sizzling, and chatter. Today, however, it was an orchestra of silence.  He stood frozen in his apron, a single crimson stain spreading from the butcher's cleaver to its steel handle, as the echoing silence held him captive.

Elias Thorne, named after his great-grandfather who’d brought trade and fear in equal measure to this town over two hundred years ago, was a man of precision and discipline. Every cut of meat had its rhythm, every blade stroke spoke a language only he understood. But today, that familiar dance felt off-kilter. The tension was palpable, thick like the morning fog clinging to the cobbled streets outside his shop's window.  The town's whispers of a "shadow" moving through the city’s back alleys had begun, echoing louder than Elias's heart beat as he stared at the mangled form on the chopping block.
