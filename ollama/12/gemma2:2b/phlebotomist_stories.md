## Story Opening: The Inkblots

**Setting:** A bustling city like Chicago, where steel-and-glass skyscrapers pierce the cloudy sky, their reflections flickering on the wet pavement below. 

**Main Character:**  Anya "Annie" Petrovna Kozlova, a phlebotomist with fingers as steady and precise as an artist's brush, except her canvas wasn't paint but human veins. The rhythmic thump of the heart monitor, the gentle murmur of hushed whispers from patients, the tang of antiseptic - these were the familiar scents and sounds of Annie's world.

**Opening Scene:** 

The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sickly green glow over the waiting room. A smattering of nervous chatter filled the air as patients nervously clutched armrests or stared at their shoes.  Anya, her trademark scarlet scrubs splashed across her skin like a rebellious splash of color in this sterile environment, was already prepared for action. Today's schedule presented a new challenge: an elderly gentleman named Mr. Henderson with a history of... well-documented complications. Annie’s usual stoicism masked a growing knot of unease. There was something about the man's demeanor that felt off, like a tide of anxiety threatened to wash over him.

He sat on the edge of his creaky chair, fidgeting with his worn cane. His eyes darted around the room as if searching for an escape route. A bead of sweat trickled down his forehead, mirroring the lines etched upon his tanned face that had witnessed countless storms. 

“Good morning, Mr. Henderson,” Annie greeted him gently, her voice warm and reassuring even as a prickle of apprehension ran through her veins. “Ready to start?”  She held out a small metal clamp, its sharp tip glinting in the harsh light. The man's gaze met hers, an unspoken plea etched upon his weary face. And then he spoke. His words were clipped, urgent. 

"The ink... it’s… there." He whispered, eyes wide with terror and something else that Annie couldn’t quite decipher. "Like someone…  drew them."
