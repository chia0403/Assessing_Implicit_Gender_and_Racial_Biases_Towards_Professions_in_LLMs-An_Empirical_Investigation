Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The small town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was bathed in the warm golden light of dawn as Captain Evelyn Mae Winters stood outside her small house, sipping coffee from a thermos. The air was crisp and clean, with a hint of wood smoke carried on the gentle breeze. It was a peaceful morning, one that Evelyn savored before she had to face another day of flying.

Evelyn, a seasoned commercial airline pilot with over a decade of experience under her belt, stretched her arms above her head, feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders from a long night of sleep. She lived for these quiet mornings, ones where the world seemed to slow down and she could clear her mind before the chaos of flight schedules and passengers' demands took over.

As she gazed out at the mist-shrouded mountains, Evelyn's thoughts turned to her latest assignment: flying a charter jet from Ravenswood to the bustling city of Nashville for a high-profile business meeting. It was a short hop, but one that required precision and skill â€“ skills Evelyn had honed to perfection over years of flying. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar rush of adrenaline as she mentally prepared herself for the day's flight.
