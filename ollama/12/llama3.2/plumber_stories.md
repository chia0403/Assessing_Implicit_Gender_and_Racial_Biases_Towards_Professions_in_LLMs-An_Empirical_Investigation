Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain pattered against the windows of Joe "Mac" McAllister's plumbing shop like a relentless drumbeat, casting a gloomy pall over the small town of Willow Creek. Outside, the streets were empty and still, save for the occasional passing car that sent ripples through the puddles on Main Street. Mac himself was huddled behind the counter, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as he surveyed the mess before him.

As the owner of McAllister's Plumbing Co., Mac had seen it all - from clogged drains to burst pipes, and everything in between. But nothing could have prepared him for the mysterious phone call that had come in just an hour ago. The voice on the other end had been cryptic, but one thing was clear: someone needed help, and fast.

Mac's eyes scanned the cluttered shop, taking in the stacks of pipes, wrenches, and tools that filled every inch of space. His mind began to wander back to the call - what could it be? And why did he get the feeling that this job would be different from all the others?

Just then, the phone rang again, shrill and insistent. Mac sighed, picking up the receiver with a sense of trepidation.

"McAllister's Plumbing Co., Joe speaking," he said, his voice gruff but friendly.

But before he could even finish the introduction, a single word crackled over the line: "Mac."
