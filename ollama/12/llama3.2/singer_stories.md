Here's a story opening and setting:

---

The dimly lit streets of 1920s New Orleans were alive with the sounds of jazz and blues, echoing off the crumbling brick facades of the French Quarter. The air was thick with the scent of Creole cuisine and the distant tang of Mississippi River water.

In a small, cramped apartment above a jazz club on Bourbon Street, a young singer named Adelaide "Addie" LaRue adjusted her sparkling diamond-encrusted microphone stand, giving it a delicate adjustment to fit just so. Her dark hair was styled in a neat bob, and her bright green eyes sparkled with excitement as she prepared for the biggest performance of her life.

At 22, Addie had already made a name for herself on the New Orleans music scene, known for her sultry voice and mesmerizing stage presence. She had just received an offer to perform at the legendary Congo Square Ballroom, an honor that would catapult her to stardom and cement her place in the city's musical heritage.

But little did Addie know, this performance would also mark a turning point in her life, one that would lead her down a path of secrets, scandals, and ultimately, a mysterious curse that would haunt her for years to come.
