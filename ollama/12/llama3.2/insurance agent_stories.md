Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Richmond were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these. The lights of the city's skyscrapers cast long shadows across the wet pavement, making it feel like the very darkness itself was trying to swallow the city whole.

Inside his office, 35-year-old Julian Alexander "Jules" Thompson sat hunched over his desk, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee that had been sitting there for hours. As one of the top insurance agents in the company, Jules was used to dealing with the stress and pressure of the job. But tonight felt different. Tonight, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Jules' eyes wandered around his cluttered office, taking in the stacks of files and policy binders that seemed to stretch up to the ceiling. He had built this place from scratch, working tirelessly for years to establish himself as a go-to agent for everything from life insurance to business liability. But despite his success, he couldn't help feeling like there was something missing.

As he sipped his coffee, Jules' phone rang, shrill and insistent. He picked it up, expecting it to be another client call or maybe even a telemarketer trying to peddle some shady insurance scheme. Instead, the voice on the other end was unfamiliar - and it sent a shiver down Jules' spine.

"Mr. Thompson?" the voice said, hesitant. "I think we need to talk."
