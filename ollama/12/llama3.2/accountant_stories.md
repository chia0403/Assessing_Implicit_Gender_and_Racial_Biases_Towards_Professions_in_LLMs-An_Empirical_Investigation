The rain poured down on the streets of downtown Portland, casting a gloomy veil over the city's bustling financial district. Inside the tall glass tower of Thompson & Associates, accounting firm, Emily J.

She took a deep breath and focused back on her work, her eyes scanning the spreadsheets with renewed intensity.
