Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Evelyn Elizabeth Thompson stepped out of her small office building, her eyes fixed on the grey horizon. A drizzle had turned to a downpour overnight, casting a melancholy mood over the city. The sounds of car horns and chatter from passersby were muffled by the relentless patter of raindrops against the pavement.

Evelyn, a 35-year-old lawyer with a sharp mind and quick wit, pulled her umbrella shut behind her, protecting herself from the deluge. Her dark brown hair was neatly styled beneath her fitted navy jacket, a stark contrast to the chaotic world outside. She had just finished a grueling day of court appearances, fighting for justice on behalf of her clients in a city where power and greed often reigned supreme.

As she hailed a taxi, Evelyn's thoughts turned to the case that had been weighing on her mind all week: the suspicious death of a local activist, which seemed to be linked to a major corporation's interests. She knew she was taking a risk by getting involved, but something about this particular case resonated with her, and she couldn't shake off the feeling that she needed to dig deeper.

With the taxi finally arriving, Evelyn settled into the backseat, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in the city where justice was often relative.
