Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Detective Emilia Rose McCarthy stood at the edge of the storm drain, her eyes fixed on the dark waters below. The rain had been pouring down for hours, threatening to overflow the already-saturated streets of downtown Portland. It was just another night in the city, where crime seemed to lurk around every corner.

As a 10-year veteran of the Portland Police Department, Emilia had seen it all - from the worst-case scenarios to the most mundane citizen complaints. But tonight felt different. Tonight, she had been called to the scene of a particularly gruesome discovery: a young woman's body, pulled from the storm drain just hours before.

The rain continued to fall, casting a misty veil over the city. Emilia shivered, despite her thick coat and layers of thermal underwear. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. This was going to be a long night.

As she gazed out at the deserted streets, Emilia's mind began to wander back to the case files she'd studied earlier that day. A serial killer had been terrorizing Portland for months, targeting young women and leaving behind no evidence but a faint scent of lavender. The only clue was a small, hand-drawn symbol etched into the victim's forehead.

Emilia knew she was running out of time. She had to find this killer before they struck again. And tonight, under the darkness of the stormy night, she felt like she was being watched - by something more sinister than just the shadows themselves.
