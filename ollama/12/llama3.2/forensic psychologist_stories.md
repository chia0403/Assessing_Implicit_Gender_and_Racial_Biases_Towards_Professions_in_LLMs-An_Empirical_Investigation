Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

**Opening Scene:**

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the rain-soaked rooftop, gazing out over the dark, deserted streets of Seattle. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to match the melancholy mood that had been plaguing her all week. As a forensic psychologist with the King County Sheriff's Office, Lexi had seen her fair share of gruesome crime scenes, but none as unsettling as this one.

The body lay at her feet, wrapped in a tattered blanket and cordoned off with police tape. A small, leather-bound notebook was clutched in the victim's hand, its pages fluttering gently in the wind. Lexi's trained eyes scanned the scene, taking in every detail: the shattered window, the torn fabric caught in the broken glass, the eerie silence that seemed to suffocate the entire area.

**Setting:**

Seattle, Washington - 9 PM on a chilly autumn evening

The city was shrouded in a thick layer of mist, the kind that seeped into your bones and made you wonder if the rain would ever truly stop. Lexi stood at the rooftop of the police station's east wing, overlooking the glittering lights of downtown Seattle. The skyscrapers seemed to stretch up towards the gray sky like giant sentinels, their reflections rippling in the wet pavement below.

The King County Sheriff's Office was a nondescript building, situated on the outskirts of Capitol Hill. Lexi had worked there for years, using her expertise to analyze evidence and help the police department solve some of Seattle's most baffling crimes. But tonight felt different. Tonight, she sensed that something was off, that this case would be one she wouldn't soon forget.
