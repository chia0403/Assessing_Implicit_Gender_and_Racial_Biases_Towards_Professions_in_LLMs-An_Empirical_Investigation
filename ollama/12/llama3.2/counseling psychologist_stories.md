Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Rose Blackwood stepped out of her small, cozy office and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed up at the towering oak trees that lined the quiet streets of Ashwood Village. The sunlight filtering through the leaves cast dappled shadows on the sidewalk, creating a sense of serenity that seemed to wash over Emilia like a balm. As a counseling psychologist with a practice nestled in this sleepy town, she had grown accustomed to the peaceful rhythms of rural life, but today felt different. Today, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that the delicate balance of her clients' lives and her own was on the cusp of being upset.

She tucked a strand of curly brown hair behind her ear, smoothing out her tailored white blazer as she made her way towards her car, parked at the edge of the sidewalk. Her mind began to wander to the first client of the day, Lucy Mayfield, a troubled teenager struggling to cope with the loss of her mother just last week. Emilia's thoughts were interrupted by the soft chime of her phone, and she smiled wryly as she pulled out her phone to check the screen - it was a text from an unknown number, with only two words: "Wait for me."

Little did Emilia know, this chance message would be just the beginning of a journey that would shake her to her core and force her to confront the darkest corners of her own past.
