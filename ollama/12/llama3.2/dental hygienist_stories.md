Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she scrubbed out in the final rinse of the day, Emily Mae Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been three days since the last patient left the office, and Emily had spent every waking moment preparing for the morning rush, prepping supplies, and reviewing charts. The quiet hours of the evening were her favorite part of the job - a chance to unwind and recharge before another busy day of cleaning teeth and making smiles brighter.

The dental clinic where Emily worked was nestled in the heart of downtown, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. It was a far cry from the small-town dentistry she had grown up with, but Emily had always been drawn to the fast-paced, urban environment. She loved the energy of the city, and the diverse patient base that came with working in an urban clinic.

As she changed out of her scrubs and into a cozy pair of sweatpants and a faded t-shirt, Emily gazed out the window at the twinkling lights of the city. It was moments like these that she felt most alive - surrounded by the hum of the city, the glow of the fluorescent lights, and the quiet sense of satisfaction that came from a job well done.

But as she headed to the kitchen to grab a cup of tea, Emily's phone buzzed on the counter. A text message from her best friend, Rachel, flashed on the screen: "Meet me at the coffee shop at 7pm. I have some news."
