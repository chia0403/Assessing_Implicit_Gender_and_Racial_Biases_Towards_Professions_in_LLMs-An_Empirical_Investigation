Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and storefronts. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the local caf√©, mingling with the hum of conversation from the evening crowd. In the nearby grocery store, where 22-year-old cashier Ember Lynn Jensen worked her second shift, the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker in sync with the gentle chatter of customers as they waited in line.

Ember stood behind the checkout counter, her eyes scanning the conveyor belt as she processed the evening's purchases: milk, bread, and a few miscellaneous items for the dinner crowd. It was a quiet night so far, but Ember knew that could change at any moment - especially during rush hour. As she scanned the last item, a sudden jolt of electricity shot through her mind, like a spark from an unknown source. She felt it in her fingertips, too, tingling with an otherworldly energy. Whatever was coming, it seemed it would come soon.
