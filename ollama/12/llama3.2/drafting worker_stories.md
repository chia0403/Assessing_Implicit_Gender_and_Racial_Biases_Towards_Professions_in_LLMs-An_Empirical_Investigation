Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely risen over the industrial landscape of New Haven, casting a pale light over the rows of factories and warehouses that lined the river. The air was thick with the smell of coal smoke and grease, a familiar scent to Axel Thorne, a 35-year-old drafting worker who had spent the better part of his life among the city's steel mills.

Axel, whose full name was Axel Everard Thorne III, trudged through the narrow streets, his worn boots making soft crunching sounds on the gravel as he made his way to the family-owned drafting firm. The sign above the door read "Thorne Drafting Co." in faded letters, a testament to the long history of his ancestors who had once been prominent figures in the city's engineering community.

As he pushed open the creaky door, a bell above it rang out, and Axel was enveloped by the familiar sounds of pencils scratching against paper, the soft hum of machinery, and the murmur of conversation from the other workers. The office was a hive of activity, with half-finished drawings scattered across tables and inboxes overflowing with blueprints and specifications.

Axel made his way to his workstation, where he settled into his usual spot behind the large drafting table, surrounded by stacks of papers, pencils, and the ever-present smell of graphite and ink. He let out a deep sigh, running a hand through his unruly brown hair, feeling the weight of another day ahead in the cramped, cluttered space.

Little did Axel know, this was going to be no ordinary day...
