Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set over the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that lined its narrow alleys. In a small workshop nestled between a bakery and a blacksmith's forge, Asher Thorne worked by the fading light of day, his hands moving with precision as he shaped a block of rough-hewn stone into a beautiful marble veneer.

Asher, a master stone cutter with over twenty years of experience, had spent most of his life honing his craft. He took great pride in his work, and was renowned for the exquisite details that went into every piece he created. His fingers, stained with dust and sweat from a day's labor, moved nimbly as he carefully chipped away at the stone, revealing the hidden beauty within.

As he worked, the sounds of the town's evening routine filtered in through the open doorway: laughter and chatter from the bakery next door, the clang of hammering on metal from the blacksmith's forge, and the distant lowing of cattle from the nearby fields. It was a peaceful scene, one that Asher knew all too well.

Outside, the night air was filled with the scent of wood smoke and the stars were beginning to twinkle overhead. The town was quiet, save for the occasional sound of a door creaking open or shut, but in the workshop, time seemed to stand still. For now, at least, Asher's work was his world.

What happens next?
