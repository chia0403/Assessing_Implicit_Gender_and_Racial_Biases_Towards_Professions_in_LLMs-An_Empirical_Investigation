Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a dietician as the main character:

As the sun rose over the bustling streets of New York City, Dr. Sophia Maria Rodriguez stepped out of her small apartment in the heart of Manhattan, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air. The sounds of honking cars, chatter of pedestrians, and wail of sirens filled the air as she made her way to the hospital where she worked as a registered dietitian.

Sophia had always been passionate about nutrition and helping people achieve their health goals. She had spent years studying and working in some of the top hospitals and clinics in the country, earning her Doctor of Philosophy degree in Nutrition Science from Columbia University. But after a particularly grueling experience with a demanding hospital administrator, Sophia had decided to leave the corporate world behind and start her own practice as an independent dietician.

Now, at the age of 32, Sophia was finally finding her footing in her new career. She had built up a loyal client base of patients who appreciated her holistic approach to nutrition and her willingness to listen to their unique needs and concerns. Her cozy office in a trendy neighborhood was filled with books on nutrition, kitchen gadgets, and a few framed photos of loved ones.

As Sophia walked to the hospital, she checked her phone for any messages or notifications. She had a busy day ahead of her, with appointments with patients who were struggling with everything from weight loss to managing chronic diseases like diabetes. But first things first, she needed to fuel up for the day - and that meant heading straight to her favorite coffee shop for a pre-shift latte.

Little did Sophia know, this was just the beginning of a challenging yet rewarding journey that would take her to the front lines of the nutrition world...
