Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy mist over the already drab streets of downtown Los Angeles. It was a fitting backdrop for the latest meeting at Smith & Co., the high-end electronics store where 32-year-old salesperson Ethan Thompson spent most of his days trying to make a sale.

Ethan's eyes scanned the crowded conference room, taking in the familiar faces of the company's top clients and his own colleagues. He had been working at Smith & Co. for five years now, slowly building up a loyal customer base among the city's tech-savvy elite. But with the rise of online shopping and big-box stores like Best Buy, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling that he was fighting a losing battle.

Just as he was about to take his seat at the conference table, Ethan's phone buzzed in his pocket. He hesitated for a moment before pulling it out, hoping against hope that it wasn't another missed call from the warehouse with some inventory issue. But as he glanced at the screen, his heart sank: a text message from his ex-girlfriend, Rachel, asking him to meet her at the rooftop bar in West Hollywood that night.

Ethan's mind was already racing with the possibilities. He and Rachel had been on-again, off-again for years, and their relationship had always been complicated. But there was something about this text message that made Ethan feel like he needed to know what was going on.

As he took his seat at the conference table, trying to focus on the presentation ahead of him, Ethan couldn't help but wonder: what would tonight's chance encounter with Rachel bring?
