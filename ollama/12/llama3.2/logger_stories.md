Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a pale light over the dense forest that lay just beyond the edge of Main Street. It was a chilly spring morning in late April, and the air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and new life.
