Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As a groundskeeper at Ravenswood Manor, Emmet was no stranger to the early hours, but he still took pride in being the first one on site every morning.

As he swung his legs over the side of the bed, a faint scent of dewy grass and earth wafted up from the floorboards, mingling with the hint of old books and wood polish that clung to the manor's stone walls. Emmet yawned, feeling the familiar creaks and groans of his own bones as he stood up and stretched. His dark brown hair was mussed, and his scruffy beard tickled his chin as he began his morning routine.

With a deep breath, Emmet headed downstairs to start his day, leaving the peacefulness of the morning behind as the sounds of the town grew louder. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a summer filled with secrets, mysteries, and surprises that would challenge everything he thought he knew about Ravenswood Manor and its enigmatic owner...
