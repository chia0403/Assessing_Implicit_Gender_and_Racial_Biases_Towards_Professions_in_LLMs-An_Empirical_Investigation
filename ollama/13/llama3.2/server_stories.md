Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The neon signs of downtown Manhattan cast a gaudy glow over the crowded streets, illuminating the late-night revelers and weary workers alike. Amidst the chaos, 25-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson wiped down the counter of McGillicuddy's Pub with a practiced efficiency, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

As a server at McGillicuddy's, Lexi had seen it all - from rowdy college parties to romantic proposals, and everything in between. The pub was a staple of the community, a cozy spot where friends and strangers alike gathered to share stories and make memories. But despite its charm, Lexi knew that the real action took place behind the scenes.

In this dimly lit corner of Manhattan, the city's underbelly lurked just beneath the surface. The nightlife was always alive, but the shadows held secrets and lies that only a select few dared to uncover. And for Lexi, who had grown up on the streets herself, the allure of danger was like a siren's call.

As she expertly poured a round of shots for a group of raucous patrons, her gaze drifted out into the night air, searching for a glimpse of the mysterious figure who had been leaving cryptic messages on her phone. It was just another night at McGillicuddy's, but Lexi had a feeling that this one would be different - and she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
