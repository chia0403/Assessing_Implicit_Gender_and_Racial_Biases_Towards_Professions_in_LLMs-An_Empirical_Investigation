Here's a potential story opening and setting for a private detective novel:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these. The kind of night where the neon signs of the local bars and strip clubs seemed to flicker in sync with the rhythm of the drizzle, casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalks. It was a night that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the troubles that lurked just beyond the threshold.

But for Emilia "Mia" Thompson, private detective, there was no comfort to be found in such quiet desperation. Mia stood outside her office, a small, cramped room above the used bookstore on 5th Street, gazing out at the rain-lashed streets below. The sign above her door, with its faded letters and rusty hinges, seemed to creak in sympathy as she lit a cigarette.

Mia was no stranger to Ashwood City's darker corners. She'd grown up here, the daughter of a local cop who'd been murdered when she was just a teenager. Since then, Mia had made it her mission to uncover the truth about her father's death and bring justice to those responsible. As a private detective, she'd seen her fair share of unsavory characters and unexplained mysteries.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A sense of restlessness had been building inside Mia all day, like a low-grade fever that refused to break. She couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her, waiting for her to make a move. And when she turned back into her office, the dim light and dusty air seemed to swallow her whole, leaving only an unsettling sense of being watched.
