Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Ravenshire, casting a dark shadow over the crumbling stone walls that surrounded its main street. The air was heavy with the scent of smoke and damp earth, and the only sound was the distant howl of wolves in the surrounding forest.

Inside the town's central keep, Guard Commander Elara Asteria Valdor stood watch at the entrance to the great hall, her eyes scanning the gathering darkness for any sign of trouble. Her armor creaked softly as she shifted her weight, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword at her side. The flickering torches cast eerie shadows on the stone walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the dead were stirring.

Elara had served as a guard in Ravenshire for nearly ten years, and yet the sense of unease that settled in her stomach whenever nightfall approached never truly dissipated. There was something about the darkness that made her feel like she was walking on thin ice, waiting for the next tremor or earthquake to shake the foundations of the keep.

As she stood vigilant, Elara's thoughts turned to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing Ravenshire for weeks. Livestock gone missing, strange noises in the dead of night, and an increasing number of travelers who claimed to have seen shadowy figures lurking on the outskirts of town... it was as though something - or someone - was watching Ravenshire from just beyond its borders, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

And Elara had a feeling that she was about to be called upon to face whatever horrors lay ahead.
