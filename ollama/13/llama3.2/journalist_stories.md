Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a sweltering summer evening in July 2023, and the streets of New Orleans were alive with the sounds of jazz music and the smell of spicy gumbo wafting from the kitchens of the French Quarter's famous restaurants. Amidst the vibrant nightlife, one person stood out - Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a determined and resourceful investigative journalist who had made a name for herself in the city's news scene.

Lexi, a 32-year-old native New Orleanian with curly dark hair and piercing green eyes, sat at her desk, sipping on a cold glass of Abita beer as she pored over the latest police report. Her worn-out notebook and pen were scattered across the table, filled with notes and leads on a string of recent burglaries that had been plaguing the city's wealthier neighborhoods.

As she scanned the report, Lexi's mind began to wander back to her childhood home in the Treme, where her parents still lived. Her younger brother, 19-year-old Tyler, was missing - last seen leaving his part-time job at a local diner just a few days ago. The police had given up hope of finding him, but Lexi knew that wasn't true. She had a hunch that the burglaries were more than just random break-ins - she was convinced that her brother's disappearance was connected to the crimes.

With a newfound sense of determination, Lexi tossed her pen onto the desk and grabbed her bag, ready to start digging deeper into the mystery. Little did she know, this case would lead her down a dark and treacherous path, one that would test her skills as a journalist and push her own family's secrets to the surface.
