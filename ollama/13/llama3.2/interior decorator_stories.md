Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the dusty windowsills of her Brooklyn brownstone, Augusta "Gussie" Wynter Wellesley stepped back to survey her handiwork. The once-neglected living room was now a tranquil oasis, its walls painted a soothing shade of sage and its furniture arranged in a deliberate dance of comfort and style.

A successful interior decorator with a keen eye for detail, Gussie had spent years honing her craft, turning neglected spaces into havens that belied their former drabness. Her clients adored her, and she took pride in knowing exactly how to coax the best out of even the most recalcitrant rooms.

But as she gazed around the room, a tiny crease furrowed her brow. Something was off, something Gussie couldn't quite put her finger on. She felt it in the subtle way the afternoon light slanted through the windows, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floor... and a nagging sense of unease that had been growing all day.

It wasn't until she spotted a small piece of paper tucked away beneath the couch cushion that Gussie's instincts screamed for her to take action. The note was scribbled in hasty handwriting, and its contents sent a shiver down her spine: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."

Gussie's heart skipped a beat as she stared at the cryptic message. Who could have left it here? And what did they want from her?
