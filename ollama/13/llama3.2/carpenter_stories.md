Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Willow Creek, shrouding its quaint streets and wooden buildings in a damp, gray veil. In a small workshop on Elm Street, carpenter and owner of "Hartley & Sons" woodworking company, Emrys Hartley, stirred from his slumber. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and swung his legs over the side of the creaky workbench, planting his feet firmly on the wooden floorboards.

Emrys lived for this time of day - the quiet morning hours before the sun rose high enough to make the town's bustle unbearable. The scent of freshly cut wood, oil, and sawdust filled the air as he lit the forge fire in the corner, coaxing it back to life with a gentle nudge of the metal poker.

It was on days like these that Emrys felt most at home - surrounded by his tools, his hands moving deftly between the workbench and the waiting projects. The sounds of the town's morning routine filtered through the workshop window: children playing in the park across the street, the distant rumble of the town's water tower being filled, and the clanging of pots from the diner on Main Street.

Emrys took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist fill his lungs, and smiled. Today was going to be a good day - he had a few projects lined up, including a new porch for the Watsons' old Victorian home and a set of stairs for the Jenkins' rustic cabin in the woods. The quiet morning hours were all his, and he was ready to make the most of it.

But as he began to plan out his day's work, Emrys's thoughts kept drifting back to an odd job he'd received from the town's reclusive old-timer, Silas Thorne - a mysterious request that had left him with more questions than answers.
