Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The neon sign creaked in the gentle breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets of downtown Ravenswood. Inside "Maeve's Pourhouse," the dimly lit bar was a haven for those seeking refuge from the city's noise and chaos. Behind the counter, Maeve O'Connor polished a glass with a white apron wrapped tightly around her waist, her bright blue eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble.

Maeve had always loved the Pourhouse, with its faded velvet curtains and worn wooden tables. It was her family's bar, passed down from her grandfather, who had poured pints for the town's finest during Prohibition. Now, Maeve was the one keeping the tradition alive, serving up craft beers and whiskey to the regulars and newcomers alike.

As she expertly mixed a classic Manhattan, Maeve's mind wandered to the night ahead. The Ravenswood River Festival was just around the corner, bringing with it a influx of tourists and locals looking for a good time. Maeve had already started prepping for the crowds, but her attention was focused on one customer in particular - a mysterious stranger who had walked into the Pourhouse earlier that evening, his eyes locked on hers with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

Little did Maeve know, this stranger's arrival would set off a chain of events that would change the course of her life forever.
