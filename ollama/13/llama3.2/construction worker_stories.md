Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the bustling city of New Haven, casting a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers and cramped alleys of the industrial district. In a small, rundown warehouse on 5th Street, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins was finishing up his shift as a construction worker.

At 32 years old, Hawk had spent most of his life working with his hands - first on his father's farm in rural Ohio, and then in the city's construction scene for over a decade. He was a jack-of-all-trades, known for his mechanical aptitude and no-nonsense attitude that had earned him respect from his coworkers.

Despite the grueling work schedule and long hours, Hawk took pride in his job as a roughneck on the local high-rise development project. The steel beams, concrete slabs, and rivets were his domain, and he knew every inch of the site like the back of his hand.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Hawk had received an unusual request from the project manager - to meet with him at 5 PM sharp in a private office on the 10th floor. The email had been brief: "Urgent business. Come alone."
