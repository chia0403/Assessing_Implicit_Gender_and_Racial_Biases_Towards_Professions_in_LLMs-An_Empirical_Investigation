Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School, illuminating the rows of lockers and classrooms that seemed to stretch on forever. The year was 1995, and the air was thick with the scent of stale dust and yesterday's lunches.

In one of these forgotten classrooms, a lone figure pushed a mop cart down the center aisle, the soft swish-swish-swish of the broom echoing through the empty space like a lonely lullaby. This was Emilio Javier Morales, the school's janitor extraordinaire, who had been keeping Ravenswood running smoothly for over a decade. With his worn denim overalls and battered Stetson hat, Emilio looked more like a veteran of the American West than a custodian. He moved with a quiet purpose, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble or messes that needed attending to.

As he emptied the trash cans and restocked paper towel rolls, Emilio's mind began to wander to the events of the previous night â€“ the mysterious break-in at school, the eerie feeling that lingered in the hallways like a shadow, and the cryptic message scrawled on the bathroom wall: "The truth is hidden where you least expect it."

Little did Emilio know, his mundane routine was about to take an unexpected turn.
