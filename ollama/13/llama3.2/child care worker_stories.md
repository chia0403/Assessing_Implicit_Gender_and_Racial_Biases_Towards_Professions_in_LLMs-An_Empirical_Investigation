Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a cozy little house on Elm Street, 25-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was getting ready for another long day at the job she loved. As a child care worker at the local community center, Lexi spent her days playing with kids, making arts and crafts, and teaching them about the world around them.
