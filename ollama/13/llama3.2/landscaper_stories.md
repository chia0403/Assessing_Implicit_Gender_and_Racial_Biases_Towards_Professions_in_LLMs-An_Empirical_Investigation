Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun rose over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm glow over the quaint streets and tidy lawns, Jasper Alexander "Alex" Thompson stepped out of his rusty old truck and stretched his weathered arms. The smell of freshly cut grass and dew-kissed earth filled his lungs as he gazed out at the patchwork of gardens and parks that made up his livelihood.

At 35, Alex had spent over a decade working as a landscaper, earning a reputation in Willow Creek for his attention to detail and ability to coax even the most reluctant plants back to life. His own small business, Thompson's Turf, had grown from a handful of odd jobs to a thriving operation that employed several others during the warmer months.

But on this particular morning, Alex's thoughts weren't on the latest garden design or client satisfaction. They were on the mysterious letter he'd received just days before - a cryptic note that spoke of an old, long-abandoned property on the outskirts of town, and hinted at a hidden treasure waiting to be uncovered. The words danced in his mind like a tantalizing itch, refusing to be ignored.

With a sense of trepidation and curiosity, Alex tucked his letter into his pocket and set off towards the abandoned property, the worn soles of his boots scraping against the gravel driveway as he made his way deeper into the unknown.
