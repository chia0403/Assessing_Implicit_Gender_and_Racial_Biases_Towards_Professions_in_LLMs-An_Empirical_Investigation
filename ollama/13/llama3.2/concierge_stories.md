Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the canals of Venice like a damp shroud, casting a misty gloom over the city's narrow streets and ornate piazzas. It was a typical autumn morning in this ancient metropolis, with tourists scrambling to find the perfect shot for their Instagram feeds and locals hurrying to get to work.

In a small, family-owned hotel nestled between a gelateria and a vintage shop on the Riva degli Schiavoni, a concierge named Leonardo Marco Fabbri was already up and about, preparing for another day of dealing with the city's eccentric guests. At 32, Leo had spent years honing his skills in the art of hospitality, from arranging private gondola rides to recommending the best seafood risotto joints.

Leo's eyes scanned the hotel's lobby, taking in the intricate frescoes on the ceiling and the antique chandeliers that cast a warm glow over the plush armchairs. He smiled to himself as he spotted his first guest of the day, a flamboyant fashion designer named Alessandro Bianchi, who was notorious for his diva-like behavior and tendency to make unreasonable demands.

As Leo began to prepare for the day's arrivals, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been building in the city all morning, like a storm brewing on the horizon. And then, just as he was about to start his rounds, a cryptic message appeared on his phone from an unknown number: "Meet me at the Piazza San Marco at midnight. Come alone."
