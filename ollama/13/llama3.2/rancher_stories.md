Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the open range, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and towering oak trees that dotted the landscape. On his family's ranch, the Bar none, Wyatt August "Augie" Jenkins gazed out at the breathtaking view from the worn wooden railing of his porch, a familiar sense of unease settling in the pit of his stomach.

It had been three months since Augie's younger brother, Jake, had gone missing. The local sheriff, Ed Thomas, still hadn't given up hope that Jake would turn up alive, but as the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, Augie couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible had happened to him.

Augie's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his oldest son, Caleb, pulling up in the truck out front. The 16-year-old had been working on the ranch for years, but lately he'd taken to spending more and more time exploring the backcountry with Augie, much to their father's dismay. Now, however, Caleb was staring at his phone, a look of concern etched on his face.

"What is it, boy?" Augie asked, setting down his drink.

"It's Sheriff Thomas," Caleb replied, his voice low and serious. "He wants to talk to us about Jake."

Augie's gut dropped. This wasn't good.
