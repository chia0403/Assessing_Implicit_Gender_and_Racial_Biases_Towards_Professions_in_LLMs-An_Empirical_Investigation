**Opening**

As she sipped her morning coffee and gazed out the rain-soaked window of her office, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson felt a sense of unease wash over her. It was not uncommon for days to start like this in Seattle - gray skies, drizzle, and a general feeling of stagnation. But Lexi knew that today was different. Today marked the one-year anniversary of her mother's passing, and she couldn't shake the feeling that somehow, someway, her mother's legacy would come flooding back into her life.

**Setting**

Lexi's office, Thompson Realty & Investments, was a small, unassuming building in the heart of downtown Seattle. The walls were adorned with photographs of happy clients, listings from past sales, and faded motivational posters from a bygone era.

As the rain continued to fall outside, Lexi knew that today was going to be a long day - one that would take her from the bright lights of downtown Seattle to the quieter corners of the city, all in pursuit of her next big sale.
