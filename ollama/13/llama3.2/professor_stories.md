Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Alexandra Wellesley stood at the edge of her office window, gazing out over the sleepy college town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. The misty dawn air clung to the rolling hills like a damp shroud, casting an ethereal gloom over the streets and homes below.

As a professor of English literature at Ravenswood University, Dr. Wellesley had grown accustomed to the quiet rhythms of small-town life. She had spent countless hours researching, teaching, and writing within these walls, but tonight she felt restless, her mind buzzing with thoughts of a mysterious package that had arrived earlier that day.
