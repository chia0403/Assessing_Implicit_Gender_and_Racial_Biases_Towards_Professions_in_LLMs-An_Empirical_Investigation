Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Paris were always at their most melancholy during the spring equinox, when the city seemed to be suspended between winter's chill and summer's warmth. It was a time of transition, much like the city itself. Amidst the winding streets and charming cafes, Aurora "Rory" Étienne sat huddled in her small atelier, surrounded by half-finished canvases and scattered paint tubes.

Aurora, or Rory as she was known to friends and acquaintances, was a 28-year-old artist with a passion for capturing the fleeting moments of beauty that seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye. Her paintings were like windows into another world, a world of dreamlike landscapes and intimate portraits that spoke to the hearts of those who beheld them.

As she worked on her latest piece, a haunting portrait of a woman lost in thought, Rory's mind wandered back to the conversation she'd had with her estranged father earlier that day. He was a successful businessman, always chasing the next big deal and leaving little time for his family. Rory's mother had passed away when she was just a teenager, and her relationship with her father had been strained ever since.

The phone rang, breaking the spell of concentration that had settled over Rory like a blanket. She picked up, expecting it to be one of her clients or perhaps a fellow artist with an opportunity to collaborate. Instead, she heard her sister's familiar voice on the other end of the line, laced with a hint of worry and urgency.

"Rory, I need to talk to you about something," her sister said, her words tumbling out in a rush. "Meet me at Café de Flore tomorrow afternoon. Come alone."

And just like that, Rory's world was turned upside down once again.
