The air in Florence hung thick and pregnant with history. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight that slunk through the arched doorway of Amelia Alcott's tiny writing room.  She inhaled deeply, letting the musty scent of aged paper and leather mingle with the lingering tang of Tuscan sunbaked grapes from yesterday’s vineyard tour.  Amelia ran a hand over her worn copy of Dante’s Inferno, its pages whispering secrets from a bygone era. 

"Another blank page," she sighed, tracing the edges of a particularly spidery inscription. It was meant to be inspiration, but all it brought was frustration. She yearned for a story, something that would fill the echoing void in her soul and shake loose the stubborn weight on her shoulders.  Instead, she found herself staring at a storm brewing outside her window – not the usual gentle Tuscan rain showers, but something more ominous, like an angry sea about to crash against the shore.
