##  Dust Devil's Dance

The wind whipped across Jebediah "Jeb" Miller's weathered face, tugging at his worn Stetson hat like a mischievous child playing tag. He squinted through the red haze that clung to the air in the Oklahoma desert, its thinness amplified by the relentless 100+ degree heat. Dust devils danced around him, swirling up from the cracked earth of the highway, a fiery ballet against the endless expanse of sky and sand. Jeb adjusted his headlamp, casting a harsh beam across the desolate landscape.  His worn Chevy pickup rumbled to life behind him, its engine coughing and wheezing like an old man's cough. 

Jeb had been hauling rocks for the past five years on this stretch of I-40, battling the unforgiving desert and his own growing frustration with each passing sunset. A solitary figure against the vast emptiness, he felt more at home amidst the grit and grime than in any bustling city or crowded town. The highway was Jeb's lifeblood - its hard-worn asphalt a canvas for his quiet rebellion against the monotony of existence, painting it with lines of duty, sweat, and stubborn hope. He was ready to confront the dust devil's dance once more; he had a bridge to build, and time, like the wind, refused to wait for him to catch up.
