The gentle hum of the clippers mingled with the rhythmic patter of rain against the shop window. Inside "Scissors & Style," the air smelled faintly of lavender shampoo and worn leather.  This was Elias Thorne's domain: his small, cozy barbershop on Elm Street in Portland. Elias, a man whose salt-and-pepper beard matched the city's autumnal chill, ran a hand over his own unruly hair – the auburn strands seemed to dance as he did. 

It wasn't just the weather that was melancholy this afternoon. A lingering sense of loss hung heavy in the air. Elias had been called away unexpectedly last night, on an emergency basis. He had seen it happen – a scene both violent and tragic, something that left him shaken long after the last sirens faded. 

Tonight, he'd be waiting for his regular client, Ms. Evelyn Bellweather, who was notorious for her meticulous routine and sharp wit. The storm outside mirrored the anxiety brewing within him as he waited for her to arrive – a feeling of something approaching an unveiling. He had heard whispers about a secret that would unravel the delicate tapestry of their lives –  a story whispered around his barbershop door like a hushed prayer.
