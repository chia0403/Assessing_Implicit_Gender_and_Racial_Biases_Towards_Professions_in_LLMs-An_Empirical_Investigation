The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Aethelburg like a shroud, obscuring even the ancient gargoyles that dotted the cathedral's rooftop in their grotesque grandeur.  Inside the cathedral, rain hammered against the stained glass, transforming the usual kaleidoscope of colours into a muted tapestry of grey and green. This was where Elias Thorne, a man whose soul was as sharp and angular as his architectural designs, found solace. 

Elias Thorne had been obsessed with Aethelburg's gothic cathedral for years, not just because it housed the city's most cherished relics but also because its very structure held echoes of an ancient power that lay dormant under layers of stone and mortar. He was a dreamer, a man who saw beyond the mundane to envision magnificent structures that defied gravity and challenged convention. 

Today, however, Elias’s usual meditative state was disrupted by a frantic knock at his door. It was Agnes, his secretary, her face pale and etched with worry, the words "Master" barely leaving her trembling lips.  Agnes had served him faithfully for years, understanding his complex soul better than most. She knew that Elias's world wasn't just about blueprints and building codes. He lived on the edge of magic and wonder, even if he couldn’t quite admit it.
