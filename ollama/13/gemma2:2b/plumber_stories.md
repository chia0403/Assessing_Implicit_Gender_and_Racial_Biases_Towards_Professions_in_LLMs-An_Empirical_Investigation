Rain hammered against the worn-out window of Frank “Fingers” Fitzwilliam’s cramped apartment, its rhythm mimicking the frantic drumming of his heart. The storm had begun with an alarming chill, but it was only now that he’d realised the real problem – a burst pipe in the basement was slowly turning into a cascading torrent of water, threatening to consume everything in its path.  

Frank's hands, calloused and strong from years spent battling leaky pipes, gripped the wrench tighter.  He wasn’t a man of grand gestures, more comfortable with his worn tools than any fancy gadgets or dramatic pronouncements. Frank Fitzwilliam was just a plumber, doing what he always did – fix things for others until they were watertight again. 

Tonight though, the storm wasn't just a weather anomaly; it felt like the world itself was collapsing in on him.  He glanced at his worn-out toolbox, its contents familiar and comforting, yet somehow inadequate against this impending deluge. The smell of mildew and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark reminder of the precarious nature of life within these walls. He wasn't just battling a leaky pipe; he was fighting for something bigger – against the tide that threatened to drown him, both literally and metaphorically.
