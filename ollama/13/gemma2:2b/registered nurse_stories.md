## The Nightingale's Shadow

The sterile white walls of Mercy General seemed to press in on Amelia "Amy" Thorne. It wasnâ€™t the usual hum of machines and conversations that bothered her, though there was enough noise to fill a cathedral. No, it was the silence, the eerie quietude that punctuated the cacophony around her.  

Amy, with her signature auburn braid trailing down her worn hospital scrubs, scanned the empty waiting area. The air hung heavy with anticipation and a lingering scent of disinfectant. The room across from her was normally alive with anxious families, their faces etched with worry, but today, it was eerily empty except for a single gurney tucked away in the corner. She'd just received news that sent a shiver down her spine - Mr. Eldridge, the esteemed cardiologist who ran the entire heart transplant program at Mercy General, had been admitted. 

Mr. Eldridge hadnâ€™t been seen by anyone since his late-night emergency visit. They were all on edge. What was worse, the silence seemed to speak volumes, each tick of the clock echoing with unspoken anxieties.  As Amy adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, she couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched. There was a presence in this room, a shadow lurking in the corner, a darkness that felt almost tangible. This wasnâ€™t just an ordinary patient; this was Mr. Eldridge, and something was amiss.
