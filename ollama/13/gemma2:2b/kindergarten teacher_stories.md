## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The sun dripped gold through the stained-glass windows of Mrs. Evelyn Bell's Kindergarten classroom in Sunnybrook Elementary School. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, carrying with it the scent of fresh-cut grass and blooming honeysuckle. The air was thick with the sweet aroma of apple cider donuts, courtesy of Mrs. Thompson's baking class this afternoon. 

**Main Character:**  Evelyn Bell, a veteran kindergarten teacher with eyes as blue as forget-me-nots and hands that moved with an almost magical grace, was meticulously prepping for her daily routine. A symphony of squeaks from the construction block castle in one corner, giggles echoing from the pretend grocery store made up of discarded cardboard boxes in another, and the soft hum of children’s voices filled the room. 

**Opening:**  Evelyn's gaze fell upon the bulletin board where the week's theme was emblazoned - "The Wonderful World of Nature." She traced her fingers over the large-scale drawing of a lush rainforest. The image was vibrant, almost too lifelike for its painted nature. It seemed to whisper secrets to her – whispers of forgotten tales and hidden wonders. As she looked deeper into the classroom's eyes, however, Evelyn noticed a change. There, amongst the usual flurry of excited chatter, stood one child, his brown eyes wide with fear, clutching a crumpled piece of paper in his small fist.  "He's scared, Mrs. Bell," whispered Ms. Davies, her voice tinged with concern. "He saw something outside."
