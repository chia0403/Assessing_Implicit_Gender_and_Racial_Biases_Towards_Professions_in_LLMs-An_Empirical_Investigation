The wind whipped across the prairie, biting at the exposed skin on Ezekiel "Zeke" Thornton's cheeks even through his worn leather jacket. The harsh sun had begun to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised orange and blood-red. As dusk settled over Pine Ridge Ranch, Zeke surveyed his meager property – a sprawling expanse dotted with dusty barns and weathered fences.  He adjusted his cowboy hat, its brim casting a shadow over his tired eyes that held the weight of years spent under this unforgiving sun. 

Zeke's ranching days were long over. The bones of a once-mighty operation now creaked beneath a thin layer of dust and neglect. His herd had dwindled to just a handful of stubborn longhorns, their coats scarred by harsh winters and the unrelenting desert heat.  He was outnumbered and outmatched by the creeping drought that had settled over the land like a shroud, stealing life from the earth with every passing day.

The only solace he found in this desolate landscape was the familiar rhythm of his daily chores – feeding his dwindling herd, mending fences, and tending to his aging mare, Starla. Each task felt heavy under the weight of unanswered prayers, each sunrise bringing only further reminders of the struggles that lay ahead.
