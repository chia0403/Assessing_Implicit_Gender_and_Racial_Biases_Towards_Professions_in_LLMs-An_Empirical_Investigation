## The Setting

The rust-colored dust kicked up by the bulldozer swirled around Elias Thorne's worn leather boots. It was noon on Tuesday in Deadwood Gulch -  the kind of place where time flowed like molasses and days were measured in the rhythm of engine coughs and the clang of steel against steel. Elias ran a calloused hand across his face, feeling the grit beneath his fingernails. His reflection in the battered metal cab of his Cat 973 looked weary, even after years spent battling the unforgiving landscape of Wyoming's backcountry.

## The Opening

Elias Thorne had seen it all.  He knew how to coax a stubborn grader out of a ditch, how to soothe a jittery excavator into submission, and he had a sixth sense for spotting trouble before it became a full-blown disaster. But even with his decades of experience, the mountain's face before him was different. The rock faces were steeper today, more imposing than usual. A storm had rolled in overnight, leaving behind an eerie stillness, broken only by the wind whistling through the canyons. 

He shifted into gear, the engine purring like a sleepy bear. "Alright, boy," he muttered, giving the Cat's hydraulic arm a gentle thump.  "Time to dig."  His eyes scanned the vast expanse of barren land, a familiar battlefield where his crew faced every inch of the mountain with grit and determination. Today, though, there was a different kind of tension in the air â€“ an unsettling premonition that something wasn't right.
