## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** The Grand Blackwood Hotel, London. A grand but crumbling Victorian mansion on a secluded stretch of Regent's Park. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the reception desk, creating an unnerving symphony as it echoed through the cavernous room. 


**Main character:** Amelia Blackwood, her name echoing the very building she worked in, was known for her quiet demeanor and even quieter disposition. She moved with a subtle grace that belied the sharp edge of her gaze as she watched the revolving door at reception swing open once more.  Each guest entry was an invitation to another story, another life waiting to unfold within these walls. Yet, Amelia never seemed to stray far from the routine â€“ checking in guests, answering phones, filing documents with practiced ease. Her days were predictable, her emotions, muted. 

The only exception to this routine was a persistent unease that gnawed at her soul. Whispers echoed through the building's ancient structure;  sounds of rustling silk, hurried footsteps, and choked whispers in the dead of night.

They were like seeds buried deep within her heart, slowly taking root and threatening to bloom into something more sinister.

As Amelia's gaze locked with his, her unease turned into a chilling premonition. This was no ordinary guest; this man held secrets she could not even begin to comprehend. And in that moment, within the echoing silence of the reception desk, Amelia felt a tremor of fear course through her veins - a shiver that resonated with the whispers swirling around her.
