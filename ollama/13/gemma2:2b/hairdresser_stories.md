The air in "Scissors & Sass" was thick with the tang of hairspray, sweat, and suppressed tension. It wasn't exactly a symphony, but for Evelyn "Eve" Hawthorne, it was her orchestra. A kaleidoscope of colours danced across the salon walls: turquoise streaks in blonde bobs, streaks of pink on raven braids, the occasional neon green highlighting a rebellious undercut. Eve ran a calloused finger through her own auburn curls, the tangles giving way to smooth waves with a whisper of salt spray. Her gaze swept over the row of mannequins, each adorned with an outfit chosen for a specific client - not just hairdressing, but a reflection of their lives and dreams. 

It was Friday, prime time for appointments, yet the waiting room remained sparsely populated.  A single mother juggling childcare and freelance work sat with her daughter reading a battered copy of "Winnie-the-Pooh." A nervous young man in his early twenties fidgeted in his worn leather jacket, eyes flitting around the salon like a caged bird. Eve knew this was just a temporary lull; the phone wouldn't stop ringing until it stopped buzzing. 

As she reached for a fresh bottle of hair oil, her heart sank. The call hadn’t been good – news from the family in London. It wasn’t even news, it was just the inevitable. Evelyn’s world was one of constant change and unexpected turns, a fact that came with the territory of running a small business on the edge of bustling city life.
