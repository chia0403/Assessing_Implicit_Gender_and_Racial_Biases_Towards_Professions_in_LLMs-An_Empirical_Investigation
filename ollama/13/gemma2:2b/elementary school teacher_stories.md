The crisp autumn air swirled fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes that whipped around Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's ankles as she walked down Maple Street. The sun, a pale ghost behind the late-October haze, cast long, skeletal shadows from the old oak trees lining the curb. It was 7:15 am, and the smell of burnt coffee and sugar hung in the air like a tired promise of normalcy. Her classroom, nestled amongst towering shelves filled with forgotten textbooks and overflowing bins of colored pencils, awaited her. Today was field trip day, which meant the usual chaos of twenty-five mismatched second graders, an assortment of misplaced crayons, and a faint hint of terror from Ms. Hawthorne herself, ever since she'd accidentally swapped her "Mrs." for "Ms" on the school supply list. 


 
**Main Character Name:**  Ms. Amelia Hawthorne

* As the school buses rumbled towards their destination, Ms. Hawthorne couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu wash over her, reminiscent of countless other field trips that had been… let's just say "unique."
