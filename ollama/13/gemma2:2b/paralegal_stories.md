Rain lashed against the windowpane of Amelia's tiny apartment in Chicago's Loop district.  The wind howled like a banshee, mimicking the storm raging inside her. Outside, sirens wailed a constant symphony of urban chaos, but inside, Amelia found herself trapped in an even more potent silence. Her boss, Mr. Thorne, had just called it quits. "Not exactly legal eagle material," he'd rasped through the receiver, his voice brittle as old parchment. "Best get your affairs in order." 

Amelia straightened, pulling the worn sweater tighter around her thin frame.  Her gaze swept across the roomâ€”a jumble of legal briefs and dusty files that mirrored her own anxieties. This wasn't just a job; it was a lifeline.  She was barely scraping by with her student loans and rent in this sprawling city that never seemed to sleep, yet somehow always left her feeling completely hollowed out. 

**Name:** Amelia Hayes
**Setting:** Chicago, Illinois (specifically the Loop district) -  a vibrant, bustling city center known for its towering skyscrapers and gritty underbelly.  There's a distinct contrast between high-priced law firms in glass buildings and the makeshift offices of individuals like Amelia struggling to make ends meet.
