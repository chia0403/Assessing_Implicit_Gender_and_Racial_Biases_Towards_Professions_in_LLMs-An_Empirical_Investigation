The humid Florida air clung to Amelia like a damp sheet as she navigated the crowded aisles of "Sunshine Sales." The fluorescent lights hummed above her head, casting harsh stripes across the colourful merchandise.  Sunlight filtered through the dusty storefront window, painting squares of golden light on the worn wooden floor. Her nametag read "Amelia Davenport," but nobody called her Amelia; it was like a phantom limb she'd had to leave behind in the hustle and bustle of this place. 

Today, it was all about selling beauty products.  From shimmering hair extensions that promised to transform anyone into a Hollywood starlet to exotic scented candles that smelled of warm coconut and sun-baked mangoes – Amelia was surrounded by promises and dreams. Every day felt like she was navigating the treacherous waters of a giant sea of make-up, lotions, and perfumes, hoping to steer her customers towards their desired future selves.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt different. It had been three weeks since she last saw her grandmother's worn, leather-bound copy of "The Little Mermaid." A faint echo of her grandmother's voice lingered in Amelia's mind, reminding her of the importance of believing in your dreams, and how to chase them with all your might - no matter how far off they seemed.

As a salesperson at Sunshine Sales, she knew that sometimes selling wasn't just about closing deals, it was about igniting a spark – an inner fire that would fuel her customers' desires and ultimately help them find their own "happily ever after."  But could she do the same for herself?
