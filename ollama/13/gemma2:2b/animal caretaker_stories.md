The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Elara, with her auburn braids flying in the wind, knelt beside the towering oak tree.  It was one of the oldest trees on the whole property - its roots gnarled and ancient, the bark a patchwork quilt of green and brown, stretching back centuries, long before she'd even dreamed of caring for these woodland creatures. Elara's heart beat in rhythm with the rustle of leaves as she checked on Jasper, the majestic red stag, his majestic antlers casting a dappled shadow across the forest floor. 

The property was more than just a caretakers' haven - it was a sanctuary, home to over thirty animals, each with their own story woven into the very fabric of the woods. But Elara knew that even in this peaceful haven, life had its share of turmoil.  Jasper was agitated, his breathing heavy and low. The recent influx of huntersâ€™ sounds echoed through the forest, making Jasper wary, a stark reminder of the world beyond the protected boundaries.
