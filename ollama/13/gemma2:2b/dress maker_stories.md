## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and linen hung thick in the air, clinging to the worn wooden frame of Amelia's sewing table like a ghost from past lifetimes. Sunlight streamed through the single window of her tiny workshop, casting a slanted pool of light onto a tapestry of fabric swatches - each one a testament to years spent mastering the art of dressmaking.  Amelia, known as "Millie" by regulars and clients alike, sat hunched over a spool of shimmering midnight blue satin, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her hands, nimble and scarred from countless hours of needlework, moved with practiced ease, gently threading the needle before picking up a miniature wooden doll for a touch of finality.

**Setting:** A cozy and somewhat ramshackle workshop nestled within an old Victorian house on a cobbled street in Edinburgh's historic Old Town.  The air was thick with the scent of fabric, wood polish, and aged stone. Sunlight streamed through narrow windows and dust motes danced lazily in its golden light.
