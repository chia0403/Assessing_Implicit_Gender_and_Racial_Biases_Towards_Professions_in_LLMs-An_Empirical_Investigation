Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Ethan Thorne’s office at Blackwood Securities, blurring the iconic skyline into an impressionist watercolor. He stared out, his jaw clenched tightly. The city, usually shimmering with controlled chaos and neon dreams, felt like a caged beast, trapped in a storm it couldn't overcome.

He was fighting against something bigger than money: the suffocating weight of failure and the gnawing uncertainty about what lay ahead, as if he were trapped in a tempestuous sea of his own making. His life, once a meticulously crafted symphony, was now a discordant score, one with every note echoing the fear that gnawed at its core.
