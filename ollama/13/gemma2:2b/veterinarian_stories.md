The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the Oregon sky with hues of bruised plum and fiery orange as Dr. Evelyn Thorne walked into the small animal clinic.  Dust motes danced in the last rays of light filtering through the cracked windowpane, illuminating rows of dusty cages and piles of discarded medical supplies. The air hung heavy with the familiar scent of disinfectant and pet food left uneaten after a particularly stressful night on call at the local veterinary hospital.

She was used to dealing with injured animals â€“ cats tangled in fishing line, dogs poisoned by garden chemicals - but tonight felt different. Tonight, there was an air of foreboding that lingered even as she pulled on her familiar green scrub top and white coat. It started with a frantic phone call from Mrs. Henderson's house, followed by the arrival of a nervous young boy clutching a trembling terrier in his arms.
