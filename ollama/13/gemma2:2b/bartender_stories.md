Rain hammered against the windows of The Salty Siren, each drop a tiny explosion of sound that echoed across the crowded bar.  Inside, amidst the comforting scent of stale beer and woodsmoke, sat Zephyr Thorne.  His fingers danced across a worn wooden counter, polishing a glass with practiced ease. 

Zephyr, known as "Zeke" by everyone who crossed his path, was a quiet observer of life's little dramas. The Salty Siren wasn't just any bar; it was the heart of Havenwood, where sailors swapped tales under flickering gaslights, and families huddled over steaming mugs after years of hard work on their boats.  Zeke knew every corner, every creaky floorboard, and every secret whispered in a hushed tone â€“ from long-lost love letters to whispered deals made in smoky corners. 

Tonight was particularly stormy, but not just because of the weather outside. The air crackled with tension as two men stood facing each other at the bar, their bodies tense, fingers gripping worn leather pouches. One man, tall and broad-shouldered, wore a frayed coat that spoke of countless adventures, while the other was smaller, with nervous eyes that darted around the room before finally meeting Zeke's gaze.  Zeke knew he had to do something before things went from bad to worse.
