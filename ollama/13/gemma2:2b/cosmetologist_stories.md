## The Scent of Roses

**Setting:** A quaint, seaside town nestled between rolling hills and a vast, turquoise bay. The air is filled with the salty tang of brine and the sweet, fragrant smell of wildflowers. 

**Main Character:** Esmeralda "Essie" Blackwood, owner of "The Velvet Bloom," a small but charming salon perched on the edge of the harbor, where seagulls call and weathered wooden boats bob gently in the waves.


Essie ran her fingers through the soft strands of hair in front of her, a strand straying over her forehead like a rebellious sunbeam. The familiar weight of expectations pressed down on her: every client's dream cut, every subtle shade of color that would make them feel radiant; all under her skillful touch.  But today, something felt different. An unusual tension thrummed in the air as if the sea itself was restless. 

A sudden gust of wind whipped through the open salon windows, bringing with it a strange scent: not the usual floral notes of lilac and jasmine, but a sharp, metallic aroma that set her heart racing. It was as if something unseen stirred within the tide's ebb and flow, an undercurrent she felt pulling at the edges of her consciousness. 


Could this be what they call "bad vibes" or was there something more sinister brewing beneath the placid surface of their idyllic town?
