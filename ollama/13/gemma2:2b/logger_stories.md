The mist hung low over Blackwood Creek like a shroud, clinging to the damp trees with a malevolent tenacity. The air itself seemed thick with unspoken dread, pressing down on Silas Thorne's shoulders even through his worn denim jacket.  He stood at the edge of the old-growth forest, the silence a cruel mockery of the symphony he'd grown accustomed to from years spent navigating its depths. 

Silas Thorne wasn't your typical logger. He wasn't just another face in a mask of sawdust and timber dust. No, his calloused hands were stained with more than just wood sap; they had the stories of centuries etched into them – tales whispered by the wind through the towering pines. His grandfather, Elias Thorne, a man whose eyes held the wisdom of the forest itself, would often say that Silas wasn't just cutting trees, he was carving memories into their very souls.  

Today, however, even the weight of that legacy couldn’t silence the growing dread that pulsed within him. The tremor in his hand as he gripped his axe mirrored the unsettling premonition twisting in his gut. Something felt different this time, a discordant note played on the strings of his life's soundtrack.
