Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Bell's office, blurring the world outside into streaks of grey and green. Inside, however, the air was thick with the aroma of lavender and chamomile – the calming scents Eleanor had strategically placed around her therapy space. It served as a comforting contrast to the storm raging beyond, mirroring the turbulence brewing within her own heart. 

The waiting room door creaked open, and in walked her first client that day –  a young woman named Chloe. Her dark hair was pulled back tight, and her usually bright eyes held an unsettling amount of fear. Eleanor knew it wouldn't be easy to help Chloe untangle the knots of grief she carried after losing her brother. But she had to start somewhere. With a quiet smile, Dr. Bell ushered Chloe into her small, warmly lit room, hoping to create a haven within this storm-tossed world.
