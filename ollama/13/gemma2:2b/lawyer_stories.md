The humid New Orleans air hung thick like a shroud as Amelia "Amy" Dubois pushed open the heavy oak doors of her law office. The aroma of jasmine, emanating from the blooming bougainvillea outside, was a stark contrast to the sharp tang of old paperwork and fresh coffee swirling in the air inside.  She ran a calloused hand through her messy dark curls before taking a seat at her desk, the worn mahogany creaking softly under the weight of years. 

A bustling city like New Orleans never sleeps, but tonight, it felt especially hushed. The usual symphony of jazz spilling from nearby bars was replaced by an eerie quiet, as if even the city itself had taken a temporary pause before sunrise. 

Amy's gaze drifted towards the overflowing trash bin in the corner, where a yellowed newspaper lay face down with the headline 'Voodoo Murders on the Rise'. A shiver ran down her spine, not from the cold, but from something deeper - an unsettling premonition of impending doom.  Tonight was a night for justice, and tonight, she would find it.
