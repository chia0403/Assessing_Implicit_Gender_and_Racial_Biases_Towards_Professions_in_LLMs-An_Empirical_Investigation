Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Crooked Crow," leaving streaks of grey light on Detective Alistair Thorne's desk.  His eyes, sharp as chipped flint, focused on a photograph in his hand - a young woman with fire-red hair and a wide, toothy smile, framed by two menacing red roses. Her name was Seraphina Bellweather. The case wasn't anything remotely glamorous – just another missing person. But there was something about the photo that gnawed at Alistair’s gut, a feeling he couldn't shake off, like a rat scurrying in his boots. 

The setting was an old, bustling part of New Orleans - the French Quarter, where cobblestone streets were slick with rain and shrouded in a perpetual haze of smoke from jazz clubs. The air hummed with street musicians and the scent of beignets mingled with stale cigarettes and desperation. This was Alistair's stomping ground, his domain where mysteries walked amongst the ghosts of Bourbon Street and secrets whispered on the wind. 


Alistair Thorne, known by locals as "The Raven" – for his sharp intelligence and unsettling demeanor that always seemed to bring a shadow across a room – took a deep breath and smoothed down his worn fedora. He knew this case wouldn’t be easy, not for him, not for anyone in this city of shadows.  He was a private detective with secrets as murky as the Mississippi River that snaked through its heart.
