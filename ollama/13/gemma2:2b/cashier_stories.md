##  Aisle 8: The Quiet Before the Storm

**Setting:** A bustling Saturday afternoon in "Sunnyside" Grocery Store. Lines snake around the produce section, families are navigating the aisles with overflowing carts, and kids scream over a forgotten snack pack. It’s all part of the familiar chaos that makes up this quaint neighborhood grocery store – except today, something feels different. 

**Character:** Esme Reyes, at 19 years old, was already a veteran cashier. Her smile was weary from decades worth of greeting strangers and their endless requests for help finding ketchup, her long brown hair pulled back in a practical bun.  Esme's life revolved around the rhythm of the grocery store:  the clattering of cash registers, the rustling of bags, the steady hum of conversations about weekly menus and leftover spaghetti sauce. 

But something was unsettling this afternoon. The air felt thick with an unspoken tension, amplified by the growing silence in the store’s usual symphony of sounds. All eyes turned towards a new arrival:  a figure shrouded in a black coat and a wide-brimmed hat, who strolled through the entrance, almost as if they owned the place.  A wave of whispered questions passed through the crowd, followed by a collective hush as their gaze fell on Esme, who stood frozen behind the cash register.
