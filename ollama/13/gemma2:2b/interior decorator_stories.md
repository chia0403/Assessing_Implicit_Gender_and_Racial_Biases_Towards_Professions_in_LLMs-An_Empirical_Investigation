## Story Opening

**Setting:** A sun-drenched, bohemian-style apartment in New Orleans, Louisiana. The year is 1930, jazz music drifts from an old gramophone tucked into a corner, and vibrant tapestries hang on the walls, juxtaposed with antique brass lamps and hand-woven rugs. The scent of jasmine blossoms fills the air.

**Character:** The name is Amelia "Amy" Beaumont, but she's known by all as "Muse." She is an interior decorator whose touch transforms ordinary spaces into works of art. A whirlwind of a woman, her eyes sparkle with excitement as she takes in the details of every room. Her nimble fingers, constantly sketching or holding a paintbrush, leave no detail untouched. 

**Opening:**  "This place has so much potential, darling," Amy mused, tracing her finger along the ornate molding in the living room. She was standing before an unassuming brick facade, the remnants of a grand Victorian era home hiding beneath layers of peeling paint and dusty furniture. The previous owner had been a silent recluse for decades, leaving the place untouched by time except for the faint echoes of forgotten laughter. 

"But it needs life," she declared, her voice full of conviction as if the room itself were listening. "It needs... me." 


Amy was about to start her work on the next project when a gust of wind blew through the open window, swirling around her and carrying with it the faint scent of jasmine blossoms. A note attached to the door said, “The muse is waiting.”
