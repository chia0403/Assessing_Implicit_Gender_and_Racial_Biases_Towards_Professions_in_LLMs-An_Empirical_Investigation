The air in the server room hummed with an unseen life force – a constant thrumming pulse against Amelia Thorne’s temples as she moved between rows of humming computer components. Sunlight, filtered through grimy skylights, cast long shadows on her worn leather jacket and the tangle of wires around her fingertips. The smell of burnt plastic and ozone mingled with the faint scent of coffee brewing in a chipped ceramic mug held precariously in one hand. 

Amelia, known affectionately as "The Oracle" by her colleagues (and sometimes, with slight annoyance, “A-thorne” by her boss), had grown accustomed to this symphony of technology. It was a world she'd immersed herself in since childhood, building her first rudimentary website before even leaving high school.  Her days were spent navigating the intricate web of data flows and algorithms, trying to make sense of the chaos that pulsed through the veins of the modern world. 

Tonight, though, Amelia felt an odd dissonance. A glitch had begun to ripple through the company's core system, a silent tremor shaking the seemingly unshakeable foundation of their business operations. The server room lights flickered erratically, casting long dancing shadows on her face as she ran diagnostics, a familiar feeling of dread creeping up her spine like the smell of burnt plastic.  Something was wrong. And it had a mind of its own.
