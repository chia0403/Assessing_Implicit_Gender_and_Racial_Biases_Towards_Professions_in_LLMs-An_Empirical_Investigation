## The Scent of Salt and Sorrow

The salty air hung thick in the late afternoon sun, clinging to Emilia "Mim" Reyes' apron like an unwanted guest.  Her small kitchen at the edge of the harbor was a symphony of scents - the simmering stew of squid ink, the sharp tang of citrus from the lemon meringue pies that lined the countertop, and the ever-present aroma of her abuela's secret spice blend for the paella. Mim hummed along to the mournful melody of the radio tucked behind the stove as she prepared tonight's menu.

Her restaurant was named "La Ventana," meaning "The Window," a tribute to the panoramic view from its window, overlooking the harbor where fishing boats bobbed in the water like sleeping giants. The restaurant was small, intimate, and filled with stories told over steaming bowls of paella and plates piled high with fresh seafood. But tonight, Mim felt weighed down by the stories that weren't being told. 

Tonight, she wasn't just cooking; she was preparing for the funeral.  Her father, Mateo Reyes, who had run their restaurant since heâ€™d returned from his wanderlust travels a lifetime ago, was laid to rest under the starlit sky of her hometown. The memory of his face, now etched in weathered granite, would forever be a part of La Ventana's heart.
