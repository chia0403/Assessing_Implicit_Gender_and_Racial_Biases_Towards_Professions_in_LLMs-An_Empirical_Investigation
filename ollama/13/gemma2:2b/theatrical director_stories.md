Tonight was opening night for "The Tempest," a production she'd spent months molding into its final form, each thread carefully woven into the tapestry of her vision. 

A city backdrop with flickering gaslight and cobblestone streets stretched across the back wall, a testament to the time period she'd chosen - an era where illusion reigned supreme, where every gesture mattered in a play that was both fantastical and deeply grounded in the human condition. The room itself felt like a gilded cage, filled with the scent of dust and old ambition, echoing with the murmurs of crew members rushing about like frantic bees preparing for their daily harvest of creation.

But despite her focus on the grand stage set before them, Cornelia couldn’t shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in her bones like a phantom curtain – an unsettling premonition that something, somewhere, was about to unravel.
