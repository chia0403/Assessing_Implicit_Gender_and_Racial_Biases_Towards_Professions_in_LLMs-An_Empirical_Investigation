Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Hayes' office, each drop like a tiny exclamation mark on the glass.  The storm was a fitting metaphor for the state of her mind. In just an hour, she would be facing a patient whose life had been shattered by loss - a loss that could only be described as profound, as if a piece of the universe itself had been taken. Eleanor stared at the swirling patterns on the office's antique rug, its faded blue and gold threads seeming to mock her own internal chaos. 

Eleanor Hayes, with her quiet demeanor and sharp wit, was known for unraveling the most knotted human anxieties.  She navigated the world of therapy with a patient grace that belied the deep-seated storms brewing within her own soul. Tonight, however, even Eleanor's usual reserves seemed to be dwindling. The weight of another shattered life, another story of unyielding grief, hung heavy in the air like the storm outside. 


**Setting:** A quaint and somewhat old-fashioned office nestled in a quiet corner of New England, with wood paneling and antique furniture, overlooking the sprawling green landscape of a town known for its history and secrets.
