The worn linoleum floor felt familiar beneath Daniel's worn-down cleaning shoes. He navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Old City Library with practiced ease, his eyes scanning for any stray crumb or dusty book spine that defied the daily onslaught of patrons and time. The air hung thick with a strange blend of wood polish and forgotten dreams - the scent was as integral to the library's soul as its towering stacks of aged tomes.  

Daniel wasn't your typical library worker. He wasn't an enthusiastic librarian, nor a scholar who sought enlightenment amongst the silent pages. He was simply Daniel. A man forged from the everyday grind of routine and tired laughter, his life mirroring the rhythm of the clockwork that ticked away within the library's heart. At 57, he had seen it all - forgotten love letters tucked away in yellowed envelopes, teenage angst reflected in shattered window panes, and whispered secrets shared in hushed tones between patrons on quiet evenings.  

He hummed quietly to himself as he pushed his heavy cart, a melody of the mundane punctuated by the occasional creak of aging floorboards. His days were filled with tasks, from sweeping dusty stacks to polishing mahogany tables, but tonight felt different. Tonight was the night of the annual book auction, and the air crackled with an unspoken tension that Daniel could almost taste in the stale air.
