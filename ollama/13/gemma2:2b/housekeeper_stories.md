The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the sliver of sunlight filtering through the stained-glass windows. Agnes Butterfield, affectionately nicknamed "Agatha" by the family she tended to for nearly thirty years, inhaled deeply. The scent, a potent blend of old leather, lavender soap, and something distinctly like mothballs, always clung to the house like a phantom, each room whispering its own stories through creaking floorboards and faded tapestry.  The year was 1927, a time when flappers danced to crackling gramophones and whispers of prohibition swirled in smoky speakeasies, but Agatha's world felt timeless. Her small corner in the grand old house, tucked away like a forgotten melody, held her steady.

Outside, London hummed with activity - the rhythmic rumble of buses, the cacophony of horse-drawn carriages, and the insistent calls of newsboys hawking their wares. Yet, within the four walls of this stately abode, time seemed to move differently, governed by Agatha's quiet rhythm.  She was a guardian angel in tweed skirts and worn pumps, tending to every need with an efficiency born from years of experience and an unwavering love for her charges. The family - the Earl of Ashworth and his three daughters - were as different as the constellations, their personalities as diverse as the rooms themselves. But Agatha understood them all, each one a melody waiting to be played.
