## The Ballad of Barrett "Brick" Blackwood

**Setting:**  The rust-red sun dipped beneath the endless Arizona sky, painting the horizon in hues of orange and purple as twilight crept across the desert town of Dustbowl Junction. Wind whipped through the skeletal limbs of creosote bushes, carrying a scent of dry earth and distant rain. 

**Character:** Barrett "Brick" Blackwood, his name practically synonymous with the worn, calloused hands that swung hammers like they were extensions of himself, stood atop a two-story house that leaned precariously as if burdened by secrets whispered from its cracked plaster walls. 

He was tired.  The endless cycle of nails hammering against wood, shingles flying across the sky in a dizzying dance, and the ever-present scent of sawdust and sweat had dulled his senses over the years. Brick had been building roofs since he was just old enough to stand on his own two feet, earning the nickname "Brick" for the unyielding, sturdy nature that defined him – just like the brick-like houses he built. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A shiver of anticipation ran down his spine as he heard a sound from inside the house – a faint, rhythmic tapping against plaster. It was late and everything should be quiet in Dustbowl Junction, but this tapping wasn't the usual creaking of old wood settling after years of weathering. This felt... urgent.
