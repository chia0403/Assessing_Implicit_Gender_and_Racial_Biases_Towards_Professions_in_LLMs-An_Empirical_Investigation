## Opening: 

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon buns battled for dominance in Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's tiny office, as usual. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window, casting rainbows across her desk where a map of the world – meticulously detailed with pins marking each trip she had booked – was pinned to the wall.  Outside, a lone pigeon squawked on the wrought iron railing outside, oblivious to the symphony of travel dreams unfolding within.

Amy's office wasn’t much to look at; an eclectic mix of maps, vintage suitcases, and battered old globe sat amongst piles of brochures and crumpled travel diaries. It was her haven – a place where she could disappear into the stories of those who booked their next adventure with her. This Tuesday, though, something felt different. 

A woman in a worn tweed jacket, looking as lost as a misplaced compass, stood hesitantly at Amy's desk. Her eyes, heavy with weariness, stared out of focus.  “I need…,” she began, her voice barely a whisper, “a way to escape.”
