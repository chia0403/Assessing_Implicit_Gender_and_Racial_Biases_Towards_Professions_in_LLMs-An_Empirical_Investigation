The humid August air hung thick and heavy in Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom at Northwood High. Sunlight streamed through the cracked windowpane above her desk, illuminating dust motes dancing in the fading light. Outside, the cicadas buzzed their symphony of summer discontent, a soundtrack to the quiet chaos of empty desks that echoed with the ghost of last year's students and the lingering scent of stale chalk.  Eleanor, a woman whose sharp wit matched her equally razor-sharp eyes, tapped a pencil against her worn-out textbook as she awaited her first student of the day. It was 8:03 AM, the official start time for the long summer break that was supposed to be filled with sunshine and carefree days at the beach.  Instead, it felt like another year had begun, and Eleanor just wasn't quite ready for this endless cycle.
