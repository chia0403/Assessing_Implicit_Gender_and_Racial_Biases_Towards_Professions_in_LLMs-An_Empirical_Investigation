The air crackled with static, a familiar symphony to Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's ears. Her workshop, nestled in the shadow of a rust-red barn overlooking the sprawling wheat fields of Kansas, vibrated with the hum of her latest project: a hulking, cobbled-together radio receiver, its wires resembling a tangled nest of metallic serpents. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the workbench piled high with spare parts, capacitors, and half-disassembled radios. 

Ellie traced a calloused finger along the antenna's copper coil, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic chirping of crickets blended with the distant drone of a tractor engine, creating a soundtrack to her solitary work.  Her radio, affectionately nicknamed "The Whispering Giant," was supposed to be different. It wasn't just about picking up broadcasts from distant cities anymore; it was about reaching out beyond the confines of their small town, into the vast unknown of the electromagnetic spectrum. She believed there were whispers on those frequencies, hidden messages waiting to be deciphered.  

A sudden burst of static interrupted her thoughts, followed by a faint, distorted voice that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. Ellie's heart skipped a beat. This wasn't the usual interference; this was something else entirely.
