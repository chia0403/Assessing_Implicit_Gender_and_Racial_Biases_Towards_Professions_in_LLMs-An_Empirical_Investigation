The sun beat down on Silas Montgomery's neck like a hammer against steel. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him. Mile marker 178. Another identical stretch of grey waiting to be tamed by his crew and their yellow army of machinery. This was Silas’ world – the rumble of asphalt rollers, the metallic clang of shovels, the earthy scent of freshly laid gravel.

He stood on a makeshift platform overlooking the construction zone, clipboard in one hand, a thermos sweating condensation in the other. A hawk circled lazily overhead, its keen eyes scanning the dust motes dancing in the sunlight.  The Texas sky was vast and unforgiving, a brilliant blue canvas stretched taut over the flat plains that stretched out to meet the horizon. It was the kind of heat that turned asphalt into liquid fire and made even breathing feel like an effort. But Silas didn’t mind. This was home.


This was where he knew his place, amongst the men who built and maintained the arteries of the nation, one mile marker at a time.
