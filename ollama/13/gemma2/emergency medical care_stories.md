The wail of the siren sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of Charleston, South Carolina. Amelia "Amy" Grace Harper, her dark hair pulled back tight under her EMT helmet, gripped the steering wheel as she navigated the slick, rain-streaked streets. The flashing blue lights reflected in her eyes, mirroring the urgency pulsing through her veins. 

Tonight's call: a possible cardiac arrest at an abandoned warehouse on the edge of the city, a place shrouded in rumors and whispered tales of illegal activity.  Amy took a deep breath, pushing down the unease that always accompanied these "unknown" situations. Her training kicked in, focusing her mind on the task ahead â€“ reaching their patient, assessing the situation, and doing whatever she could to save a life.

The warehouse loomed ahead, a hulking silhouette against the backdrop of an overcast sky.  Rain lashed down, blurring the edges of the crumbling brick facade and casting long, distorted shadows across the overgrown yard. Amy knew that sometimes, the most dangerous calls weren't found in bustling city streets, but in these forgotten corners where darkness held sway. She tightened her grip on the steering wheel, steeling herself for whatever awaited them within those walls.
