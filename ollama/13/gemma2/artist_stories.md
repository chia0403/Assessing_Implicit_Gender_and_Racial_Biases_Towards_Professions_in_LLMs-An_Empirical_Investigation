The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch. Her small studio, perched precariously on the top floor of a crumbling Victorian building overlooking the tempestuous North Sea, felt more like a sanctuary than a workspace.

Ellie stood before her latest masterpiece, a sprawling abstract piece titled "The Kraken's Embrace," its swirling blues and greens mirroring the churning sea below.
