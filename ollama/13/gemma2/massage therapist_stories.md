The air hung heavy with the scent of eucalyptus and lavender as Elara Nightingale adjusted the heated bamboo mat beneath her patient. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window in her therapy room, casting rainbows across the worn wood floor. Outside, the bustling city of Seattle roared with its usual morning cacophony, a world away from this haven of calm nestled within a converted Victorian house on Capitol Hill. Elara took a deep breath, grounding herself in the quiet hum of the diffuser and the soft rasp of Mrs. Peterson's breathing as she settled onto the table.  Today was just another Tuesday for Elara - another day of kneading anxieties away, releasing muscle tension, and listening to the silent stories her clients carried within their weary bodies. But little did she know, today's session would be anything but ordinary.
