The sun beat down on Amelia Celeste Hawthorne’s shoulders, turning the already oppressive August humidity into a thick, suffocating blanket. Sweat prickled at her hairline despite the light cotton dress she'd chosen for the day, an attempt to appear approachable and not like someone perpetually trapped in a sauna. 

She stood before the decaying Victorian mansion on Mulberry Street, its once-grand facade now marred by peeling paint and overgrown ivy that seemed to claw at the cracked windows. This wasn’t her usual clientele; Amelia was known for sleek condos and sprawling modern homes in affluent neighborhoods. But this…this was a fixer-upper, an architectural relic begging for a buyer with both vision and deep pockets. 

A sigh escaped her lips as she adjusted her designer sunglasses. Maybe this "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" wasn't such a great idea after all.
