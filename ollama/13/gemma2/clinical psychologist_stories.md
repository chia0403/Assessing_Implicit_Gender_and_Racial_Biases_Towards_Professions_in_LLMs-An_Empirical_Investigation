He was scheduled for his first appointment, seeking help for what he described as "night terrors." A vague term, yet it held a certain weight in Amelia's experience. She knew that often, behind seemingly innocuous diagnoses lurked deeper anxieties and traumas waiting to be unearthed.  

She smoothed down the wrinkles on her skirt, took a deep breath, and knocked lightly on the closed door. "Ethan? It's Dr. Brighton."
