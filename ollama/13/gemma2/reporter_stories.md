The humid Mississippi air clung to Clara Belle Beaumont like a damp shroud as she stepped out of her beat-up Ford pickup. The smell of stagnant water and honeysuckle hung heavy, a sickly sweet counterpoint to the roar of cicadas that filled the muggy twilight. 

Clara Belle adjusted the brim of her straw hat, shielding her face from the fading sun that cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted main street of Cypress Creek, Mississippi. The town, once bustling with the industry of its cotton mills and lumber yards, now wore a cloak of faded grandeur. Buildings stood hunched and empty, their paint peeling like sunburned skin. Even the lone gas station at the intersection wore an air of weary resignation, its pumps silent and rusted. 

Clara Belle, her name as Southern as the magnolia blooms that choked her grandmother's porch swing back in Vicksburg, was here for a story. A story about whispers, shadows, and secrets that ran deeper than the roots of the ancient oaks lining Cypress Creek Road. A story she had a hunch wouldn't be easy to tell.
