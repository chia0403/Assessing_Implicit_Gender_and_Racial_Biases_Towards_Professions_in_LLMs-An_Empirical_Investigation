The morning mist clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's tweed jacket like a damp shroud as he surveyed his domain.  Sunlight had yet to fully pierce the veil of fog that shrouded Oakhaven Manor, its gnarled branches dripping with condensation. The dew-kissed grass, emerald green even in this pre-dawn gloom, was slick underfoot. Bart adjusted his worn leather gloves and inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and blooming rhododendrons filling his lungs. 

He loved these quiet mornings at Oakhaven. The silence was broken only by the chirping of sparrows and the distant bleating of sheep from the fields beyond the manicured lawns. This sprawling estate, with its rambling gardens, ancient oaks whispering secrets in the wind, and hidden pathways leading to forgotten nooks, had been his sanctuary for twenty years. 

But today, Bart felt a prickle of unease. The air was thick with an unsettling stillness, as if something were amiss beneath the surface of this tranquil scene.  He couldn't quite place it, but a sense of foreboding lingered, casting a shadow over even the most beautiful morning at Oakhaven Manor.
