The morning mist hung heavy over Maple Creek Animal Clinic, clinging to Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's crisp white coat like a damp shawl. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and wet earth, a familiar fragrance that usually calmed her. Today, however, it did little to soothe the knot of anxiety in her stomach. 

Amelia surveyed the bustling waiting room: anxious pet parents whispering nervously, nervous dogs straining at their leashes, and a calico cat perched on a stool, eyeing the world with disdainful indifference. The clinic was always lively, a cacophony of barks, meows, chirps, and muffled sobs. But today, the air felt charged, electric.

She had received an unsettling call earlier that morning. A frantic voice, choked with tears, had described a strange illness sweeping through the town's animal population. It started with lethargy and loss of appetite, quickly progressing to seizures and unresponsiveness. There was no known cause, and the local human hospital's resources were stretched thin.  

The weight of responsibility settled heavy on Amelia's shoulders. Maple Creek was her home, and its furry residents were her family. She wouldn't let them down.
