The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Finch's meticulously organized dental practice. Each surface gleamed, reflecting the anxious faces that peered back at her from across the room. Outside, the humid August air clung to New Orleans like a second skin, but inside, a cool, antiseptic breeze circulated, attempting to dispel the faint scent of peppermint and fear. Eleanor adjusted her thin-rimmed spectacles, her gaze settling on the young woman slumped in the chair before her. Her name was Sarah, and she trembled with every tick of the clock, her knuckles white as they gripped the armrests. 

"Deep breaths, Sarah," Eleanor murmured soothingly, her voice a calm counterpoint to the whirring drill in the corner. "It's alright. I'm here."  

But even as she spoke, Eleanor felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her own chest. The pressure was always there, this relentless need to alleviate not just dental pain, but also the fear that gnawed at her patients. Fear that mirrored her own, though she masked it with practiced ease. Today, more than ever, she wished she could offer them more than just a gentle touch and a reassuring smile.
