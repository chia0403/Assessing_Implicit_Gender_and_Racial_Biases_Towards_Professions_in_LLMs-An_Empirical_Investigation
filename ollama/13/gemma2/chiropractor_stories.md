The rain hammered against the windows of "Straighten Up Chiropractic," blurring the neon sign advertising Dr. Amelia Juniper's services into an impressionistic swirl of red and green. Inside, the air smelled faintly of lavender oil and stale coffee – the comforting aroma of a Tuesday morning in small-town Vermont. Dr. Juniper, her dark hair pulled back in a neat braid and her white coat impeccably pressed, adjusted the volume on the radio. The soft murmur of folk music did little to drown out the insistent drumming of the rain against the glass, but it added a layer of coziness to the quiet office. 

Amelia sighed, glancing at the clock – 8:50 am. Another lonely morning in her practice, seemingly deserted despite the downpour that had trapped most folks indoors. Just then, the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a new patient. Amelia straightened, a flicker of anticipation dancing in her hazel eyes. Perhaps this day wouldn't be so quiet after all.
