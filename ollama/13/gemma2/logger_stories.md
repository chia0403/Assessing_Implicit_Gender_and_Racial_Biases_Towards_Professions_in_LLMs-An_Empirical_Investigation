The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Mist clung to the towering Douglas firs, obscuring the sun in an ethereal haze. Dew glistened on Silas Everett Blackwoodâ€™s calloused hands as he surveyed the forest floor, his boots crunching softly on the fallen leaves.  

Silas was a logger born and bred, his lineage etched into the very bark of these ancient trees. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather before him had worked these lands, their axes carving out a living from the whispering giants. Silas, with his sun-weathered face and unruly brown hair, bore the weight of that legacy on his shoulders. Today, like every day, he walked these hallowed woods not just as a laborer, but as a steward, a guardian of this wild symphony of life and death. He knew every curve of the path, every rustle in the undergrowth, every groan of the trees.  But today, something felt different. A disquietude pulsed beneath the surface, a tremor in the ancient rhythm of the forest that sent shivers down Silas's spine.


He gripped his trusty axe tighter, its steel head reflecting the faint sunlight filtering through the canopy. This was more than just another day on the job. This was a call to something deeper, something primal, something that whispered of danger and secrets hidden beneath the verdant facade.
