The morning mist clung to the thatched roofs of the Animal Sanctuary like cobwebs, obscuring the vibrant colours of the peacocks strutting in their enclosure.  Inside the small wooden cottage bordering the sanctuary, Amelia Willowbrook yawned, stretching her arms above her head. Sunlight peeked through the gaps in the floral curtains, casting dancing patches on the worn wooden floor. 

Amelia, with her unruly auburn curls perpetually escaping her braid and her patched overalls dusted with hay, was more at home amongst the chirps and whinnies than she ever was amidst the clatter of human cities. She'd dedicated her life to this sanctuary, a haven for rescued and abandoned animals, each one carrying its own story etched onto their weary souls. Today, like every day, Amelia would be tending to their needs, mending broken wings, offering gentle words to those who yearned for companionship, and making sure every creature found solace within the sanctuary's walls.  

But today felt different. A shiver ran down her spine, a prickling sensation that whispered of change, hinting at a storm brewing beyond the peaceful hum of animal life. Amelia dismissed it as nerves, knowing the sanctuary needed her focus. She pulled on her boots and grabbed her well-worn bucket, stepping out into the mist, ready to face whatever the day brought.
