The scent of aged paper and leather was as comforting to Amelia Beatrice Finch as her own grandmother's perfume. She inhaled deeply, savoring the musty aroma that permeated every corner of the Elmwood Public Library. Sunlight slanted through dusty stained-glass windows, painting rainbows on the worn wooden floorboards. The late afternoon hush settled around Amelia like a familiar blanket, broken only by the soft rustling of pages turning and the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard as she catalogued a new donation - a first edition Dickens novel in surprisingly good condition. 

Elmwood was a sleepy town, content with its quiet routine. Life revolved around the library's weekly book club meetings, the annual pie contest held during the summer solstice, and the gossip that flowed freely over cups of tea at Mrs. Peabody's bakery. Amelia loved it here, surrounded by stories waiting to be discovered, and people who cherished them just as much as she did.


But today, a ripple of unease disturbed the familiar rhythm. A new book had arrived, tucked discreetly amongst the donations. Its worn cover bore no title, only a cryptic symbol that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine.
