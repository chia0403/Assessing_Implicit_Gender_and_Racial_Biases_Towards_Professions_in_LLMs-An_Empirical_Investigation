The air hung thick with the scent of granite dust and sweat in Elias Thorne's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylights, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the workbench cluttered with chisels, hammers, and half-finished sculptures. Elias, his forearms corded with muscle from years of wielding heavy tools, surveyed his latest project: a bust of a noblewoman commissioned by Lord Blackwood himself. 

The woman's sculpted features were already taking shape â€“ the high cheekbones, the delicate curve of her jawline, the piercing intelligence in her eyes.  Elias was meticulous, each tap of his chisel measured and deliberate. He wasn't merely carving stone; he was breathing life into it, capturing a fleeting moment in time, preserving beauty for eternity. 

But today, something felt different. A gnawing unease settled in Elias's gut, as if the very stones around him were whispering secrets he couldn't quite decipher. He brushed it off as fatigue. The workshop, usually his sanctuary, suddenly felt oppressive, the silence broken only by the rhythmic clang of his hammer against stone. 


Elias Thorne lived and breathed this trade, his life intertwined with the ancient craft of stone carving. His world was a tapestry woven from granite, marble, and limestone, each piece whispering tales of history and artistry.
