The humid August air hung heavy over Charleston, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. Sweat slicked Ezekiel "Zeke" Hawthorne's brow as he navigated the precarious metal ladder leading to the peak of Mrs. Davenport's Victorian mansion. The shingles beneath his boots groaned like an old man complaining about his aches, a familiar sound Zeke had grown accustomed to over his fifteen years as a roofer.  Below him, the cobblestone streets glistened with the heat haze, cars crawling along like beetles in their own time-warp world. But up here, perched amongst the eaves and chimney pots, Zeke felt a sense of calm. The city was a distant murmur, replaced by the rhythmic chirping of cicadas and the occasional screech of a hawk circling overhead. He took a deep breath, savoring the freedom that came with being high above it all, before setting his toolbox down and getting to work. 


Zeke knew every inch of Charleston's rooftops. He could navigate them blindfolded, identify the different types of shingles just by their texture, and predict the next storm's fury by the way the wind whistled through the gaps in the chimneys.  But this roof was different. Mrs. Davenport had lived in the house for over fifty years, a woman with a sharp wit and an even sharper eye for detail. Sheâ€™d asked Zeke to replace just one shingle, a seemingly insignificant repair. Yet, there was something about the way she'd looked at him, her blue eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief, that made Zeke feel like this was more than just another job.  There was a story hidden beneath these shingles, waiting for him to uncover it.
