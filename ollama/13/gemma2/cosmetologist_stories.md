Outside, the humid July air clung to Charleston like a damp blanket, but inside Amelia's salon, "Sinclair's Styles," it was always an oasis of cool air and gentle chatter. 

Amelia loved the hush that fell over the shop as she worked her magic, transforming faces with color, cut, and style.  The whirring of the dryer and the rhythmic snip of scissors were a symphony to her ears, each strand of hair a brushstroke in her artistic canvas. But today, something felt different. A knot of tension tightened in Amelia's chest, a premonition that this day wouldn't be like any other.

She was clearly out of place in Amelia's tranquil haven, her desperation jarring against the soothing ambiance.
