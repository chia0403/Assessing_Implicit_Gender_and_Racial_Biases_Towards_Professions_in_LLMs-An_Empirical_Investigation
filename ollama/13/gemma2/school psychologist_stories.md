The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Dr. Amelia Harper’s cluttered office. Paperwork piled high on her desk like miniature mountains, each sheet whispering tales of anxiety, fear, and fractured minds. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the schoolyard, where children shrieked with laughter and chased after each other in a chaotic ballet.
