The faint scent of jasmine lingered in the air, a cruel reminder that spring was on its way while Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick toiled beneath a ceiling draped in dust motes. She scrubbed at a cobweb-laden chandelier in the grand dining room of Blackwood Manor, her movements precise and economical, years of experience guiding her hand.

Blackwood Manor itself was a behemoth, a sprawling Victorian mansion that seemed to sigh with every gust of wind through its crumbling eaves. Built in 1887 by a shipping magnate who'd made his fortune in the spice trade, it had fallen into disrepair after generations of eccentric owners and financial woes. Its grandeur was now more melancholy than magnificent: faded velvet curtains, peeling wallpaper, and cold marble floors that echoed with every step Amelia took.


It wasn't exactly glamorous work, but Amelia found a strange solace in its routine. The endless tasks, the familiar creaks and groans of the house, even the faint scent of jasmine - it all served as a comforting anchor in a world that felt increasingly chaotic.
