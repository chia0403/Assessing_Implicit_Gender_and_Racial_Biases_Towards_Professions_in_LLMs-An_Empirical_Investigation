The humid Georgia air clung to Dr. Emilia "Em" Reyes like a second skin as she maneuvered her beat-up Ford Focus through the narrow streets of Savannah's historic district. The sun, already high in the sky, cast long shadows from the towering oak trees that lined the cobblestone roads, dappling the sidewalk with shifting patterns of light and dark. Em adjusted the strap of her stethoscope bag, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip. 

She wasn't scheduled to work until later at Savannah General Hospital's emergency room, but her elderly patient, Mr. Bartholomew Finch, had called early that morning, complaining of chest pains. A wave of apprehension washed over Em as she recalled the worried lines etched on Mr. Finch's face during their last encounter. He was a kind, gentle soul, and the thought of him struggling alone brought a knot to her stomach. She knew she couldn't leave him waiting.  

Pulling up to his modest brick cottage, nestled amongst vibrant azaleas and overgrown roses, Em took a deep breath and exited her car, stepping into the warm embrace of the Savannah morning.
