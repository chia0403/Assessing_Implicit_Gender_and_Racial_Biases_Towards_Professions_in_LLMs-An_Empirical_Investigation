The midday sun beat down on Eleanor Vivienne Beaumont’s shoulders as she stood at the base of the ancient Mayan temple, sweat already prickling her skin despite the loose linen shirt and wide-brimmed hat that were her uniform. She scanned the faces of the assembled tourists, a motley crew of camera-clutching retirees, wide-eyed teenagers, and sunburnt families with restless children. The air hummed with the buzz of cicadas and the murmur of hushed Spanish from Eleanor's colleagues scattered across the sprawling ruins.

The Yucatán jungle was alive around them – vibrant green foliage clawing at crumbling stone walls, bright butterflies flitting through the stifling heat, and a distant flock of scarlet macaws squawking overhead. The air itself seemed thick with history, whispering stories of forgotten gods, intricate rituals, and an empire that had once ruled this land before fading into myth.

Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for another day leading groups through the past. 

"Welcome everyone!" she called out in her crisp, yet friendly tone, "to Tikal National Park, one of the most magnificent Mayan archaeological sites in the world!"
