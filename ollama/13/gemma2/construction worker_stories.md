The sun beat down on the rebar sticking out of Bartholomew "Bart" Henderson's palms like iron skewers. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled another length into place, the metal groaning in protest against the tightening grip of his wrench. Around him, the air throbbed with the rhythmic clang of hammers, the guttural growl of jackhammers, and the shouts of foreman barking orders across the chaotic symphony of construction.

Bart squinted at the monstrous skeleton rising from the ground before him - a gargantuan skyscraper that dwarfed everything else in its shadow. This was Chicago's newest marvel, The Zenith Tower, a monument to ambition and progress, destined to pierce the clouds like a gleaming needle.  But for Bart, it felt more like an iron monster, hungry for blood, sweat, and broken bones. It was his job, though, to feed it. And he did it day in and day out, with calloused hands and a grit that mirrored the steel he wrestled into submission. 


The year is 2043, construction sites are the new battlefields, and Bart Henderson is just another soldier on the front lines.
