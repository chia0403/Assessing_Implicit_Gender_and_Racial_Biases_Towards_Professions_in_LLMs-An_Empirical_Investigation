The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Tankard" cast an anemic glow over Elara Wren's tired face. She wiped down a countertop already spotless with a practiced flick of her wrist, ignoring the mournful hum of the refrigerator in the back.  It was just past midnight on a Tuesday, and the bar was as empty as a forgotten graveyard. The only sound besides the fridge was the distant wail of a siren slicing through the quiet street. Elara sighed, leaning against the mahogany counter with an aching weariness that ran deeper than her eight-hour shift allowed. 

The Rusty Tankard itself wasn't much to look at: a dimly lit space squeezed between a laundromat and a pawn shop on a forgotten side street in New Haven.  It was the kind of place where regulars came not for the atmosphere, but for Elara's whiskey sour â€“ a concoction so perfectly balanced, it could soothe even the most jaded soul. Tonight, however, even her signature drink couldn't lift the weight settling on her chest.


Elara glanced at the clock: 12:17 am.  Another night, another quiet shift. She just hoped tomorrow would bring something more.
