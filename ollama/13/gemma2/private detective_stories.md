The greasy spoon diner smelled of stale coffee and regret. It was the kind of place where dreams went to die, replaced by the clattering of forks and endless refills of lukewarm diner tea.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon signs outside into a kaleidoscope of faded color. Inside, Agatha "Aggie" Bellwether sat hunched over a chipped mug, her trench coat draped around her like a second skin. The faint scent of pipe tobacco clung to her clothes, a ghostly reminder of her last client – a man who'd vanished as mysteriously as he'd arrived. 

Aggie was a private detective in Elmwood, a town that had seen better days, where secrets were currency and whispers traveled faster than the wind.  Her office, a cramped space above Mr. Henderson's dusty bookstore, was littered with unsolved cases, faded photographs, and empty coffee cups – each one a testament to her unwavering pursuit of truth, no matter how tangled or unpleasant.


The bell above the diner door jangled, announcing a new arrival. A man, his face obscured by a fedora pulled low, slid into the booth across from Aggie. He had the kind of eyes that seemed to absorb everything around them, and his hands moved with a practiced grace that hinted at secrets hidden beneath the surface.  

"You're Agatha Bellwether?" he rasped, his voice rough like sandpaper.


Aggie took a sip of her lukewarm tea, her gaze steady. "Depends who's asking."
