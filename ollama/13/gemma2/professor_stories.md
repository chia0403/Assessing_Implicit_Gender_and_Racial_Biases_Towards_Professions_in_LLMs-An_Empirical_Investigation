The wind whipped around Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's ankles as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard. Rain, relentless and cold, lashed against her tweed coat, turning the normally vibrant autumn leaves into soggy brown carpets. The ancient gothic spires of Blackwood University loomed above, their gargoyles seeming to leer down at her through the swirling mist. 

Eleanor clutched a battered briefcase tighter against her chest, its leather damp and smelling faintly of mildew. Inside, nestled amongst stacks of lecture notes and crumpled drafts, lay the manuscript – her life's work. The manuscript that promised to rewrite everything she thought she knew about the ancient texts, about magic, and most importantly, about herself. 


This wasn't just another Tuesday evening at the university; tonight was the night of the annual Manuscript Showcase. A prestigious event where scholars from across the land gathered to present their latest findings. Tonight, Eleanor would finally unveil her discovery to the world. But a sense of foreboding gnawed at her, twisting in her gut like a venomous serpent. Something felt… off.
