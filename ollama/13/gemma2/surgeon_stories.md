The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor was the only sound in Dr. Alistair Finch's world. He stood poised above his patient, the sterile scent of antiseptic heavy in the air, his scalpel glinting under the harsh overhead lights. The operating room was a sanctuary, a place where chaos and uncertainty were banished, replaced by precise movements and calculated risks. Outside, the city throbbed with life - sirens wailing, car horns blaring - but here, within these four white walls, Alistair ruled. His world was one of blood vessels and tendons, bone marrow and pulsating organs.  His focus was absolute. The patient's life, fragile and flickering like a candle flame, rested in his hands. 


The city outside - a sprawling metropolis on the edge of an industrial revolution - pulsed with both opportunity and danger. Gritty steel and glass towers clawed at the sky, casting long shadows over cobblestone streets teeming with people, their faces etched with a mix of hope and desperation. This was Newhaven, a city where fortunes were made and lost in the blink of an eye, where dreams soared and nightmares lurked around every corner.
