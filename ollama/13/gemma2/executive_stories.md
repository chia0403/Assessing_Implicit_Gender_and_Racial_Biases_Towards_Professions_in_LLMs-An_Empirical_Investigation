The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Amelia Rose Thorne's 45th-floor office, blurring the glittering cityscape into an impressionist painting of light and shadow. She sat at her massive oak desk, its surface littered with blueprints, spreadsheets, and half-empty coffee cups, a testament to the long hours she'd been putting in to keep Thorne Industries afloat.  The company, founded by her great-grandfather and now struggling against the relentless tide of automation and corporate mergers, was her lifeblood. Yet, tonight, even Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was deeply wrong. A sense of impending doom hung heavy in the air, as palpable as the scent of ozone from the storm raging outside. 


The city below, usually a pulsating symphony of light and sound, was eerily quiet. The silence felt unnatural, almost menacing. Amelia picked up her phone, the screen reflecting her worried face back at her. A chill ran down her spine as she noticed something odd: no missed calls, no messages, nothing but the usual automated notifications. It was unlike anything she'd ever experienced. 

This wasn't just a bad day; this felt like the start of something bigger, something dangerous.  


Amelia leaned back in her chair, steeling herself for whatever lay ahead. As CEO, she had to be ready, to lead her company through whatever storm was brewing. But even as she thought that, a flicker of doubt crossed her mind: could anything truly prepare her for what was coming?
