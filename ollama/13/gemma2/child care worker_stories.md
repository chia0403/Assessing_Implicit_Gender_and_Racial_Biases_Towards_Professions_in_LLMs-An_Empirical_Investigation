The scent of hand sanitizer clung to Amelia Claire Hawthorne like a second skin. It wasn't a bad smell, not exactly, but it was the aroma of childhood scraped knees, sticky fingers, and the occasional bout of stomach flu that permeated every fiber of her being. This wasn't just a job; it was a way of life for Amelia.  

She ran a hand through her messy bun, pushing stray auburn strands behind her ear as she surveyed the chaotic scene unfolding in front of her. The Sunshine Daycare center, nestled in a quaint brick building on Elm Street, was usually a symphony of giggles and crayon scribbles. Today, however, it sounded more like a flock of startled pigeons. A particularly rambunctious group of four-year-olds were engaged in a full-scale water balloon fight, their tiny faces alight with mischievous glee.  Amelia sighed. This was going to be one of those days.
