A lone saxophone wailed a mournful tune from a nearby bar, its melody swallowed by the relentless drumming of rain against corrugated iron roofs. Elara, her red hair plastered to her forehead and her trench coat dripping onto the cracked sidewalk, was engrossed in her latest assignment: uncovering the truth behind a string of seemingly unrelated disappearances plaguing the city's French Quarter. She knew this story was bigger than just names in a missing person file – it felt like a secret heartbeat beneath the vibrant façade of New Orleans, waiting to be unearthed.
