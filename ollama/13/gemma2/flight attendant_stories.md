The recycled air of Gate 42 tasted vaguely of burnt coffee and desperation.  

Amelia Rose Hawthorne surveyed the sea of weary faces before her, each one etching a silent plea into the sterile atmosphere: "Get us out of here." Amelia, despite years in the sky, still felt the pull of empathy for these passengers, their lives temporarily entangled with hers in this metal tube hurtling towards an unknown future.  A wave of anxiety, as familiar and unwelcome as turbulence, ruffled her composure. This flight, a 7:00 am red-eye to Reykjavik, was already running late. And the storm brewing over Iceland? It wasn't just meteorological; it felt personal.


**Setting:** Gate 42 at Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport, early morning, during a chaotic departure schedule and a looming Icelandic storm.
