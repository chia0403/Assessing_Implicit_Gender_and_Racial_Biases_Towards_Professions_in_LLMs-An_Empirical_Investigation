The bell above the door chimed its usual discordant tune as Amelia "Amy" Rose adjusted her nametag, already sweating through the crisp white fabric of her uniform despite the late October chill clinging to the air outside.  

The Rusty Lantern, a dimly lit pub nestled in the heart of Portland's Old Town, was buzzing with the pre-dinner crowd: businessmen in tweed jackets hunched over pints, couples stealing whispered conversations, and lone wolves nursing coffee by the fireplace. The scent of stale beer and roasted peanuts hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of cinnamon from the bakery next door.  Amy, armed with a notepad and her ever-present smile, navigated through the throng, her worn-out Doc Martens thumping softly against the sticky floorboards. It was another Friday night at the Rusty Lantern, another symphony of clinking glasses and boisterous laughter â€“ and Amy's stage.
