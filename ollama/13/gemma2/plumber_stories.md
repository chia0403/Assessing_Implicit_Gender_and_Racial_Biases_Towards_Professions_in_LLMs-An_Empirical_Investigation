Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Benny "The Wrench" Worthington's van, each drop a tiny explosion echoing in the cramped space. He hunched over his toolbox, fiddling with a set of pliers, the greasy metal cold under his calloused fingers. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the rain into icy sheets that obscured the already murky streetlights of Cobblestone Alley. 

Cobblestone Alley wasn't exactly known for its cleanliness or safety. It was a labyrinth of crumbling brick buildings, their facades peeling like sunburnt skin, and narrow paths choked with overflowing bins and stray cats hissing in the gloom. Benny knew every nook and cranny, every leaky pipe and clogged drain, as well as he knew the lines on his own weathered hands. 

This storm, however, was different. It felt primal, a beast clawing at the city's underbelly, determined to tear it apart piece by piece. And tonight, Benny felt an unsettling premonition, like something lurked beneath the storm's fury, waiting for its chance to strike.  


He glanced at the dripping rain gauge in his van window – over three inches already. He cursed under his breath, knowing his call about a burst pipe on the third floor of 12 Cobblestone Lane wouldn’t be pleasant. This wasn't just any leak; this was Mrs. Peabody's prized orchid collection, and she was notorious for her fiery temper when anything threatened her precious flowers.  

Benny sighed, grabbed his toolbox, and stepped out into the tempest. He braced against the wind, its icy fingers tearing at his worn jacket, and headed towards the building, its shadow a looming silhouette against the stormy sky.
