The air in Beatrice "Bea" Blackwood's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already faded cityscape of New Orleans into an impressionistic watercolour. Bea, perched precariously on her worn swivel chair, stared at the stack of paperwork on her desk, each file a miniature tragedy waiting to be processed.  She was drowning in claims – flooding from the recent downpours, burst pipes, and the ever-present threat of hurricane season looming just over the horizon. 

Bea, however, wasn't fazed by the storm brewing outside or the metaphorical one raging within her office. She was a seasoned insurance agent, weathering the emotional tides of human misfortune for over a decade. But today, a particular file held her attention. It belonged to a Mrs. Eloise Dupree, whose antique shop had been robbed just last night.  Bea knew this wasn't just another claim – it felt different, heavier somehow. A shiver ran down her spine as she reached for the file, a feeling that this case was about to unravel something far more complex than just stolen trinkets.
