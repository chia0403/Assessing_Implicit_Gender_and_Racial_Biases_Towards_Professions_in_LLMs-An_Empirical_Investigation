The biting wind whipped across Amelia "Ace" Blackwood's face, carrying with it the scent of salt and a hint of storm brewing on the horizon. She adjusted her leather aviator goggles, their worn lenses reflecting the fiery sunset painting the clouds above the small, wind-battered island airstrip. Her single-engine Cessna 172, affectionately nicknamed "Whiskey", hummed beneath her, eager to take flight amidst the gathering dusk.  Ace squinted at the approaching storm, a familiar apprehension gnawing at her stomach. She wasn't afraid of storms; she loved the challenge they presented. But tonight, something felt different, heavier. The air crackled with an unseen energy, and a deep unease settled within her bones. 


The airstrip itself was a patchwork of gravel and dust, barely visible against the darkening landscape. Palm trees swayed precariously in the growing wind, their fronds whistling like mournful ghosts. Beyond the runway, the dense jungle rose up on all sides, its shadowy depths promising secrets and dangers in equal measure. This remote island, nestled deep within the Pacific Ocean, was a world apart, known only to a handful of weathered souls who called it home. Ace belonged to that select group, drawn here by an unquenchable thirst for adventure and a yearning to escape the confines of her past. Tonight, however, even this haven felt vulnerable under the menacing gaze of the approaching storm.
