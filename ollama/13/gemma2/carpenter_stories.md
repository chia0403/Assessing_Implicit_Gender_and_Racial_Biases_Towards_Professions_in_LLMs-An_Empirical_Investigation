The scent of sawdust and varnish hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thornewood. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden rays. Outside, the bustling port town of Saltwind was waking, its cobbled streets soon to be teeming with merchants, sailors, and everyday folk. But inside the workshop, time seemed to move at a slower pace. Elias, hammer poised above a piece of oak, felt the familiar thrum of creation in his bones.  He was crafting a chest – a simple one, for an old woman who wanted to store her late husband’s tools. Simple, yet every curve and joint held the weight of stories untold, whispered by the wood itself. Elias listened. He always did. 


**Setting:** Saltwind, a bustling port town on the edge of a vast, storm-ridden sea.  The town is known for its shipbuilding, fishing industry, and lively marketplace. It's a place where whispers of adventure mingle with the salty tang of the air, and legends are born from the swirling mists that often blanket the harbor.
