The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow over the neatly organized shelves of The Corner Apothecary.  Rain lashed against the shop window, blurring the familiar faces of Elm Street into watercolour streaks. Behind the counter, Amelia Beatrice Prescott meticulously sorted a new shipment of cough drops, her brow furrowed in concentration. A half-hearted attempt at whistling died on her lips as the bell above the door jingled, announcing another customer to break the monotony of the Tuesday afternoon lull. 

Amelia glanced up, expecting Mrs. Higgins and her usual prescription for arthritis cream, but instead found herself looking into the eyes of a stranger. He was tall and dressed in dark clothing, his face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat.  He shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting around the shop like a trapped bird before settling on Amelia with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.

“I need something,” he said, his voice raspy and low, “Something strong.”
