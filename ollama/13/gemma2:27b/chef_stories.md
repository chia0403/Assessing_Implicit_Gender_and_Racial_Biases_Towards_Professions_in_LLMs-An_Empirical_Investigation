Rain hammered against the bakery windows, blurring the warm glow spilling from within into streaks of ochre and gold. The aroma of freshly baked bread, mingled with cinnamon and cloves, fought a losing battle against the damp chill seeping through the cracks in the ancient wooden door.

Elias Blackwood, his brow furrowed in concentration, kneaded a mound of dough with practiced ease. Flour dusted his thick arms and apron like snowdrifts. His face, etched with lines that spoke of late nights and relentless dedication, softened as he inhaled the yeasty scent rising from the bowl. 

This was Elias’ sanctuary, a haven from the storm raging outside – and often within him. The rhythmic pulse of kneading, the precise dance of ingredients, the alchemy of transforming humble flour and water into something sublime - it all brought a sense of peace that eluded him in the rest of his life.
