Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's office, blurring the already-dim view of Elm Street. The smell of wet asphalt and decaying leaves drifted in through the cracked pane, mingling with the stale scent of coffee and desperation that permeated the tiny space. Bea sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she stared at the stack of unsold property listings on her desk. 

She was known in this sleepy town of Oakhaven as "Bea Hawthorne, The Realtor Who Can Sell Anything."  A reputation earned through years of hustling and charm, navigating the fickle market with a smile and a silver tongue. But lately, even Bea's magic seemed to be fading. The once-booming housing market had cooled, leaving her struggling to make ends meet.

Today was different though. Today, she had an appointment that promised to change everything:  the Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion shrouded in mystery and whispered rumors. It was rumored to be haunted, its previous owner vanishing without a trace years ago. Most agents wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole, but Bea saw opportunity where others saw danger.
