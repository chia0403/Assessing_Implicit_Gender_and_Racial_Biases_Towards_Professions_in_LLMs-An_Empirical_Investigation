The air in the cramped drafting room hummed with the quiet whir of fans battling the summer heat radiating off rows of flickering fluorescent lights. Elias Finchley hunched over his drafting table, the faint scent of graphite and linseed oil filling his nostrils. Outside, the bustling city of New Alexandria pulsed with life - a symphony of honking horns, clanging trams, and the distant cries of street vendors. But within the confines of this room, tucked away on the third floor of a nondescript brick building, Elias existed in a world of precise lines, meticulous measurements, and intricate details. 


His calloused fingers danced across the vellum paper, meticulously sketching the framework for a new airship hangar - a colossal structure with towering steel girders and sweeping glass domes designed to house the city's burgeoning fleet of dirigibles. Eliasâ€™ brow furrowed in concentration as he adjusted the angle of his T-square, ensuring each line was perfectly perpendicular. This project, commissioned by the esteemed Air Transport Guild, was his chance to prove himself, to rise above the ranks of ordinary draftsmen and etch his name into the annals of New Alexandria's architectural history.
