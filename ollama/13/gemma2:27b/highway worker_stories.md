The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias Santiago's back, turning his already sweat-soaked shirt into a second skin. He squinted at the shimmering asphalt ahead, its surface rippling in the heat haze like a mirage. The scent of tar and diesel hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail to Elias who had spent the last decade patching up this stretch of Interstate 10. Today's assignment: fixing a gaping pothole the size of a small car, courtesy of a runaway semi-trailer tire.

Elias hefted his shovel, the worn wooden handle smooth under his calloused grip. He glanced at the dusty pickup truck parked further down the shoulder, its door open and revealing his partner, Miguel, enjoying a lukewarm can of soda in the shade. Elias envied him for a moment before turning back to the monstrous hole that yawned before him. 

This stretch of highway, a ribbon of asphalt slicing through the desolate beauty of the Sonoran Desert, was Elias's domain. He knew its every curve and dip, its hidden oases of wildflowers after a rare rain, and the treacherous patches where sand would drift onto the lanes, turning them into mini-skating rinks for unsuspecting drivers.  But today, all he felt was the relentless heat pressing down on him, the weight of another long shift stretching ahead.
