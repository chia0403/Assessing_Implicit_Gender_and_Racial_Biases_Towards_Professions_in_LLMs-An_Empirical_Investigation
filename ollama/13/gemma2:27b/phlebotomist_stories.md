The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the cramped waiting room. Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, smoothing down her starched blue scrubs for the tenth time. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and nervous sweat, a familiar cocktail she'd come to associate with Mondays at St. Jude's Community Clinic. Today, however, the usual humdrum anticipation was laced with something else: an unsettling stillness.

The waiting room chairs sat empty except for one occupied by a young man in a tattered hoodie, his face buried deep within his hands. Amelia watched him nervously from behind the registration desk. She couldn't help but wonder what brought him to the clinic on this dreary morning. Was it a routine checkup? A nagging cold? Or something more serious, lurking beneath the surface of his hunched shoulders and muffled sobs?
