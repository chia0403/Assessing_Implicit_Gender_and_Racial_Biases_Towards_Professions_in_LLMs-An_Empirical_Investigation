Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the office on 42nd Street, blurring the neon cityscape into an impressionistic smear of crimson and emerald. Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, squinting at the jumble of invoices spread across her desk. The rhythmic clacking of her typewriter was a lonely counterpoint to the storm raging outside and the muffled arguments emanating from Mr. Hendersonâ€™s office next door.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. It was just another dreary Wednesday in the bowels of Henderson & Sons Import-Export, a company that seemed as ancient and dilapidated as the building it inhabited. Her fingers hovered over the keys, longing for something more than endless paperwork and the bitter tang of lukewarm coffee brewing in the communal pot. She dreamed of worlds beyond her dusty window, of adventure and romance whispered on pages torn from well-worn novels.
