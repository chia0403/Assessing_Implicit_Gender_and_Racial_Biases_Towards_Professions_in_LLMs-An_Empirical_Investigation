Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's studio apartment, blurring the neon glow of the Tokyo skyline beyond. The air hung thick with the scent of old coffee and desperation.  Alistair, his once-sharp brown eyes clouded with fatigue, stared at the blueprints spread across his desk, the lines blurring into a frustrating jumble. He'd poured weeks into this project - a sleek, sustainable skyscraper designed to redefine the cityscape â€“ only for it to be rejected by yet another client.

"It's too ambitious," they'd said. "Too futuristic." Alistair snorted. Was he supposed to design beige boxes with predictable layouts just because that's what everyone else was doing? He craved innovation, beauty, a building that would breathe and pulse with the city around it.  But Tokyo, it seemed, preferred conformity.

The insistent chirping of his phone dragged him from his thoughts. It was Kenji, his only friend in this concrete jungle, reminding him about their evening plans: karaoke at the neon-drenched dive bar beneath the train tracks. Alistair hesitated. He wanted nothing more than to curl up under his threadbare blanket and drown his sorrows in cheap ramen. But he knew Kenji wouldn't take "no" for an answer. And maybe, just maybe, a night of belting out off-key pop songs was exactly what he needed.
