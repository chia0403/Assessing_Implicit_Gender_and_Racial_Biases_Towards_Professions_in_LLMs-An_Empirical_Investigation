The smell of cedar hung heavy in the air, a sweet counterpoint to the acrid tang of sawdust that perpetually dusted Alistair Finch's overalls. Sunlight slanted through the open doorway of his workshop, illuminating swirling motes and casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the Maine coast was waking up – gulls squawked, lobster boats chugged out into the mist-shrouded harbor, and the distant clang of a buoy against a hull echoed Alistair's own rhythmic hammering. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth curve of a cedar chest he was building, his brow furrowed in concentration. 

Alistair wasn't one for fancy designs or intricate carvings. His work was solid, functional, built to last generations. Each piece held a piece of himself – the patience honed through years of whittling down rough planks, the love for the natural beauty of wood, the quiet satisfaction of creating something useful from nothing but raw material and his own two hands.
