The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows of Judge Amelia Cartwright's chambers, casting long shadows across the overflowing stacks of case files on her desk. The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the cacophony of downtown New Haven echoed â€“ sirens wailing, horns blaring, the rumble of buses struggling uphill. But inside, a quiet stillness had settled.

Amelia rubbed her temples, willing away the burgeoning headache. Another day, another parade of broken lives shuffled through her courtroom. She longed for simpler times, when justice felt clear-cut and the weight of her decisions didn't feel like lead in her gut.  Today's case, a custody battle between two acrimonious parents, was proving particularly thorny. The child, a bright-eyed six-year-old named Lily, had already been through enough trauma.  

Amelia glanced at the clock. Five minutes to judgement. She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and picked up the file labeled "In re: Custody of Lily Evans." The fight for Lily's future was about to begin.
