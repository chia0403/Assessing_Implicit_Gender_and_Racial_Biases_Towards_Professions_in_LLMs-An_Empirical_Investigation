Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the warped glass. Eleanor Vance, perched precariously on a wobbly stool, swore under her breath as the flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows across the dusty manuscript pages spread before her. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and forgotten dreams. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, its icy fingers clawing at the eaves of the rambling Victorian house. Eleanor shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders. This old house, inherited from a distant aunt she barely remembered, had become both sanctuary and prison.

She longed for inspiration to strike, for the words to flow freely onto the page as they once had. But lately, her muse had flown the coop, leaving Eleanor stranded in a sea of writer's block.  The manuscript before her, a sprawling gothic novel set amidst the misty moors of Yorkshire, lay unfinished â€“ a testament to her creative paralysis.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation ran down her spine as the wind seemed to whisper secrets through the cracks in the attic walls. Perhaps tonight, she thought, just maybe tonight, the muse would return.
