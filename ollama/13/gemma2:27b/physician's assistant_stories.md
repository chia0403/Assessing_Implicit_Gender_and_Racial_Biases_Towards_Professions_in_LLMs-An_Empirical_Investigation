The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow over the overflowing triage room. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. It was another Tuesday night in the Emergency Department at Mercy General, where chaos reigned supreme and sleep was a distant memory.

Eleanor, her blonde braid snaking down her back like a weary serpent, sighed as she glanced at the overflowing waiting area. A man clutched his chest theatrically, a young girl with a sprained ankle wailed piteously, and an elderly woman mumbled incoherently while clutching a stained teddy bear. She loved her job, truly she did, but some nights felt like an endless barrage of misery.

Tonight was shaping up to be one of those nights.
