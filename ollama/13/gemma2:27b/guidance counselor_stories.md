The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered desk in Amelia Hawthorne's office. Posters with motivational slogans like "Dream Big" and "Believe in Yourself" hung limply on the walls, their once vibrant colors now faded and dull. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she stared at the mountain of student files piled precariously on one corner of her desk.

Outside, the late September air held the crisp scent of fallen leaves and impending winter. A dreary drizzle hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the weight pressing down on Amelia's chest. This was supposed to be her dream job, helping young minds navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence and prepare for the future. Yet, lately it felt more like drowning in paperwork and dashed hopes.
