The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unflattering glare on Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's already-tired face. She sighed, her fingers hovering over the stainless steel tray filled with gleaming instruments. The familiar tang of toothpaste and antiseptic hung in the air, a scent she usually found comforting but today felt suffocating. 

It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Henderson, notorious for her bad breath and even worse dental hygiene, was due at 2:30 sharp. Eleanor braced herself mentally, picturing the woman's gummy smile and the inevitable lecture she'd have to deliver on the importance of flossing.  

Outside, beyond the frosted windowpane, a relentless drizzle hammered against the pavement. Even the rain seemed dreary today, mirroring Eleanor's mood as she prepared for another day of scraping plaque and lecturing patients about sugar consumption. This wasn't how she envisioned her life. A talented artist in her spare time, Eleanor yearned for something more than the sterile routine of her job at Dr. Miller's practice. 

But bills needed paying, and dreams, unfortunately, didn't.
