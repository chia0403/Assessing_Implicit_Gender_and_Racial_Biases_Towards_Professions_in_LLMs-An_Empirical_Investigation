The bell above the pharmacy door jingled merrily, announcing Amelia Brighton's arrival. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she surveyed the cluttered counter. Empty pill bottles teetered precariously next to stacks of prescription forms, vying for space with boxes of cough drops and tubes of hand cream. The air hung thick with the scent of lavender essential oil, a feeble attempt to mask the harsher medicinal smells that permeated every corner of Brighton's Pharmacy.

Amelia had inherited the pharmacy from her grandmother five years ago, vowing to keep the family legacy alive. But lately, the weight of responsibility felt heavier than ever. The once-bustling village of Oakhaven seemed to be fading away, its inhabitants slowly drifting towards larger towns with modern conveniences. Foot traffic dwindled, prescriptions were fewer, and Amelia found herself battling not just dispensing pills but also a creeping sense of loneliness.

Today, however, the bell's cheerful chime promised something different. A young woman stood hesitantly by the counter, her face hidden behind a curtain of dark hair. Her eyes, when she finally met Amelia's gaze, were filled with a desperate urgency.
