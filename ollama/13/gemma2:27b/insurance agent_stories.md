Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Archibald "Archie" Finnegan's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the neon glow of the Lucky Clover pawn shop cast an sickly green hue onto the rain-slicked asphalt. It was a Friday night in Bleakersville, and Archie, senior insurance agent at Bleakers & Sons, hadn't closed a single deal all week. 

His phone, usually buzzing with potential clients seeking his expertise on life, fire, and everything in between, lay silent on the desk. The once-vibrant brochures detailing the benefits of comprehensive coverage were now dog-eared and faded, victims of Archie's dwindling hope. He stared at a half-eaten tuna sandwich, the smell suddenly revolting. Bleakersville, with its shuttered factories and air thick with regret, seemed to be swallowing his dreams whole.
