Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Blackwood's cramped office. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the overflowing inbox and stacks of files threatening to topple over onto her already cluttered desk. Outside, sirens wailed, their mournful song blending with the relentless drumming of rain. It was a typical Tuesday afternoon in Southbridge, a city steeped in grime and despair, its streets echoing with the struggles of those who had lost their way.

Amelia Blackwood, a probation officer hardened by years of navigating this urban labyrinth, sighed deeply, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that escaped her bun. Her sharp blue eyes, usually alight with empathy, seemed dulled by the relentless weight of her caseload. Today, however, she felt a prickle of unease. A new file lay on her desk - Case Number 4782: Ethan Cole. The name sparked a flicker of recognition, a whisper from a forgotten past that Amelia couldn't quite place.

Ethan Cole, convicted for grand theft auto, was due for his first meeting with Amelia this afternoon. And something about it felt... different.
