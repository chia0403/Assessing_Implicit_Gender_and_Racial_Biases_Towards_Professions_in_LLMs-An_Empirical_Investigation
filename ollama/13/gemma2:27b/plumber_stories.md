Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rusty van, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. The streetlights cast an anemic glow on the slick cobblestones, reflecting off puddles that mirrored the storm-wracked sky. Bart sighed, his breath fogging the grimy windshield. He was hunched over a mangled pipe fitting, the fluorescent light inside the van casting harsh shadows across his grease-stained face and calloused hands.

He was supposed to be enjoying a rare night off, but the universe, it seemed, had other plans. A panicked phone call from Mrs. O'Malley, her voice trembling as she described a geyser erupting from her kitchen sink, had yanked him away from his half-finished crossword and plunged him back into the murky depths of plumbing emergencies. Bart muttered under his breath about ungrateful pipes and the capriciousness of fate, but there was a begrudging fondness in his tone. He knew Mrs. O'Malley relied on him, just like countless others in this ramshackle corner of the city.

He tightened the last bolt on the fitting, wiping away a stray bead of sweat with the back of his hand. The storm showed no sign of abating. It seemed this night would be as long and arduous as the pipe he'd just wrestled into submission.
