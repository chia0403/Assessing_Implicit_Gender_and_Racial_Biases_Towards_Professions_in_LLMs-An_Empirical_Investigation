The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thistlewick's head, casting an anemic glow over the linoleum floor he was diligently mopping. Elias wasn't just any janitor; he was the custodian of the Grand Blackwood Library, a labyrinthine edifice filled with centuries-old tomes and whispers of forgotten lore. Every night, after the last scholar had departed and the heavy oak doors were bolted shut, Elias would roam the silent aisles, his mop a faithful companion against the encroaching dust bunnies and stray parchment scraps. 

Tonight, however, the usual stillness was punctuated by a strange tremor that rippled through the shelves, sending a shiver down Elias's spine. The air grew thick with the scent of ozone, and a faint luminescence pulsed from deep within the library's oldest wing. A place even Elias, who knew every nook and cranny of this hallowed hall, avoided.
