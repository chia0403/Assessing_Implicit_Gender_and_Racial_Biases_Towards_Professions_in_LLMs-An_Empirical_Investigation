Rain lashed against the grimy window of Silas Blackwood's office, mimicking the rhythmic drumming in his temples. The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, a perfume familiar to anyone who frequented the dingy back alleys of New Haven, Connecticut. Outside, neon signs flickered through the downpour, casting grotesque shadows that danced on the peeling wallpaper. 

Silas Blackwood, a man whose face bore the map of countless late nights and bad decisions, leaned back in his creaky chair, fingers drumming impatiently on his desk. A half-empty bottle of bourbon sat precariously close to the edge, threatening to spill its amber contents onto the stack of case files beside it. He was waiting for a client, a woman named Amelia Thorne who'd called earlier, her voice trembling with urgency and something else â€“ fear, perhaps? 

She'd been vague on the phone, only mentioning a missing heirloom and a family secret buried deep in the past. Whatever she had to tell him, Silas knew it wouldn't be simple. Nothing ever was in this city, a place where shadows clung tighter than hope and secrets whispered louder than the wind.
