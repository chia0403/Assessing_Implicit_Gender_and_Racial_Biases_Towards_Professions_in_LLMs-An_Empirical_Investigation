The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, clinging to Elara Nightingale's skin as she stood backstage. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a frantic drum solo accompanying the hushed murmur of anticipation from the crowd beyond the velvet curtain. Tonight was the biggest gig of her life – The Blue Moon Tavern, legendary for hosting the hottest emerging talent in New Orleans.

Elara traced the outline of the crescent moon pendant hanging around her neck, its cool silver a reassuring touch against her clammy fingers. She could hear the last chords of the previous act fading, followed by the thunderous applause that always seemed to shake the very foundations of the tavern. It was almost her turn. 

She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath and letting the music from her own soul rise within her. Tonight, she would pour it all out – the heartache, the hope, the yearning for something more that pulsed through every note she sang.
