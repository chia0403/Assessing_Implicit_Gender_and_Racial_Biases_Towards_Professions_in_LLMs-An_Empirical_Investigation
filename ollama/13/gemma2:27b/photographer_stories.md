The air hung thick and humid, smelling of salt and rotting fish. It clung to Elara Skye like a damp shroud as she trudged through the sand, her battered canvas bag slung over one shoulder. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the white sands into blinding expanses.

She squinted at the horizon, searching for the jagged silhouette of the abandoned lighthouse that marked her destination. It stood sentinel against the crashing waves, a skeletal monument to forgotten maritime dreams. Elara had been drawn to it since she was a child, captivated by its melancholic beauty and the stories whispered about its ghostly keeper.

Today, with her trusty camera in hand, she was determined to capture its essence, to weave a narrative through light and shadow. The lighthouse promised to be the perfect subject, a lonely sentinel against the relentless march of time. As Elara neared the base of the crumbling structure, the wind picked up, whipping strands of her dark hair across her face.

This was it. This was where she'd find her story.
