The bell above the shop door chimed with a cheerful, almost apologetic jingle, announcing Eloise Evangeline Beaumont's first customer of the day. Rain hammered against the windowpanes of "Blooming Marvelous," blurring the cobblestone street outside into an impressionist painting of greys and blacks. Inside, the air was thick with the sweet perfume of lilies, roses, and hyacinths, a fragrant oasis from the dreary London morning. Eloise, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, smiled warmly at the woman who entered, dripping slightly from the downpour. 


"Good morning," Eloise greeted, her voice lilting with a hint of Yorkshire charm. "What can I do for you today?"  The customer, a stern-looking woman with a tightly wound bun and a hawk-like gaze, surveyed the shop with thinly veiled suspicion. This was no ordinary flower-buying occasion. Something in the air – perhaps the scent of impending mystery – told Eloise this was just the beginning of a rather unusual day.
