The insistent chime of the antique brass bell echoed through the cavernous lobby, jarring Elara Finch from her daydreams.  She smoothed down the lavender cardigan clinging to her slightly rounded figure, plastered on a smile, and looked up. 

The Grand Blackwood Hotel was a relic of a bygone era, its gilded opulence fading like an old photograph. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of mythical beasts and forgotten gods.  Marble floors gleamed underfoot, worn smooth by countless footsteps over generations. A roaring fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the ornate tapestry depicting a hunt scene hanging above it. 

Yet, despite its grandeur, Elara found herself yearning for something beyond the endless cycle of check-ins and inquiries.  As she met the eyes of the new arrival – a tall man with a fedora pulled low over his face and an aura of mystery clinging to him like smoke – she couldn't help but feel that something was about to change.
