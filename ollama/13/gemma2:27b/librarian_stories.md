Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick.  The usually comforting scent of aged paper and leather was overpowered by the cloying smell of damp wool and anxiety. Eleanor, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, paced behind the imposing mahogany circulation desk, her sensible shoes squeaking rhythmically against the polished floor. The library, her sanctuary for the past twenty years, felt alien tonight. 

The annual Founders' Ball was in full swing upstairs in the Grand Hall, and the echoing strains of a waltz filtered down through the heavy oak doors. Eleanor shuddered. Social gatherings were her personal hell, filled with forced smiles and stilted conversation. She much preferred the company of dusty tomes and forgotten lore. But tonight was different. Tonight, she had a responsibility â€“ a duty that weighed upon her like a stack of overdue encyclopedias.
