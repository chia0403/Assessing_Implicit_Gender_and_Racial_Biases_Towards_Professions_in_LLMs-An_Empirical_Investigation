Rain lashed against the frosted glass of Amelia Cartwright's office window, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of shimmering lights and swirling grey.  She sat perched on the edge of her leather desk chair, fingers drumming a restless rhythm against the mahogany surface. Files lay open around her, each one a tangled knot of legal jargon and human despair.

The air in the small office hung heavy with the scent of old paper and Amelia's lavender hand cream - a futile attempt to mask the underlying odor of defeat that had become all too familiar. Tonight was different though. Tonight, she felt a flicker of hope ignite within her chest. After months of tireless work, the preliminary hearing for her client, a young single mother wrongly accused of embezzlement, was finally scheduled.

Amelia straightened, her gaze drawn to a photograph on her desk - a smiling image of her own daughter, Lily, now away at university pursuing a degree in environmental law. It was Lily who had instilled in Amelia a deep-seated belief in justice, a conviction that fueled her passion for defending the underdog.  Tonight, she would fight tooth and nail for another mother, for another chance at a brighter future.
