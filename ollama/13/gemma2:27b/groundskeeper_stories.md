The mist clung to Blackwood Manor like an ethereal shroud, muting the once vibrant colours of the rose garden to muted shades of grey. Elias Hawthorne, his weathered face creased with concern, surveyed the damage.  A fierce storm the previous night had ripped through the meticulously tended grounds, leaving a trail of uprooted roses, shattered flowerpots and twisted branches in its wake.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the mournful cry of the wind whistling through the ancient oaks that lined the drive. He loved Blackwood Manor, its history whispering from every stone and leaf. For decades, his family had served as groundskeepers for the once-grand estate, their lives intricately woven into its fabric. Now, facing the daunting task of restoring the garden to its former glory, Elias felt a weight settling on his shoulders, heavier than any fallen branch.
