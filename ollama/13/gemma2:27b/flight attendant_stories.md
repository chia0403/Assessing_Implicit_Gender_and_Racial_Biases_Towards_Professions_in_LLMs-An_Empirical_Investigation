The recycled air in the cramped galley hummed with the monotonous drone of the engine, mirroring the weary ache throbbing behind Elara Ainsworth's eyes.  She was nearing the end of her transatlantic flight from London to New York, but the usual sense of accomplishment that accompanied landing didnâ€™t quite reach her today. The turbulence had been brutal, leaving several passengers shaken and a spilled tray of mimosa staining the already worn carpet.

Elara sighed, wiping down the sticky residue with a damp cloth. Her reflection in the stainless steel fridge door stared back at her: tired blue eyes framed by wisps of auburn hair escaping its braid, a smudge of lipstick on her cheek.  She looked older than her twenty-five years. The constant time zone shifts and dealing with demanding passengers were taking their toll.

Suddenly, a sharp crack echoed through the cabin, followed by an unsettling silence. Elara froze, her heart plummeting to her stomach. It wasn't the usual creak or groan of the aging aircraft; this was something different, something ominous.
