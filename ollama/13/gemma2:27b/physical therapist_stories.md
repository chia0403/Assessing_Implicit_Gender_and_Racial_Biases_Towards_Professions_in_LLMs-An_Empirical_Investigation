Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Evelyn Rose Hawthorne. She stared out at the blurred cityscape, her knuckles white as they gripped the edge of her desk. Three years. Three years she'd poured her heart and soul into this place, building it from the ground up. Now, thanks to a bureaucratic snafu with insurance reimbursements, she was staring down the barrel of closure.

The scent of disinfectant mingled with lavender from the diffuser she’d desperately bought in an attempt to soothe the anxiety gnawing at her stomach. Her phone buzzed on the desk – another cancellation. Evelyn sighed, the sound heavy and resigned. It wasn't just about the money anymore; it was about helping people reclaim their bodies, their lives. The thought of turning them away, of sending them back into a world that often felt unyielding and unforgiving, filled her with a hollow dread. 

Just then, the door creaked open, momentarily breaking the silence. In walked a figure shrouded in rain-soaked canvas. Evelyn straightened up, forcing a smile onto her face. Maybe this was it – a last-minute client who would change everything.
