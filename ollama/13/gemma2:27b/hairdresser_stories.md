The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and burnt hairspray. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane of "Curl Up & Dye," casting stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Eloise Beatrice Fontaine hummed along to Billie Holiday on the crackling radio as she expertly weaved a braid into Mrs. Henderson's silvering hair. Outside, the clamor of the New Orleans French Quarter pulsed â€“ street musicians vying for attention with hawkers and rumbling trolleys. But within the haven of Eloise's salon, time seemed to slow. 

Here, amidst mismatched chairs, faded posters of glamorous hairstyles, and the comforting clink of shears, Eloise was a magician. She transformed not just hair, but lives. A bad perm could be a soul-crushing blow; a perfectly sculpted updo, a confidence booster.  Eloise knew this better than anyone.

Today, however, felt different. There was an undercurrent of tension in the air, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of Curl Up & Dye. The bell above the door chimed, interrupting Eloise's thoughts and announcing a new arrival. She looked up, expecting Mrs. Dubois for her weekly curl touch-up. Instead, a figure stood silhouetted against the afternoon sun, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  A chill snaked down Eloise's spine. This was no ordinary customer.
