The scent of crayons and Elmer's glue hung thick in the air, mingling with the sugary sweetness emanating from the half-eaten cupcakes on the counter.  Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch surveyed her classroom with a sigh. Glitter clung stubbornly to every surface, a testament to their morning art project: making sparkly Christmas ornaments. Five-year-old Liam was currently attempting to eat one, convinced it was edible candy, while Maya and Sophia were locked in a fierce debate over the ownership of a particularly glittery purple star.

It was the last day before winter break, and Ellie could feel the restless energy buzzing around the room like a swarm of miniature honeybees.  The Christmas tree in the corner shimmered with lopsided homemade ornaments, each one representing a unique expression of her students' boundless imagination. It should have been a moment of peaceful joy, but Ellie couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something was amiss.
