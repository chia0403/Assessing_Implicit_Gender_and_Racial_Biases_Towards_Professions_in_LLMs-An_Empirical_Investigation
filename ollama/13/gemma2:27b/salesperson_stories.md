The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to drape across Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's shoulders like an itchy wool shawl.  She tugged at her collar, wishing for the hundredth time she'd worn something lighter than this linen monstrosity.  Beads of sweat gathered on her brow, threatening to drip into her carefully applied crimson lipstick. 

The market square buzzed with activity - hawkers bellowing their wares, children weaving between stalls, the rhythmic clatter of a blacksmith's hammer ringing out from somewhere deeper in the labyrinthine alleyways. Evelyn surveyed it all with a practiced eye, noting the ebb and flow of foot traffic, identifying potential customers amongst the throng.

Today was a crucial day for Evelyn. After months of peddling her wares across dusty roads and forgotten villages, she'd finally arrived in Aldersgate - the bustling heart of the kingdom, rumored to be overflowing with wealthy merchants eager to acquire the latest novelties.  She'd staked everything on this trip: her savings, her reputation, even her grandmother's treasured silver locket. 

Evelyn adjusted the velvet-lined tray strapped to her waist, where nestled a collection of exquisitely crafted clockwork hummingbirds â€“ each one capable of mimicking real bird song with uncanny precision. It was a gamble, she knew, but if she could just secure a few influential buyers... then everything would change.
