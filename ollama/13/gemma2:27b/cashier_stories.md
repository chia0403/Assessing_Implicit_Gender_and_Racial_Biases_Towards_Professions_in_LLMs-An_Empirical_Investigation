Rain hammered against the grimy storefront window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into an indecipherable smear. Inside, Amelia Thistlewick sighed, the sound swallowed by the incessant drumming on the glass. She idly traced a finger across a cracked barcode scanner, her mind wandering to warmer, drier places â€“ anywhere but this dingy all-night convenience store in the heart of Bleaker Heights. 

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles stocked with dented cans and dusty bags of chips. A lone cockroach scuttled across the linoleum floor, disappearing behind a shelf stacked with expired ramen noodles.  Amelia braced herself for another night punctuated by bored truckers, insomniac college students, and the occasional drunk stumbling in from the nearby bar. She hoped tonight wouldn't be as eventful as last week, when a man tried to pay for his beer with Monopoly money.
