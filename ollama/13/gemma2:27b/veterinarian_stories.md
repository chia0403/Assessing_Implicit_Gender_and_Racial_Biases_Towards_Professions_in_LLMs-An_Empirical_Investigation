Rain lashed against the windows of the ramshackle veterinary clinic, mimicking the frantic thumping of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's heart.  The old building creaked and groaned around her, its bones weary from years of weathering coastal storms. Salt air hung thick in the air, mingling with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant and a faint underlying scent of wet fur.  Amelia wiped her brow, leaving a streak of mascara through the grease paint she'd applied earlier for the annual Seahaven Harvest Festival parade.

Tonight, however, there was no festive cheer. Only dread.

A low moan drifted from the back room, where a hulking figure lay shrouded in blankets on a makeshift gurney. Not a human figure, Amelia reminded herself, forcing down the bile rising in her throat. This was Fang, Old Man Finnigan's beloved Irish Wolfhound, and he wasn't doing well.  

Amelia took a steadying breath, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her thin shoulders. Fang was more than just a patient; he was a companion, a lifeline for the lonely Finnigan who lived miles up the coast in a crumbling cottage overlooking the churning sea. And Amelia couldnâ€™t bear to think what would become of them both if she failed.
