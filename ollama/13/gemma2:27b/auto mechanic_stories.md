The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and sweat - a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Bart" Kincaid. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly on his garage, turning the rusted metal roof into a skillet. Inside, however, it was a sanctuary of clanging tools, whirring machinery, and the satisfying rumble of engines coming back to life. Bart wiped grease from his forehead with a rag, squinting at the carburetor he'd been wrestling with for the past hour. A '67 Mustang, cherry red and gleaming despite its age, sat patiently on the lift, waiting for him to coax it back to its former glory.  He loved these classics, the ones that whispered stories of dusty highways and carefree summers.

But today, Bart wasn't feeling the usual thrill. He was restless, a nagging unease twisting in his gut. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a sense of impending change hanging heavy in the air like monsoon clouds gathering on the horizon.
