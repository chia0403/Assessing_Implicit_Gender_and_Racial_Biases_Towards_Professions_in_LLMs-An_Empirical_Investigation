The dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling miniature tornadoes against the backdrop of endless blue sky.  Caleb "Cal" McKinley squinted through the grime coating his goggles, watching the shifting patterns with a detached amusement. He'd seen enough sunsets and dust storms in his thirty years to last a lifetime. Still, there was something strangely captivating about the way the wind sculpted ephemeral art on the desolate landscape.

Cal adjusted his grip on the controls of the massive Caterpillar excavator he called "Big Bertha".  His calloused hands moved with practiced ease, coaxing the machine to life with a guttural roar that echoed across the barren expanse. The sun beat down on the steel behemoth, turning its yellow paint into molten gold.

He was tasked with clearing an area for a new pipeline, carving a path through the unforgiving heartland of West Texas. A monotonous job, sure, but it paid the bills and kept him away from the ghosts that haunted his past. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Bertha's hydraulics was a steady beat in the silence, a counterpoint to the lonely whispers of the wind.
