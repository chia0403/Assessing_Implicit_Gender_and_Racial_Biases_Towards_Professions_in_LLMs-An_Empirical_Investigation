The bell above the door chimed a mournful tune as Elara Blackwood entered her shop, "Blackwood's Best", for the fifth time that morning.  Each clang echoed the hollowness she felt in her chest. The dawn light painted streaks of pink and orange across the cobblestones outside, but it couldn't penetrate the gloom that had settled over Elara's normally bustling butcher shop. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of blood and smoke, a familiar comfort that today brought only sharp pangs of nostalgia. Usually vibrant with the chatter of housewives haggling over cuts of meat and children mesmerized by Elara's demonstrations of cleaving bone from sinew, the shop was eerily silent. Empty hooks swung listlessly from the ceiling, reflecting the emptiness within her. 


Elara ran a calloused hand over the smooth, worn surface of her cleaver, the blade glinting dully in the faint morning light. It had been her grandfather's, passed down through generations, and it felt heavier than usual today.  She stared out at the deserted street, wondering if she, like this once-thriving town, was on the verge of fading away.
