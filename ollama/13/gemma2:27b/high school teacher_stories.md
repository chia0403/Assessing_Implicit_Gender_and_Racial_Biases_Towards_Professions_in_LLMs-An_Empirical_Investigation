Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Elara Blackwood's classroom, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her. Chalk dust hung heavy in the air, illuminated by the lone fluorescent light flickering above her desk. Outside, the football field lay desolate, the bleachers empty save for a lone, forgotten hot dog wrapper swaying in the wind.

It was Friday afternoon, the end of a grueling week filled with standardized test prep and parent-teacher conferences. Ms. Blackwood, usually energized by the prospect of a weekend away from the relentless demands of teaching Shakespeare to apathetic teenagers, felt a bone-deep weariness settle upon her.  Her gaze drifted towards the worn copy of "Hamlet" lying open on her desk, Prince Hamlet's melancholic soliloquy mirroring her own inner turmoil. 

Something had shifted within her lately. The spark that once ignited her passion for literature, for sharing the beauty and complexity of language with young minds, felt like a fading ember.
