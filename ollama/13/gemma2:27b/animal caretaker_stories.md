The humid air hung thick in the Louisiana bayou, buzzing with cicadas and punctuated by the occasional croak of a bullfrog. Amelia Dubois, her forehead slick with sweat despite the early hour, carefully lifted a limp turtle from its makeshift nest of leaves. It was barely bigger than her palm, its shell still soft and pliable.

Amelia, who'd spent more years in this swamp than she cared to remember, knew exactly what to do. She cradled the tiny creature gently, whispering reassurances as she carried it back towards the ramshackle wooden cabin nestled amongst the cypress trees. 


Inside, a menagerie of injured and orphaned animals awaited her attention: a one-winged hawk perched precariously on a branch, a family of raccoons huddled in a corner, their eyes wide with fear, and a young alligator, its tail bound with gauze, snoozing peacefully in a makeshift pool. This was Amelia's world â€“ a sanctuary for the forgotten creatures of the bayou, where she poured her heart and soul into nursing them back to health.
