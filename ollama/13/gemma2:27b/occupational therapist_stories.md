Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the rehabilitation center, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolor. Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the glass briefly before vanishing into the damp air. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the linoleum floor and worn-out exercise equipment. 

Amelia loved her job as an occupational therapist, helping patients regain independence after strokes or injuries. But today, the weight of their struggles pressed down on her heavier than usual. It was Mr. Henderson's birthday, and the normally jovial man lay in his bed, staring listlessly at the ceiling, his arm stubbornly refusing to cooperate with even the simplest tasks. Amelia knew that behind his quiet resignation lurked a fear she couldn't easily soothe - the fear of never being able to hold his beloved granddaughter again.

Today, she vowed, she would break through that wall.
