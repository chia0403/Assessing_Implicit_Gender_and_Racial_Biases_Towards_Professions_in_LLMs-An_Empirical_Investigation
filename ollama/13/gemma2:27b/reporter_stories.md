The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and stale beignets. Cicadas thrummed their relentless song from the overgrown magnolia trees lining Bourbon Street, competing with the distant wail of a saxophone and the raucous laughter spilling from overflowing bars.  Eleanor "Ellie" Marchand wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead as she surveyed the scene, her notepad clutched tightly in one hand, her battered Olympus camera dangling from its strap.

She wasn't here for the revelry, though. Ellie was chasing a story, a whisper that had snaked its way through the city's tangled underbelly â€“ a tale of voodoo rituals gone wrong, of ancient curses awakened, and a series of unexplained deaths plaguing the French Quarter.
