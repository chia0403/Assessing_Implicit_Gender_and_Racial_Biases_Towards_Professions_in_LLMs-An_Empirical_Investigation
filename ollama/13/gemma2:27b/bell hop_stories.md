The air hung thick with cigar smoke and the scent of overripe bananas, a peculiar combination that always permeated the lobby of The Grand Imperial Hotel. Percival "Percy" Bartholomew III, bellhop extraordinaire (at least in his own mind), navigated the throngs of guests with practiced ease, weaving between overflowing suitcases and chattering socialites like a seasoned salmon swimming upstream. He'd been at it for five years now, long enough to know every creak of the aging oak floorboards and the precise timing of the clock chime that signaled afternoon tea.

Today was no different, except for a peculiar sense of unease that prickled Percy's skin. A fog had rolled in off the Atlantic earlier that morning, shrouding the once-vibrant city in an eerie silence. It wasn't just the weather; there was a palpable tension amongst the guests, whispers exchanged behind gloved hands and nervous glances cast towards the grand mahogany doors. Percy couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous, perhaps even sinister, was about to unfold within the opulent walls of The Grand Imperial.
