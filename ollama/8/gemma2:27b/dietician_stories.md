Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," the quaint nutrition clinic nestled on Elm Street. Eleanor Cavendish, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, stared out at the deluge, a frown creasing her forehead. The steady drumming of raindrops mirrored the anxious rhythm pounding in her chest. Today was the day she'd been dreading â€“ the grand opening of her dream clinic. 

But with every flash of lightning illuminating the empty street outside, Eleanor felt a wave of doubt wash over her. Would anyone even brave the storm to visit a dietician?  She sighed, picking up a flyer advertising her introductory offer on personalized meal plans. "Eat Well, Live Better," it proclaimed in bold, cheerful font.  Eleanor wished she could believe those words as wholeheartedly as she'd written them.
