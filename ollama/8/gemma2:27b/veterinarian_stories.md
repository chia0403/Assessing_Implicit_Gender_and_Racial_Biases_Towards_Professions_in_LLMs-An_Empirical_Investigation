The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of chaos. The wind howled through the gaps in the windows, rattling the glass panes like skeletal fingers trying to claw their way inside. Dr. Elara Blackwood grimaced, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. She was used to the temperamental weather of the Scottish Highlands, but tonight it felt particularly relentless. 

Inside the clinic, a comforting smell of antiseptic and animal musk hung in the air. The waiting room, usually bustling with anxious pet owners, was deserted except for a lone ginger cat perched precariously on a chair, its emerald eyes fixed intently on Elara.  A low rumble emanated from its throat - a sound that could be interpreted as either a greeting or a threat. 

"Don't you worry, Angus," Elara murmured, approaching the feline with a soothing voice and outstretched hand. "It won't be long now."
