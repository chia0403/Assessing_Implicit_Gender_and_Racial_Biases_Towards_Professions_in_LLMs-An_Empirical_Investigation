Rain lashed against the windshield of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's Kenworth T680, blurring the neon signs of the deserted truck stop into streaks of color. The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and greasy fries, a familiar comfort in Bart's world. He squinted at the flashing red sign above: "Rusty's Roadhouse – Open 24 Hours."  Bart sighed, his stomach rumbling in protest against the stale bag of chips he’d been munching on for the past three hours.

He pulled into a vacant spot, the groan of his rig echoing through the empty lot. It had been a brutal day – endless miles of rain-slicked highway, impatient drivers, and a blown tire that had cost him precious time. He just wanted a hot meal, a strong cup of coffee, and maybe a slice of Rusty's infamous pecan pie. 

But something felt off. The usual hum of activity at the truck stop was absent. Even the fluorescent lights seemed dimmer than usual. As Bart climbed out of his cab, he noticed that every other truck in the lot was parked with their engines off, doors locked tight. An unsettling silence settled over him.  

"Hello?" Bart called out tentatively, his voice swallowed by the rain. There was no answer, only the rhythmic drumming on the roof of Rusty's Roadhouse. Something wasn't right.
