Rain lashed against the cockpit window, blurring the already hazy lights of the city below. Amelia "Amy" Moreau gripped the yoke tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The Cessna 172 bucked and swayed in the turbulent air, each gust threatening to rip it from its precarious perch above the storm clouds. Amy squinted at the instruments, trying to ignore the gnawing unease in her stomach. This was not how she'd envisioned her first solo flight after earning her pilot's license.

She was supposed to be soaring above the sun-drenched Arizona desert, enjoying the freedom of the open sky. Instead, she was trapped in a meteorological cage, fighting for control against the whims of Mother Nature. The radio crackled with static, making communication impossible. Amy was alone, relying solely on her training and instincts to navigate through this treacherous storm.
