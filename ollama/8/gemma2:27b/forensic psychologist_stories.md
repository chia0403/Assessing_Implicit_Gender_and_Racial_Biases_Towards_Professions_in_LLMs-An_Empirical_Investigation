Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the steel table where her subject sat, hands clasped tightly together, eyes fixed on a point just beyond the wall. This wasn't some petty thief or drug dealer; this was Alexander Thorne, a man accused of brutally murdering his wife and daughter.

The stench of stale coffee lingered in the air, a grim testament to the countless hours spent within these walls. Evelyn adjusted her glasses, her mind already sifting through the files she'd meticulously studied: witness testimonies riddled with contradictions, forensic evidence pointing towards premeditation, and Thorne's unsettlingly calm demeanor during their initial interview.

He was an enigma wrapped in a tailored suit, his sculpted features betraying no hint of remorse or guilt. Evelyn had a reputation for cracking even the toughest cases, for peeling back the layers of deception to reveal the truth hidden beneath. But with Alexander Thorne, she felt an unsettling disquiet, a sense that this case was unlike any she'd ever faced before.
