The pungent scent of lemon polish mingled with the faint sweetness of decaying roses, a fragrance unique to the Blackwood Manor. Elara Thistlewick, her grey braid bouncing against the starched white apron, meticulously scrubbed the marble floor in the grand foyer. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting forgotten battles, painted shifting patterns on the dusty wood paneling. A grandfather clock, its ornate pendulum swinging with a melancholic rhythm, chimed thrice, marking three o'clock. Elara paused her scrubbing, listening intently for any sound from the upper floors. Silence reigned, broken only by the distant rasp of wind against the ivy-choked walls.

The Blackwood Manor was a mausoleum of memories, its vast halls echoing with the ghosts of a long-gone era. Elara, who had been the housekeeper for over twenty years, knew every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind through the ancient chimneys. Yet, today, a strange unease settled upon her, a feeling as tangible as the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams. 

Something was amiss.
