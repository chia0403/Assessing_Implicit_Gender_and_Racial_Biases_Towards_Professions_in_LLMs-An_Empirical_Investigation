The rooster's crow was abruptly cut short by a clap of thunder so loud it rattled the windowpanes in Elara Blackwood's farmhouse kitchen.  She sighed, pushing aside the half-filled cup of lukewarm tea she'd been nursing for the past hour. A storm brewing on the horizon wasn't exactly what she needed today.

Her calloused hands tightened around the worn wooden handle of her father's plowshare, a family heirloom that hung above the fireplace. It was a reminder of simpler times, before the rains had become erratic and the harvests meager. Before whispers of "leaving the land" began to circulate in their small village nestled in the shadow of Mount Cinder.

Elara glanced out the window at her fields, stretching green and gold under a rapidly darkening sky. This year's barley crop, already struggling from a late frost, needed another week of sun before it was ready for harvest. The rumbling thunder seemed to mock her hopes, each boom echoing the uncertainty gnawing at her heart.

She knew she couldn't afford another failed season.  Her family relied on her now - her aging mother, frail and plagued by coughing fits that worsened with every damp chill, and young Thomas, her nephew whose bright eyes were clouded with worry whenever he saw the furrowed brows of his elders. 


Elara took a deep breath, steeling herself against the encroaching storm both outside and within.  She wouldn't be defeated. Not yet. There was work to be done, barley stalks to be tended, even if it meant facing the tempest head-on.
