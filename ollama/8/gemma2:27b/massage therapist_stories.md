Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Now," blurring the neon "Open" sign into a shimmering smear.  Eleanor Vance sighed, watching the droplets race down the glass. Business was always slow on Tuesdays, but this torrential downpour felt like it was actively discouraging customers.

She was looking forward to a quiet evening at home with a good book and a steaming cup of chamomile tea.

Suddenly, the chime above the door tinkled, startling Eleanor. A figure, shrouded in a dripping trench coat, hesitantly stepped inside, bringing with them a gust of cold air and the faint scent of ozone.
