Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Emergency Room, blurring the city lights into shimmering streaks. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic and the low murmur of worried voices. Eleanor Grace Montgomery, RN, her blonde braid whipping across her shoulder as she moved, navigated the controlled chaos with practiced ease. A gurney carrying a young man with a fractured leg zipped past, followed by a frantic mother cradling a whimpering child.

Eleanor paused at the triage desk, scanning the board overflowing with names and ailments. Tonight was shaping up to be another relentless surge. Her stomach clenched; she hadn't had a break longer than five minutes in hours. Still, she pushed aside the exhaustion, focusing on the faces before her: the weary eyes of a grandmother clutching a hand, the pale face of a teenager doubled over with pain. This was why she did what she did. These people needed her, and she wouldn't let them down.
