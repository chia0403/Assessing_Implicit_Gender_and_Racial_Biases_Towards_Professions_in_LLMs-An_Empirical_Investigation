Rain lashed against the glass storefront, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips, lilies and roses that bloomed in perfect defiance within. Emilia Rose Thornton sighed, her breath fogging the already steamed pane. The bell above the door tinkled mournfully as she pushed it open wider, letting in a gust of wind and spray that instantly soaked the welcome mat.

"Another dreary day," Emilia murmured to Mr. Whiskers, a ginger tabby who perched regally on a stack of burlap sacks by the counter. He blinked slowly, unimpressed, then resumed grooming his already immaculate fur.

Emilia’s little flower shop, "Bloom & Bark", nestled between a dusty antique store and a bustling bakery in the heart of quaint Willow Creek. While charming and full of character, the town was struggling – businesses closing one by one, replaced by empty storefronts like boarded-up eyes staring vacantly onto the cobblestone street. Emilia hoped her shop wouldn’t be next.
