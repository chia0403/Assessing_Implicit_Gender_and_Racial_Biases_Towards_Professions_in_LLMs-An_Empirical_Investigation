Smoke and ash swirled around Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's boots, stinging her eyes despite the thick visor of her helmet. The air thrummed with the roar of flames consuming the third floor apartment, punctuated by the sharp crackle of breaking timbers. Acrid, chemical-laced smoke filled her lungs, making each breath a labored struggle. Amy braced herself against the howling wind that whipped through the shattered windows, the heat from the inferno licking at her exposed skin. This wasn't her first rodeo - she'd faced down countless blazes in her five years with the San Francisco Fire Department - but this one felt different.  A cold dread snaked its way up her spine as a strangled scream pierced through the chaos.

The building, a dilapidated Victorian on Lombard Street, was notorious for its labyrinthine layout and questionable wiring. A fire here meant potential casualties. Amy knew they had to find the source of that scream before it was too late.
