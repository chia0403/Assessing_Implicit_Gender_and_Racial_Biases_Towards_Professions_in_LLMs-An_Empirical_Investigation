Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. The siren wailed its mournful song, slicing through the heavy air thick with the scent of wet asphalt and ozone. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Chen fought to keep her stomach from churning.

The call had been terse: "Possible cardiac arrest, 123 Elm Street." Simple enough, but Amy knew that beneath the clinical description lurked a storm of unknowns. Was it a young athlete collapsing mid-game? An elderly grandmother succumbing to illness? A stranger snatched away by fate's cruel hand?

Her partner, Mark, a grizzled veteran with a reassuringly steady presence, checked the defibrillator. "Ready when you are, Amy," he said, his voice calm amidst the cacophony. 

Amy took a deep breath, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. Elm Street was just a few blocks away. Every second counted.  This wasn't just another call; it was someone's life hanging in the balance. And tonight, she was determined to be the lifeline they needed.
