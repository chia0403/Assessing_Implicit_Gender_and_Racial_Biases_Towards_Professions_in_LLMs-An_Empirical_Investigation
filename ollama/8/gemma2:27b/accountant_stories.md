The flickering fluorescent light above Elspeth Winthropâ€™s desk buzzed like a disgruntled bee, mirroring the uneasy feeling in her stomach. Spreadsheets filled with numbers danced before her eyes, each column a testament to the financial woes plaguing "The Gilded Swan," the once-renowned cabaret she was tasked with auditing.  

Elspeth, a woman whose life revolved around the precise order of debits and credits, found herself utterly out of her element in this opulent, decaying space. The velvet curtains were threadbare, the chandeliers dimmed with dust, and the faint scent of stale perfume hung in the air like a ghost from a bygone era.

Elspeth prided herself on her sharp analytical mind, but even she struggled to decipher the tangled web of expenses and unexplained payments woven into The Gilded Swan's financial history.
