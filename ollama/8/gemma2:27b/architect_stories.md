The acrid scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the dust kicked up by construction cranes tearing at the skeletal remains of what was once the Grand Zenith Hotel. Alistair Finch, his tweed jacket askew and tie loosened, surveyed the scene through narrowed eyes. A gust of wind whipped strands of gray hair across his forehead, reminding him that even the most meticulously designed structures eventually succumbed to time and neglect.

This wasn't just any demolition; it was a personal reckoning for Alistair. He'd been the lead architect on the Grand Zenith project three decades ago, a monument to his youthful ambition and audacious vision. Now, he stood witness to its unceremonious demise, a stark reminder of both his past triumphs and the relentless march of progress.
