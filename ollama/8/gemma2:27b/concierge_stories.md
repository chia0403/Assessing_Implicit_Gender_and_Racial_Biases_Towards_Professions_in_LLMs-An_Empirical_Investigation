The air hung thick with jasmine and diesel fumes, a peculiar blend that was uniquely Paris.  Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Hôtel Beaumont, blurring the Eiffel Tower in the distance into a shimmering, skeletal silhouette.  Inside, the lobby glowed with warm amber light, reflecting off polished marble floors and ornate chandeliers.

Henrietta Dubois-Chaumont adjusted her crisp white gloves, smoothing down the front of her tailored navy uniform.  As head concierge of the Hôtel Beaumont, she was the embodiment of Parisian grace and discretion.

For over twenty years, Henrietta had navigated the labyrinthine world of high society, catering to the whims and fancies of diplomats, celebrities, and the impossibly wealthy. She knew every secret nook and cranny of Paris, from hidden Michelin-starred restaurants to exclusive boutiques tucked away on cobblestone streets.

But tonight was different.  A tension crackled in the air, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of her world. A new guest had arrived – one shrouded in mystery, whose request promised to unravel Henrietta’s carefully constructed life.
