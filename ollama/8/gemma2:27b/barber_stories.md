The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' barbershop hung thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the dusty streets of Redemption, Arizona, a town clinging to life by a threadbare tapestry of memories and faded glory. Bart stood behind his worn leather barber chair, meticulously sharpening his straight razor on a strop, its rhythmic swish-swish a counterpoint to the lazy creak of the ceiling fan overhead. The only other sound was the faint tinkling of the saloon piano across the street, a mournful melody that mirrored the town's own melancholic state.

Bart sighed, running a calloused hand through his thinning gray hair. Business had been slow lately â€“ slower than a turtle in molasses. Redemption wasn't exactly teeming with customers these days, what with the mines drying up and folks packing their dreams and heading west.
