The air in "Chez Maurice," usually thick with the aroma of garlic bread and simmering bouillabaisse, was tonight choked with tension.  Eleanor Price, balancing a tray laden with overflowing plates of escargot, navigated the bustling dining room with practiced ease. Each step was calculated, her smile unwavering even as she dodged elbows and overheard snippets of heated conversation. 

Chez Maurice had always been a haven for romance, its candlelit tables whispering tales of stolen glances and whispered confessions. Tonight, however, love seemed to have soured into something acrimonious. Eleanor could feel it in the air, sharp as the scent of lemon in her signature vinaigrette.  A group of businessmen argued loudly at table six, their voices competing with the tinkling piano music. A young couple sat frozen mid-argument, their unfinished plates a monument to shattered affections.

Eleanor sighed inwardly. She craved the simple joy of serving a satisfied customer, the warmth of a genuine "thank you" echoing across the room. But tonight felt different, as if the very walls were holding their breath, anticipating some unseen storm.
