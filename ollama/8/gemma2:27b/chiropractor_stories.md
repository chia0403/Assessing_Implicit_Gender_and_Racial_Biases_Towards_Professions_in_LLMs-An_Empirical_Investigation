Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's practice, mimicking the relentless pounding in her temples. Her normally serene office, filled with calming sage green walls and the gentle scent of lavender, felt oppressive today. The storm seemed to have seeped into her very bones, amplifying the already gnawing anxiety she'd been carrying since receiving the cryptic voicemail earlier that morning.

"Eleanor," a gravelly voice had rasped, "We need to talk. About your father. Meet me at the usual place, noon sharp."

The message had ended abruptly, leaving Eleanor with more questions than answers. The "usual place" could only mean The Rusty Anchor, a dingy waterfront bar her father, a retired private investigator, frequented.  He'd been gone for months, supposedly on a case in some remote corner of the world. But something about the voicemail, the urgency in the speaker's voice, told Eleanor this wasn't just another routine assignment for her dad.

Fear, cold and clammy, tightened its grip around her heart. She forced herself to take a deep breath, remembering the calming techniques she taught her patients. Adjusting spines was one thing; unraveling the mystery surrounding her father's disappearance felt like an entirely different beast.
