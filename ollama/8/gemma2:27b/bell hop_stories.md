The brass revolving door groaned like an old man complaining about the heat as Elroy Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins III wrestled with a behemoth steamer trunk. It wobbled precariously on its wheels, threatening to spill forth its contents – a jumble of silk scarves and moth-eaten fur coats judging by the faint whiff that wafted up. Bart gritted his teeth and heaved, the worn leather digging into his palms.  

He was supposed to be at the elevator bank already, but Mrs. Van Der Snoot, with her endless parade of luggage and chihuahua in a rhinestone-studded carrier, had insisted on a detailed itinerary of every single hotel amenity before even stepping inside. The opulent lobby of The Grand Majestic Hotel glittered around him: polished marble floors reflecting the glittering chandeliers overhead, plush velvet chairs occupied by languid guests sipping tea from delicate china cups, and a symphony of whispered conversations punctuated by the occasional tinkling laughter.  

Yet Bart barely noticed. All he could see was that goddamn trunk threatening to tip over and bury him in moth-eaten luxury.  This wasn't how he envisioned spending his summer break before starting college. He'd pictured beaches, bonfires, maybe even a chance encounter with someone who didn't pronounce "hotel" as "hoh-tell." Instead, he was stuck here, battling behemoth luggage and the whims of entitled guests for a measly $3.50 an hour.

Bart finally wrestled the trunk onto its side, letting out a sigh of relief that echoed through the hushed lobby.  Just another day in paradise, he thought grimly, wiping sweat from his brow.
