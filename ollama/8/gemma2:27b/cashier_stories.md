The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Ainsworth's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of "Bargain Bites," the discount grocery store where she'd been employed for the past three years. A symphony of beeps echoed through the air as Beatrice scanned item after item, her practiced hand moving with robotic efficiency. A crumpled bag of bruised apples, a dented can of creamed corn, a half-empty box of expired crackers â€“ these were the treasures of Bargain Bites, where even the most discerning bargain hunter could find something to pique their interest (or perhaps pity). 


Beatrice sighed, her breath fogging up the scratched plexiglass partition separating her from the weary parade of customers. She longed for something more, something beyond the endless cycle of scanning, bagging, and making change. Today, a particularly persistent feeling of restlessness gnawed at her. Perhaps it was the incessant rain drumming against the store windows, blurring the already bleak cityscape outside. Or maybe it was the faded poster advertising "Bargain Bites' 5th Anniversary Celebration" that hung lopsidedly above the dairy aisle, a mocking reminder of Beatrice's own stagnation.  Whatever the cause, Beatrice knew deep down that she needed a change.
