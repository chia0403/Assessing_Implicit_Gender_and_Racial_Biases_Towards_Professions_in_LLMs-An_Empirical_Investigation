The scent of aged paper and leather was Eleanor Winthrop's comfort, her haven. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, illuminating shelves that groaned under the weight of centuries. Eleanor, with her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose and a dusting of flour on her cardigan (a souvenir from her disastrous attempt at baking scones), ran a calloused finger along the spines of first editions, murmuring their titles like forgotten prayers.  

Outside, a storm brewed, mirroring the tempestuous emotions Eleanor felt brewing within. Today was the day. The day the library board would vote on whether to modernize Oakhaven â€“ a decision that threatened to rip away its very soul.
