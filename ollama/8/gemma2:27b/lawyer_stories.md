Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon cityscape outside into a watercolour smear of red and blue. Inside the cramped office, Penelope Ainsworth chewed on the end of her pen, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her weary face. Papers overflowed from her desk, threatening to engulf the flickering lamp in their midst. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

Penelope was a lawyer, though "lawyer" felt like a grandiose title for someone who spent most days wading through mountains of paperwork, fighting tooth and nail for scraps thrown by the legal system. Tonight's case was no different: a young single mother facing eviction, her meagre savings already depleted by medical bills. Penelope knew she had slim chances of winning, but the woman's haunted eyes haunted Penelope herself, reminding her why she chose this path in the first place - to be a voice for those who couldn't speak for themselves.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door jolted Penelope from her thoughts. She straightened, smoothing down her rumpled blouse before calling out, "Come in!" The door creaked open, revealing a silhouette backlit by the hallway light.
