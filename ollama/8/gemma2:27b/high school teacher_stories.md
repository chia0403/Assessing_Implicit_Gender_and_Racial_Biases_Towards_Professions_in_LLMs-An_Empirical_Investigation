Rain lashed against the classroom windows, blurring the autumn leaves swirling outside into impressionistic streaks of red and gold.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Ms. Eleanor Cartwrightâ€™s meticulously organized desk: stacks of graded papers aligned by subject, pens sorted by color in a ceramic mug, and a single wilting sunflower facing the window as if yearning for the sun. A sigh escaped her lips, fogging the glass momentarily before she swiped it away with the back of her hand.

Eleanor was a veteran English teacher at Northwood High School, known for her sharp wit, love of classic literature, and unwavering dedication to her students. Yet, today, a sense of unease gnawed at her. It wasn't just the dreary weather; something felt amiss, a subtle dissonance humming beneath the surface of her usual routine. 

The bell signaling the start of third period rang, jolting her from her contemplation. As the teenagers shuffled into the classroom, chattering and throwing backpacks onto empty desks, Eleanor plastered on her usual welcoming smile. But deep down, she couldn't shake the feeling that this ordinary Wednesday was about to become anything but.
