The neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign buzzed incessantly, casting an eerie green light across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Cortez's rain-slicked trench coat. The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and cheap cigarettes, mingling with the ever-present tang of saltwater from the nearby harbour.  

The diner booth creaked under Izzy's weight as she stared out at the deserted street.  Rain lashed against the greasy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs and flickering streetlamps. The rhythmic clatter of the diner's cutlery on plates provided a lonely soundtrack to her thoughts. Tonight, the city felt more like a ghost town than a bustling metropolis. 

Izzy tapped her pen impatiently against the worn table, her eyes fixed on the blurry outline of a derelict warehouse across the street. That was where they'd found him – Daniel Flores, slumped against a rusted oil drum, his life snuffed out before it had even begun. A single gunshot wound to the chest. No witnesses. No leads. Just another statistic in the city’s never-ending list of unsolved crimes.
