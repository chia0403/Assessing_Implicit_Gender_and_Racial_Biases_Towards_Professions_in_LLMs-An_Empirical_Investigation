Amelia smiled, carefully peeling it off and smoothing out the wrinkles. Kindergarten was rarely boring, though sometimes it was definitely sticky.

The morning sun streamed through the large windows of Mrs. Thistlewick's classroom, illuminating the colorful alphabet chart hanging above the whiteboard.  Tiny chairs, each adorned with a hand-painted animal face, sat in neat rows facing a well-worn rug patterned with numbers and shapes.  Outside, the playground buzzed with the joyful chaos of recess. But inside, Amelia Thistlewick was preparing for a different kind of adventure - one involving twenty five-year-olds, glitter glue, and a rogue hamster named Professor Squeaks.
