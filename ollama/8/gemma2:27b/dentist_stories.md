The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Winthrop, casting an almost otherworldly glow on the stainless steel instruments laid out before her. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her tiny dental practice in Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled between rolling hills and the brooding expanse of Blackwood Forest. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose panes and sending shivers down Eleanor's spine. It was nights like these that she felt the isolation most acutely, the silence broken only by the rhythmic tick of the antique clock on the wall and the occasional creak of her aging office chair. 


Eleanor sighed, tracing a fingertip along the edge of her scalpel. Oakhaven wasn’t exactly overflowing with dental emergencies, especially on stormy nights like this.  She longed for the bustle of her previous practice in the city, for the camaraderie of colleagues and the constant stream of patients. But her heart yearned for something quieter, closer to nature, a place where she could escape the relentless pace of urban life. So, she’d traded her high-rise office for this quaint Victorian building overlooking the town square, hoping to find peace amidst the rolling hills and whispering pines.
