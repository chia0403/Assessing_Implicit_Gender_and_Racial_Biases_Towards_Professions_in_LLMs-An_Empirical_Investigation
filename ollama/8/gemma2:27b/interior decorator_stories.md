The humid Charleston air clung to Eliza Marie Beaumont like a second skin as she surveyed the cluttered living room. Sunbeams sliced through dusty windows, illuminating layers of faded floral upholstery, mismatched knick-knacks, and a threadbare Persian rug that looked older than time itself.  Eliza sighed, adjusting her oversized sunglasses. This wasn't exactly the grand antebellum mansion she'd envisioned gracing the cover of "Southern Living" magazine when she left design school in Savannah. 

Still, there was undeniable charm hidden beneath the clutter. The original heart pine floors gleamed faintly, and a delicate plaster medallion adorned the high ceiling. Eliza could already picture crisp white walls, pops of turquoise and coral against antique brass accents, and sunlight streaming through sheer linen curtains. This house just needed someone to see its potential.


That someone was going to be her.
