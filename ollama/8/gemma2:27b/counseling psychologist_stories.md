Rain lashed against the bay windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest raging inside her own heart. The scent of bergamot from her diffuser did little to soothe the anxiety knotting in her stomach.  Her latest client, Liam Blackwood, was due any minute, and this session promised to be unlike any she'd encountered before.

Liam was a renowned sculptor, his work lauded for its raw emotion and visceral impact. But behind the public façade of artistic genius lurked a crippling fear of creation - a debilitating block that threatened to extinguish the flame of his passion. Eleanor had been studying Liam's case for weeks, poring over art critiques, biographical snippets, and even analyzing photographs of his studio, searching for clues to unlock the mystery within him.  

The antique grandfather clock in the corner chimed twice, marking 3:00 pm sharp. Eleanor straightened her cardigan, a nervous habit she'd been trying to break for years. She glanced at the framed diploma on her wall – a constant reminder of her vow to help others navigate the labyrinthine paths of the human psyche. Today, she felt the weight of that promise more acutely than ever.

A sharp rap on the door startled her. Liam Blackwood was here.
