The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's neck as he squinted across the parched expanse. Dust devils danced in the distance, kicking up swirling red plumes against the relentless blue sky. The wind, hot and dry, whistled through the skeletal branches of the lone cottonwood by the rusted windmill, its mournful song a familiar dirge on Blackwood Ranch.

Silas, his weathered face etched with lines as deep as the canyons that scarred the land, adjusted the brim of his Stetson. Sixty years he'd spent wrestling this unforgiving earth into submission, coaxing life from the arid soil. But this year was different. The drought had lingered longer than any Silas could recall, turning the once-lush pastures into a brittle, brown wasteland. His cattle, their ribs stark beneath dusty hides, mooed listlessly, their voices a constant reminder of the struggle ahead.
