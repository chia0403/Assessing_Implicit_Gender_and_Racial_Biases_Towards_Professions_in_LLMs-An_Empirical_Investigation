The insistent buzz of Celeste Moreau’s phone shattered the quiet concentration that had settled over her studio. Grumbling, she pushed away the intricate web of lines and shapes blooming on her Cintiq tablet – an almost finished logo design for a new artisanal bakery.  Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of her converted loft, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the vintage Eames chairs scattered around the room. Outside, the familiar cacophony of Brooklyn buzzed – car horns, sirens, distant laughter. But Celeste was lost in a world of pixels and color palettes, until that jarring reminder of the real world demanded her attention. 

She snatched up the phone, squinting at the caller ID. It was Amelia, her best friend and partner-in-crime since kindergarten. A knot of apprehension tightened in Celeste's chest – Amelia rarely called during work hours unless it was an emergency.
