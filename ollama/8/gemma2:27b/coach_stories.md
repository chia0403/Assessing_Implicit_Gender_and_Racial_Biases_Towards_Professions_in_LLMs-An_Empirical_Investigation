Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Coach Theodore "Teddy" Callahan's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Teddy ran a hand through his thinning hair, the fluorescent lights reflecting off the sweat gathering on his brow. Outside, the dilapidated bleachers of St. Cecilia's High School groaned under the weight of another losing season. It had been five years since they'd seen a victory, five years since hope flickered in these tired eyes. 

Teddy stared at the worn-out playbook lying open on his desk, its pages filled with plays that seemed to mock him now. He knew he needed something different, something radical, if he was going to save his team, his career, and maybe even a sliver of his own self-respect.  But what?

A sudden knock startled him. It was Daniella, the school secretary, her face etched with concern. "Coach Callahan," she said, her voice barely audible above the rain, "There's someone here to see you."
