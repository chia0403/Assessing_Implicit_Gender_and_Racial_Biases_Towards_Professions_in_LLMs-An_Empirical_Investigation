The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and browning garlic. Outside, a relentless August sun beat down on the dusty market square, baking the cobblestones until they shimmered. But within the cool embrace of La Petite Cuisine, time moved differently. Elodie Marchand, her forehead beaded with sweat despite the chill emanating from the ancient stone walls, deftly tossed a panful of sliced mushrooms in butter. 

Elodie was renowned throughout Aix-en-Provence for her culinary artistry. Her dishes weren't merely meals; they were symphonies of flavor, each ingredient carefully selected and coaxed to its fullest potential. Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. A famed food critic, known for his scathing reviews and acerbic wit, was rumored to be dining at La Petite Cuisine that very evening.
