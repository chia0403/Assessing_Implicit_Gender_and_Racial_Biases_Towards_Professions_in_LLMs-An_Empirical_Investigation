The air hung thick with the smell of hairspray and anticipation in "Curl Up & Dye," Beatrice "Bea" Fontaine's salon tucked away on a quiet side street in New Orleans. Sunlight streamed through the dusty bay windows, illuminating motes of glitter that danced in the air like miniature fireworks. Outside, the rhythmic pulse of jazz music drifted from a nearby cafe, blending with the steady snip-snip of Bea's scissors and the cheerful banter of her regulars.

Bea, a woman whose vivacious personality was as bright as her crimson lipstick, paused mid-cut, tilting her head to listen to Mrs. Dubois recounting the latest drama unfolding in her bridge club. A mischievous twinkle danced in Bea's hazel eyes. She loved being the confidante for her clients, their joys and sorrows woven into the fabric of her days like threads in a tapestry. Today, however, something felt different. A peculiar energy crackled in the air, a sense of foreboding that sent shivers down her spine.
