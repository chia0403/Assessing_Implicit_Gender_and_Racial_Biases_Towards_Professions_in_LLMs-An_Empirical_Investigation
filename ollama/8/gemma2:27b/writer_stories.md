The rain hammered against the attic window, mimicking the insistent drumming in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head.  She stared at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen, the mocking white glow reflecting in her dark, tired eyes. Five hours sheâ€™d been staring at this blank page, willing words to appear, but they remained stubbornly elusive.

Amelia was a writer, or at least she aspired to be one. Her tiny attic room overlooking the cobbled streets of Edinburgh's Old Town was supposed to be her sanctuary, a place where inspiration flowed freely and stories bloomed like heather on the Scottish hills. Instead, it felt more like a prison cell tonight, the dampness seeping into her bones and suffocating her creativity.

The manuscript for her historical novel lay open on the desk beside her, its pages filled with half-written chapters and abandoned plotlines.  She'd envisioned a sweeping tale of forbidden love set against the backdrop of 18th century Scotland, but the story felt flat, lifeless. Amelia sighed, pushing away from her desk and padding over to the window. The rain had intensified, blurring the lights of the city below into an impressionistic watercolour.

Perhaps a change of scenery was what she needed.  Amelia pulled on her raincoat and boots, grabbing her notebook and a battered copy of Robert Burns' poetry for inspiration. Stepping out into the storm-lashed night, she hoped that Edinburgh's ancient streets held the key to unlocking her writer's block.
