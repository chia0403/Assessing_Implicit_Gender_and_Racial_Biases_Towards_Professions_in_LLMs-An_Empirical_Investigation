The dust clung to Elias Hawthorne like a second skin, coating his beard and the lines etched deep around his eyes. He squinted at the block of granite before him, its rough surface mirroring the craggy landscape beyond his workshop window. The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut stone and the rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel filled the cavernous space. Outside, the sun beat down on the bustling marketplace of Alora, a city carved into the heart of the Sunstone Mountains. But Elias barely noticed. His world was contained within these four walls, where rough stones transformed under his calloused hands into elegant sculptures and sturdy pillars. Today, however, his mind wasn't on the intricate floral motif he was tasked with carving. A summons had arrived that morning, a crisp scroll bearing the royal seal – a request for Elias Hawthorne, master stone cutter, to meet with the King himself.

Had he somehow caught the King’s eye with that humble creation? Or was there something else, something more urgent at play? Elias hesitated, chisel poised mid-air, his heart pounding against his ribs like a blacksmith's hammer.
