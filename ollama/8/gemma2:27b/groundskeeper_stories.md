The rusted swing set groaned under the weight of a fat pigeon, its coo echoing through the stillness of the overgrown rose garden. Elias Thorne, his calloused hands clutching a pair of shears, paused in his trimming to listen. It was a familiar sound, one he'd grown accustomed to during his fifteen years tending the grounds of Blackwood Manor.

Blackwood Manor stood brooding on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, its once majestic facade now cracked and moss-covered. The gardens, once renowned for their vibrant blooms and intricate topiary, had fallen into disrepair, mirroring the decline of the manor itself. Yet Elias saw beauty in the wildness, in the tenacious creepers reclaiming stone pathways and the sun dappling through ancient oak leaves. He was a caretaker, not just of plants but of memories, preserving the whisperings of a bygone era.
