The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he shimmied along the narrow ridge of the Victorian mansion. Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakhaven stretched out like a meticulously stitched tapestry, dotted with the occasional dog walker and oblivious child kicking a soccer ball. Eli ignored them all. His focus was solely on the loose slate tile perched precariously at his feet. One misstep, one misplaced hammer blow, and it could send him plummeting down onto that very lawn â€“ not exactly conducive to keeping a steady job.

Eli gripped the slate tighter, adrenaline momentarily spiking in his veins. This wasn't fear, he told himself, it was respect. Respect for the heights, respect for the precarious nature of his work, and respect for the aging bones of this grand old house that groaned beneath him like a weary giant.
