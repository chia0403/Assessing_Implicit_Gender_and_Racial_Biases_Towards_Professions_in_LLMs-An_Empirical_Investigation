The scent of turpentine and linseed oil hung heavy in Amelia "Em" Blackwood's cramped studio, a scent as familiar to her as her own heartbeat. Outside, the Parisian sky was bleeding into hues of apricot and lavender as dusk descended, but Em barely registered the spectacle. Her gaze was locked on the canvas before her â€“ a still life of wilting lilies, their petals drooping like weary dancers.

The lilies were meant to be a celebration of beauty fading gracefully, but they felt lifeless under Em's brush. She sighed, stepping back to assess the work from a distance. The lilies looked more like casualties than anything else, their pale colours muted and dull. Frustration gnawed at her. It had been weeks since inspiration last graced her easel, leaving behind a wasteland of unfinished canvases and a mounting sense of despair.

Em needed a change, something to jolt her creative spirit awake. Paris, the city of lights and artistic revolution, felt suffocatingly stagnant. Perhaps it was time for a new landscape, a fresh perspective. The thought took root in her mind, blossoming with the promise of rediscovery.
