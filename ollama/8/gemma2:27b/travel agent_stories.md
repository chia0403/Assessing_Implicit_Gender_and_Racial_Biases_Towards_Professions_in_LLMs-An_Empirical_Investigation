The air conditioner wheezed its last breath just as Emilia Rosalie Bellwether, renowned travel agent extraordinaire, stepped into her office. The sweltering August air in Savannah instantly turned her crisp linen blouse into a sweaty second skin. “Fantastic,” she muttered, fanning herself with a brochure advertising the breathtaking glaciers of Iceland.

Emilia’s office, nestled above a dusty antique shop on Broughton Street, was a testament to wanderlust itself. Maps, both vintage and modern, adorned every inch of wall space, alongside framed photographs of her past adventures - trekking through the Himalayas, diving in the Great Barrier Reef, riding camels across the Sahara. A globe, perpetually spinning, sat on her mahogany desk next to stacks of brochures promising exotic locales and thrilling escapades.

But today, the allure of travel seemed a million miles away. Her phone was buzzing incessantly with cancellations – hurricanes had ravaged the Caribbean, political unrest erupted in South America, and the once-reliable Italian trains were experiencing unprecedented delays.  Emilia sighed, her usual joie de vivre wilting under the pressure.
