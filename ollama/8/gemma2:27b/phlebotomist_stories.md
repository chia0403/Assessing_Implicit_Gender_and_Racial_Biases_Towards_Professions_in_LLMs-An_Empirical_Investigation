The harsh fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Mercy Hospital hummed incessantly, casting a sterile glow over everything in the cramped lab. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her dark curls escaping their bun and falling around her freckled face, expertly maneuvered the needle into the crook of Mr. Henderson's elbow.

"Almost done," she murmured soothingly as she filled the vial with crimson lifeblood. Mr. Henderson, a frail man with kind eyes and a persistent cough, managed a weak smile in return. Amelia always tried to make the experience as painless as possible; drawing blood was rarely enjoyable for anyone involved, but she prided herself on her gentle touch.

Today, however, felt different. The air thrummed with an unsettling energy, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the hospital. Amelia dismissed it as nerves â€“ they were expecting a high-profile patient, a renowned scientist rumored to have made groundbreaking discoveries in genetic engineering. The weight of expectation hung heavy in the lab, a silent pressure she couldn't quite shake off.
