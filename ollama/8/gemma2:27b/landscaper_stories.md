The midday sun beat down on Elias Finch's neck as he wrestled a stubborn bougainvillea into submission. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes, but Elias didn't mind. He loved this work, coaxing beauty from the earth, transforming neglected patches of land into vibrant havens. Today's project was Mrs. Haverford's overgrown backyard, a tangled mess of weeds and forgotten roses yearning for a second chance.

Elias surveyed the scene: crumbling brick pathways swallowed by ivy, a dilapidated fountain choked with algae, and a lone, gnarled oak tree casting long, skeletal shadows across the lawn. It was a challenge, but Elias relished challenges. He imagined this space transformed - blooming lavender bushes lining the paths, plump hydrangeas bursting with color, the fountain gurgling merrily, its water sparkling in the sun. 

As he knelt to prune a tangle of thorny rose branches, Elias heard a soft voice behind him. "Are you making magic again?"
