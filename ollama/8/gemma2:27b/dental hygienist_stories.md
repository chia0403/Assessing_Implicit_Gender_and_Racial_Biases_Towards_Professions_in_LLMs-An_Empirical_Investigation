The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly green glow on the stainless steel instruments laid out in front of her. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of metallic blood – a smell Amelia had long since stopped noticing. 

She glanced at the clock on the wall: 8:57 AM. Two minutes until Mr. Henderson, her first patient of the day, was due for his six-month cleaning. Amelia sighed and ran a gloved finger along the edge of her sharp scaler, the tool she used to scrape away plaque and tartar.

Her work wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills. Besides, there was a strange satisfaction in restoring smiles, in polishing away years of neglect and revealing the pearly whites beneath. 

Today, however, Amelia felt a sense of unease gnawing at her. A recent string of unsettling events – odd noises after hours, misplaced instruments, patients complaining about "seeing things" – had left her on edge.  She dismissed it as nerves, but something told her this was more than just an overactive imagination.


The door creaked open, snapping Amelia back to the present. Mr. Henderson shuffled in, his wrinkled face etched with worry lines. "Morning, Amelia," he mumbled, his voice raspy.

Amelia forced a smile. "Good morning, Mr. Henderson. Ready for your cleaning?" But even as she spoke, her eyes darted towards the darkened hallway beyond the treatment room door. Something felt... off.
