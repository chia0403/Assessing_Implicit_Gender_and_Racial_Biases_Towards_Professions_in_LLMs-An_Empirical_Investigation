The humid Louisiana air hung heavy as Clara Jean Delacroix hurried through the bustling French Quarter market. Baskets overflowed with ripe tomatoes and glistening seafood, while vendors hawked handmade jewelry and voodoo trinkets. The scent of beignets mingled with the earthy aroma of chicory coffee, a symphony of scents that normally brought Clara Jean comfort. Today, however, her stomach churned with anxiety.

She was on her way to meet Dr. Etienne Moreau at his clinic, nestled in a quiet courtyard just off Royal Street.  As a physician's assistant, she was Etienne’s right hand, assisting him with everything from routine checkups to complex surgeries. But today was different. 

Dr. Moreau had called her earlier that morning, his voice tight with urgency. He spoke of a patient, a young woman brought in with strange symptoms – fever, hallucinations, and inexplicable rashes. Clara Jean could hear the unspoken fear beneath his professional calm. This wasn't just another case; this was something unusual, something that threatened to shake their understanding of medicine itself.  

As she reached the clinic door, a shiver ran down her spine. The wrought iron gate creaked open with an unsettling groan, inviting her into a world where the familiar rules of medicine might no longer apply.
