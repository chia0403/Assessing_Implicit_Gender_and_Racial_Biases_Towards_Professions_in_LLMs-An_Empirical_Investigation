Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the view of the dilapidated Victorian mansion across the street. Eleanor Thorne sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily. The listing had been sitting stagnant for weeks - a testament to its crumbling facade and whispering reputation. Locals spoke in hushed tones of strange lights seen flickering in the attic windows at night, and children dared each other to cross the overgrown lawn, convinced the house was haunted. 

Eleanor scoffed at such superstition. A house was simply bricks and mortar, regardless of the stories spun around it. Still, even she had to admit that "Rosewood Manor" held a certain ominous charm. The ivy snaking up its weathered walls resembled skeletal fingers, reaching for the perpetually grey sky.

She picked up her phone, dialing the number she'd been avoiding. "Mr. Davenport," she said into the receiver, her voice steady despite the nervous flutter in her stomach, "I think we need to talk about a price adjustment."
