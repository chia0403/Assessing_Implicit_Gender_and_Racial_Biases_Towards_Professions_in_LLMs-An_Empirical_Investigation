The wind howled like a banshee through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, its icy breath whistling through the gaps in Elara Thorne's leather armor.  She shivered, pulling her threadbare cloak tighter around her shoulders. Above, the moon hung heavy and low, casting long, distorted shadows across the cobblestone courtyard of Castle Blackwood.

Elara squinted into the darkness, her calloused fingers tightening on the hilt of her sword. The flickering torches lining the castle walls did little to pierce the gloom, leaving swathes of the courtyard shrouded in impenetrable blackness. Every rustle of leaves, every creak of aging stone, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her veins. Tonight, the silence felt heavy with unseen threats. 


She wasn't sure why she had been assigned this post. Usually, the younger recruits were given the graveyard shift, but Elara, despite being only twenty-two, had already earned a reputation for diligence and unwavering focus. Perhaps Captain Thorne (no relation) thought her seasoned enough to handle it alone. Or perhaps he simply didn't want to risk losing another inexperienced guard to whatever lurked beyond the castle walls.

Whatever the reason, Elara stood her ground, her gaze sweeping across the moonlit landscape. Beyond the towering stone walls lay the Whispering Woods, a tangled mass of ancient trees rumored to be haunted by restless spirits and shadowy creatures. It was said that anyone who ventured into those woods after dark never returned.
