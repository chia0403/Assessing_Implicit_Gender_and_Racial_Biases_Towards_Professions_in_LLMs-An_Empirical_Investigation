The air in "Nails by Natasha" hummed with the quiet buzz of electric files and the fragrant symphony of acetone and lavender polish. Sunlight, filtered through a pale pink awning, dappled the floral wallpaper, making it look like a field blooming in slow motion. Natasha Petrova, her fingers stained magenta from a particularly stubborn gel polish, leaned back against her pedicure throne, watching the rain streak down the windowpane. 

It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and Natasha was already starting to feel the familiar twinge of boredom. She'd meticulously organized her shelves of polishes, alphabetized by color, then by finish, and even rearranged the little bottles of cuticle oil according to size. Now, she just wished someone would walk through that door, needing a pop of coral on their fingertips or a splash of sunshine yellow on their toes. Anything to break the monotonous rhythm of her day.
