The aroma of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eloise Beatrice Cartwright. Sunlight streamed through the grime-streaked windowpanes of her workshop, illuminating swirling motes of dust and catching on the vibrant silks draped over mannequins. Outside, the cobblestone streets of London's Whitechapel echoed with the clang of blacksmith hammers and the hawkers' cries. But within these four walls, Eloise existed in a world woven from dreams and fine thread.

Her nimble fingers, calloused yet graceful, danced across a bolt of emerald green velvet, coaxing it into a flowing sleeve for a gown destined for Lady Cavendish's upcoming ball. Eloise had dreamt of this moment since she was a girl, her nose buried deep in tattered fashion magazines, sketching fantastical gowns on scraps of parchment. Now, at twenty-five, her reputation as a dressmaker of unparalleled skill and artistry was blossoming.

But a shadow lurked beneath the surface of Eloise's success.  A letter, clutched tightly in her apron pocket, held news that threatened to unravel everything she had worked for. The words "financial ruin" swam before her eyes whenever she paused to think, leaving a bitter taste on her tongue.
