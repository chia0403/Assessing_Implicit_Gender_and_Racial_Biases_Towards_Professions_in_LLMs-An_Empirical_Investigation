The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the sterile lab, casting a sickly green pallor over everything. Beatrice Rosalind Cavendish adjusted her spectacles, squinting at the petri dish under the microscope.  Years she had dedicated to this research, years spent meticulously isolating and culturing the bioluminescent algae from the Mariana Trench. Tonight, she was on the cusp of a breakthrough.

The air in the lab felt thick with anticipation.  Bea could almost taste it - the sweet tang of success mingling with the slightly acrid scent of agar. The rhythmic beeping of the incubator filled the silence between her whispered observations, each beep echoing the pounding of her heart.  If her calculations were correct, if the genetic manipulation had taken holdâ€¦ tonight, she would witness something truly extraordinary.
