The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez, casting a pale, sickly glow over her drafting table. Outside the window, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on Phoenix, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves of heat. Esme sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear and rubbing her tired eyes. 

Her drafting board was littered with blueprints – tangled lines and precise measurements for a new high-rise development downtown. It was a monotonous task, meticulously transferring the architect's vision onto paper, but it paid the bills. And besides, Esme secretly dreamt of one day designing buildings herself, her imagination soaring above the mundane lines she painstakingly replicated.

But today, the usual tedium felt heavier than usual. A knot of anxiety tightened in Esme’s stomach. The deadline for the project loomed, and a crucial detail was missing – a set of structural calculations from the engineering firm. Without them, her work was useless. She tapped nervously on her keyboard, hoping for an email update. 

Nothing.

Esme rose, stretching her stiff muscles.  Maybe she could get through to someone at the firm directly? As she reached for her phone, a sharp rapping on her cubicle wall startled her. 

"Ramirez?" a gruff voice boomed. "Got a minute?"
