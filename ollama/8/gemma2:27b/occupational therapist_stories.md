The scent of antiseptic and overripe bananas hung heavy in the air of St. Sybil's Rehabilitation Center, a smell Elara Rose Cartwright had come to associate with both hope and heartbreak. Sunlight filtered weakly through the grimy windows of the communal therapy room, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path.  Elara sighed, adjusting the straps of her worn canvas satchel before pushing open the double doors. The familiar cacophony of groans, shuffling feet, and strained laughter greeted her like an old friend. 

Today, she was working with Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter whose stroke had robbed him of the dexterity needed to whittle his beloved wooden birds. Elara believed in small victories: the way a finger twitched just a fraction more, the glimmer of determination returning to a patient's eyes. It wasn't always about regaining what was lost; sometimes it was about finding new ways to live, to thrive, even in the face of adversity.
