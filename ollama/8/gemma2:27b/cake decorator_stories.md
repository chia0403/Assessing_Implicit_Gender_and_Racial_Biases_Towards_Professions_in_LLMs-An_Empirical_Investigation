The air in Sweet Surrender hung thick with the scent of vanilla and almond, a fragrant fog that clung to Eloise Beaumont's apron as she meticulously piped delicate pink roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, illuminating dust motes dancing above the pristine white counter. Outside, bustling Market Street throbbed with life – the honk of a taxi, the melodic chime of a passing ice cream truck, the rumble of the underground train snaking beneath the city. Eloise, however, was lost in her own world, her fingers moving with practiced grace as she brought each sugary bloom to life.

But today, the familiar calm of her craft was disrupted by a jarring phone call. The shrill ring cut through the quiet hum of the refrigerator, jolting Eloise from her artistic trance. She glanced at the caller ID – an unfamiliar number. A tremor of unease ran down her spine. Something told her this wasn't just another order for cupcakes.
