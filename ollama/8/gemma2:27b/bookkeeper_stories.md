The air in Mildred Featherstone's cramped office hummed with the low thrumming of her ancient adding machine.  Dust motes danced in the shaft of afternoon sunlight slanting through the grime-coated windowpane. Outside, the clamor of New York City roared, an endless symphony of horns and shouts that Mildred barely registered anymore. 

She hunched over a ledger, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously tallied figures for Mr. Goldblatt's haberdashery. The scent of mothballs and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, persistent odor of mildew emanating from the stacks of aging invoices piled precariously on every available surface.

Mildred sighed, pushing a stray curl back under her drab grey bun. Another Tuesday, another mountain of receipts to climb.  She longed for the days when bookkeeping was done by hand, each entry a carefully formed inscription in a pristine ledger. Now, with these infernal contraptions promising "speed and efficiency," Mildred felt increasingly like a relic herself, struggling to keep pace in a world that seemed to have left her behind.
