## Setting the Scene:

**Time:**  Late afternoon, late August 2023. The sky hangs thick with humidity, promising rain that never quite arrives.  The air thrums with cicadas, their song a relentless drone amidst the hushed whispers of the school hallway.

**Location:** Oakwood High School, a sprawling institution with worn hallways and faded posters bearing the logos of once-prominent athletes. The aroma of stale coffee hangs heavy from the Guidance office, blending with the faint smell of chalk dust from the nearby math lab. 

**Character Introduction:** 
* Name: **Ms. Amelia Finch** -  A woman in her late forties, Ms. Finch has a warm smile and eyes that hold a world-weariness from years spent guiding students through the turbulent waters of adolescence. Her neatly styled silver hair contrasts with the vibrant rainbow pens she keeps in her drawer, each one representing a different colour coded motivational affirmation for her students. 

**Opening:**

The bell clanged, signaling the end of another long day, and Ms. Finch sighed. As usual, her inbox overflowed, an ever-growing mountain of student anxieties about college applications, scholarships, standardized tests - the very things that occupied her thoughts with equal intensity.  But today, a different kind of worry hung in the air. 

A crumpled piece of paper lay abandoned on her desk, its contents a jumble of scribbled notes and frantic questions: "What if I don't know who I am?" 

Ms. Finch picked it up, tracing the name she had underlined - **Ethan Taylor**.  She couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to this note than just teenage confusion. This wasn't just a typical plea for advice; it felt like a glimpse into a storm brewing within Ethan, and she knew it wouldnâ€™t be easy to steer him through.
