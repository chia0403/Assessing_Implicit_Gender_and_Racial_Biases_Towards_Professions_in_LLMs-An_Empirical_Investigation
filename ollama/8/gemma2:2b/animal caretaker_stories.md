The salt air stung Amelia's nostrils as she stepped onto the wooden platform overlooking the beach. The sun was already sinking behind the horizon, casting long shadows across the crashing waves. Her worn boots crunched on the sand, each step echoing in the growing stillness of the day.  Her hands were calloused and strong, the kind that had built sturdy shelters for beached animals like her husband's grandfather before her, but even she felt a tremor of unease as she gazed upon the endless expanse of blue. 

Amelia was the caretaker at the "Wings & Fins" wildlife sanctuary on this remote island. For years, it had been her lifeblood â€“ tending to injured seabirds, rescuing stranded marine mammals, and witnessing the fragile beauty of creatures so different yet connected to each other. But tonight, a different kind of fear gnawed at her gut. 

The last time she'd seen the lighthouse keeper, old Silas, was just after he'd arrived on the island two weeks ago. He'd told Amelia about mysterious calls coming from the depths of the ocean and the sudden appearance of strange, glowing lights far out past the breakers. His words were as fleeting as the seagulls soaring above her head, leaving a sense of dread that lingered like the salty air.  Now, as dusk settled over the island and the lighthouse's beam began to flicker, Amelia felt an undeniable urge to face it all - the fear, the mystery, and the weight of responsibility.
