Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Jake "The Wrench" Sullivan's garage, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of motor oil, burning rubber, and something vaguely sweet – like burnt sugar and gasoline.  Jake was hunched over his workbench, carefully dismantling a sputtering engine. 

His hands were roughened by years of wrenching on everything from rusted pickup trucks to high-performance sports cars.  He'd learned the language of engines before he could speak, a dialect that only a man who had spent his life living and breathing beneath their hood could truly understand. Today's challenge was a 1978 Ford Mustang – a classic muscle car with a heart full of trouble. Jake took a swig of lukewarm coffee, grimacing at the taste,  and looked out at the storm that raged beyond his workshop door. He sighed, wishing for a dry day, but mostly for a break from the endless cycle of mechanics and their never-ending demands. 

"Another Sunday, another engine's gone belly up," he muttered to himself, tracing a greasy finger along the crankshaft.  He knew today wouldn’t be much different than the past week or month. The same monotonous rhythm of wrenching, troubleshooting, and fixing would continue, until the storm finally passed. But for now, Jake was alone with his machines, the only solace being the roar of the engine as he fought to bring it back from the brink of death.
