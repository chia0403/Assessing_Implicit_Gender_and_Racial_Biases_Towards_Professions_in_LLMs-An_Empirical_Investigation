## Setting:  The Whispering Mountains

**Opening:** The wind howled across the craggy peaks of the Whispering Mountains, its icy breath nipping at Silas Blackwood's weathered face. He stood before his quarry, a giant, moss-covered boulder overlooking the vast valley. It pulsed with an inner energy that even after years in the trade, he couldnâ€™t entirely explain. This was no ordinary stone; this was the heart of his craft, the very soul of his work. 

Silas Blackwood, known throughout the mountain villages as "Silas of the Whispering Stone," was a man carved by time and hardship, yet imbued with an artistic spirit that burned brighter than any fire he'd ever witnessed.  He had spent his life shaping stone, transforming rough fragments into majestic sculptures that whispered tales of forgotten heroes and lost civilizations. But this quarry held a secret, a raw power that he could only barely comprehend. 

His hands, calloused and strong, moved with the practiced ease of a master weaver, drawing lines and arcs across the stone's surface. He was carving away at something far beyond the physical; he was chipping away at his own fear, trying to understand the whispers that reverberated from within the rock itself.
