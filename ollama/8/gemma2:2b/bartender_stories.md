The rusty neon sign above The Rusty Mug cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, the air hung thick with smoke from countless cigarettes and stale beer, punctuated by the hiss of the ice machine. This was Elara's domain, her solace in a city that felt more like a storm than a town. Her name echoed around the bar:  Elara Blackwood. At 32, she wasn't exactly old, but time had left its mark on The Rusty Mug and everyone who walked through it's doors.

Elara wiped down a glass with a practiced hand as another drizzly night bled into a new one.  She knew every face in this dingy haven; the grizzled fishermen seeking solace after long days at sea, the weary travelers hoping to find refuge from the storm, and the forgotten souls hiding behind shadows. Tonight was no different, the same faces swirling around her like a perpetual dance of despair and desperation. 

But tonight, Elara also felt a different kind of hum in the air. It wasn't just the thrum of the rain against the window pane; it was something heavier, something sharper.  A new customer had just walked through the door, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat that blocked out the light. The tension crackled around him like static electricity, and Elara felt her gaze drawn to his sharp eyes, reflecting a storm cloud of their own.
