The worn brick of his classroom echoed with the hushed whispers of students, their faces illuminated by an array of phones held aloft like prayer beads. Mr. Elias Thorne, 52 years young with eyes that crinkled at the corners when he smiled, looked upon them as if they were a particularly stubborn batch of clay, needing to be molded and shaped before it could take on its true form.
