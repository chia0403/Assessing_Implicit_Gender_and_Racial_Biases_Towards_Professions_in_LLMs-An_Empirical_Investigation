## The Stone Citadel

**Setting:** A crumbling fortress carved into the heart of a storm-wracked mountain range. The air hangs thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying stone, punctuated by the sharp sting of wind whistling through cracks in the ancient walls.  

**Character:** Elara Thornewood, a sturdy guard bearing her weariness like a well-worn cloak. Her eyes, though faded with age, still held a spark of defiance as she surveyed the fortress's gatehouse. 

**Opening:** Elara took another drag from her frayed pouch, the acrid taste of spiced tobacco stinging her tongue. Another night, another silent vigil. The Stone Citadel was a tomb in its own right, its stone walls etched with tales of heroes and forgotten kings. Yet today, even the ghosts seemed to whisper fear in the wind. For the sky churned a restless sea of black clouds, mirroring the turmoil within Elara's own soul. Tonight was the night she would face her own demons, or so they said.  The Citadel was supposed to hold only memories - but tonight, something else stirred in its silent corners...
