The air hung thick with the smell of sweat, blood, and something vaguely metallic that could only be described as "death".  It was the kind of smell that clung to you like a second skin, no matter how many times you scrubbed yourself in the cold water basin at the back of the shop.  But for Elias Blackwood, it was comforting, like the familiar weight of his cleaver against leather and bone.  He'd known this scent since he was a boy, even before learning to read or write. It had been the smell of life itself - a life taken too soon and brutally often, but a life nonetheless.

Elias stood amidst his bustling workshop, surrounded by the clattering steel and the rhythmic chopping of meat against bone.  His shop, Blackwood's Fine Cuts, was nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Victorian London, where whispers of the cityâ€™s underbelly danced with the scent of fresh sausages sizzling in a griddle outside.  It wasn't fancy, but it was his sanctuary, a place where life and death were intertwined into the intricate dance of the trade.
