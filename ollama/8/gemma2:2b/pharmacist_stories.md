The air hung thick with the smell of lavender and something else, something metallic that pricked at Amelia's nose like a stray beehive in her brain. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the bustling pharmacy on Sycamore Street. It was closing time, and she could feel the familiar anxiety creeping in, twisting her stomach into knots like cheap wire. 

Amelia "Amy" Thorne had been running this little gem of a shop for over three years now, inheriting it from her beloved grandmother. Her fingers, calloused from countless refills and gentle hands, tapped against the counter as she sorted through last-minute prescriptions. This was more than just a job; it was a legacy, a tangible connection to the woman who had built her dreams brick by brick. 

Tonight, however, something felt different. A sense of urgency hung in the air like the final chime of the bell above the door. The line of customers seemed longer than usual, and there was an undercurrent of nervous tension that made even her normally stoic demeanor flicker with unease. As she scanned the faces one by one, a single name flashed through her mind â€“ "Mr. Blackwood."  His presence usually brought a calm hum to the shop; tonight, however, it felt different. It held a weight, a storm gathering on the horizon that made Amy's heart pound in her chest.
