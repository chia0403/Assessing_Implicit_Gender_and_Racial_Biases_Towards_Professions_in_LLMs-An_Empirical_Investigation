## Setting: 

The plush leather seats on Air France Flight 213 were a testament to luxury; a stark contrast to the weary bustle outside the Parisian terminal.  But even with the champagne-drenched lounge and the meticulously curated in-flight menu, there was an unsettling stillness clinging to the air like smoke after a particularly strong cigarette. The jet bridge was silent, passengers scattered throughout the cabin like birds taking flight on a windless day. Even the usual hum of anticipation before take-off was muted, replaced by a palpable sense of dread. 

## Character:

**Name:** Amara  Amadou

Amara's name felt as heavy in the air as the weight she carried on her slender shoulders. For five years, she had been the comforting face and calming voice on Air France, bringing smiles to weary travelers and navigating them through turbulent waters of life. Tonight, however, even her usual stoicism seemed like a flimsy shield against the growing anxiety that throbbed beneath her skin. 

**Opening:**

"Ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate your patience as we prepare for departure," Amara's voice echoed across the cabin, a delicate thread in the tangled web of fear. She stepped into the aisle of Flight 213, her nametag a bright beacon against the muted backdrop of anxiety-ridden faces. A single gust of wind ruffled a loose strand of hair on her forehead and she glanced at her watch. The departure time ticked away â€“ every minute an eternity in this unsettling silence.  Suddenly, a woman's voice pierced the stillness from the back. "I need to speak with Amara."
