Rain hammered against the classroom windows, each drop a tiny explosion echoing through the hollow space.  Inside, Ms. Evelyn Thorne, PhD, watched as a group of fourth-graders argued about the merits of imaginary dragons versus actual ones. The air hung thick with tension and an undercurrent of anxiety that was more than just the usual pre-test jitters. 

Ms. Thorne's gaze shifted to the boy in the corner, Ethan, who kept his back straight like a statue while fidgeting with his hands. His eyes darted around the room, seemingly looking for something he couldn't quite grasp. He hadn't been himself lately, his usual playful energy replaced by an anxious silence.

The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sterile glow that did little to penetrate the gloom settling over Ms. Thorne’s chest. She knew there was a reason Ethan's anxiety had peaked in the run-up to this test – the infamous "Magic Assessment" – and she hoped to uncover it before the storm unleashed itself.  The world outside seemed to mirror the unease within, as if each raindrop held a secret waiting to be revealed, just like the emotions brewing beneath Ethan’s quiet facade.
