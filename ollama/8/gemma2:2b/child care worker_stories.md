The scent of vanilla and sugar clung to the air like a phantom limb – remnants of Mrs. Fitzwilliam’s infamous afternoon tea.  It was a smell Amelia, with her unruly ginger curls and bright green eyes, associated more with memories than reality. She knew it meant another day had begun, another group of eight-year-olds whose boundless energy threatened to consume the house's very essence. This specific aroma, however, carried an air of melancholy she couldn’t shake off. 

Amelia was Mrs. Fitzwilliam’s assistant, a title that felt more like a whisper than a declaration. She knew it was her job –  not just to help care for the children but also to witness the delicate and chaotic dance of their lives unfold under her watchful eye. The house itself felt like an antique clock, each creak and groan a reminder of countless years spent beneath its roof. 

The story's opening is set in a quaint, old-world home with a hint of sadness. It introduces us to Amelia, our main character, and subtly hints at the deeper mystery that lies ahead within this setting.
