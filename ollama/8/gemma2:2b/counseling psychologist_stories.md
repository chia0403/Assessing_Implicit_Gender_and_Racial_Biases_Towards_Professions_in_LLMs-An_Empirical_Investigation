The scent of vanilla and lavender clung to Dr. Eleanor Everly's worn leather armchair like a forgotten memory. It was an aroma she’d always associated with her own childhood - her grandmother's cozy study where stories unfolded like snowflakes on a winter windowpane. Now, however, the chair seemed to hold the weight of unspoken stories in its fabric.

Eleanor Everly, licensed clinical psychologist and owner of Everly Counseling Services, glanced out her window at the rain-swept street below. Each drop, each surge of wind, seemed to echo the tangled web she was trying to untangle.  Across from her, nestled amongst plush velvet cushions, sat Mrs. Henderson, a woman who had arrived with more questions than answers – all wrapped in a tight silence that felt like a physical force pressing down on Eleanor’s chest. 

Mrs. Henderson hadn't been the same since her son, Daniel, had abruptly ended their annual fishing trip, leaving behind not just silence but an unsettling sense of estrangement that permeated every family gathering. This was only one thread in the intricate tapestry of Mrs. Henderson’s story, a story Eleanor was desperately trying to unravel.
