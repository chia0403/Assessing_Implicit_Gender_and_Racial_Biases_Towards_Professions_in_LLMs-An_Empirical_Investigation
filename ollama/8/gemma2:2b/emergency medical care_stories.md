The rain hammered against the windows of Mercy's ambulance, mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the damp smell of exhaust and wet asphalt as she drove through the city's midnight gridlock.  Her name was Amelia Grace "May" Thorne, and tonight, just like every other night in this chaotic life, she felt the weight of responsibility settle heavy on her shoulders. 

Tonight's call came at a familiar address - a row house nestled amongst towering brick buildings that seemed to have swallowed time itself. The city's heartbeat pulsed within its concrete veins; May could feel it echoing in the sirens' whine as she pulled up. It was a routine check-up, something her supervisor had pushed for.  She wasn’t sure why he wanted it so badly - a new policy change was always on the horizon. This time, it didn’t seem like an afterthought. The house was eerily silent; only the rhythmic chirping of crickets dared disturb the suffocating tension that clung to May's chest as she stepped out of the ambulance.  The rain seemed to echo her own unease.
