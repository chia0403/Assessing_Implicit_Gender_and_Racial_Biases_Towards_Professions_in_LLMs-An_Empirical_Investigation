The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and old money as Celeste Dubois stepped into the grand foyer of The Grand Astoria. Her worn leather shoes echoed faintly on the polished marble floor, each step measured and precise, a ballet in the opulent silence. A single ray of sunlight sliced through the arched window, illuminating a dust motes dancing in the air, momentarily turning the room from an austere palace into a shimmering cathedral.  The Grand Astoria was more than just a hotel; it was an embodiment of old-world opulence and Celeste’s heart was woven into its very fabric.

For years, she'd been the unseen architect of the Astoria's beauty – the concierge who ensured every guest felt like royalty, orchestrating elaborate schedules, arranging private tours, and even knowing the perfect song to soothe a troubled mind. Today, however, something felt different. The usual hum of anticipation had been replaced by an unsettling quiet. There was a tension in the air, sharp enough to cut through the opulent tapestry hanging on the wall. 

Celeste’s eyes swept across the grand staircase leading up to the penthouse suite, its entrance framed by heavy velvet curtains that hid a secret she was desperate to unravel. The silence whispered stories of a storm brewing.
