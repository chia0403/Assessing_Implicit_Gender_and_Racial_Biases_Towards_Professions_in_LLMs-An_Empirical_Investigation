The red dust clung to Elara Blackwood's boots like an unwelcome second skin as she surveyed her vast Montana ranch.  Sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple, while wind whistled through the lone windmill, its blades churning out a slow, rhythmic dance against the dying light.  Elara had always loved these moments - the solitude of the sprawling prairie, the quiet hum of nature after a long day's work. She was a woman built for it, strong and weathered like the land itself. 

This wasn't just her life; it was legacy.  The Blackwoods were ranchers etched into the very fabric of Montana, and Elara inherited more than just the cattle ranches on each sprawling acreage - she inherited their stubborn independence, their unshakeable faith in the land, and a deep-seated fear, like a ghost that lingered at every turn, that some hidden force was slowly eroding everything they held dear.
