## Setting: The Crooked Willow Farm

The air hung thick with the aroma of freshly turned earth and rain-soaked hay as Elara Blackwood, her face weathered by sun and wind, surveyed the farmyard with weary eyes.  Sunrise painted the sky in hues of peach and lavender across the rolling hills of the West Wind Valley. But even such beauty couldn't dispel the heavy heart that weighed upon Elaraâ€™s shoulders. The old willow tree, which stood sentinel at the edge of her farm, was beginning to shed its leaves early, a sign of winter's encroaching grip. 

It had been another hard year for Elara Blackwood, one where drought parched the land and blizzards stole livestock and froze crops.  The meager harvest she managed to coax from the earth left her struggling to keep their little farm afloat. The whispers in town that the wind itself held a malice towards them were starting to sting like thorns on her spirit.

Elara's hands, calloused from years of toil, gripped the worn wooden handle of her hoe.  She muttered under her breath, "One more year," she sighed. Then, with a quiet strength born of experience and desperation, she turned toward the house where her young son, Thomas, was already at work in their kitchen.
