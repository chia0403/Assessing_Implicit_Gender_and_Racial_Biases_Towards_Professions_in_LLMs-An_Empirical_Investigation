## Opening Scene

The air hung thick with anticipation, heavy as the humidity pressing against Dr. Amelia Thorne's cheek. The sterile scent of antiseptic and disinfectant barely penetrated the thick fog that seemed to swirl around the operating theatre. Outside, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the cityscape in a fiery orange hue. Inside, however, the world narrowed down to the rhythmic beeping of machines, the hushed whispers of nurses, and the steady thrumming of Amelia's own anxious heartbeat. 

Tonight, she wasn't just performing surgery; she was trying to save a life. A life that belonged to Kai, an eight-year-old boy with a rare heart condition, whose tiny body could barely hold its own against the relentless march of time and circumstance. 

Amelia adjusted her surgical mask, the sterile fabric scraping against her skin, and took a deep breath.  Tonight, she would face not only the challenge of the surgery but also the daunting reality of the weight she carried - the responsibility for another soul's future in the delicate balance of human anatomy.  


**Setting:** 

* **Location:** The bustling cardiac surgical unit at Mercy General Hospital, Seattle, Washington
* **Time:** Late afternoon/early evening during a summer storm 
* **Atmosphere:** Intensely focused but claustrophobic; full of tension, high-stakes activity with a heavy sense of impending change.  


**Note:** This opening is designed to set the stage for a story that involves medical drama, moral dilemmas, and perhaps even some personal introspection on Amelia's part as she navigates this life-saving mission and the ethical complexities that come with it.
