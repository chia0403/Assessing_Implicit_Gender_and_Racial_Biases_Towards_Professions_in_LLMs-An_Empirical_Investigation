## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the tin roof of the small hospital, mirroring the chaotic storm raging inside Amelia "Amy" Hayes. She stood in the sterile hallway, a stark contrast to the bright red scrubs that clung awkwardly to her frame. Her steely gaze swept over the rows of anxious faces: families huddled in corners, children clutching their parents' hands, and exhausted doctors with shadowed eyes.  Today was her first night as a registered nurse at Willow Creek Medical Center, a small but bustling facility clinging desperately to survival.

Amy had always dreamt of serving others through healing. The warmth and comfort she brought to patients during her final year in school felt like an affirmation, until the reality of this hospital hit home.  The staff was dwindling; resources were scarce, and even the most seasoned nurses seemed lost in the storm of despair. A shiver ran down Amy's spine as she took a deep breath, forcing herself to remember why she'd answered the call. 

**Setting:** Willow Creek Medical Center, nestled on the outskirts of a sleepy town in Vermont, is struggling to stay afloat amidst a rural exodus and a dwindling influx of patients. The hospital has seen better days; its white-painted walls are chipped and faded, its hallways echo with unspoken anxieties, and the once-proud emblem now stands as a stark reminder of what used to be.  The storm outside mirrors the internal turmoil within the building.
