The flickering neon sign cast an oily sheen on the slick asphalt, reflecting off Amelia's rain-rimmed glasses like a thousand shattered promises.  She was wedged between two dilapidated buildings in the heart of Chicago's notorious "Redevelopment District," known more for its boarded windows and stray cats than anything resembling progress. This wasn't exactly the scene she'd imagined for her sales pitch. 

Her name was Amelia Blackwood, and tonight, she was peddling dreams. A single projector illuminated a room filled with faces that seemed as weary as the city itself, all huddled in a desperate hope of escaping their own crumbling realities. The air hung heavy with unspoken anxieties, and the only sound louder than the wind whipping off Lake Michigan was the incessant whirring of her sales machine – a clunky contraption Amelia's father had gifted her, muttering something about "keeping your foot on the gas." 

Tonight, though, even Amelia wasn't sure what she was selling.  The projector flickered through its slideshow, showcasing the lives Amelia's machine promised: families escaping urban decay, single parents finding a second chance, and entrepreneurs dreaming of their own futures. But the faces in her audience looked so lost, their eyes reflecting a storm far more turbulent than any city wind.
 
"It's just what you need," she whispered to them, trying to ignite something beyond the flickering images. "Just what you deserve."  But even as she spoke, Amelia felt like she was sinking into a pit of despair herself, her own dreams mirroring the desolate landscape around her.  The question wasn't just about selling a machine – it was about selling hope in the face of utter cynicism.
