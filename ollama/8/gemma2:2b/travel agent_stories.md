The aroma of cinnamon and old paper hung heavy in the air as Amelia "Amy" Cartwright meticulously arranged her latest client's itinerary. The faded map of Peru, its edges curling with age, lay forgotten on the worn leather desk. Amy's gaze drifted towards it, a faint flicker of longing crossing her features. She couldn't help but remember that first time she landed in Cusco, years ago, back when the city was still whispering secrets in the wind and sunlight danced across ancient stones.  

The bustling streets, vibrant with life and color, now hummed with a different kind of energy - the restless pulse of tourism. Amy's office, nestled on the outskirts of the bustling tourist zone, felt more like a museum of forgotten dreams than a haven for future journeys. Outside the window, tourists jostled through the city's streets, their faces filled with a hopeful excitement for adventure. But for Amy, the magic seemed to have faded into a familiar routine, leaving her longing for something she couldn't quite grasp.

The air was thick with the anticipation of tomorrow's trip to Machu Picchu â€“ a dream for many, but one that felt increasingly distant to Amy herself.
