The late afternoon sun, already dipping behind the towering oaks on Elm Street, cast long shadows across Henry Thorne's worn boots as he surveyed his canvas-covered work van.  His hands, calloused and strong from years spent bending under the weight of heavy pruning shears, dug into the smooth surface of the metal, tracing a familiar path. His name was etched beside "THORN" on the side – an ironic contrast to the gentle curves of his landscape design ambitions. Henry wasn't just a landscaper; he saw nature as something alive, breathing and striving for balance. 

Elm Street itself felt like a battleground today. Every year, the residents clashed over which blooms were deemed "too wild" or "not bold enough," but this year, a storm was brewing, not just in the weather reports, but within Henry's own soul. He had been commissioned to transform Mrs. Peterson's neglected backyard into a haven for her beloved children – but every time he stepped foot on her property, an unsettling pressure filled his chest, like the earth itself was holding its breath.
