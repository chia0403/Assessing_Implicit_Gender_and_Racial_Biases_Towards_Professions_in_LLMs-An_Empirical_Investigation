The mahogany door chimed as Dr. Alistair Finch entered his office, the air thick with the scent of lavender and antiseptic. The soft glow of a Himalayan salt lamp cast long shadows across the waiting room, where a lone magazine lay open on a coffee table dusted with crumbs. Alistair's gaze swept over the patients – a young woman with nervous hands clasped tightly together, an older gentleman reading intently from a travel brochure, and a young couple whispering to each other in hushed tones.  

Alistair adjusted his bow tie - a small habit he had cultivated for years that somehow never failed to calm him before a new patient evened the anxiety he felt just beneath the surface. This was Dr. Finch's sanctuary, a haven of order where the anxieties of the day melted away into the soft hum of machinery and the gentle rasp of dental tools.  But today, something felt different. The air was stagnant, heavy with an unspoken tension that prickled Alistair’s skin.  The reason? It was a Tuesday afternoon, meaning he had to meet a new potential client – a powerful attorney known only as “Mr. Blackstone” for his ruthless approach to both business and life.
