The wind, already biting with an icy edge before sunrise, whipped around Finn O'Malley’s worn flannel shirt like a vengeful spirit.  He adjusted his battered Stetson, keeping his gaze fixed on the looming silhouette of Mount Timberhorn. It wasn't just the mountain that held his attention; it was the silent promise of the day's bounty, hidden within the frozen heart of its pine forest. This wasn’t just another logging day for Finn. This was a quest - a pilgrimage to reclaim his family legacy and honor the memory of his grandfather, who had been swallowed by the mountains himself fifty years ago.

**Setting:**  
A remote, heavily forested region in the Pacific Northwest. The land is rugged and unforgiving, populated by ancient giants of timber and home to whispers of old legends. 
**Main Character:**  Finn O'Malley. A stoic and fiercely independent logger who carries the weight of his family’s legacy on his broad shoulders.
