The aroma of stale coffee and burnt toast hung heavy in the air, an unwelcome fixture in the sterile office walls of Herbert "Herb" Thornton's accounting firm. 12:01 PM sharp on Tuesday. Herb stretched his stiff shoulders, his worn leather shoes squeaking against the polished floorboards. The year was 1958, and though progress had come for most things in the city, even the mundane corners of an accountant's life remained unchanged.  

Herb ran a finger through his thinning brown hair, his eyes taking in the messy landscape of spreadsheets, invoices, and tax returns scattered across his desk. The silence was broken only by the hum of the old air conditioner struggling to combat the August heat radiating off the nearby skyscrapers. Today, however, it wasn't just the oppressive heat that felt stifling.  There were whispers, murmurs about a new client, a man named "The Baron" who had bought into the city's burgeoning tech industry with an unprecedented level of wealth and audacity. The rumors painted him as someone with secrets buried deeper than any financial ledger, and Herb found himself strangely drawn to the enigma.
