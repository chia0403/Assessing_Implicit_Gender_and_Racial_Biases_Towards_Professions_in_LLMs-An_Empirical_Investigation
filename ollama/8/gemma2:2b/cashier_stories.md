## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The bustling heart of New York City. 20th century, early evening.  The neon glow of Times Square pulses against the night sky, while street musicians weave a symphony of jazz and blues from small stages scattered throughout the area.  A cool breeze whips through the air as a flock of pigeons take flight across the intersection, their wings a flurry of motion against the backdrop of towering skyscrapers. 

**Character:** The story opens with Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, her name emblazoned beneath an oversized clock on her cashier's uniform, the time ticking down to the end of her shift at the “Last Stop Diner,” a greasy spoon nestled between a vintage clothing store and a bustling laundromat on 7th Avenue.   

**Opening Lines:**  
Ellie sighed as she watched the last customer leave, his faded fedora casting an unsettling shadow across the worn linoleum floor. The clatter of plates, the rumble of the old neon sign, and the constant chatter from her fellow employees were all muffled by a feeling of impending loneliness. Tonight was like any other –  a monotonous drone of serving coffee and cigarettes, watching people rush through life. But tonight, something felt different. A strange unease gnawed at Ellie's gut as she glanced out the window to the bustling street scene beyond.
