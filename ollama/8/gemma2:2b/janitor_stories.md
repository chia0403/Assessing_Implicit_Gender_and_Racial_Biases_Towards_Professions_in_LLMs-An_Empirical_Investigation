The fluorescent lights hummed a dissonant symphony as Theodore "Theo" Miller pushed his mop through the stale air of the Grand Ballroom.  He was scrubbing a corner of the expansive space where a thousand people once danced in swirling patterns under the glittering chandeliers, their laughter ringing out until late into the night. Now, silence reigned, punctuated only by the distant hum of emergency generators and Theo's rhythmic swooshing motion. 

The Ballroom held a ghost-like beauty that he couldnâ€™t fully grasp, even after years cleaning its dusty floors.  He loved the way light caught the intricate tapestries hanging in the velvet-draped alcoves, or how moonlight spilled like silver across the polished wooden floor. But tonight, a heavy feeling sat like a stone in his gut. Theo knew this place, every creak of the stairs and whisper of the old plumbing, like the back of his hand.  He felt oddly disconnected to it all though - as if some invisible thread was holding him back from truly experiencing the Ballroom's magic. 


**The story focuses on Theo, a janitor who finds himself at an important crossroads in life, both professionally and personally.**
