## Opening

Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the already faded view of the cobblestone street below. Inside, the air was warm with the scent of cinnamon and fresh bread, but it did little to quell the chill that seemed to seep into Amelia Thorne's bones. She stood by the counter, watching the rain batter the storefront, her phone a silent accusing finger in the corner of her eye.  It had been ten minutes since she last heard from Michael - ten minutes where time was nothing more than a warped echo in the cafe's relentless hum. 

Amelia Thorne, nutritionist extraordinaire, and self-proclaimed queen of healthy living, wasn’t accustomed to feeling powerless. The world of vitamins and fiber supplements felt like an impenetrable fortress against the chaos of life outside. But today, the walls seemed to press closer, the weight of uncertainty heavier than even a double espresso. 

She was waiting for Michael, her boyfriend - or at least, that's what he’d told himself as he’d swept Amelia off her feet with promises of forever, only five months into their whirlwind romance. Now, his silence felt like an avalanche, the promise of love crumbling under the weight of unanswered questions. 

**Setting:**  A quaint, bustling cafe in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. The setting is a microcosm of its inhabitants: lively and eccentric with whispers of history echoing through every creaky beam. Outside, the iconic French Quarter buzzes, while inside, it’s an oasis of warmth. 


**Note:** This opening establishes a conflict - Amelia's uncertainty about Michael's whereabouts. The setting emphasizes the contrast between the chaos outside and the calming presence of the cafe.
