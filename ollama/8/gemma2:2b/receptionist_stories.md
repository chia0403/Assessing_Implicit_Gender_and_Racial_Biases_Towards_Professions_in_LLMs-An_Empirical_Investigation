## Story Opening

The fluorescent hum of "Sunshine City" was a constant companion to Evelyn Price's life.  She sat at her desk in the cramped reception area of Dr. Theodore Abernathy's Holistic Health Center, its cheery floral wallpaper faded and peeling like an old grandmother's skin. Sunlight streamed through the grimy window, catching on dust motes that danced like tiny phantoms in a perpetual waltz with the air-conditioning unit's whine. 

Evelyn was used to the scent of essential oils and lavender soap, the constant hum of worry from patients hoping for cures, and Dr. Abernathy's peculiar blend of herbal teas that he insisted on serving with his pronouncements on "energy flow." For a receptionist in a holistic health center, she had the most mundane job imaginable, but Evelyn found it oddly comforting. The predictability of her days - answering calls about appointments, taking messages for the elusive Dr. Abernathy who often spent hours meditating under the 'Zen Garden' (a fake bamboo tree adorned with plastic wind chimes) on the second floor - was a balm to the constant whirlwind of chaos that resided in Evelyn's life outside the walls of the clinic.  

But lately, even the predictability had begun to fray at the edges. A new kind of pressure was building beneath the surface, and it wasn't just the impending deadline for filling Dr. Abernathy's schedule with the monthly 'New Moon Rituals' which Evelyn found deeply unsettling.
