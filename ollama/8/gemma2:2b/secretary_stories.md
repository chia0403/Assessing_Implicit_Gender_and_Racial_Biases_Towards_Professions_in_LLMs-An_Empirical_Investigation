## Opening Lines & Setting

**Opening:** The rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of Mrs. Winthrop's office, each drop a tiny drumroll on the already frantic tempo of Amelia Thorne's life. For weeks now, her normally placid world had been a swirling maelstrom of deadlines, missing documents, and ever-increasing pressure from her demanding boss, Mr. Winthrop himself.  The air was thick with tension, and the only sound louder than the rain was the insistent ringing of the antique rotary phone on Mrs. Winthrop's desk. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Thorne, a meticulous secretary whose quiet demeanor belied a steely resolve that simmered beneath her tailored skirts. She had long believed in order and efficiency, meticulously organizing Mr. Winthrop's chaotic life like a well-oiled machine. But the recent influx of unexpected requests – each more demanding than the last - was threatening to unravel everything she held dear.

**Setting:** The office itself was a paradox: opulent yet cluttered. Ornate mahogany furniture sat beside overflowing files, and an ancient grandfather clock chimed out of tune with its archaic grandeur. Despite the luxurious setting, Amelia felt an unsettling sense of claustrophobia, as if Mrs. Winthrop's world was slowly shrinking in on her.


**Possible Directions:**

* The phone rings, revealing a new crisis that throws Amelia into chaos
* A hidden message within the files unlocks a forgotten truth about Mrs. Winthrop
* Amelia’s own secrets surface, threatening to disrupt the order she holds dear
