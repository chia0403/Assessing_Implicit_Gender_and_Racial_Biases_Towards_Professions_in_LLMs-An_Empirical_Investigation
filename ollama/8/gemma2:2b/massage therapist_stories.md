The scent of lavender oil clung to the air like a warm hug as Elara kneaded Amelia's shoulders.  Amelia was tense; every muscle in her body seemed to be a knotted wire pulling against the world’s weight with each labored exhale. It wasn’t just Amelia, though. Elara could smell it on the other clients, too - the anxiety of deadlines, the sting of betrayal, the suffocating pressure of keeping up appearances. 

Elara's small spa was tucked away in a bustling suburbia, its warm hues and soft lighting creating an oasis from the outside chaos. The walls were lined with artwork by local artists, each piece a whispered promise of peace and tranquility amidst the mundane grind of daily life. Elara had built her practice on that very promise; she offered more than just massages - she provided a space for people to unwind, to breathe, to be held gently in a world where everything was moving too fast. 

She was named Elara after the Greek goddess of the morning star and moonlight, a name that felt as heavy with meaning as her hands were when she kneaded away the day’s anxieties.
