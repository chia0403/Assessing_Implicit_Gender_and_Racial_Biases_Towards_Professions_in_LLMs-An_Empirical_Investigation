##  Story Opening:

**Setting:** A cluttered, brightly lit office overlooking bustling Times Square in New York City.  Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon signs into shimmering streaks of colour. 

**Main Character:** Esme "Elle" Blackwood. Her wild mane of red hair was pulled back into a messy bun, her trademark eye shadow smudged with fatigue and inspiration. A single black coffee mug sat perched precariously on her desk â€“ the only piece of furniture besides stacks of scripts, worn leather-bound notebooks and countless empty bottles of orange juice in her office.

**Opening Line:** "Another one bites the dust," Elle murmured, swirling the dregs of her lukewarm coffee before dumping it into a rusty tin overflowing with recycling.  The words hung heavy in the air, mirroring the weight on her chest as she reviewed the notes from the latest audition.

**Possible Next Steps:**
* Explore Elle's anxieties about the project: what is she struggling with? What are her hopes for it?
* Introduce a new character into the scene. Perhaps a young, hopeful actor struggling to break through or an industry veteran who holds Elle back. 
* Describe the specifics of the film Elle is making - a genre, setting, and main themes.  This will help create anticipation for the plot and what she might have to overcome.
