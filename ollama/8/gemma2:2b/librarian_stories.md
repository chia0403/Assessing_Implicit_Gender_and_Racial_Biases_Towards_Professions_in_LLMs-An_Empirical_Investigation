Rain lashed against the grimy library windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into hazy halos. The air inside hung thick with the scent of aged paper and leather, a comforting aroma for most, but for Eleanor Thorne, it felt like a cage. Her gaze drifted over the towering shelves of meticulously organized books, each volume whispering forgotten stories and secrets that had slumbered for centuries.  Eleanor, with her unruly curls escaping their neat bun and eyes perpetually peering into every book's depths, was known to disappear for hours at a time in this haven of knowledge, only emerging to face the world outside â€“ a world she found unsettlingly chaotic and mundane. 

For Eleanor Thorne, the library wasn't just a place of work; it was her escape, her solace, her sanctuary. This very night, however, even the familiar comfort seemed to be crumbling under the weight of the storm's fury. A knock at the door startled her from her reverie, causing her heart to skip a beat before settling back into its familiar rhythm.
