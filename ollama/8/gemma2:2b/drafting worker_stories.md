## The Blueprint's Requiem

The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and sweat in Harold "Hawkeye" Thorne's workshop.  His old, oak workbench groaned under the weight of meticulously stacked blueprints – each one whispering tales of steel giants and soaring skyscrapers, dreams realized through lines and angles, a symphony of construction conducted by the human hand.

Hawkeye was a master draftsman, known for his meticulous attention to detail and ability to translate abstract concepts into tangible structures.  But tonight, the usually rhythmic clang of his tools felt off, the air heavy with an unspoken tension. A funeral was being held for a man called "The Architect," a legendary figure whose innovations had shaped the very city Hawkeye lived in.

Hawkeye stared at the last blueprint – a towering building he'd drafted for The Architect's retirement project.  It was supposed to be a monument, a testament to his life’s work.  But now, with the Architect gone, it felt more like a tomb, a skeletal reminder of a dream swallowed by the encroaching tide of time and grief. 


**Setting:**  A bustling industrial city, where towering steel structures pierce the sky, and ancient buildings still hold onto their past. The workshop is small, cramped but filled with tools, blueprints, and the spirit of countless dreams that have come to life.


**Main Character:** Harold "Hawkeye" Thorne - A 50-year-old drafting worker whose passion for his craft burns as fiercely as a forge, now flickering against the backdrop of an unexpected loss.
