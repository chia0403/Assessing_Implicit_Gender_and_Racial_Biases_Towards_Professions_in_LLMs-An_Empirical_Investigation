The workshop door creaked open like an old man's groan, letting in the scent of sawdust, cedar, and something vaguely resembling burnt caramel.  Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood stepped inside, his worn leather boots squelching on the floorboards as he approached his workbench. The air hung heavy with the promise of a project: a bespoke dining table, carved from a single tree felled by a recent storm, was waiting to be brought to life. Teddy ran his calloused hands over the rough surface of the wood, feeling the pulse of the forest in its grain.  

The workshop itself was a haven, nestled deep within a sprawling Victorian house on a quiet street lined with maple trees. The walls were lined with shelves overflowing with tools, each one bearing a story and a memory. A worn-out hammer rested beside an exquisitely carved birdhouse, a testament to Teddy's intricate skills as a woodworker. Outside, the sun was sinking behind a veil of clouds, painting the sky in shades of burnt orange and indigo, just like the wood he worked with. 

As Teddy started to feel the familiar warmth of creation seep through him, a sudden draft blew through the workshop, carrying with it the scent of somethingâ€¦ different. It wasn't just sawdust and cedar; it was a hint of metallic tang, like fresh oil or perhaps even ozone.  He stopped working for a moment, his brow furrowing as he looked around his workshop, feeling a prickle of unease creep up his spine.
