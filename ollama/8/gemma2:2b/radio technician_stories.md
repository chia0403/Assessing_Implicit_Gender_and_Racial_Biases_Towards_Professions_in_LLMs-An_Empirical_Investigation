## The Hum

**Setting:** A ramshackle apartment in the heart of Boston’s bustling North End. Rain pattered against the leaky window, mirroring the rhythmic hiss of static that emanated from Elara Thorne's vintage radio.

**Main Character:** Elara Thorne, known to her friends as “Ellie,” is a wiry woman with eyes as green as emeralds and hair the color of storm clouds.  Her hands, calloused and strong, danced across the knobs of her radio, coaxing out faint tunes from the 1940s – a far cry from the crisp digital signals of today's technology. Elara was more at home amongst crackling static and hums than in the sterile world of modern electronics.  To her, the radio wasn’t just an instrument; it was a portal to another time, a vessel for stories whispered across waves. 

The only other occupant of the apartment was a grumpy Siamese cat named Marmalade, who eyed Ellie's work with disdain, occasionally batting at the dangling wires with a playful swipe of his paw. Ellie had found him abandoned on the steps outside her studio apartment back when she was just starting out as a radio technician. The creature had somehow become her muse and her confidante – an unlikely bond forged through shared hours in the silence of the crackling static.  


Tonight, however, Elara felt uneasy. A strange hum vibrated beneath the background hiss, like a discordant note against the familiar symphony of the radio. It wasn't just static this time; it was something else, something that made her skin prickle with apprehension.  A tremor shook the old building as if from an unseen force, and Ellie’s ears perked up, listening for any sign of change in the hum. The hum pulsed again, growing louder, resonating in the air around her.
