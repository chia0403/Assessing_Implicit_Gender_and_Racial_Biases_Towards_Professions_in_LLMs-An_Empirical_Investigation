The air hung thick with humidity as Amelia "Amy" Reed waited outside Mrs. Henderson's sprawling Tudor mansion.  Sunlight dripped through the leaves on the ancient oak trees lining the driveway like liquid gold, painting dappled patterns on the worn brick steps leading to the grand entrance. Amy, a recent transplant from bustling Chicago, felt like a tiny figure dwarfed by the majestic home and its towering shadow. The house belonged to Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose name was whispered in hushed tones throughout the community, known for her icy demeanor and even colder financial portfolio - one that included the entire block's property.  It seemed the only thing more imposing than the house itself was the silence surrounding it, broken only by the frantic chirping of crickets on the lawn. 

This wasn't exactly how Amy envisioned her days in this quaint town. She had left behind the chaotic energy of Chicago to find a slower pace, but something about Mrs. Henderson and the mansion felt like a knot tied too tightly around her stomach. Today was supposed to be a routine open house. Instead, it was turning into an investigation she wasn't sure she was prepared for.
