The air in "Scissors & Secrets" hung thick with the aroma of hairspray and lavender detergent – a peculiar combination that was somehow comforting.  Inside, the worn-out salon chairs creaked beneath the weight of its patrons: Mrs. Peterson's floral perm set to an alarmingly bright pink, Mr. Henderson nervously fidgeting in his oversized newsboy cap while waiting for a trim, and little Lily, who sat with her chin held high, refusing to let go of her mother's hand as she watched her own hair being sculpted into impossible, gravity-defying curls. This was Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne’s domain, the small salon nestled in the heart of Maplewood - her haven of chaos and quiet artistry. 

It was an idyllic world that Amy had built herself, one snip at a time. The past few years had been good to her – steady clientele, word-of-mouth referrals, even a small, growing following on Instagram.  But there was a persistent unease in the air, like a cat curled up against a dusty windowsill with its eyes fixed on something unseen. It whispered of secrets and whispers, of unspoken truths and hidden emotions. 
Amy, oblivious to the murmurs that swirled around her, was absorbed in the intricate art of shaping hair.  A sharp pair of shears sliced through thick auburn locks while she hummed a soft melody from an old vinyl record. The only sound louder than her humming were the rhythmic taps of her fingers against a wooden stand, as if counting down the moments before something important might happen.
