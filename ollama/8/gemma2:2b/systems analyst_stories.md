Rain splattered against the windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Elara's fingers on her keyboard. Outside, the neon lights of the city pulsed like a sickly heart, reflecting in the grime that clung to her worn office window. Elara, with hair pulled back in a tight bun and eyes constantly scanning data streams across her monitor, was lost in a labyrinth of code. For three years, she'd been hunched over this desk at Systems Analysts International - a world of binary logic and complex algorithms that felt more and more like an abyss after the sudden disappearance of her fiancé. 

The office, once buzzing with the camaraderie of colleagues and their shared passion for problem-solving, now echoed with Elara’s mounting frustration. Each line of code she analyzed seemed to lead her further down a rabbit hole, each dead end another painful reminder of her inability to crack the mystery of his disappearance.  She was on the verge of throwing in the towel when a single message popped up on her screen, seemingly out of thin air: "The key is in your dreams." 

**Setting:** A mid-century modern office building in Seattle, Washington. The company's sleek design and futuristic computers belie a stark reality -  one where Elara struggles to balance the allure of technological advancement with the brutal loneliness of an unsolved case.
