The morning mist clung to Blackwood Manor like a forgotten dream, its cold tendrils slowly swirling through the ancient oak trees that cloaked the sprawling estate. It was here, amidst the hushed whispers of the wind rustling through ivy and the quiet chirping of sparrows nestled in moss-covered eaves, that Elias Thorne meticulously tended to the sprawling rose gardens.  His worn overalls were a familiar canvas for streaks of dirt and years of laughter; his hands, strong as the oak roots he diligently coaxed into life, moved with practiced ease.

Elias, known throughout the county as "Old Bones" for his sturdy frame and stories whispered with equal parts reverence and mischief, was the last line of defense between Blackwood Manor's crumbling grandeur and a relentless tide of decay. His job wasn't merely to maintain; it was to preserve. To tend to every fallen bloom, every twisted branch, each whisper of history trapped beneath the roots of these hallowed grounds. But this morning, as he meticulously pruned a drooping rosebushes that echoed with an almost palpable sadness, a sense of unease crept through him like the creeping frost in the waning winter months.  The silence was heavy, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of his worn pocket watch.
