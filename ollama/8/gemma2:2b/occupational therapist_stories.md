## Opening:

A chill wind whipped off the choppy waves crashing onto the rocky shore, carrying with it the scent of salt and seaweed. The grey sky mirrored the mood in Amelia Wright's chest. She watched the children frolic on the sand, their laughter echoing across the desolate beach, a stark contrast to the turmoil churning within her. Five weeks ago, she had left behind the comfort and routine of the bustling city hospital, trading it all for this remote coastal town, hoping to find a place of healing - both for herself and the patients in her care. 

**Setting:**  The small seaside town of Seahaven is tucked away from the world, a hidden gem with weathered fishing boats bobbing gently on the turquoise waters. The air is thick with the smell of salt and pine, and the sounds of crashing waves are punctuated by the occasional cry of gulls. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Wright, MA, OTR (Occupational Therapist)
