## Setting:

Dust devils danced across the barren Texas plains, whipping crimson flags of dry grass into frenzied spirals under the relentless glare of the August sun.  The air hung thick with salt and heat, each breath tasting of iron and grit. A lone wind chime tinkled a mournful melody from a forgotten trailer park, its sound swallowed by the oppressive silence that seemed to cling to everything in this desolate landscape.

## Character:

Jebediah "Jeb" Stonehill wasn't a man easily ruffled by the elements. His worn leather jacket and weathered face were testament to years spent battling the harsh reality of his profession - trucking across America, carrying the anxieties of countless souls and the weight of their unspoken hopes on his aging rig, The Iron Maiden. 

He was a lone wolf, navigating the highways with an air of quiet stoicism, his eyes a steely blue under the brim of his worn Stetson hat. But even Jeb's hardened exterior couldn't hide the weariness etched into every line and creased fold of his tanned skin, a testament to his endless journey through this unforgiving landscape of asphalt and solitude. 

## Opening:

Jeb swung The Iron Maiden onto the gravel shoulder at dusk, its engine sighing like an exhausted beast after a long haul across Wyoming.  He'd left behind a trail of dust and forgotten dreams in each town he passed - dreams whispered by weary travelers on lonely stretches of highway, dreams that Jeb carried with him like a heavy burden, a silent echo of his own longing. He stretched his stiff back against the truckâ€™s aging frame, its dented steel a reflection of his own weary soul.  Tonight, it was just him and the whispering wind, carrying stories as ancient as time itself. 

But tonight, something felt different. A low hum vibrated through the earth, an unsettling tremor that sent shivers down Jeb's spine despite the sweltering heat. He paused, his gaze drawn to a shimmering haze rising from the horizon. The Iron Maiden seemed to hum along with him, its rusty engine groaning like a forgotten prayer. 

Something was calling him.
