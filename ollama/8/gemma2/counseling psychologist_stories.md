Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Avery's office, each drop a tiny hammer striking glass. The rhythmic drumming was almost comforting in its predictability, a counterpoint to the storm brewing inside her own head.  

Eleanor sat slumped behind her mahogany desk, staring out at the rain-slicked street below. Her once tidy office now felt cramped and oppressive, the scent of lavender hand sanitizer doing little to mask the underlying aroma of anxiety that clung to the air. She'd been on edge all day, ever since the call from Dr. Thompson, her mentor and former supervisor, informing her of his sudden, unexpected resignation.

The news had hit Eleanor like a rogue wave, leaving her reeling. Dr. Thompson had not only been her guide through the labyrinthine world of psychology, but also a close friend, confidante, and source of unwavering support. Now, with him gone, she felt adrift, uncertain about her own future at the prestigious New Haven Center for Psychological Wellness. 


The office building itself was a monolithic structure of steel and glass, towering over the bustling city center. Rainwater cascaded down its fa√ßade, creating shimmering rivers that flowed into the overflowing gutters below. Eleanor's office, perched high on the seventh floor, offered a panoramic view of the city, but tonight, it felt more like a prison cell than a sanctuary.
