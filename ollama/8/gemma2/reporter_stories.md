The acrid smell of ozone hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hayes's throat like cheap perfume. The roar of the storm, amplified by the metal shell of her beat-up Ford Focus, drowned out even the frantic chirping of the emergency broadcast system. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon signs advertising greasy spoons and discount pawn shops that lined Highway 127.  

Amy squinted through the deluge, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. The storm had rolled in faster than predicted, a wall of wind and rain slamming into the small town of Dustbowl, Nevada, just as she was getting close to her source. He'd promised her an exclusive - a scoop that could make or break her fledgling career at the Dusty Chronicle. Now, she wasn't even sure if he'd be alive when the storm subsided. 


Amy gripped the steering wheel tighter. This wasn't just about a story anymore; it was about trust and responsibility. She owed him, and more importantly, she owed her readers the truth.
