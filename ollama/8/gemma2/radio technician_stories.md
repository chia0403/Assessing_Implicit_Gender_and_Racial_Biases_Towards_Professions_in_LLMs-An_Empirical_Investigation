The incessant whine of the generator buzzed through Amelia "Amy" Grace's teeth like a tuning fork gone mad. Outside her makeshift shack in the desolate Mojave Desert, the wind howled a mournful tune across the parched, cracked earth. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the metal roof of her workshop into a furnace. Sweat trickled down Amy’s forehead as she meticulously inspected the tangle of wires and tubes snaking out from the battered radio console before her. She tightened a loose connector, her brow furrowed in concentration.  

This wasn't just any radio; it was her lifeline. Her only hope of contacting anyone beyond this forsaken stretch of wasteland after the Fall. 


Amy adjusted her headset, its earcups cracked and worn from countless hours of static and whispers. This desert oasis was all that remained for her – a rusted husk of a gas station with an abandoned motel attached, scavenged for whatever scrap could be salvaged. She had christened it "The Echo," hoping against hope that someday, someone would answer back.
