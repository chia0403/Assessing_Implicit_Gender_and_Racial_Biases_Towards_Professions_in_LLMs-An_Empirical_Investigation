The air in Mr. Hendersonâ€™s office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and old ambition. Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright, her auburn hair pulled back in its usual severe bun, navigated the treacherous sea of paperwork that littered his mahogany desk with practiced grace. She had been Mr. Henderson's secretary for ten years, a testament to both her efficiency and his peculiar lack of organization.

It was a Tuesday morning in 1948, and the city of Chicago hummed outside the tall windows, a symphony of car horns and distant construction clanging. But inside the office, time seemed to move differently. The antique clock on the wall ticked with an almost mournful rhythm, counting down the minutes until Mr. Henderson would finally emerge from his labyrinthine thoughts and demand her attention. 

Eleanor smoothed the wrinkles in a stack of invoices, her pale fingers gliding over the crisp paper. A sense of unease settled over her. It wasn't just the oppressive silence or the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun. There was something else, a subtle shift in the air that felt like the calm before a storm.
