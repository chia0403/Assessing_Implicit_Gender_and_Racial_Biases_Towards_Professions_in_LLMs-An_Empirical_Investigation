The scent of burnt toast and desperation hung heavy in the air of Eleanor "Ellie" Blythe's small kitchen. She stood perched on a stool beside the counter, her blonde ponytail swinging with each frantic stir of the quinoa porridge she was desperately trying to salvage. Outside, the rhythmic clatter of construction echoed through the bustling city of Chicago, a stark contrast to the quiet chaos unfolding within Ellie's own personal domain.  

Her phone buzzed relentlessly on the counter – an avalanche of texts from clients needing last-minute advice, her boss demanding updates on a new campaign, and then, a single text from an unknown number that simply read: "Meet me at the bakery tomorrow, 8am sharp." Ellie's eyebrows shot up. Who was this? And why were they so insistent? 

Ellie sighed. Another day, another plate of dietary dilemmas.  This wasn't exactly how she envisioned her life as a dietician – battling burnt breakfast and cryptic messages. But then again, nothing ever went quite to plan in the city that never sleeps.
