The asphalt shimmered under the relentless Arizona sun, baking the air into an oppressive haze.  Sweat stung Jeremiah "Jay" Hawkins' eyes as he wrestled with the recalcitrant coil of road striping tape. He adjusted his battered straw hat, offering little respite from the heat that radiated off the blacktop. The highway stretched before him like a ribbon of tar, disappearing into the shimmering horizon. 

Jay hated this stretch of Route 66 - miles and miles of nothing but desert scrub and the occasional tumbleweed rolling by on the relentless wind.  But it was his job, one he'd inherited from his father after the accident took him away. The solitude wasn't exactly what he craved, but it offered a kind of peace, a quiet that mirrored the vast emptiness surrounding him. 


Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in Jay's gut, a feeling amplified by the unnatural stillness of the air.  Usually, there was at least a hawk circling overhead or the occasional car rumbling past, breaking the monotony. But today, silence reigned supreme. Even the wind seemed to have forgotten how to blow.
