The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia “Amy” Harper like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Honda Civic. Spanish moss draped from ancient oaks lining Maplewood Drive, casting long, eerie shadows in the late afternoon sun.  A swarm of cicadas buzzed incessantly, their monotonous song punctuated by the distant rumble of thunder. 

Amy adjusted the strap of her shoulder bag and scanned the ramshackle Victorian house before her. Its paint peeled like sunburn, and a rusty swing set creaked mournfully in the overgrown front yard. This wasn't exactly the kind of property she usually dealt with.  She prided herself on showcasing charming bungalows and modern townhouses in the more affluent sections of Savannah. But desperation was a powerful motivator, and her phone hadn't rung with any promising leads all week.   

This house, though... it whispered stories of forgotten grandeur and hidden secrets. Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something lingered beneath its peeling facade. Maybe she could unearth a diamond in the rough, or maybe, just maybe, she'd find herself swallowed whole by its mysteries.
