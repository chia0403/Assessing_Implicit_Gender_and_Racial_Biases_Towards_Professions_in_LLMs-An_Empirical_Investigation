The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a symphony of autumn scents that Isabella "Izzy" Thorne knew by heart.  She adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel, feeling the weight of the brochures and maps nestled inside. The path beneath her feet crunched with fallen acorns and brittle twigs as she navigated the winding trail leading into Whisperwood, her usual domain for the afternoon tours. 

The sunlight filtering through the canopy was a mosaic of golds and reds, casting long shadows that danced around the ancient oaks. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, whispering secrets only the forest understood. This wasn't just a job for Izzy; it was an intimate conversation with nature she cherished every day.  

Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she scanned the familiar faces in her group - a gaggle of chattering college students on a weekend getaway. Their youthful energy usually fueled Izzy's own enthusiasm, but something about their wide-eyed glances and hushed whispers seemed out of place against the backdrop of tranquil beauty. 

As she paused to address them at the foot of a moss-covered monolith, the prickling sensation intensified.  She felt a sudden chill, a whisper of cold air that had no right being there in the autumn sun.  And then, she heard it - a low, guttural growl emanating from somewhere deep within the woods. The sound sent shivers down her spine and froze the excited chatter in its tracks. 


The tour was about to take a decidedly unexpected turn.
