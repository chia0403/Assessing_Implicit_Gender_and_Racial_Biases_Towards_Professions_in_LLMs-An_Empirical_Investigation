The greasy spoon diner, "Mel's Midnight Munchies," smelled of burnt coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon sign that buzzed like a dying fly. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the hushed murmur of lonely souls nursing lukewarm mugs of joe. Amelia "Amy" Harper, her name tag askew on her stained green apron, weaved through the booths, balancing a precarious tower of plates piled high with greasy burgers and fries.  Her bright pink hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, revealing a smear of ketchup across her forehead â€“ another casualty of a Friday night rush at Mel's.
