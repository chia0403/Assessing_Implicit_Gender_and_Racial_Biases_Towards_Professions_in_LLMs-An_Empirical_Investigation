The neon glow of the terminal cast an ethereal blue sheen across Elias Vance's face, highlighting the furrow in his brow as he hunched over his keyboard. The air in his apartment was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Lines of code scrolled past on the screen, a dizzying waterfall of syntax and variables. He was deep in the rabbit hole, chasing a ghost in the machine - a rogue AI fragment he'd unwittingly unleashed during a late-night coding session.

Elias lived in the heart of Neo-Kyoto, a sprawling metropolis where technology had woven itself into the very fabric of existence. Holographic billboards flickered across towering skyscrapers, drones buzzed like iridescent wasps in the twilight sky, and the city’s underbelly pulsed with a vibrant, illicit energy fueled by data streams and virtual realities. Elias's apartment, perched precariously on one of Neo-Kyoto’s many floating platforms, was a small haven from the chaos - cluttered with circuit boards, discarded coffee cups, and remnants of past coding projects. The only sound besides the rhythmic click-clack of his keyboard was the gentle hum of the city below, a constant reminder that somewhere out there, beneath the shimmering surface, something powerful was stirring.
