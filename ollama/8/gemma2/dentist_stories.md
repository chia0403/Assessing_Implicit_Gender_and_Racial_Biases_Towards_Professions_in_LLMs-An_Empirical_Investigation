Dr. Evelyn Amelia Hawthorne adjusted her surgical mask, the familiar scent of antiseptic mingling with the faint, lingering aroma of cinnamon gum in the air. Outside, the Chicago sun was blazing, painting the skyscrapers in hues of gold and orange, but inside her cozy dental practice, it was cool and calm. 

Evelyn surveyed her small waiting room: worn leather armchairs bathed in the soft glow of a vintage chandelier, framed botanical prints adorning the walls, and a ceramic cat figurine perched atop a shelf, its painted blue eyes seeming to follow every patient's movement. It wasn't fancy, but it was hers, a haven built brick by painful brick after years of grueling dental school and even more grueling debt repayment. 


Today, however, the usual calming rhythm was disrupted by an unsettling tension in the air. Evelyn could feel it in the way her patients fidgeted, their smiles strained, their eyes darting nervously towards the door that led to the back office. It wasn't a new feeling. Lately, whispers had been circulating in the neighborhood about strange occurrences, hushed tales of shadows flitting in alleyways and unsettling noises echoing from abandoned buildings.  

Evelyn dismissed it as mere gossip, city anxieties fueled by long winter nights and too much Netflix. But as she prepared for her next appointment, a prickle of unease crept up her spine. She glanced at the door leading to the back office, a flicker of doubt passing through her. What if the whispers were true?
