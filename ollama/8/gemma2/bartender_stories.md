The worn, mahogany bar gleamed under the amber glow of the hanging lamps, each bulb casting long shadows across its polished surface.  A faint melody drifted from the dusty gramophone in the corner, a melancholic blues tune that perfectly matched the mood of The Rusty Anchor. 

It was closing time on a Tuesday, which meant mostly empty tables and the low murmur of conversations winding down. But behind the bar, Amelia "Amy" Celeste kept her eyes sharp, polishing glasses with meticulous care. She knew every inch of this place, every crack in the floorboards, every dent in the countertop, and every story etched into its walls. The Rusty Anchor wasn't just a dive bar; it was a sanctuary for weary souls seeking solace in cheap drinks and even cheaper company. 


Tonight, however, Amy felt a prickle of anticipation beneath the familiar lull. A storm was brewing outside, both literally and figuratively, and she had a feeling that tonight, The Rusty Anchor might be about to get interesting.
