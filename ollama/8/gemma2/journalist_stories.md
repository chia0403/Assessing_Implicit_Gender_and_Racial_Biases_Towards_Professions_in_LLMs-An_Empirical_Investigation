The humid July air clung to Eloise Madeleine Dubois like a second skin as she navigated the labyrinthine alleys of Vieux Port. The cobblestone streets, slick with recent rain, reflected the gaslight in an oily shimmer, casting long, dancing shadows around her. A chorus of clinking glasses and raucous laughter spilled from the open doorways of cafes, mingling with the cries of fishmongers hawking their wares and the mournful wail of a distant accordion. 

Eloise tugged at the collar of her linen blouse, wishing for the crispness of her Paris apartment. Here, in Marseille, even the air held secrets, whispering tales of smugglers and whispers of rebellion. It was a city that hummed with a restless energy, a simmering undercurrent beneath the veneer of carefree revelry. And Eloise, with a notebook tucked under her arm and a thirst for truth burning within her, was determined to uncover it all.  

She had come to Marseille as a fledgling journalist for "Le Monde", chasing rumors of a clandestine network threatening the city's fragile peace. Her editor back in Paris had dismissed it as a wild goose chase, but Eloise knew better. She could smell a story like a truffle hound, and this one was pungent, tantalizingly dangerous.
