The humid Georgia air clung to Officer Eleanor Vance like a second skin as she surveyed the rundown trailer park.  Cigarette butts littered the cracked asphalt path leading to Number 17, its faded paint peeling like sunburned skin. A rusted swing set groaned in the breeze, a lonely monument to forgotten childhoods. This was her beat, the underbelly of Savannah where hope often withered and dreams turned to dust. Eleanor, a woman whose own life had known its share of hardship, understood this landscape better than most. She ran a hand through her tight braids, her gaze fixed on the peeling paint of Number 17. This was where Jacob "Jay" Daniels resided, a young man under her watchful eye, recently released from prison for petty theft.  Eleanor wasn't naive enough to believe in second chances, not really, but there was something about Jay's eyes, a flicker of vulnerability that hinted at a desperate yearning for redemption. Perhaps, just perhaps, she could be the bridge between his past and a future he desperately needed.
