The aroma of freshly brewed Ethiopian coffee filled Amelia Clementine’s tiny office, mingling with the scent of exotic spices from the travel brochures scattered across her desk. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and painting long shadows across the worn map of the world pinned above her.  

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Business had been slow lately. Her once-bustling travel agency, nestled on a quiet side street in Savannah, Georgia, felt more like a museum dedicated to forgotten wanderlust than a vibrant hub for adventure. The pandemic had dealt a crushing blow, leaving behind a trail of canceled trips and disappointed dreams. 

She gazed wistfully at the framed photographs lining her shelves –  a snow-capped Himalayan peak, the shimmering turquoise waters of Bora Bora, the bustling streets of Marrakech – each image a whispered promise of escape and wonder. Amelia yearned to rekindle that spark, to help people rediscover the joy of travel, even in this uncertain world. 


Perhaps today would be the day. A chime from her vintage phone startled her back to reality.  A new client was calling. Could this be the start of something new?
