The air hung thick with humidity and anticipation, the scent of stale beer mingling with the sugary sweetness of cotton candy. Neon lights pulsed in erratic rhythms against the weathered brick walls of The Rusty Note, casting an almost psychedelic sheen on the eager faces crammed into the dimly lit bar.

Estelle Claire Beaumont took a deep breath, her heart thundering a frantic tattoo against her ribs. Tonight was it. The night sheâ€™d poured every ounce of her soul into, every sleepless night scribbling lyrics in the margins of worn notebooks, every aching muscle from hours spent practicing scales until her fingers bled. 

Estelle adjusted the microphone stand, its silver gleam catching the light as she gave it a tentative tap. This was her stage now. A platform carved out of sweat and dreams, where the hushed whispers of doubt would be drowned out by the roar of her voice.  She closed her eyes, letting the bass thrumming from the speakers vibrate through her body, drawing in the energy of the crowd waiting to hear her story.


This was more than just a gig. This was her chance to break free. To finally prove that Estelle Claire Beaumont wasn't just another girl with a guitar and a dream; she was a force to be reckoned with.
