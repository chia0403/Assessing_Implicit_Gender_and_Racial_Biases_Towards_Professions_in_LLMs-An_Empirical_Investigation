The air hung thick with the scent of iron and sawdust in Silas Bartholomew's butcher shop. Dawn was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestone street outside his window. The rhythmic clang of his cleaver against the steel block echoed through the small space, a familiar lullaby accompanying the slow awakening of the city.

Silas, a man hardened by years of wielding knives and wrestling with primal forces, wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. His apron, stained a mosaic of blood and grease, hung loosely around his thick frame. He was a creature of habit, starting each day the same way: a quick breakfast of burnt toast and strong coffee, followed by the ritualistic butchering of the morning's delivery. 


It was a solitary life, but one Silas knew well. His family had run this shop for generations, their legacy etched into every chipped tile and weathered plank of the building.  But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up his spine, a whisper of unease that he couldn't quite place. He shook it off, attributing it to the lingering chill of the pre-dawn air. Business as usual, Silas thought. Just another day in the life of Bartholomewâ€™s Butcher Shop.
