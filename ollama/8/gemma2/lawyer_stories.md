Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Rose Beaumont's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Beaumont & Associates: Justice Served," seemed to mock her with its misplaced optimism.  

Amelia sat hunched over a mountain of paperwork, her brow furrowed in concentration. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the city of New Orleans hummed with its usual frenetic energy, oblivious to the legal battle raging within these four walls. Her phone rang, jarring Amelia from her thoughts. She snatched it up, her voice crisp despite the turmoil inside.

"Beaumont," she said, her tone leaving no room for pleasantries. "What is it?" 


The setting: A small, dimly lit law office on a rain-soaked street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. The building itself is old and creaky, with chipped paint and stained glass windows that cast eerie shadows across the worn furniture.
