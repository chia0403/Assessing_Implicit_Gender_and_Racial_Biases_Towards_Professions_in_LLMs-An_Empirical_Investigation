The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decay as Sergeant Alaric Thorne tightened his grip on the rusty spear. The rusted metal bit into his calloused palm, but he barely noticed. His gaze was fixed on the churning sea beyond the crumbling breakwater, its grey surface reflecting the bruised sky above. A storm was brewing, a tempest mirroring the turmoil in Alaric's soul. 

He stood watch at the outermost perimeter of Havenport, the last bastion of civilization before the encroaching wilds. The once-proud city walls now resembled skeletal sentinels, their cracked stone teeth gnawing at the unforgiving wind.  Within the walls, whispers circulated about a new threat â€“ something monstrous, lurking in the shadows beyond the tempestuous sea. 

Alaric scoffed. He'd faced down raiders, scavengers, and even the occasional rogue beast during his ten years guarding Havenport. A "new" threat was nothing he hadn't encountered before. Still, a knot of unease tightened in his gut. The storm felt different this time, charged with an unnatural energy that sent shivers crawling up his spine.  He gripped his spear tighter, the familiar weight offering a sliver of comfort amidst the growing uncertainty.
