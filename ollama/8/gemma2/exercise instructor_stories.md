The air hung thick with sweat and the scent of lavender essential oil as Amelia "Amy" Grace led her morning yoga class through Warrior Two. The studio, bathed in the golden light filtering through floor-to-ceiling windows, offered a panorama of the bustling city waking up below. Towering skyscrapers pierced the cerulean sky, their glass facades reflecting the nascent sun like a thousand scattered diamonds. 

Amy adjusted her own pose, feeling the familiar stretch in her hamstrings and glutes. She inhaled deeply, filling her lungs with the crisp air that carried the distant rumble of traffic and the faint chirping of birds.  This was her happy place: guiding her students through movements that built not just strength, but a sense of calm amidst the chaos. 


But today felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened in Amy's stomach, a feeling she usually managed to dispel with a deep breath and a mantra. It wasn’t about her class – they were focused and engaged, their bodies flowing with a grace that mirrored the morning sunlight. It was something else, a subtle shift in the air, an undercurrent of unease that seemed to emanate from the city itself.
