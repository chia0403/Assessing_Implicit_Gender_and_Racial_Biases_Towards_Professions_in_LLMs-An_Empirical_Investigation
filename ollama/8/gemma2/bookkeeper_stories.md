The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee in Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick's tiny office. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, London hummed with its usual chaotic symphony – the clatter of trams, the shouts of street vendors, the distant wail of a siren. But inside, Eleanor's world was one of ordered chaos: ledgers stacked meticulously on her desk, quills poised above parchment, and a single flickering gas lamp casting long shadows across her meticulous work. 

Eleanor, a woman whose life revolved around numbers more than people, adjusted her spectacles and dipped her quill into the inkwell. Tonight, she wouldn't be balancing accounts for Mr. Grimshaw's drapery shop or calculating Mrs. Peabody's tea trade profits. Tonight, Eleanor would face a mystery far more perplexing than any unpaid invoice – a missing sum from the Queen's own treasury.
