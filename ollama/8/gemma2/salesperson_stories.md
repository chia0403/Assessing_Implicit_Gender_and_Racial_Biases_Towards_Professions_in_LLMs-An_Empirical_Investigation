The humid Florida air hung heavy with the scent of salt and sunscreen as Amelia "Amy" Brighton adjusted her brightly-colored visor. Beads of sweat trickled down her temple despite the early morning chill. A flock of tourists, their faces pale beneath broad hats and plastered smiles, shuffled past her booth on the bustling boardwalk of Daytona Beach. Amy sighed. Another day, another dollar... or maybe just a few cents, judging by the lethargic pace of the crowd. 

Her booth, "Amy's Amazing Amusements," boasted a dizzying array of inflatable toys: giant unicorns, shimmering dragons, and even a colossal, multi-colored octopus that seemed to be perpetually caught in a state of mild panic. They were her pride and joy, each meticulously inflated and positioned for maximum visual impact. But the sun hadn't even reached its zenith, and she was already losing hope. 

This wasn't how she envisioned her summer. Back in Chicago, she had dreamt of breezy sales calls and a steady paycheck, not this relentless heat and the constant pressure to make every penny count. But then again, dreams rarely materialized as planned.


Amy took a deep breath, straightened her pastel-pink tank top, and plastered on her best smile. "Good morning, folks! Looking for some fun in the sun? Our inflatables are guaranteed to bring smiles to your faces!" she called out, her voice ringing with forced cheerfulness. A few children, their parents trailing behind them like weary soldiers, paused to stare at the colorful spectacle. 

This was it. Her chance. Amy launched into her practiced pitch, hoping against hope that today would be different. Today would be the day she sold enough inflatables to justify leaving the Midwest and becoming a beach-side entrepreneur.
