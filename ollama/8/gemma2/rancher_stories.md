The sun was already baking the cracked earth by the time Jedediah "Jed" Hayes pulled on his Stetson. Dust devils danced across the parched plains, kicking up small tornadoes of red clay that settled like rust stains on everything in their path. The air hung heavy and silent, punctuated only by the mournful buzz of cicadas. 

Jed surveyed his ranch, its sprawling expanse a patchwork of struggling cotton fields and withered grazing land. For generations, Hayes Creek Ranch had been his family's lifeblood, but this year, drought gripped the land like an iron fist, squeezing the hope out of every blade of grass and drooping flower.  His weathered face creased further with worry as he spotted a lone tumbleweed rolling across the dry creek bed that once pulsed with life. This wasnâ€™t just a bad season; it was a fight for survival. 


He spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust and muttered, "Time to find some answers, Jeb." His calloused hands reached for his worn leather chaps, ready to face whatever this unforgiving land threw at him next.
