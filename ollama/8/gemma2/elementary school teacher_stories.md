The aroma of stale pizza and chalk dust hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn linoleum floors of Mrs. Amelia Brightwood's third-grade classroom like a stubborn coat of grime. Sunlight slanted through dusty blinds, illuminating motes that danced in the stillness.  

Amelia surveyed the room with a weary sigh. Empty desks lined the walls, except for one occupied by a lone figure hunched over a drawing pad. It was Leo, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously shaded a picture of a snarling dragon. 

Outside, the world buzzed with the energy of a Friday afternoon.  Birds chirped, children shrieked, and the distant rumble of a passing bus echoed through the quiet suburban street. But within these walls, the clock ticked slowly, counting down the final moments of an otherwise ordinary school week. 


Amelia knew Leo was waiting for her. She always did. He never spoke unless spoken to, but his silence held a story she yearned to unravel. Today, it seemed even heavier than usual.  She crossed the room, her footsteps muffled by the worn carpet, and knelt beside him, ready to ask whatever question would finally crack open his shell.
