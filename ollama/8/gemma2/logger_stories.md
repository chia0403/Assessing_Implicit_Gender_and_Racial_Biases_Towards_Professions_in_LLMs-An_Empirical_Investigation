The first rays of dawn sliced through the dense canopy, illuminating a mosaic of emerald moss and sun-dappled bark. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, a familiar aroma that clung to Elias Thornwood like a second skin. He ran a calloused hand over the rough surface of his axe handle, its weight comforting in his grip.  Elias had been born under these towering redwoods, raised among the giants whose roots ran deep into the heart of their ancestral land. Logging was more than just a job for him; it was an ancient rhythm woven into the very fabric of his being, passed down through generations of Thornwoods before him. 


Today, however, Elias felt a tremor of unease as he surveyed the familiar landscape. The air seemed hushed, devoid of the usual chorus of birdsong. Even the wind, normally a restless wanderer through the towering trees, held its breath. He swallowed, pushing aside the unsettling feeling. There was work to be done, logs to fell, and his family relied on him.
