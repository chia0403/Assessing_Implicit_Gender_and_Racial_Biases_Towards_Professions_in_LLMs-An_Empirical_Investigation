The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia "Amy" Harper’s stethoscope echoed through the cramped examination room, bouncing off the faded floral wallpaper and worn vinyl furniture. The air hung heavy with antiseptic and the nervous scent of anticipation. Amy glanced at her patient, Mrs. Gertrude Peterson, a woman whose weathered face bore the stories of a life lived fully, now etched with worry lines around tired eyes.

The setting: A small town clinic in rural Oregon, nestled against the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Autumn had painted the landscape in vibrant hues of crimson and gold, but inside, the warmth of the sun seemed to struggle against the chill of approaching winter and the anxieties swirling within Mrs. Peterson's frail frame. Outside, a steady drizzle pattered against the windows, mirroring the quiet drumbeat of Amy’s heart as she prepared to deliver news that could change Mrs. Peterson's life forever.
