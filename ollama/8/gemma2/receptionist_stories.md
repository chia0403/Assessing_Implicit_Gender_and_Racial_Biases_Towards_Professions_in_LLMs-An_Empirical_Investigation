The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Perkins like a chorus of bored bees, their buzzing mimicking the dull drone in her own skull.  She chewed on the end of her pen, idly watching the swirling patterns in the dusty office carpet. Another Wednesday morning at Dr. Eldridge’s Holistic Healing Centre, another symphony of ringing phones and impatient sighs. 

Amelia glanced at the clock – precisely 8:02 am. The chime announcing the start of the workday still echoed faintly in her ears. It was a jarringly cheerful sound considering the bleak state of her own soul, which felt about as vibrant as a wilted daisy.  She straightened in her chair, forcing a smile as the door swung open and Dr. Eldridge's assistant, Brenda, bustled past, clutching a stack of files that threatened to topple over like a Jenga tower.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of the Holistic Healing Centre, its white clapboard facade glowing with an eerie luminescence against the deepening twilight. Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of lavender oil and stale chamomile tea – a far cry from the bustling energy of the outside world. The waiting room was filled with anxious faces, each radiating a distinct aura of need and desperation.  Amelia knew they were all hoping for a miracle cure, but she also knew that Dr. Eldridge's methods were more about placating the soul than healing the body. 

She sighed, her smile fading as another phone rang, shattering the fragile silence like a dropped crystal vase. Time to play pretend again.
