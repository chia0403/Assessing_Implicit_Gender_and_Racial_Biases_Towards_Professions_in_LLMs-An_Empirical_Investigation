The asphalt ribbon unfurled before Jebediah "Jeb" Blackwood like an endless snake, shimmering under the oppressive Texas sun. Sweat slicked his brow as he gripped the steering wheel of his Peterbilt, a behemoth christened "Ol' Bessie" in faded, chipped paint. The air inside the cab was thick with the scent of stale coffee and leather, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the diesel engine. Jeb squinted at the horizon, where the sky bled into a hazy orange blur, the setting sun casting long, distorted shadows across the desolate landscape. Outside Weatherford, miles stretched before him, empty except for the occasional tumbleweed skittering across the road like a lost soul. The radio crackled with static, spitting out snippets of country music and weather reports that offered little comfort in this sprawling, unforgiving land. 


Jeb knew every bump and pothole on this stretch of Highway 80. He'd been hauling freight across Texas for twenty years, his life a constant cycle of sunrise to sunset, town to town, load to unload. It was a lonely existence, but it was all he knew.
