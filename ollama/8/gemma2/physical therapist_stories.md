The air in the rehab gym hummed with the quiet clinking of weights and the rhythmic whirring of treadmills. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting long shadows across the pale linoleum floor. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, PT, surveyed her domain, her eyes sweeping over the patients diligently working on their exercises. 

Amelia loved this space – it was a testament to resilience, to the human body’s incredible ability to heal and adapt. But today, a gnawing anxiety sat in her stomach, a cold counterpoint to the warmth of the afternoon sun. This morning, Dr. Evans, the head physician at the clinic, had called an urgent meeting, his tone grave over the phone. Something was wrong. 

Amelia pushed away the swirling thoughts and focused on the patient she was working with – Mr. Jenkins, a retired carpenter struggling to regain strength in his arm after a fall. His face crinkled into a grimace as he lifted the weight, but Amelia encouraged him with a gentle smile. "Almost there, Mr. Jenkins, just one more rep."

The bell above the gym door jingled, announcing the arrival of a new patient.  Amelia looked up, her heart skipping a beat. It was Dr. Evans, his usually jovial face etched with worry. 


He walked towards Amelia, his steps heavy and purposeful. 
"Amy," he began, his voice hushed, "we need to talk."
