The insistent hum of the airplane engine was a familiar lullaby to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne.  Years spent crisscrossing the globe in economy class had taught her to appreciate its steady rhythm, a metronome marking time as she transitioned between cultures, languages, and lives. This particular flight, however, felt different.

Amelia stood at the galley door, watching passengers file into their seats on Air Oceanic Flight 342 bound for Tokyo. A veil of mist hung low over Newark Airport, blurring the city lights beyond the tarmac.  The air inside the plane crackled with anticipation – a mix of nervous chatter and excited whispers in various tongues. Amelia felt it too, a prickle of unease she couldn’t quite place. It wasn't just the looming storm clouds gathering outside; it was something intangible, a shift in the atmosphere that made her want to double-check every safety protocol.  

Her hand instinctively drifted to the small silver charm dangling from her keychain – a miniature airplane meticulously crafted by her grandmother. It had been with her since her first flight, a talisman against turbulence and uncertainty. Amelia squeezed it tight, hoping for smooth sailing as she prepared to guide these strangers through the next twelve hours.
