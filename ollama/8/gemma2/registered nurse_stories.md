The sterile scent of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a familiar aroma to Amelia Rose Hawthorne, RN. The emergency room at Mercy General Hospital was a whirlwind of flashing lights, hurried footsteps, and panicked voices. A symphony of chaos orchestrated by life and death, played out on gurneys and in exam rooms. Amelia navigated it all with practiced ease, her white coat billowing behind her like a storm cloud amidst the controlled pandemonium.

Tonight, however, was different. The air crackled with an almost palpable tension, a nervous energy that had even seasoned nurses like Amelia slightly uneasy. A whispered rumour about a mass casualty incident somewhere in the city had cast a shadow over their usual routine. Every siren wail felt closer, every patient arriving seemed more critical.  The hospital staff stood poised, waiting for the storm to break. 


Amelia glanced at the clock above the triage desk - 10:47 PM.  It felt like the calm before an impending hurricane. She took a deep breath, adjusting her mask and steelying her nerves. Whatever came through those doors next, she was ready.
