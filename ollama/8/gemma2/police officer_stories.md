Rain hammered against Detective Amelia "Amy" Hayes' trench coat, each drop exploding into a miniature firework on the slick asphalt.  The neon glow of the '24/7 Diner' sign buzzed across the wet pavement, casting elongated shadows that danced with the wind whipping down Elm Street. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and fryer grease, a familiar aroma in this forgotten corner of Providence. Amy hunched deeper into her coat, her gloved hand tightening around her badge as she approached the diner's entrance. A lone figure sat slumped over a booth by the window, their back to the door, shrouded in shadow.

This wasn't how Amy envisioned her Friday night.  But then again, life rarely unfolded according to plan in this gritty town.
