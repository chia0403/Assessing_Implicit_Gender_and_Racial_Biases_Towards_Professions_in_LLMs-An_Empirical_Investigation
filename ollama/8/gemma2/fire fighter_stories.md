The siren shrieked, a banshee wailing through the pre-dawn gloom, ripping Amelia "Amy" Hayes from a restless sleep. Her hand instinctively shot to her bedside table, fingers grasping for the worn photo frame holding her late father's grinning face. He'd been a firefighter too, his legacy burned onto her soul.  

A surge of adrenaline followed the photo's warmth. Amy scrambled out of bed, throwing on her uniform with practiced efficiency. The call: three-alarm blaze at the old textile mill on Elm Street. The same building she'd played hide-and-seek in as a child, its echoing halls whispering secrets of a bygone era. Now, they screamed danger.

The truck roared to life, a steel beast eager for battle. Amy slid into the front passenger seat, her heart drumming a primal rhythm against her ribs. The familiar scent of oiled leather and gasoline filled the air, a comforting blend that always brought her closer to purpose. Outside, the city was waking up, unaware of the inferno that threatened to consume its history. 


The pre-dawn sky bled hues of orange and red, mirroring the blaze consuming the old textile mill. Smoke billowed into the air, obscuring the cityscape in a menacing veil. The air crackled with heat, and the distant wail of sirens cut through the chaos like shards of glass.
