The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Harperâ€™s head like a chorus of discontented bees. She stared at the stack of legal documents on her desk, each page blurring into the next in a sea of jargon and legalese. It was 7:15 pm, well past closing time for most businesses, but for Amelia, the day only truly began when the office emptied and she had the place to herself. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard, was her sanctuary.

Amelia wasn't just a paralegal; she was a meticulous puzzle solver, piecing together legal arguments from fragmented facts and anticipating every possible angle before her superiors even considered it. She thrived in this quiet solitude, wrestling with complex cases while the city outside buzzed with oblivious life.  But tonight, the silence felt different. It held an unnerving stillness, like the calm before a storm. 

The office building, a grey monolith that scraped against the smog-filled sky of Chicago, was shrouded in darkness. A lone streetlight flickered outside her window, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn carpet. Amelia glanced at the clock again.  Maybe it was time to head home.
