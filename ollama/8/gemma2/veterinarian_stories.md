The aroma of disinfectant and stale coffee hung thick in the air of Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic, clinging to Dr. Amelia Harper's lab coat like a second skin. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing above the worn linoleum floor. A calico cat yowled plaintively from its cage in the corner, adding a discordant note to the steady hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. 

Amelia surveyed the scene with a sigh. Small-town life in Willow Creek, Colorado, wasn't exactly glamorous. But it was hers. Her grandfather had built this clinic with his calloused hands and unwavering love for animals, and she was determined to keep its legacy alive.  Even if that meant patching up a grumpy tomcat named Fuzzy Lumpkins with a penchant for chewing on electrical cords at the ungodly hour of 6:30 am.
