The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Maplewood Elementary's hallway.  Dust motes danced in the fading light filtering through the grimy windows. Dr. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles and sighed, rubbing her temples. The scent of burnt popcorn lingered in the air, a phantom reminder of the chaotic school assembly earlier that day. It hadn’t been a full-blown meltdown, not yet, but Amelia could feel the tension simmering beneath the surface, a pressure cooker waiting to explode.  

She paused outside room 204, her heart sinking as she heard the shrill cries coming from within. Mrs. Peterson's third grade class. Little Timmy Jackson was at it again, and this time, something felt different. His usual tantrums – stemming from an undiagnosed sensory processing disorder and a fear of missing out on playtime – were replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by guttural sobs. Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable emotional maelstrom she was about to face. Today, she wasn't just a school psychologist; she was a battlefield medic tending to the casualties of childhood trauma.
