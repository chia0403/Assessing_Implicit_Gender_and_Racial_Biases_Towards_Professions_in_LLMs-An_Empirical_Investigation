The air hung thick with the scent of lilies and dust as Emilia Beatrice Hawthorne surveyed the living room. Sunlight, slanting through the lace curtains, illuminated motes dancing in the stillness. This wasn't her usual clientele – sprawling mansions on manicured lawns overlooking the city, filled with collectors and socialites obsessed with the latest trends. No, this was Mrs. Agatha Blackwood's Victorian townhouse in the quieter heart of Edinburgh, a labyrinthine space crammed with dusty heirlooms and whispered secrets. 

Emilia adjusted her vintage spectacles, peering closer at the faded floral wallpaper peeling from the walls. A shiver danced down her spine – it wasn't just the chill seeping through the drafty windows. The house felt...burdened.  


Mrs. Blackwood, a frail woman with eyes like chipped turquoise glass, sat perched on a threadbare armchair, watching Emilia with a mixture of hope and trepidation.

"It feels," Mrs. Blackwood said, her voice thin as parchment, "like the memories are choking the life out of this place." 

Emilia smiled, reassuringly.  She had a knack for breathing new life into spaces, but could she do it here? Could she coax happiness from the shadows clinging to these walls?
