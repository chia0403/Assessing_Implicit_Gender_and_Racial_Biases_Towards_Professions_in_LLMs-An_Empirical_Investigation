The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's window, mimicking the incessant drumbeat in her own head. She rubbed her temples, trying to ease the tension that had become a constant companion since she started working at North Haven Psychiatric Hospital. The once-grand building, now clad in peeling paint and draped in ivy, seemed to groan under the weight of its secrets.

Eleanor’s office was small and cluttered, crammed with bookshelves overflowing with psychology texts, scattered papers, and half-empty mugs. A single, weak bulb cast a sickly yellow glow over the worn leather armchair opposite her desk. The air held the faint scent of antiseptic, mingled with something else – despair perhaps, or the lingering residue of shattered minds. 

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose panes in the windows. Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold. This place had a way of seeping into your bones, filling you with an unsettling sense of unease. She glanced at the clock – 4:58 pm. Her last patient of the day was due any minute.


He was a new case, referred by the local police. His name, according to his file, was Ethan Blackwood. And something about him, even in the sterile confines of his police mugshot, sent a shiver down Eleanor’s spine.  His eyes – cold, vacant, and unsettlingly intelligent - seemed to stare straight through the paper, into her very soul.
