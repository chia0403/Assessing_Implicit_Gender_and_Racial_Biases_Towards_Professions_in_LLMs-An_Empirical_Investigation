The rhythmic whir of the hospital air purifier was the only sound that dared to break the tense silence in Dr. Evelyn Alistair’s office. Rain lashed against the tall windows, blurring the cityscape into an Impressionist painting of grey and neon. Her desk, usually a battlefield of medical journals and patient files, was cleared for the once-a-week ritual – her meditation session with the holographic projection of Master Chen, a Zen Buddhist monk who'd passed away decades ago. 

Evelyn massaged her temples, feeling the familiar pressure building behind her eyes. The city’s latest outbreak, a highly contagious viral infection dubbed “The Shimmer,” was pushing everyone to their limits. Nurses cried in the hallways, exhaustion etched on every face. Supplies dwindled, and hope seemed to be fading faster than the daylight. This wasn't just a job for Evelyn anymore; it felt like a war against an unseen enemy.

Master Chen’s gentle voice filled the room, his serene image flickering as the projector struggled to keep up with the stormy weather outside. "Let go of your fear, Dr. Alistair," he said, his words laced with the wisdom of centuries. "Fear only magnifies the darkness. Find peace within yourself, and you will find strength." 

Evelyn took a deep breath, trying to quiet the storm raging both inside her and outside her window.
