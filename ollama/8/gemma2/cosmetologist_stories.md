The bell above the door chimed its usual cheerful jingle, but Amelia "Amy" Willowbrook wasn't in the mood for cheer. She was hunched over the salon sink, scrubbing at a particularly stubborn root stain on Mrs. Peterson's blonde hair, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

The air in Amy’s Corner, nestled in a quiet alley off bustling Main Street, was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and simmering resentment. It wasn't just the mess she'd inherited this morning – a disastrous home highlight attempt by a client whose taste in fashion rivaled that of a peacock in a disco – it was the city itself. The constant construction, the relentless summer heat clinging to the brick buildings like a humid shroud, and the ever-present feeling that everyone was rushing somewhere more exciting, somewhere that didn't involve meticulously applying gel polish or patiently navigating the tangled mess of someone else's hair dreams.

Amy longed for something more, a spark, a reason to feel anything other than weary resignation. She dreamt of opening her own salon, one filled with natural light and the calming scents of essential oils instead of chemical fumes. A place where she could curate a community, not just a collection of appointments. But that dream felt as far away as the moon, as unattainable as a perfect pixie cut on second-rate hair.
