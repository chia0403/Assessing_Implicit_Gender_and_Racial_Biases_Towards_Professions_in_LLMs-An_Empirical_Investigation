Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Portland were always at their most unforgiving on Mondays, when the coffee-fueled zombies of the business world trudged to the office with all the enthusiasm of a sedated sloth. For Emilia Rose Thompson, CPA, it was just another day in the trenches of tax season.

As she stood at her desk, sipping lukewarm coffee and staring blankly at the stack of financial reports in front of her, Emilia couldn't help but feel like she was drowning in a sea of numbers. Her small accounting firm, Thompson & Co., had seen better days, and Emilia was starting to wonder if she'd made a career mistake by leaving the corporate world behind.

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on her carefully coiffed brown hair, which seemed to be slowly losing its luster as another long day dragged on. Outside, the city pulsed with life – the street performers, the food trucks, the distant wail of sirens – but inside, Emilia's office was a cavernous, soul-sucking void that threatened to consume her whole.

And then, just as she was starting to feel like she couldn't take it anymore, the phone rang.
