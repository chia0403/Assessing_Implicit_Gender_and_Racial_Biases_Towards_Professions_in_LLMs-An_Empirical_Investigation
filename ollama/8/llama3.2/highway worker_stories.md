Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The sun had just begun to set on the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty roads and rundown buildings. The air was thick with the smell of grease and diesel fuel, carried on the wind from the nearby highway where 32-year-old Jack "Hawk" Hawkins spent most of his days.

As a highway worker for the state's department of transportation, Hawk had seen it all - the construction zones, the traffic jams, the endless stream of tourists who thought they knew how to drive on the highway but didn't. He'd been working the roads for over a decade, earning the nickname "Hawk" from his sharp eyesight and quick reflexes.

Tonight was no exception. Hawk was making his rounds in his trusty old pickup truck, checking the road conditions and making repairs as needed. The highway stretched out before him like a black snake, curving through the hills and valleys of rural America. He knew every stretch of it by heart, every pothole and curve, every place where the traffic got worst.

As he pulled into the next rest stop to grab a snack and refuel his truck, Hawk noticed something strange - a sleek black SUV had pulled over just ahead of him, its engine running quietly as if waiting for someone. The driver's side window was rolled down, revealing a pair of piercing green eyes that seemed to be watching Hawk from across the parking lot.
