Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn buildings. The air was thick with the scent of fresh cut wood and the sound of chainsaws echoed through the forest, where Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled logger in his late 40s, was working tirelessly to harvest the last remaining stands of timber on the family-owned land.

As he climbed down from the giant sequoia tree he had just felled, Hawk's calloused hands instinctively reached for the battered leather strap that held his pocket knife. The worn tool had been with him since he was a boy, passed down from his own father and grandfather before him. He tucked it into his back pocket, the familiar weight of it providing a sense of comfort as he gazed out at the forest.

Hawk's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of gravel crunching beneath tires, signaling the arrival of his truck, which he had left parked on the forest road earlier that day. The rusty old Chevy was Hawk's pride and joy, a testament to his resourcefulness and determination to build a life for himself outside of the city.

As he walked towards the truck, Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was as if the forest itself was watching him, its ancient trees seeming to lean in closer with every step. He shook his head, chuckling at the fanciful notion â€“ after all, he'd spent countless hours within these woods and knew them better than most. But a shiver ran down his spine nonetheless, leaving him wondering what lay ahead for Hawk Hawkins, logger extraordinaire, on this autumn evening in Willow Creek.
