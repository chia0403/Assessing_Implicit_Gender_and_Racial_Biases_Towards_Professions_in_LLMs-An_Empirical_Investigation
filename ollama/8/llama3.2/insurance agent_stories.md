Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty rain-soaked streets of New Orleans glowed like a dimly lit velvet painting in the faint moonlight that seeped through the steam-kissed windows of the office building on Canal Street. Inside, the offices of Bayou City Insurance Agency hummed with the soft murmur of computer keyboards and the occasional rustle of papers being shuffled.

Avery LaFleur, a middle-aged insurance agent with a sharp mind and a quick wit, sat hunched over his desk, sipping lukewarm coffee from a stained mug. His dark hair was flecked with threads of gray, and his eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of wisdom, gazed out the rain-streaked window at the city below.

It was 5:45 AM on a drizzly Wednesday morning in late October, and Avery was already buried under a mountain of paperwork and policy renewals. He let out a slow sigh, rubbed his tired eyes, and began to sort through the day's tasks with a practiced air of efficiency.

As he worked, the phone on his desk jolted him back to reality, shrill and insistent in the quiet morning stillness. Avery's hand shot up to answer it, and his voice rang out bright and clear into the receiver: "Bayou City Insurance Agency. This is Avery LaFleur speaking. How can I help you?"
