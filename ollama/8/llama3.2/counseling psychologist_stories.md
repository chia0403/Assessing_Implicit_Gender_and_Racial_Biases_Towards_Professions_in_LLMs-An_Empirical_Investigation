Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Thompson stepped out of the crisp autumn air and into the warm, golden light of his office, located in the heart of downtown Berkeley. The University of California, Berkeley's psychology department had provided him with a comfortable home for the past decade, and he was proud to be one of its leading counseling psychologists.

As he began to unpack the day's schedule from his calendar, the sounds of the bustling city filtered through the open window: children playing in the park, the rumble of the Bay Bridge, and the distant hum of students hurrying to class. Elliot took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scents of coffee and freshly brewed tea wafting from the café on the corner.

Elliot's gaze wandered over the framed photos on his office wall – family portraits, colleagues, and a few snapshots of his own travels abroad. He had spent several years working in refugee camps, providing psychological support to displaced communities, an experience that had left him with a deeper appreciation for the human capacity for resilience and hope.

Just as he was about to settle into his morning routine, his phone rang, shrill in the silence. Elliot smiled wryly – another long day of listening to students' problems, parents' anxieties, and adults' fears ahead. He picked up the receiver, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, one crisis at a time.
