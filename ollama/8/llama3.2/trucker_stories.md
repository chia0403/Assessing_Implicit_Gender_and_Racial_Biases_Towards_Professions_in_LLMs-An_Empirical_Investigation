As the sun set over the vast expanse of the American Midwest, casting a golden glow over the endless rows of cornfields and soybean fields, truck driver Jack "Hawk" Hawkins throttled back his rig's engine, bringing it to a gentle stop on the side of Highway 12. The worn leather seat beneath him creaked in protest as he shifted into neutral, his weathered boots scraping against the metal floorboards.

It had been three days since Hawk last saw civilization, and the isolation was starting to get to him. He'd been driving non-stop from Chicago to Dallas, hauling a load of auto parts for a factory that made everything from car engines to wheels. His Peterbilt 359, Bertha, had seen better days, but she was still running strong – for now.

Hawk stretched his long frame, arching his back and extending his arms over his head, giving a good yawn to signal the end of another grueling day on the road. He'd been driving trucks since he was 18 years old, when his father had taught him how to fix engines and drive the family business's rig. Now, at 45, Hawk was one of the best truckers in the country – or so he liked to think.

As he climbed down from Bertha's cab, the cool evening air enveloped him, carrying the scent of diesel fuel and exhaust pipes. The sky was painted with hues of pink and orange, a breathtaking sunset that would have been wasted on most men. But not Hawk – this was his country, and he knew every inch of it.

With a sigh, Hawk slung his backpack over his shoulder, loaded with snacks, maps, and a pocket-sized notebook filled with his own ramblings and sketches. He pulled out a worn mapbook and began to study the route ahead, his eyes squinting in the fading light as he plotted the best course for the night.

Little did Hawk know, tonight would be different. Tonight, fate had other plans...
