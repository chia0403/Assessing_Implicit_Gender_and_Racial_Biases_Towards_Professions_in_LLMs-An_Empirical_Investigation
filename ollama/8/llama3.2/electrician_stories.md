Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The kind of night where the darkness seemed to press in on you from all sides, making it hard to breathe. But for Emily Janelle Wilson, electrician and owner of Wilson's Wiring Co., the storm outside was nothing compared to the one brewing inside her own mind.

As she trudged through the downpour, her worn denim jacket flapping against her legs like a badge of honor, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the wind howling through the streets or the rain drumming against her helmet – it was the sense of unease that had been growing inside her for weeks.

It started with small things: a missing wire here, a faulty circuit there. At first, Emily had written it off as mere forgetfulness or sloppy workmanship on the part of one of her employees. But as the incidents piled up and the amounts involved grew larger, she began to suspect that something more sinister was at play.

As she walked towards the small office building where her company's main client, Ravenswood Enterprises, was headquartered, Emily couldn't help but wonder if she was in over her head. The building's neon sign cast a gaudy glow over the wet pavement, and for a moment, Emily felt like she was staring into the very face of her own demons.

But Emily Janelle Wilson was no ordinary electrician. She had a reputation for being one of the best in town, with a quick mind and a steady hand that could coax even the most recalcitrant wiring back to life. And as she pushed open the door to Ravenswood Enterprises' offices, a sense of determination washed over her – this was going to be the night that got to the bottom of whatever was plaguing her clients.

Little did Emily know, however, that this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her down into the very heart of darkness itself.
