Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set over the bustling streets of Manhattan, casting a golden glow over the towering skyscrapers of the financial district. But in the stately courtroom of the New York Supreme Court, the only light came from the faint glow of the fluorescent overhead fixtures.

Judge Emmeline Victoria Winters, a renowned jurist with a reputation for fairness and wisdom, sat poised behind her bench, her piercing green eyes scanning the sea of expectant faces before her. Her silver hair was neatly coiffed, framing a face that seemed to radiate intelligence and authority.

As she surveyed the courtroom, her mind turned to the case at hand: the highly publicized embezzlement trial of Marcus Blackwood, a wealthy businessman accused of defrauding his investors out of millions of dollars. The defendant was known for his ruthless tactics and cunning intellect, making him a formidable opponent in the courtroom.

With a subtle nod, Judge Winters signaled the bailiff to begin the proceedings, and the courtroom fell silent as the jurors took their seats. It was going to be a long night, but one that would determine the fate of a man whose actions had shaken the very foundations of the business world.
