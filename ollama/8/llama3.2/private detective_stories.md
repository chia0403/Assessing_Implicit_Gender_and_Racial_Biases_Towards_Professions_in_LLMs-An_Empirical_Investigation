Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Detective Emilia Victoria Wellesley stepped out of her office and onto the sidewalk. A haze of cigarette smoke wafted from the doorway behind her, mingling with the damp air as she took a long drag on her cigarette. The dim glow of the streetlights cast eerie shadows on the pavement outside.

Emilia's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, taking in the hurried pace of commuters and the distant hum of the city's nightlife. She was a private detective, not officially affiliated with the Seattle PD, but she'd worked with them enough to know their rhythm. And tonight was no exception - it seemed every last person in the city was trying to escape the rain.

As she exhaled, Emilia's gaze drifted back to her office building, a nondescript high-rise on the outskirts of downtown. The neon sign above the door flickered and died, plunging the space into darkness. It was a signal that the phone had started ringing - and with it, another case would be born.

With a sigh, Emilia tucked her cigarette into the corner of her mouth and made her way back inside, ready to face whatever secrets lay waiting for her in the rain-soaked night.
