Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn-down buildings. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, exhaust fumes, and freshly brewed coffee from the local diner next door. Amidst the hum of evening traffic, a lone figure stood out amidst the familiar landscape.

Kaitlyn "Kae" Thompson, a ruggedly handsome auto mechanic in his mid-30s, wiped the sweat from his forehead with a worn leather glove.
