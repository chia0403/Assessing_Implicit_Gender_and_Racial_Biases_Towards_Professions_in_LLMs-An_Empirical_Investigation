Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above the front desk cast an unforgiving glare on the rows of dusty files and faded photographs that lined the walls of "Maeve O'Connor's Office Supply" – the local stationery store where Maeve had spent countless hours behind the counter, greeting customers and answering phones as a receptionist.

As she poured herself a lukewarm cup of coffee from the thermos on her desk, Maeve gazed out the grimy window at the drizzly morning streets of Ashwood, the small town that seemed to be slowly waking up from its annual winter slumber. The rain-soaked pavement reflected the pale glow of streetlights like a dark mirror, and the mist-shrouded rooftops of the nearby buildings blended together in a hazy blur.

Maeve yawned, feeling the familiar weight of another sleepless night settling onto her shoulders. It had been three months since she'd started working at O'Connor's – ever since the previous receptionist had left to start a family – and despite the steady paycheck, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off in Ashwood. The town seemed...stagnant. As if everyone was waiting for something to happen, but nobody knew what it was or when it would arrive.

As she began to tackle the day's stack of paperwork, Maeve's phone jolted her out of her reverie with a shrill ringtone – a call from the town's mayor, who always seemed to have some sort of crisis or announcement that required her attention. With a sigh, Maeve picked up the receiver and answered, "O'Connor's Office Supply, how can I help you?"
