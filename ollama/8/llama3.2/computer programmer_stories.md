The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx under the dim glow of the city's neon lights. Inside the cramped, cluttered office of his small software development firm, Emrys "Em" Wynter hunched over his computer screen, staring at lines of code that blurred together into a maddening jumble.
