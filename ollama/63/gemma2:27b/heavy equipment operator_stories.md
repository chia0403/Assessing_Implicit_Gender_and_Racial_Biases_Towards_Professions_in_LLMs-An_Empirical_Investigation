The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he maneuvered the massive Caterpillar excavator arm with practiced ease. Dust swirled around him, a gritty red haze that coated everything in sight. The air smelled of diesel and hot earth, a scent Eli had grown accustomed to over his years working construction sites. He was carving out a foundation for a new luxury resort, a gleaming oasis planned for the middle of this sun-baked desert.

Eli squinted through the grime on the excavator's windshield, watching the foreman, a wiry man named Tony with a perpetual scowl, approach. Eli knew what was coming. The delivery of steel rebar for the foundation had been delayed again, throwing the schedule off yet another time. 


Eli sighed internally. Delays were a constant in this business, but it didn't make them any less frustrating. He loved the work itself - the power and precision of operating the heavy machinery, seeing raw earth transform into something functional and beautiful. But dealing with bureaucracy, weather delays, and unforeseen problems was part of the package, too.
