The air hung thick with anticipation, the scent of sawdust and sweat mingling with the faint, sweet tang of cheap champagne.  Backstage at the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre, Esmeralda "Esme" Beaumont adjusted her beret, its crimson feather trembling in time with her mounting nerves. Tonight was opening night for her production of "Macbeth," a risky gamble considering the theatre's decrepit state and Esme's penchant for unconventional interpretations.

The velvet curtain, patched with mismatched squares of faded fabric, threatened to sag altogether. The stage floor creaked ominously beneath each step, and the flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to whisper warnings. Yet, despite the dilapidated grandeur surrounding her, Esme felt a surge of exhilaration. This was her theatre, her canvas upon which she would paint a masterpiece of ambition, betrayal, and madness.
