The humid Miami air hung thick as Eliza "Liza" Cortez adjusted the microphone on her headset. Sweat already beaded on her forehead, even though the class hadn't started. The sun beat down through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the "Zen Zone" studio, illuminating the gleaming hardwood floors and rows of neatly arranged yoga mats. Outside, palm trees swayed in the breeze, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the sidewalk. Liza took a deep breath, trying to center herself amidst the pre-class jitters.

Today was different. Today wasn't just another "Sunrise Sculpt" class. Today marked Liza's first solo teaching gig after years of assisting her mentor, the formidable Ms. Delacroix. Excitement warred with anxiety in Liza's stomach as she scanned the expectant faces starting to fill the room: a retired accountant with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, a group of giggling college students huddled together, and a solitary woman in athleisure wear who seemed lost in her own world. Liza knew she had to deliver something special. 

She needed this class to be perfect. Not just for herself, but for Ms. Delacroix, whose gruff exterior hid a heart of gold and who'd believed in Liza even when Liza doubted herself. This was Liza's chance to prove she was ready to step out from the shadow of her mentor and make her own mark on the world of fitness.
