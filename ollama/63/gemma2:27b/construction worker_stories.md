The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar to sandpaper. He squinted through the glare reflecting off the chrome and glass behemoth rising from the heart of downtown.  It was supposed to be an architectural marvel, a testament to human ingenuity, but all Silas saw was another layer of concrete between him and the fading blue sky. His calloused hands gripped the steel rebar, his biceps burning with fatigue as he wrestled it into place. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the sunbeams that pierced through the skeletal framework of the building. Below, traffic crawled like a sluggish serpent, its horns a constant counterpoint to the clang and clatter of construction. Silas sighed, longing for the cool shade of the oak tree in his backyard, the scent of freshly cut grass replacing the acrid tang of asphalt and concrete.  


He knew he couldn't afford to daydream. Not with Foreman Jones prowling the site like a hawk, always looking for an excuse to dock someone's pay. Silas shifted his weight, feeling the familiar ache in his lower back. Just another day on the job, he thought grimly, another brick laid in the foundation of his ever-precarious future.
