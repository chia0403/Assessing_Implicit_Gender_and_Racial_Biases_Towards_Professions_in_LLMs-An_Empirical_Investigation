The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber, a familiar aroma that always calmed Elara Santiago. She wiped her grease-stained hands on a rag, her knuckles cracking in protest, and surveyed the cluttered expanse of her garage. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows, illuminating a battlefield of disassembled engines, rusted tools, and half-finished projects. A 1967 Mustang, its cherry red paint faded to a dusty rose, occupied center stage, its hood propped open like a gaping maw revealing a tangled mess of wires and metal.  

Today was supposed to be Elara's day off, but when Mrs. Diaz, her elderly neighbor, called in a panic about her sputtering Ford Pinto, Elara couldn't refuse. The old woman depended on that car for everything â€“ groceries, doctor appointments, even visiting her son downstate. It felt good to help, even if it meant sacrificing a rare afternoon of peace and quiet. 

But as Elara reached for her trusty wrench, a deep, guttural growl echoed from the street outside. She froze, her heart pounding against her ribs. That wasn't any sound she recognized. It was primal, menacing... almost like a roar.
