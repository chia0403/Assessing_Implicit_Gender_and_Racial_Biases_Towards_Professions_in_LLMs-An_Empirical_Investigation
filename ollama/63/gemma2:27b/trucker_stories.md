The Nevada desert stretched before Elijah "Eli" Blackwood like a wrinkled, sunbaked tablecloth, shimmering with heat haze in the late afternoon. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt 389 affectionately named "Betsy," rumbled along the desolate stretch of Interstate 15, her engine a steady, reassuring heartbeat against the oppressive silence. The air conditioning struggled valiantly against the inferno outside, but Eli could still feel beads of sweat forming on his brow beneath his trucker cap. He squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of civilization â€“ a gas station, a diner, anything to break the monotony.

His CB crackled with static, then a gruff voice cut through: "Breaker, breaker, anyone out there? Looking for company on this lonely stretch." Eli chuckled to himself. He knew that voice; it belonged to Old Man Riley, a seasoned trucker who'd been hauling freight since before Eli was born.  Eli reached for the mic, "Riley, you old dog, how's Betsy treating ya today?"
