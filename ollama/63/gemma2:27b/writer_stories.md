Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic drumming in Amelia Blackwood's chest.  Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, the blinking cursor mocking her sudden inability to string words together. Outside, the old oak tree groaned under the wind's assault, its branches clawing at the crumbling stone walls of her grandmother's Victorian home like skeletal hands.

Her normally fertile imagination lay fallow, the characters refusing to cooperate, their dialogue stilted and unconvincing. She sighed, pushing back her chair and pacing the cramped attic room, its air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams.  The storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil within her.
