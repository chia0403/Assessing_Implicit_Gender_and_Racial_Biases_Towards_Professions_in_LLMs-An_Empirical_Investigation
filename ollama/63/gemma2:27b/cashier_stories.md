The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the chipped linoleum floor and aisles overflowing with discounted candy and impulse buys.  It was 3:17 PM on a Wednesday, the kind of day where time seemed to stretch endlessly, punctuated only by the monotonous beep of the cash register and the shuffle of weary customers. Amelia sighed, her breath fogging up the plexiglass shield separating her from the world.

She longed for something more than scanning groceries and exchanging pleasantries with strangers who barely met her gaze. Something that sparked excitement, a flicker of passion in the mundane routine of her life.  Little did she know, adventure was about to find her, hidden amongst the discounted cereal boxes and two-for-one deals on toilet paper.
