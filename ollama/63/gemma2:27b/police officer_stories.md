Rain lashed against Detective Alistair Finch's trench coat, each drop exploding in a miniature burst on the cobblestones beneath his feet. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sickly sweet scent of lilies – a morbid bouquet left by the killer at the scene.  

Alistair stared down at the body sprawled on the rain-slicked pavement, its pale face illuminated by the flickering blue and red lights of the patrol cars. The victim was young, barely out of his teens, with a shock of messy blond hair and eyes forever frozen in a look of terrified surprise. A single crimson lily lay clutched in his lifeless hand, its delicate petals stained a gruesome brown. 

This wasn't Alistair's first encounter with death, but something about this case felt different. The meticulous placement of the lily, the victim's youthful face – it all whispered of a darkness that chilled him to the bone. This wasn't just another murder; it was a statement.  Alistair knew he was dealing with a killer unlike any he'd faced before.
