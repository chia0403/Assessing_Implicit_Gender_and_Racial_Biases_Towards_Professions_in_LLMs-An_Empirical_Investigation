Rain hammered against the warped glass of Elias Thorne's office window, mimicking the insistent pounding in his temple. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation, a cocktail Elias had become intimately familiar with over his twenty years as a private investigator. His desk, cluttered with overflowing ashtrays and case files teetering precariously on its edges, reflected the chaotic state of his life. A half-empty bottle of rye whiskey sat beside a dog-eared copy of "The Maltese Falcon," a constant reminder of the romanticized ideal he was struggling to live up to. 

A knock, sharp and insistent, pierced through the gloom. Elias sighed, bracing himself for whatever misfortune awaited him on the other side of the door. It wasn't uncommon for people to stumble into his dimly lit office seeking solace, or more often, answers that even a seasoned detective like him couldn't guarantee. He pushed himself out of his chair, wincing as his old knee protested, and shuffled towards the door.

"Thorne Investigations," he rasped, opening the door just a crack to reveal a woman shrouded in shadow. The flickering neon sign outside cast her face in an eerie glow, highlighting the fear that etched deep lines around her eyes.
