The smell of ozone and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air of Draftsmith & Sons, a scent familiar to Elara Thorne as the worn leather of her drafting stool.  Outside, the neon glow of New Alexandria's skyline bled through the grime-coated windowpane, reflecting off the polished surface of her latest design: a skycar chassis for the esteemed AetherCorp. It was supposed to be a masterpiece, sleek and aerodynamic, but Elara's hand hovered hesitantly above the stylus. The weight of expectation pressed down on her like a physical burden.

Draftsmith & Sons wasn’t exactly a glamorous place to work. Tucked away in a dilapidated warehouse district, its only adornment was a faded sign depicting a quill and compass intertwined with gears – a relic from a time when drafting meant actual pencils and paper.  Elara preferred the digital world of her workstation: layers upon layers of holographic schematics shimmering before her eyes, begging to be sculpted into something breathtaking.

But today, inspiration felt as elusive as a perfect sunrise in this smog-choked city.
