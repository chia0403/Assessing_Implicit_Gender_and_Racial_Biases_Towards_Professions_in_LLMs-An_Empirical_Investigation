Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest raging within her own chest.  The antique grandfather clock in the corner chimed twice, each resonant gong a hammer blow to her mounting anxiety. 

Eleanor was known for her calm demeanor, for her ability to sit with patients in their darkest hours and offer a lifeline of understanding. Yet, today, she felt adrift in a sea of uncertainty. Across from her sat Mrs. Evelyn Hawthorne, a woman whose eyes mirrored the storm outside, filled with fear and a chilling desperation. Mrs. Hawthorne had come seeking help for her husband, John, who claimed to be receiving messages from an entity he called "The Weaver."

Eleanor's office was a haven of warm wood and soft lighting, designed to soothe even the most troubled minds. Sunlight normally streamed through the tall windows overlooking the bustling city street below, but today the heavy rainclouds had cast everything in a gloomy, grey light. The scent of lavender from the diffuser she always kept running did little to calm the unease that prickled at Eleanor's skin.


This wasn't just another case of anxiety or depression; there was something profoundly unsettling about Mrs. Hawthorne's tale, something that whispered of shadows beyond the realm of reason.
