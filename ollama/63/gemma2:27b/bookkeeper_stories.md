Rain lashed against the warped glass of Bartholomew Quill's office window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already fragile pane. The aroma of damp wool mingled with the faint scent of lavender polish, a futile attempt to mask the underlying odor of mildew that permeated the cramped space above Mrs. Peabody's bakery. Bartholomew himself, hunched over his ledgers with a furrowed brow, smelled distinctly of stale bread and desperation. 

He was a meticulous man, Bartholomew Quill, his life as rigidly ordered as the columns in his accounts. Every day began at precisely 6:32 am with two slices of Mrs. Peabody's rye toast and a cup of lukewarm tea. Every evening concluded at 9:47 pm, Bartholomew retreating to his threadbare cot with a well-thumbed copy of "The Complete Works of Charles Dickens." But lately, even the comforting routine couldn't quell the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in his chest. The bakery, once a bustling hub of the community, was struggling. And Bartholomew, as its bookkeeper, knew the grim truth: unless something changed, Mrs. Peabody would soon be forced to close her doors for good.
