Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Silas Montgomery's already frayed nerves. The ancient wiring he was wrestling with hummed ominously, its bare copper strands threatening to spark at any moment. 

Silas, his forehead slick with sweat and grime, cursed under his breath. This ramshackle chicken coop on the edge of Blackwood Creek wasn't exactly the kind of job he envisioned when he'd struck out on his own as an electrician. He dreamt of sleek modern kitchens, smart home installations, maybe even rewiring a historic mansion someday. But reality, as it often did, had other plans.

The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth and chicken manure.  A lone bulb, dangling precariously from a rusted chain, cast long, grotesque shadows across the cramped space. Outside, thunder rumbled like an angry beast, mirroring Silas' growing frustration. He needed to finish this job tonight. Tomorrow was his niece Lily's birthday party, and he promised her a homemade cake with sparklers.
