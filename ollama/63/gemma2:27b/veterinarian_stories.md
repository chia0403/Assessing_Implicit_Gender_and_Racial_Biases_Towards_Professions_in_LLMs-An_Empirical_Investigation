Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Critter Care," blurring the neon sign into an indistinct smear of pink and green. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed, wiping condensation from her spectacles with a flour-dusted sleeve. Flour, because she'd been up since dawn baking for the annual Bake Sale, a fundraiser for the struggling animal shelter next door.

The smell of cinnamon and apples still lingered in the air, a fragile sweetness battling the pungent odor of disinfectant and anxiety that permeated the clinic. Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ 7:45 pm. Another slow Wednesday night. She straightened the collar of her rumpled shirt, its once-crisp white now tinged with a faint yellowing from countless late nights tending to injured strays and beloved pets.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jangled, shattering the quiet. A figure stepped inside, silhouetted against the swirling rain outside. Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. This wasn't just any patient. It was the infamous Mr. Hawthorne, recluse of Hawthorn Manor, rumored to own exotic creatures beyond imagination.
