Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the community center, each drop sounding like a hammer blow. Emilia Castillo, her dark curls escaping their braid, sighed as she surveyed the room. Empty chairs circled a makeshift table covered with brightly colored construction paper and half-used glue sticks. The air hung heavy with the scent of bleach and disappointment.

Emilia had poured her heart into this free occupational therapy workshop for the local seniors, dreaming of helping them regain lost dexterity and confidence through crafts and simple exercises. But so far, not a single soul had shown up.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 2:15 pm. Fifteen minutes past the starting time. Maybe they were just running late?

Suddenly, a tentative knock on the door jolted her from her thoughts. Emilia hurried to open it, a hopeful smile spreading across her face.  A frail figure stood in the doorway, clutching a worn walking stick and shielding her eyes with a hand wrinkled like parchment.
