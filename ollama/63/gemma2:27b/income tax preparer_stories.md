Rain lashed against the greasy windows of "Taxes Done Right," blurring the neon sign into an abstract smear of pink and green. Inside, Penelope Thistlewick sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. The rhythmic clatter of the old typewriter seemed to mock the silence that hung heavy in the air.  It was April 14th, the day before tax deadline, and the usual frenetic buzz of last-minute filers had been replaced by a disconcerting stillness. Penelope usually relished this time, the pressure cooker atmosphere where numbers danced and deductions were unearthed like precious gems. But today, a gnawing unease twisted in her gut. 

Her phone hadn't rung all day.  Not a single soul braving the downpour to seek her expertise.  Penelope glanced at the stack of neatly organized files on her desk, each one representing a life, a story. She missed the anxiety etched on their faces as they handed over shoeboxes overflowing with receipts, the triumphant smiles when she revealed an unexpected refund. Today, there were no stories to unravel, only the relentless drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the corner, amplifying the silence like a metronome counting down to an unknown doom.
