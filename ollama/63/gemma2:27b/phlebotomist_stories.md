Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Emilia Rose Santiago. She stared at the requisition form, the ink blurring through her frustrated tears. Another pediatric draw – this time for a tiny six-month-old with leukemia. Emilia loved children, cherished them even, but the sight of their fragile bodies, hooked up to machines that beeped and whirred like mechanical cicadas, twisted a knot in her gut. 

The small phlebotomy lab, tucked away on the hospital's third floor, felt suffocating tonight. The air smelled sterile, tinged with the faint metallic tang of blood. Emilia glanced at the clock – 10:42 PM. Three more hours until her shift ended. Three more hours of drawing blood, calming anxious patients, and pretending everything was alright when it clearly wasn't.

Suddenly, the phone on her desk buzzed, shattering the tense silence. It was Dr. Lee from Pediatrics. "Emilia, we have a new admission. A young girl, about ten years old, needs an immediate CBC." Emilia took a deep breath, steeled herself, and grabbed her supplies.  Another patient. Another story waiting to be told through blood.
