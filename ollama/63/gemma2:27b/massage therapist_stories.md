Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Now," blurring the neon sign into an abstract smear of pink and green. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright kneaded her thumbs into the tight knot in Mr. Henderson's shoulder, the aroma of lavender oil hanging heavy in the air.

Amelia loved her work; easing tension from weary bodies, coaxing muscles back to life. It was a quiet act of healing, a silent conversation between her hands and the stories etched onto her clients' skin. But tonight, even the soothing murmur of water trickling from the fountain in the corner couldn't drown out the gnawing unease that had settled in Amelia's stomach.

Mr. Henderson, usually a chatty fellow with a twinkle in his eye, was uncharacteristically silent, his jaw clenched tight. He hadn't made his usual jokes about needing a "tune-up" for his aging bones.  And there was something else, something hidden behind the veil of his strained expression that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine.

It started with a misplaced word, a murmured confession amidst the rhythmic kneading: "They're watching," he rasped, his voice tight.
