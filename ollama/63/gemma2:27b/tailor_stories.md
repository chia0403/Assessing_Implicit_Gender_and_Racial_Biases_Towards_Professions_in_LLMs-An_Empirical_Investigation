The pungent scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, swirling around Elias Alistair Finch like an invisible cloak. His workshop, nestled on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh's Old Town, was bathed in the warm glow of midday sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes. Bolts of vibrant silks, sturdy tweeds, and shimmering satins lined the walls, their colors muted by years of dust and the smoky haze that perpetually clung to the city. Elias, a man with hands gnarled from years of meticulous stitching and eyes as sharp as his needles, surveyed his latest creation â€“ a doublet for a young lordling, adorned with intricate embroidery depicting a snarling griffon. He adjusted a threadbare patch on his own waistcoat, sighing. The finer fabrics were reserved for the wealthy patrons who frequented his shop. For Elias himself, practicality trumped extravagance.

A sharp rapping at the door interrupted his contemplation. Elias wiped his hands on his apron and called out, "Just a moment!" He straightened the stack of unfinished garments beside him before making his way to the entrance.  The sound of muffled voices drifted in from the street, accompanied by the rhythmic clopping of horses' hooves. This wasn't an ordinary customer; something was different this time.
