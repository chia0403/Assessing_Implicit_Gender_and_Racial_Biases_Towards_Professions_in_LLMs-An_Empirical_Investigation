The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and cheap perfume. It was Friday night at The Rusty Spatula, and Amelia "Amy" Callahan weaved through the boisterous crowd like a seasoned mariner navigating stormy seas. Plates teetered precariously in her hands, a symphony of clattering china and murmured orders. Amy's smile was fixed, plastered on with years of practice. It hid the fatigue gnawing at her bones, the ache in her feet from standing for hours, and the ever-present worry about making rent.

The Rusty Spatula wasn't fancy - red vinyl booths, flickering fluorescent lights, and a perpetually sticky floor. It was a haven for late-night workers, weary travelers, and anyone craving greasy comfort food at a bargain price. Amy knew every nook and cranny of the place, every crack in the Formica countertop, every chipped plate in the stack. It was her world, chaotic and messy, but strangely comforting.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine as she spotted a figure hunched in the shadowy corner booth - a stranger shrouded in a dark coat, their face obscured by the low-hanging brim of a fedora.

The air around them seemed to shimmer with an unnatural chill, and Amy instinctively slowed her pace.  What was it about this person that sent shivers down her spine? Was it just the late hour, or was something else at play?
