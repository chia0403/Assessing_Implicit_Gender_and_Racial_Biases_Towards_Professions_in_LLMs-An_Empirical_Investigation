The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung thick with the scent of aged paper and leather, a comforting aroma that Amelia Winthrop found more alluring than any perfume. Sunlight slanted through the arched stained-glass windows, painting kaleidoscopic patterns across the worn oak floorboards. Dust motes danced in the luminous beams, swirling like miniature galaxies. Amelia, her silver hair neatly pinned beneath a crisp white bun, navigated the labyrinthine shelves with practiced ease, her fingers trailing along the spines of ancient tomes.

Today was particularly quiet. The usual symphony of rustling pages and hushed whispers had been replaced by an almost unsettling stillness. Even the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to tick more slowly, its measured rhythm echoing the unease that prickled at Amelia's skin. Something was amiss.
