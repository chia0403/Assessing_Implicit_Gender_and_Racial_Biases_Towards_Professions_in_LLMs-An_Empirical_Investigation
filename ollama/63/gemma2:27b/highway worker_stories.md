The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's back, turning the sweat beneath his neon safety vest into a shimmering mirage. He wiped his brow with a grimy rag, leaving behind streaks of dust and grease. The air hung heavy and still, thick with the smell of asphalt and gasoline. Around him, cars roared past on Interstate 40, their horns blaring a symphony of impatience. Silas barely registered the noise anymore. He'd spent years patching potholes and repaving lanes under this relentless Arizona sun, his world reduced to the rhythmic hiss of the jackhammer and the gritty texture of asphalt beneath his calloused fingers.  Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease ran down his spine as he surveyed the seemingly endless ribbon of highway stretching before him. It wasn't the heat, nor the usual rush hour din that bothered him.

It was the silence. 

For the first time in Silas's memory, there were no cars on the horizon. Just a shimmering mirage and the unnerving stillness broken only by the distant caw of a crow.
