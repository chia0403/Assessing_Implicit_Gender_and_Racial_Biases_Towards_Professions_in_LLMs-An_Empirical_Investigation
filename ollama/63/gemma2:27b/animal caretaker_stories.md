The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of "Whisker Haven," painting elongated shadows across the rows of cages.  Eleanor Beatrice Finchley, affectionately known as Ellie to the animals she cared for, sighed contentedly as she refilled the water dish in the rabbit enclosure. The air buzzed with a familiar symphony: the soft chirps of finches, the rhythmic thrumming of a bearded dragon's tail against his basking rock, and the occasional meow demanding attention from a sleek Siamese cat named Luna. 

Ellie loved her work at Whisker Haven, a small, no-kill animal shelter tucked away on the outskirts of Willow Creek.  It was more than just a job; it was her calling, a sanctuary for lost souls, both furry and feathered.
