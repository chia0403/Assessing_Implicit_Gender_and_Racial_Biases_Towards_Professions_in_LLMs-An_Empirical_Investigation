The air in "The Rusty Sprocket" hung thick with the scent of stale beer, sawdust, and regret. A haze of cigarette smoke danced beneath the flickering neon sign that declared, in chipped red letters: "Drinks, Darts, Dreams."  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest of the week, which meant Elias Blackwood had ample time to brood over the contents of his half-empty whiskey glass while polishing glasses with an absentminded fervor. 

Elias wasn't built for bartending. Tall and lean, with sharp cheekbones and eyes that held a permanent melancholic glint, he looked more suited to brooding in a dusty library than slinging drinks behind a sticky counter. But fate, it seemed, had other plans. He was stuck here, a captive of his own circumstances, pouring solace into the glasses of strangers while drowning his own sorrows in the amber liquid at the bottom of his glass.
