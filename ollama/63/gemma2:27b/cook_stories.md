The air in "Chez Celeste" hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and roasting rosemary.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy window above the sink, catching motes of dust dancing in its warmth. Beatrice Delacroix, her brow furrowed in concentration, expertly maneuvered a cast iron pan over the sputtering flames of the ancient stove. Her movements were fluid, almost rhythmic, honed by years of tireless practice.

Beatrice wasn't just any cook; she was a maestro of flavors, a weaver of culinary magic. In this ramshackle bistro tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Montmartre, Paris, she transformed humble ingredients into symphonies for the senses. But tonight, a disquieting note hung in the air - a sense of unease that prickled at Beatrice's intuition. It started with a cryptic message scrawled on a crumpled napkin left on her doorstep, and now, a shadowy figure lurking across the street, watching her every move.
