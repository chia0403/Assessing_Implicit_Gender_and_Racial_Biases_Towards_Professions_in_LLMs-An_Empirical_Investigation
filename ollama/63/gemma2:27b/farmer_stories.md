The first rays of dawn bled across the horizon, painting the endless fields of barley gold. A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, its call echoing through the stillness of the pre-dawn air. Elias Thorne, his face weathered like old leather from years under the relentless sun, squinted at the rising sky.  He inhaled deeply, the crisp scent of damp earth and ripening grain filling his lungs. Another day began on the Thorne farm, a legacy passed down for generations in this fertile valley nestled between rolling hills. Elias ran a calloused hand over the worn handle of his pitchfork, feeling the familiar weight grounding him. Today was harvest day, a time of both celebration and exhaustion.
