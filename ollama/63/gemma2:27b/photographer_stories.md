The rusty clang of the Ferris wheel echoed across the deserted boardwalk, each creak sounding like a skeletal finger tapping against Evelyn "Eve" Thorne's windowpane. Salt air whipped her black hair around her face as she squinted through the viewfinder of her vintage Nikon F3. The carnival lights below, once vibrant and alluring, now lay dormant, their colours dulled by the encroaching twilight.

Eve had always been drawn to abandoned places, finding beauty in the decay and echoes of past revelry. This derelict seaside amusement park, with its crumbling rollercoasters and silent carousel horses, was a treasure trove for her lens. Tonight, though, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. 


Eve lowered her camera, a shiver crawling down her spine. A faint hum vibrated through the boardwalk planks beneath her feet. It wasn't the familiar groan of aging wood, but something deeper, more rhythmic, like a heartbeat. She glanced around, searching for the source, but the shadows cast by the setting sun concealed all but the ghostly silhouettes of rusted attractions.

Eve knew she should leave. The park was officially closed after sundown, and her curiosity was starting to feel dangerously close to foolish recklessness. But the hum pulsed louder, pulling her in like an unseen tide. Taking a deep breath, Eve tightened her grip on her camera and ventured deeper into the heart of the abandoned amusement park.
