The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, clinging to Elias Bartholomew Finch like a second skin as he wrestled another oversized suitcase up the grand staircase of The Majestic Hotel.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained glass dome overhead, cast fractured rainbows across the plush red carpet, making it seem as though shimmering jewels had been scattered carelessly beneath his feet. The scent of lilies and beeswax polish mingled with the faint tang of chlorine from the indoor pool, creating a uniquely opulent olfactory cocktail that Elias was all too familiar with.

Elias loved the Majestic; he loved its gilded grandeur, the hushed whispers of wealth echoing in the marble hallways, and the constant stream of fascinating faces passing through its doors. But today, even the hotel's usual charm couldn't quite lift his spirits. A persistent ache had settled in his chest, a reminder of his dwindling savings and the ever-present fear that he might soon be out on the street.
