Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frenetic strokes Amelia Rosalind Sinclair was laying onto her canvas. The cramped space smelled faintly of turpentine and damp wood, a familiar and comforting aroma. Light filtered in through the grime-coated glass, casting long shadows across the room cluttered with easels, paint tubes, and canvases stacked precariously against every wall.

Amelia paused, stepping back to survey her work. A tempestuous seascape was slowly taking shape, the churning waves mirroring the storm raging outside. But something felt off. The energy, the raw power she aimed to capture, seemed to be missing. Frustration gnawed at her. She longed to paint with the vibrancy and intensity of her idol, Van Gogh, but her own brushstrokes felt hesitant, lacking that crucial spark. 

Just then, a sharp rapping sound echoed from the attic door below. Amelia's heart skipped a beat. Visitors were rare in this forgotten corner of her grandmother's rambling Victorian house.
