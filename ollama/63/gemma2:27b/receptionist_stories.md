The incessant chirp of the antique phone on Eleanor Beatrice Finch's desk grated on her nerves like sandpaper against raw skin. She idly twirled a lock of auburn hair around her finger, watching the dust motes dance in the sliver of sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane. The waiting room of "Dr. Thaddeus Blackwood & Associates: Purveyors of Fine and Unusual Antiquities" was eerily silent, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock whose pendulum seemed to swing with the languid boredom Eleanor had come to embody. 

Outside, the bustling city of Arkham roared with its usual symphony of honking cars, screeching trams, and distant shouts. But within these four walls, tucked away in a dimly lit corner on the third floor of an aging Victorian townhouse, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. Eleanor longed for something, anything, to break the monotony. A glimpse into the dusty artifacts lining the shelves, a peek at the mysterious clientele that frequented this peculiar establishment, even just a stray thought beyond the drudgery of answering phones and filing invoices â€“ anything but this suffocating stillness.
