Smoke choked the air, thick and acrid, stinging Elias Thorne's eyes even through the mask.  The inferno roared behind him, devouring the once-humble apartment building with insatiable hunger. Each floor was a pyre, windows glowing malevolent orange against the twilight sky. Elias, Captain of Engine 27, scanned the scene, his heart pounding in rhythm with the sirens wailing nearby. Above him, flames licked at the fourth story, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the street below. He could hear the panicked screams of trapped residents echoing from within the blaze. Elias tightened his grip on the hose, adrenaline surging through his veins.

Tonight was a night for heroes. Tonight, Elias Thorne would be one.
