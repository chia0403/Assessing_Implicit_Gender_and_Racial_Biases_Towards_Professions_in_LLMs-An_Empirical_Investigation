Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the Weatherby & Sons law firm, blurring the already dimly lit street below. Penelope Ainsworth adjusted her spectacles, the worn frames digging into the bridge of her nose, and sighed. The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly towards five o'clock, but Mr. Weatherby, a man with more punctuality than compassion, was nowhere to be seen.

Penelope tapped a manicured fingernail against the stack of files piled precariously on her desk â€“ contracts, wills, depositions, all demanding her attention. She longed for the comforting routine of sorting and filing, for the quiet satisfaction of bringing order to chaos. But today, the air hung heavy with a strange tension, a premonition that whispered something was amiss.  

The mahogany door creaked open, startling Penelope from her thoughts. A tall figure silhouetted against the gloomy hallway stepped inside, his face hidden in the shadows.  "Penelope," a voice rumbled, deep and unfamiliar, "Mr. Weatherby requests your presence immediately."
