Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy Hospital, each gust sending shivers down Amelia Rose Hawthorne's spine. The old building groaned under the assault, its bones weary from decades of carrying the weight of hope and heartbreak.

Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its braid, tugged her thin cardigan tighter.  Even with the relentless heater blasting in the nurses' station, a chill clung to her. It wasn't just the weather; it was the oppressive quiet that had settled over the usually bustling ward since midnight. 


The steady beep of heart monitors and the occasional wheeze from a struggling patient punctuated the silence. Tonight felt different, heavier somehow, like something unseen lurked in the shadows, waiting to strike. Amelia, with five years under her belt as a registered nurse on Mercy's third floor, couldn't shake the feeling that tonight wouldn't be an ordinary shift.
