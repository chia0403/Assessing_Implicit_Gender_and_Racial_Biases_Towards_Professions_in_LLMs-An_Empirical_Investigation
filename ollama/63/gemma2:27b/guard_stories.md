The biting wind whipped across the obsidian plains, stinging Seraphina Thorne's exposed cheeks and tugging at the frayed edges of her woolen cloak. Above, the twin moons cast an ethereal glow upon the crumbling ruins that sprawled before her, their jagged silhouettes stark against the bruised purple sky. 

Seraphina shifted her weight from one foot to the other, her gaze sweeping across the desolate landscape. For centuries, these ruins had stood as a silent testament to a forgotten civilization, their secrets buried beneath layers of sand and rubble. Now, they served as the last bastion of defense against the encroaching Shadowblight - a creeping darkness that threatened to consume all life in its path.

As a Guardian sworn to protect the remnants of her world, Seraphina's duty was both daunting and solitary. She stood alone atop the highest watchtower, her only companions the howling wind and the ghosts of a forgotten past.
