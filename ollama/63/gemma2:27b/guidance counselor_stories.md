Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over stacks of college applications and tear-stained tissues scattered across her desk.  Eleanor was known for her empathy and unwavering belief in her students at Northwood High, but today, that wellspring of patience felt dangerously close to running dry.

The smell of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to the late nights Eleanor had been pulling, trying to navigate the increasingly complex world of college admissions. Standardized tests scores were soaring, extracurriculars were becoming ludicrously ambitious, and the pressure on teenagers seemed to be reaching an unbearable level.  


Eleanor sighed, rubbing her temples as she stared out at the grey sky. She knew there was a reason she'd chosen this profession: to guide young minds towards their futures, to help them find their passion and purpose. But lately, it felt like she was fighting a losing battle against a system that valued achievement over well-being.

Just then, a hesitant knock broke through her thoughts. Eleanor straightened in her chair, plastering on a smile. "Come in," she called out, bracing herself for whatever storm the next student might bring.
