Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside him.  Stacks of invoices towered on his desk like precarious mountains, each one representing another sleepless night and a growing sense of dread. Bart, a meticulous accountant known for his unwavering calm, was starting to unravel. His usually tidy workspace reflected the chaos in his mind - stray receipts spilled across the floor, and a half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned beside a mug stained with cold coffee. 

The setting sun cast long, ominous shadows across the cramped office, nestled within a labyrinthine building on Wall Street. Outside, the bustling city had succumbed to the downpour, its symphony of horns and sirens muffled by the relentless rain.  Bart knew he should leave for the night, but the looming deadline for the Hawthorne Holdings audit kept him tethered to his chair. He stared at the complex spreadsheet on his screen, numbers blurring together in a dizzying dance. This wasn't just any audit; it was the biggest case of his career, and failure meant losing everything he had worked for.

The phone on his desk chirped, breaking the silence. A sharp pang of anxiety shot through him as he recognized the caller ID - Mr. Hawthorne himself.  Bart knew this call could make or break him.
