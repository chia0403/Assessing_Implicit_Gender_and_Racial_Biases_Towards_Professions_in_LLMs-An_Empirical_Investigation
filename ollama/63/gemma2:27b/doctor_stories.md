Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's cluttered office, mimicking the chaotic rhythm pounding in his chest. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of disinfectant and desperation. Outside, the neon glow of the Red Lantern Tavern flickered intermittently, casting distorted shadows that danced across the threadbare rug. This part of Newhaven wasn’t known for its charm; it was a crucible where poverty and vice simmered together, forging a gritty resilience in its inhabitants. Elias knew this intimately. He'd been tending to their wounds – physical and emotional – for over a decade. 

Tonight, however, the usual symphony of coughs, whimpers, and whispered prayers had been replaced by an unnerving silence. The waiting room, usually overflowing with the city’s forgotten souls, was empty. Even the stray cat that often sought refuge beneath Elias' desk was nowhere to be seen. A prickle of unease traveled down his spine. Something wasn't right.
