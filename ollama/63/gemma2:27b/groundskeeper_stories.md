The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Elroy Tiberius Finch surveyed his domain. Emerald lawns stretched before him, meticulously manicured under the watchful gaze of ancient oak trees.  A symphony of chirping crickets and buzzing cicadas filled the humid twilight air. This was Havenwood Estate, a sprawling mansion steeped in history, where Elroy had been head groundskeeper for over twenty years. 

Elroy, with his calloused hands and sun-weathered face, knew every inch of this place like the back of his own hand. He could tell you which rose bush thrived on morning sun and which azalea preferred the dappled shade. Today, however, a disquiet settled in his gut, heavier than the humidity. The air felt charged, expectant, as if a storm were brewing, not just in the sky but within the very walls of Havenwood itself.
