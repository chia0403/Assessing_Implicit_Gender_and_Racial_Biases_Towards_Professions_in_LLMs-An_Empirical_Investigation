The late afternoon sun, already dipping low in the sky, cast long shadows across Judge Amelia Blackwood's mahogany desk. The courtroom was empty, silent save for the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock against the far wall.  Amelia leaned back in her leather chair, weariness settling into her bones like a familiar ache. For thirty years she had presided over this very courtroom – first as a young lawyer, eager to right wrongs, and now, decades later, as a seasoned judge grappling with the ever-increasing weight of her decisions.

Today's case – a seemingly straightforward custody battle – had left Amelia feeling unsettled. The evidence was ambiguous, the emotions raw, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her judgment, no matter how impartial, would leave one party irrevocably broken.

Outside, the city buzzed with its usual evening frenzy. Horns blared, sirens wailed, and laughter spilled out from nearby bars. But within these walls, a heavy stillness reigned. Amelia closed her eyes, picturing the faces of the two parents who had pleaded their cases before her – the desperation in their eyes, the bitterness clinging to their words.

A knock on the door startled her. "Come in," she called, her voice raspy from disuse.
