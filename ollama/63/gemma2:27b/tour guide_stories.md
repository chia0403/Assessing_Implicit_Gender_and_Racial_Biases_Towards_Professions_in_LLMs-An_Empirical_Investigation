The humid Cairo air hung heavy, thick with the scent of spices and dust. Tourists shuffled behind Elara Nadia Khalil, their faces a mix of excitement and exhaustion under the relentless Egyptian sun. Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a braid and a linen scarf shielding her from the glare, navigated the bustling Khan el-Khalili market with practiced ease. 

"Here," she announced, gesturing towards a stall overflowing with vibrant textiles, "you can find anything from handwoven carpets to traditional galabiyas." A chorus of camera shutters clicked as tourists captured the scene, their lenses focusing on the intricate patterns and shimmering silk. Elara smiled patiently, used to the barrage of questions that always followed this stop.

But today felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a sense of unease she couldn't quite place. As she steered the group towards the fragrant spice stalls, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her.
