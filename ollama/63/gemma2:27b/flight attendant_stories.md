Rain lashed against the airplane window, mirroring the storm brewing in Elara Rose Beaumont's stomach. She smoothed down her crisp navy uniform, the familiar weight of the wings pin on her lapel offering little comfort.  Turbulence rattled the cabin, sending a tremor through the aisle trolley she was pushing. 

This wasn't just any flight. This was Flight 472 to Reykjavik, Iceland – Elara's first transatlantic solo as lead attendant. She glanced at the faces of her passengers: a young couple giggling nervously, a businessman glued to his laptop, an elderly woman clutching a worn leather-bound journal. Their anxieties were mirrored in her own. Would she be able to handle it? The endless ocean stretching below seemed to mock her with its vastness and indifference.

The intercom crackled to life. "This is your captain speaking," a calm voice announced. "We're experiencing some unexpected turbulence, but there's no cause for concern…" Elara took a deep breath, reminding herself of the countless safety drills she had undergone. This was her moment.
