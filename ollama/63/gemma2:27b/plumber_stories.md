The air in Alistair Montgomery's workshop hung thick with the smell of solder and desperation. A tangle of copper pipes lay on his workbench, mocking him with their intricate curves and stubborn joints. Outside, rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, drumming out a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing pain in Alistair's temples.

He hadn't slept properly in days. Mrs. Higgins' flooded basement was proving to be more than just a leaky faucet - it was a hydra of plumbing problems, spewing forth fresh horrors with every twist of his wrench. And with each passing hour, the pressure mounted.  Mrs. Higgins, bless her sweet soul, had already threatened to call "that slick young plumber from downtown" if Alistair couldn't fix it by nightfall.

Alistair took a deep breath, steeling himself against another onslaught of plumbing woes. He grabbed his trusty pipe wrench, its worn wooden handle smooth under his calloused hand, and muttered a silent prayer to the patron saint of plumbers - whoever that might be. Tonight, he would conquer Mrs. Higgins' basement, or die trying.
