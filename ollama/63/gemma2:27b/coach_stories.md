The late afternoon sun beat down on Coach Evelyn "Eve" Ramirez's face as she surveyed her team from beneath the brim of her worn baseball cap. Sweat dripped from her brow, mingling with sunscreen, leaving salty trails down her weathered cheeks. The dusty field, nestled in the heart of rural Nevada, buzzed with the excited chatter and anxious thumps of bouncing basketballs. It was tryouts for the Silver Sage Rattlers, Eve's ragtag group of high school hopefuls, and the tension was as thick as the desert air.

Eve's gaze swept across the court: a lanky boy with glasses struggling to dribble, a pair of girls giggling while practicing layups, and a hulking figure bouncing the ball with such force it seemed the asphalt might crack beneath him.  Her heart clenched with a familiar mix of hope and trepidation. This season, more than any other, felt crucial.
