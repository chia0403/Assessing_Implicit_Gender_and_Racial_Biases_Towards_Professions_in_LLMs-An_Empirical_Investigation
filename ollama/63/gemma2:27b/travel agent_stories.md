Rain lashed against the dusty storefront window, blurring the neon "Paradise Found Travel" sign into an Impressionist smear of pink and blue. Inside, Amelia Cartwright sighed, drumming her fingers on a brochure featuring impossibly turquoise waters and sugar-white beaches. The irony wasn't lost on her. Paradise felt a million miles away from this cramped office in downtown Millhaven, where the biggest adventure was deciphering Mrs. Henderson's indecipherable handwriting on a request for a "quiet getaway with minimal stairs."

Amelia yearned for something more than selling package deals to retirees and honeymooners. She craved exploration, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to experience the destinations she so passionately researched. Yet, her wanderlust remained firmly tethered by responsibility. Rent needed paying, bills accumulated, and dreams had a nasty habit of taking a backseat to reality.

Today, however, something felt different.  A tingle of anticipation danced along her spine as the bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer. Amelia glanced up, her breath catching in her throat. The woman who stood framed in the doorway was unlike any client she'd ever seen. Dressed in an emerald green cloak that shimmered with an otherworldly luminescence, her eyes held a depth of ancient knowledge and a spark of something undeniably adventurous.
