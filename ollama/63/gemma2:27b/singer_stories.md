The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and anticipation in The Blue Flamingo, a dimly lit jazz club tucked away on a cobblestone street in New Orleans.  Eliza Rose Sinclair, her fiery red hair piled high atop her head, adjusted the microphone stand with a practiced grace. She closed her eyes for a moment, feeling the rhythm of the city pulse through her veins â€“ the distant wail of a saxophone, the rumble of a passing streetcar, the murmur of conversation blending into a harmonious symphony. This was Eliza's stage, her sanctuary. Tonight, she would pour her soul out in every note, hoping to captivate the audience with the raw emotion that lived within her music.  

Eliza took a deep breath and opened her eyes. The spotlight blinded her momentarily before revealing a sea of expectant faces. A hush fell over the crowd as she lifted her chin and began to sing.
