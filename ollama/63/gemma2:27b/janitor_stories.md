The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Elias Finch as he pushed his battered cleaning cart down the deserted hallway. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee, a familiar cocktail in this cavernous building that housed the city's archives. Outside, the first hints of dawn were painting the sky in hues of lavender and apricot, but within these walls, time seemed to stand still. Elias preferred it that way.  

The archives were his sanctuary, a labyrinthine haven crammed with dusty volumes and forgotten secrets. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of paper in the wind tunnels created by the building's archaic ventilation system. Here, amidst the whispers of history, Elias felt invisible, a ghost gliding through time.  Tonight, however, something was different. A shiver crawled up his spine as he rounded a corner, the air suddenly growing colder. The faint scent of ozone lingered in the air, a prickling sensation on his skin that spoke of unseen energy. He stopped, his hand instinctively reaching for the battered flashlight clipped to his belt.  

Something wasn't right.
