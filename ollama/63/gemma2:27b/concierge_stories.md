The rain hammered against the glass awning of The Grand Blackwood Hotel, a relentless counterpoint to the tinkling melody emanating from the lobby's grand piano.  Augustus Thaddeus Finchworth III, impeccably dressed in his midnight-blue livery, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. He adjusted the silver nameplate on his lapel – "Augustus T. Finchworth III, Concierge" – a testament to generations of impeccable service within the hallowed halls of The Grand Blackwood.

His fingers drummed a silent rhythm against the polished mahogany of the concierge desk.  A single red light blinked ominously on the antique phone system, signifying an urgent request. Augustus straightened his bow tie and braced himself for whatever peculiar demand the rain-soaked city might unleash upon him tonight.
