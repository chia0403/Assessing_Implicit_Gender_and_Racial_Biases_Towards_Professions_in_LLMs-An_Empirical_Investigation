Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the lights of the city into an Impressionist painting. Emilia Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before dissipating into the chilled air. Her office, usually a haven of calming beige and muted greens, felt oppressive tonight. The storm mirrored the turmoil brewing inside her: a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest, fueled by the day's string of emotionally fraught sessions. 

She glanced at the clock â€“ 8:47 p.m.  Another hour, she reminded herself, then she could finally retreat into the comfort of her worn armchair and a steaming cup of chamomile tea. But first, there was David. He was late, as usual. Emilia had learned to expect his tardiness, a symptom of the chaos that ruled his life. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine. 

David wasn't just a client; he was a puzzle Emilia had been trying to solve for months. He presented with classic symptoms of anxiety and depression, but beneath the surface lurked something darker, something she couldn't quite grasp. Tonight, she felt an unsettling premonition that his story was about to take a dramatic turn.
