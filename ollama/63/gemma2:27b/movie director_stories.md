The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, clinging to Amelia Rose Carmichael like a second skin. Even under the dim glow of the string lights strung across the dilapidated courtyard, she could feel the sweat beading on her forehead. This was not how she’d envisioned her big break – directing a low-budget horror film in a crumbling Portuguese villa rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a lovelorn poet. 

Amelia adjusted her worn Panama hat and surveyed the scene before her. The ramshackle stone walls, overgrown with ivy, seemed to whisper forgotten secrets. Actors milled around nervously, their faces pale under the flickering lanterns, while the exhausted crew scurried about setting up cameras and lighting. This was a far cry from the sleek Hollywood studios Amelia had dreamt of gracing as a young film student. But desperate times called for desperate measures.  Her last two films had bombed, leaving her with mounting debts and dwindling hope. 

This project – "The Ballad of Isabella" – was her last shot. A bizarre, gothic love story set against the backdrop of this eerie villa, it was a risky venture, even by indie film standards. But Amelia saw something in the script – a raw, visceral energy that resonated with her own yearning for artistic redemption.
