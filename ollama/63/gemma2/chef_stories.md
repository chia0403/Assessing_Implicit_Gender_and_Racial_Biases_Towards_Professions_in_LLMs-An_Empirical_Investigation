The air hung thick with the scent of simmering broth and caramelizing onions in Amelia Rose Blackwood's tiny kitchen. It wasn't much, really – cramped, cobweb-threaded corners, worn linoleum floor tiles that buckled underfoot – but for Amelia, it was her haven. Her battlefield against blandness. She worked with a ferocity born from a lifetime of feeling overlooked and underestimated, proving herself one perfectly plated dish at a time. Tonight's challenge?  Impressing the notoriously hard-to-please food critic, Jean-Claude Dubois, who had mysteriously requested a table for one at her little bistro, "The Twisted Spoon," tucked away on a rain-slicked side street in Prague. 


Amelia, clad in her flour-dusted apron and hair escaping its bun in rebellious curls, surveyed the scene:  the flickering candlelight casting long shadows across the mismatched antique furniture, the lone figure at a table by the window staring intently at his phone, oblivious to the symphony of sizzling garlic and bubbling sauces playing out around him. Jean-Claude Dubois was here, and Amelia's heart pounded like a rogue drum solo in her chest.
