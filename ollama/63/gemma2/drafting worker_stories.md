The air hung thick with coal dust and the metallic tang of sweat in the sprawling factory floor. A single shaft of sunlight pierced through the grime-coated skylight, illuminating motes dancing in the stagnant air. Amelia Cartwright squinted, wiping her brow with the back of her gloved hand. Her calloused fingers traced the worn grooves on her drafting tools – a familiar comfort amidst the symphony of clanging metal and whirring machinery that defined her world.  

Amelia wasn't an engineer, not in the traditional sense. She was a draftswoman, responsible for bringing the blueprints to life, translating the vision of the engineers into tangible lines and measurements. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was vital. Every cog, every gear, every rivet on these massive steam engines she helped design, was her responsibility. 

Today, Amelia was tasked with creating detailed plans for a new locomotive – one designed to haul freight across the vast plains of the West. The project was ambitious, fraught with technical challenges, and demanded meticulous attention. Yet, as Amelia gazed at the blueprint spread out before her, she felt a surge of excitement. This wasn't just another engine; this was a chance to be part of something bigger, to leave her mark on the expanding world.


This is where Amelia Cartwright, our draftswoman hero, begins her journey amidst the bustling factory floor and the promise of a westward expansion.
