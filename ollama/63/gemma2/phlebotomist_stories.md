The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Blythe’s head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of crimson vials lining the shelves. A faint scent of disinfectant hung in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood. It was the familiar aroma of her world – the hematology lab at City General Hospital.

Amelia, a seasoned phlebotomist with veins mapping the contours of her own forearms like a well-worn map, meticulously prepared another patient’s sample. She moved with practiced grace, her gloved hand steady as she inserted the needle, drawing the crimson liquid into the vial. 

Outside the lab window, the city roared to life – sirens wailed, horns blared, and the incessant pulse of traffic throbbed through the concrete arteries. But inside these sterile walls, Amelia found a strange kind of peace. It was in the quiet concentration of her work, the rhythmic hiss of the vacuum pump, the gentle clinking of vials, that she felt truly at ease.  


But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the usual antiseptic scent. The nurses moved with a hurried pace, their faces etched with worry. Amelia caught snippets of hushed conversations – "critical condition," "unknown infection," "isolated ward." 

Whatever was happening, it was about to change everything.
