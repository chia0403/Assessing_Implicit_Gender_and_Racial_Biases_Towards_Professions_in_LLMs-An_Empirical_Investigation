The flickering neon sign outside cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Thistlewood's face as she leaned back in her chair, idly tapping a pencil against the worn linoleum floor.  Inside Dr. Hemlock's office, the silence was broken only by the hum of the ancient air conditioner and the occasional chirp of a cricket trying to find its way through the open window. The waiting room smelled faintly of disinfectant and stale coffee – a familiar aroma that had become Amelia's olfactory signature.

The clock ticked past 4:00 PM, and the last patient of the day had long since left. Amelia, perched at her desk like a weary sentinel, felt the familiar pang of loneliness creep into her chest.  Another day spent fielding inquiries about "unusual ailments," calming frazzled nerves, and suppressing the urge to yawn dramatically during particularly boring conversations with insurance companies. 

But as Dr. Hemlock, a gaunt man with perpetually haunted eyes, walked through the doorway, Amelia straightened up, ready for his usual enigmatic instructions for the evening.


**Setting:** A dimly lit, slightly dilapidated office building in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The waiting room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and stacks of forgotten magazines. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Thistlewood, late twenties, receptionist at Dr. Hemlock's unconventional practice.  She’s intelligent, observant, and longs for something more fulfilling than her mundane routine.
