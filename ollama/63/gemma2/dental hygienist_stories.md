The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Kensington’s domain.  Her instruments lay neatly arrayed on their tray: scaler, probe, mirror, all gleaming under the sterile light. She ran a gloved hand over the cool stainless steel, inhaling the faintly antiseptic scent of disinfectant. The waiting room was quiet, save for the low murmur of the ceiling fan and the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock perched atop the counter, its pendulum swinging like a metronome marking time’s relentless passage. Amelia sighed, glancing at the clock again. 8:57 AM.  Just three more minutes until her first patient arrived, another soul to be subjected to the dreaded dental exam.


Amelia wasn't particularly fond of the exams themselves. She enjoyed the meticulous cleaning, the satisfaction of scrubbing away plaque and revealing the pearly white beneath. But the probing, the peering, the pronouncements about gum disease and cavities - it all felt invasive, a violation of personal space she was never quite comfortable with.  Yet, here she was, day after day, wielding her tools, a silent guardian against decay in this small-town dental practice nestled on Elm Street.
