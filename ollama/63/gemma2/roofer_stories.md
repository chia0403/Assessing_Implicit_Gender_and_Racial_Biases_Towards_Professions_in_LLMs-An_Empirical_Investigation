The sun beat down on Alistair Finch's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the view of the terracotta tiles he was painstakingly repairing.  A dusty plume of heat rose from the aging asphalt shingles beneath his feet, swirling lazily in the July air. The rooftop of Mrs. Delacroix's Victorian mansion stretched before him, a labyrinth of gables and dormers bathed in a golden light that seemed to mock the grime on his hands. He wiped his brow with a grease-stained rag, leaving a trail of soot across his forehead. Below, the manicured lawns of the upscale neighborhood gleamed like emerald carpets, untouched by the midday heat. Alistair sighed, wishing he were lounging somewhere cool, instead of battling the elements in this forgotten corner of the city. 


He shifted his weight, adjusting the tool belt that sagged with his work essentials - a hammer, nails, trowel, and the ever-present toolbox filled with an assortment of odd bits and pieces.  Alistair Finch, master roofer and occasional magician of leaky pipes, was about to embark on another day in the world of shingles and skylights. He just hoped Mrs. Delacroix wouldn't ask him to fix her "wobbly" chandelier while he was up there. The last time she had requested such a thing, it turned out to be a family heirloom with more sentimental value than Alistair's entire bank account.
