The scent of jasmine tea hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of freshly turned earth from the overflowing potted geraniums lining Beatrice Eloise Hawthorne's windowsill. Her eyes, the same shade of warm honey as her namesake flower, squinted against the afternoon sun streaming through the glass panes of her Chelsea flat. Outside, London buzzed with its usual chaotic symphony –  car horns blaring, sirens wailing, and a distant busker strumming a melancholic tune on his guitar. 

Beatrice took another sip of her tea, savoring the bitterness that danced on her tongue. Today's clients were proving to be a handful: a couple who couldn't agree on anything from wall color to whether or not a faux fur rug was "too much". She sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped its chignon and landed on her cheek. This was the part of being an interior decorator she wasn't always fond of –  the endless compromises, the clashing opinions, the seemingly impossible task of pleasing everyone. But then, there were moments like these: sunlight dappling her worn leather armchair, the comforting weight of her well-thumbed copy of "The Elements of Style" resting in her lap, and a quiet sense of satisfaction that came from knowing she was creating spaces that people could truly call home.  


Beatrice hoped this client job wouldn't be one of those moments where she longed for a simpler life spent just rearranging bookshelves and dreaming up pastel palettes.
