The rain hammered against Sergeant Evelyn "Evie" Blackwood's trench coat, turning the cobblestones of Edinburgh into treacherous black mirrors. The scent of damp earth and chimney smoke hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the sharp tang of sea salt carried on the wind. Above, a lone streetlamp cast a sickly yellow glow, barely penetrating the thick curtain of mist that shrouded the Old Town.

Evie huddled deeper into her coat, her breath frosting in the frigid air. Her patrol route tonight was always a grim affair, but something felt particularly off. The usual symphony of clinking glasses and raucous laughter from the pubs seemed muted, replaced by an unnerving silence punctuated only by the relentless drumming of rain.  She adjusted her holster, fingers brushing against the cold steel of her service weapon. A shiver ran down her spine that had nothing to do with the weather.


Tonight, Edinburgh felt like a city holding its breath, waiting for something terrible to happen.
