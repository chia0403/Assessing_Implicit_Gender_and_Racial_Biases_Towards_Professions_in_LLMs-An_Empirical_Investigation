The humid New Orleans air clung to Theodore "Teddy" LeBeau like a second skin as he wheeled his luggage cart down the bustling lobby of The Grand Magnolia Hotel. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, painting the polished marble floor in a kaleidoscope of colours. The scent of jasmine and chicory coffee mingled with the murmur of tourists chattering in various languages, creating a symphony of sound that was as familiar to Teddy as his own heartbeat.

Teddy, with his crisp white uniform and ever-present smile, navigated the crowd like a seasoned captain charting a course through a bustling port. His dark eyes, crinkled at the corners from years spent beneath the Louisiana sun, scanned the faces around him, searching for the next guest in need of his services. The Grand Magnolia was more than just a job to Teddy; it was a family, a stage where he played the role of friendly guide and confidante, a silent observer of the lives unfolding within its grand walls. 


Today, however, a sense of anticipation hung in the air, thicker than the usual humidity. A famous jazz musician was expected to arrive that afternoon, and whispers of his legendary talent were buzzing through the staff like a hummingbird's wings. Teddy, despite his years of service, felt a thrill course through him at the prospect of witnessing such artistry firsthand. Perhaps, just perhaps, this wouldn't be another ordinary day in the life of Teddy LeBeau, bell hop extraordinaire.
