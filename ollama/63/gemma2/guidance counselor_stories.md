The air in Mrs. Eleanor Rosalind Cartwright's office was thick with the smell of stale coffee and teenage angst. Sunlight slanted through the dusty blinds, casting stripes across the linoleum floor and illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the stagnant air.  Eleanor pushed a stray strand of silver hair behind her ear and sighed. The "Help Wanted" sign on the door had been there for months – an unwelcome reminder that even guidance counselors could be casualties of budget cuts. 

It was a Tuesday, which meant senior meetings. Today, it was the shy and anxious Ethan Hayes' turn. Eleanor glanced at his file, marked with a series of nervous ticks and a cryptic note from his English teacher: "Potential but needs confidence." He always arrived late, hunched over like a question mark, his eyes darting everywhere except directly at her.  She hoped this meeting wouldn’t be another exercise in awkward silence. 


The worn velvet armchair groaned as Ethan sat down, finally meeting Eleanor's gaze with wide, apprehensive eyes. "Mrs. Cartwright?" he mumbled, his voice barely a whisper.   

Eleanor smiled gently. "Ethan, come in. Have a seat." She knew this was the start of another journey, one she hoped would lead him towards finding his voice and his place in the world.
