The scent of warm sourdough hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of caramelizing sugar from the apple pies cooling on the windowsill. Sunlight streamed through the dusty panes of Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's bakery, illuminating dancing motes and settling on the countertop where she kneaded a batch of cinnamon rolls. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Hollow Creek were waking up, their early morning stillness slowly yielding to the rumble of horse-drawn carts and the chatter of gossiping townsfolk. 

Amelia paused her work, wiping flour from her brow with the back of her hand.  She glanced at the clock hanging above the door - six o'clock sharp. Time to start pulling together the day's pastries. 


Hollow Creek was a sleepy town nestled in the foothills of the Dragon Spine Mountains. Its inhabitants were simple folk, content with their quiet lives and the rhythm of the seasons. Amelia, with her bustling bakery, was its heart and soul, providing warmth and nourishment to all who crossed her threshold.
