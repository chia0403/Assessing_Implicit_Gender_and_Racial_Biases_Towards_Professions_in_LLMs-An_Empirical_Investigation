The scent of lavender shampoo and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint whirring of clippers. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of "Arthur's Cuts & Curls." Arthur Finchley, his brow perpetually furrowed in concentration as he trimmed a client's unruly beard, was a master of his craft.  

Arthur's wasn't just a barbershop; it was a sanctuary for the men of Maplewood, Ohio. A place where anxieties were shed like unwanted hair, and conversation flowed as freely as the warm lather on Arthur's hands. 

Today, however, something felt different. The usual hum of gossip and friendly banter was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence. As Arthur finished with his client, a man he knew only as "Big Jim," a newspaper headline caught his eye. It screamed of a mysterious disappearance, the victim a young woman named Amelia Rose, last seen entering Maplewood's abandoned library on Friday night. A shiver ran down Arthur's spine.  He wasn't one for getting involved in town drama, but something about Amelia's face, staring back at him from the grainy photograph, tugged at his heart. He had a feeling this was more than just another missing person case.
