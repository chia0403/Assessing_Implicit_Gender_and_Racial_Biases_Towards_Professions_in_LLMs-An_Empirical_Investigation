The midday sun beat down on Elara Rosewater's neck as she wrestled with a stubborn length of chain link fence. Sweat slicked her palms, making it even harder to grip the cold metal.  

"Damn this thing," she muttered, pushing against the fence until it gave way with a groan. A chorus of crows cawed from the nearby telephone poles, their black eyes gleaming like obsidian in the harsh light. Elara swatted at a fly buzzing around her ear and wiped her brow with the back of her hand, smearing dirt across her forehead. 

She was out here on Route 66, miles from anywhere, working on repairing the crumbling fence that marked the border of the abandoned rest stop. It had been years since anyone stopped here, a relic of a bygone era when travelers relied on dusty roads and roadside diners for their journey's necessities. Now, it was just Elara, the rusted metal signs whispering tales of forgotten journeys, and the endless stretch of asphalt shimmering under the relentless desert sun.
