The stale air of the Grand Blackwood Theatre hung heavy around Elias Finch as he pushed his mop across the sticky linoleum floor of the orchestra pit.  Moonlight streamed through the grimy skylights above, casting long shadows that danced with every sweep. The plush velvet seats, once teeming with laughter and applause, were now vacant, their crimson hues dulled by time and neglect. A lone moth fluttered against a dusty spotlight, its wings tracing lazy patterns in the gloom. 

Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space. Another night, another empty theatre. He'd been the janitor here for ten years, ever since his father, the former stage manager, had passed away. It wasn't a glamorous job, but it kept him close to the ghosts of memories - the vibrant costumes, the electrifying performances, the palpable energy that had once pulsed through these very walls.  Now, only silence remained, broken only by the rhythmic squeak of his mop and the distant rumble of traffic outside. 


**Setting:** The Grand Blackwood Theatre, a grand old theatre in its twilight years, struggling to stay afloat. It's located in a bustling city but feels isolated from the surrounding world.
