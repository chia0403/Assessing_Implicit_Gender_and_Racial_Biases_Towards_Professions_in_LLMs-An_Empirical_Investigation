The clang of metal on metal was a symphony to Elias Vance's ears. The morning sun, still shy behind the skeletal silhouette of the half-finished skyscraper, cast long shadows across the construction site. Dust motes danced in the pale light, swirling like miniature tornadoes around Elias' boots as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn beam. 

He wiped the sweat from his brow, leaving a streak through the grime caked on his face. His calloused hands, perpetually stained with rust and concrete, gripped the steel tightly, muscles straining beneath his faded blue work shirt. Below him, the city hummed with its pre-dawn energy - car horns chirping, sirens wailing in the distance, the muffled rumble of a distant subway train. But up here, on the thirty-fifth floor, it was just Elias and the symphony of construction.
