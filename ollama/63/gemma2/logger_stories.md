The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a symphony of green stretching as far as the eye could see in the vast Douglas Fir forest of Oregon.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering canopy above, dappled the forest floor where Elias Thorne knelt, his calloused hands carefully examining the base of a fallen giant. He wasn't just any logger; Elias was known throughout the Cascade foothills for his skill, his respect for the trees he felled, and the whisperings that followed him - tales of an uncanny connection to the ancient woods themselves. 

A tremor ran through the forest floor, barely perceptible but enough to make Elias pause. He listened, his weathered face creased in thought. The usual symphony of bird calls and rustling leaves had been replaced by a tense silence, broken only by the distant caw of a crow.  Something wasn't right. 


Elias Thorne straightened, placing his hand on the rough bark of the fallen giant. "Speak to me, old friend," he murmured, "What troubles this wood?" The forest held its breath. Elias waited, a knot of anticipation tightening in his chest. This was more than just another day in the woods.  This felt like the beginning of something... different.
