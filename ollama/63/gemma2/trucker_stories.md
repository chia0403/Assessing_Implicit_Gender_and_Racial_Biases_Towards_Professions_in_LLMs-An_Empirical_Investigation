The air hung thick with diesel fumes and anticipation as Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood adjusted his Stetson, its brim casting a shadow over his weathered face. Dawn was just beginning to bleed over the dusty horizon outside Amarillo, painting the sprawling Texas landscape in hues of orange and purple. Bart rubbed his calloused hands over the worn leather of his steering wheel, feeling the familiar vibrations humming through the metal frame of his rig, "The Lone Star." 

He wasn't a man for fancy words or idle chatter. Just Bart, his truck, and the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him, a lifeline connecting cities and dreams across the vast heart of America.  This run was different though. This haul felt heavier than usual, not just from the load of steel beams in his trailer, but from the burden of a promise he'd made to himself: to reach Denver by nightfall, no matter the cost.


The sun climbed higher, casting long shadows across the desolate plains as Bart kicked his rig into gear, leaving behind the familiar diner coffee and greasy spoon breakfast. He was alone out here, miles from anything resembling civilization, but that was how he liked it. Out here, under the vast expanse of the Texan sky, he could be himself: a lone wolf howling at the wind, chasing the horizon with grit and determination.
