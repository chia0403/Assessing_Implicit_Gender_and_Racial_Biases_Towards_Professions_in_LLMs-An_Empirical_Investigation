The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Alfie Reginald Finch's workshop like angry fists. Each drop echoed through the cluttered space, bouncing off stacks of pipes, wrenches, and rusty tools. Steam hissed from the leaky kettle perched precariously on an old toolbox, filling the air with a comforting warmth that did little to combat the chill seeping in through the gaps in the weatherboarding.

Alfie, a stocky man with a ginger beard streaked with grey, wiped his brow with a grease-stained rag and squinted at the rain outside. "Bloody monsoon," he grumbled, pulling his threadbare cardigan tighter around him.  "Just what I need to keep these pipes from groaning their last." 


The setting was Alfie's workshop - a converted shed in the back garden of his modest Victorian terrace house nestled on a forgotten street in the sprawling, rain-soaked city of Grimsborough. The year was 1947, and the air hung heavy with post-war austerity and the lingering scent of damp wool and engine oil.
