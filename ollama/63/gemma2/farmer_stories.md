The morning mist clung to Amelia Thistlewick's weathered boots like a loyal hound, refusing to relinquish its hold as she trudged through her barley field. The sun, still a drowsy eye peering over the eastern hills, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with every rustle of wind in the ripening stalks. 

Amelia, her face etched with lines born of sun and worry, inhaled deeply, letting the earthy scent of damp soil and fresh green shoots fill her lungs.  It was a smell she knew intimately, one that both comforted and challenged her. Comforting because it meant life, renewal, and the promise of harvest. Challenging because this year's promise felt more fragile than ever. The erratic spring rains had left some patches parched while others overflowed, leaving her barley vulnerable to blight and disease. 

Amelia’s farm, Thistlewick Hollow, nestled in the foothills of the Grey Mountains, had been her family’s for generations. It was a small plot of land, carved from the unforgiving landscape, where every inch was fought for, nurtured, and ultimately yielded its bounty – or its grief.  And this year, Amelia knew, it was a gamble on whether the land would be generous or cruel.
