The scent of antiseptic and damp fabric hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Rosalind Cartwright, affectionately known as Ellie by her patients. Her small office was tucked away on the third floor of Mercy General Hospital, bathed in the warm glow of the late afternoon sun filtering through the blinds. Outside, the city hummed with its usual pre-dinner frenzy, but inside Ellie's world, time moved at a different pace, dictated by the slow, deliberate movements of her patients.  

Ellie adjusted her glasses and peered at the file on her desk: "Samuel Pierce, 42, Right Arm Fracture - Case 37." She sighed, already anticipating his gruff demeanor and reluctance to participate in his therapy sessions. Samuel was a construction worker, tough as nails and used to getting things done quickly. Relearning to use his injured arm would be a humbling experience for him, but Ellie was determined to make it as smooth as possible. 

The door creaked open, revealing Samuel's stoic silhouette framed by the corridor's fluorescent light. He shuffled in, his gaze fixed on the floor, and with a muttered "Good afternoon," took a seat opposite Ellie, his injured arm draped listlessly across his lap.  


Ellie smiled warmly, her eyes crinkling at the corners.  "Samuel, good to see you again. Let's get started."
