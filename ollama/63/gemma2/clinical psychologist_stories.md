The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and lavender hand sanitizer in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Outside, the Chicago skyline was shrouded in a haze of late afternoon smog, casting an orange glow on the rain-slicked streets below.  Eleanor stared out the window, watching as taxicabs splashed through puddles, their yellow forms blurring like fleeting memories. A sigh escaped her lips, a sound swallowed by the rhythmic hum of the city beyond. She hadn't felt this restless in years. 

Her next appointment was due any minute â€“ a young woman named Olivia struggling with anxiety and insomnia. Typically, Eleanor found solace in her work, in unraveling the intricate tapestry of human minds. But today, a persistent unease gnawed at her, a feeling she couldn't quite place. It felt like a loose thread, tugging at the fabric of her carefully constructed life. 


This thread, she knew instinctively, was tied to the cryptic phone call she'd received earlier that day, the voice on the other end speaking in riddles and veiled threats. The caller had hung up before revealing their identity, leaving Eleanor with a sense of foreboding that clung to her like a second skin.
