The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma to Elias Blackwood as he surveyed his workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the worn workbench where he meticulously carved intricate details into a mahogany chest. Outside, the coastal town of Saltwind was waking up, gulls crying their mournful calls over the crashing waves against the rocky shore.

The weight of responsibility pressed upon Elias as he worked, every piece he crafted a legacy to carry on. This chest, commissioned by Captain Thorne himself, was no ordinary job. It was destined for his daughterâ€™s dowry, a vessel holding not just precious possessions but hopes and dreams for the future.
