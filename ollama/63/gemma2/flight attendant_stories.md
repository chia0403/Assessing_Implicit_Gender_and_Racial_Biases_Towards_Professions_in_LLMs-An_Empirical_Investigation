The stale scent of recycled air hung heavy in the cabin as Amelia Celeste Hawthorne expertly maneuvered through the narrow aisle, her practiced smile pasted firmly in place.  

She was mid-flight on United Airlines Flight 872, en route from Seattle to Los Angeles, and already her day felt as predictable as the sunrise over Puget Sound. Coffee run, safety demonstration, a few fussy passengers, maybe a crying baby or two.  But something about the stillness in the air, the way the muted chatter of the passengers seemed hushed and expectant, prickled Amelia's senses with unease. It was the kind of silence that preceded a storm, not just the meteorological kind, but one that felt personal, woven into the fabric of the plane itself.


As she reached for the beverage cart, a tremor ran through the fuselage, barely perceptible at first. Then, a second jolt, stronger this time, followed by an ear-splitting crack that echoed through the cabin. The lights flickered and died, plunging the plane into darkness. Screams erupted in panicked chaos, shattering the uneasy quiet Amelia had felt moments before. In the sudden, terrifying blackness, she knew something was terribly wrong.
