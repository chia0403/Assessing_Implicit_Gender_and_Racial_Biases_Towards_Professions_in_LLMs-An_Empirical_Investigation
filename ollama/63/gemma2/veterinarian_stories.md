The rain hammered against Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Harper's window, mimicking the frantic drumming of her heart. A storm like this wasn't unusual for their remote corner of the Appalachian Mountains, but tonight, it felt different – ominous. She glanced at the clock: 10:32 pm.  She should be asleep by now, especially with an early morning surgery looming. But the phone hadn't stopped ringing all evening, each call a desperate plea for help from worried pet owners. The power flickered ominously again, casting her office in a disjointed dance of light and shadow. 

Evelyn sighed, pushing back her thick auburn hair from her eyes.  Her clinic, nestled amongst the towering pines just outside the sleepy town of Ridgemont, was usually quiet at this hour. But tonight, the storm had brought with it a wave of unexpected emergencies – a fallen dog trapped in a ravine, a frightened kitten lost in the woods, and now, this final call: a frantic woman reporting that her prize-winning sheepdog had been struck by lightning.  Evelyn rubbed her temples, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing down on her. This wasn't just a job; it was a calling, a commitment to the animals who couldn't speak for themselves. And tonight, they needed her more than ever.
