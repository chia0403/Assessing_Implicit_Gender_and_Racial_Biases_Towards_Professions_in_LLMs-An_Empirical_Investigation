The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Clementine's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floor of the Sparkle & Shine Grocery Store. It was 7:42 pm, and the last hour of Bea's shift was always the slowest. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and discounted baked goods, a scent that usually bothered her but tonight felt strangely comforting.  A lone figure lingered by the checkout line, a man in a faded denim jacket who seemed to be wrestling with an overflowing basket of discount ramen noodles. Bea leaned against the counter, idly tapping a melody on the register screen, waiting for him to make up his mind. The silence was broken only by the occasional whirring of the industrial freezer behind her and the distant drone of traffic outside.  This small grocery store in the fading suburb of Maplewood had become Bea's little corner of the world, familiar and predictable in a life that felt increasingly chaotic.
