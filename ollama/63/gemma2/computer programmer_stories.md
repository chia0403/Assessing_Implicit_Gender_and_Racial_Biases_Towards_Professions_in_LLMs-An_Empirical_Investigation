The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Hayes' head, casting a sterile glow over the clutter on her desk. Empty coffee mugs, crumpled paper scraps with cryptic code scribbled across them, and a half-eaten bag of gummy bears formed a familiar landscape. Outside the window, the San Francisco fog clung stubbornly to the Golden Gate Bridge, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolor.

Amelia's fingers flew across the keyboard, her gaze fixed on the lines of code scrolling across her monitor. She was deep in the heart of "Project Phoenix," a top-secret AI development project for a shadowy government agency known only as 'The Consortium'.  The pressure was immense, the stakes even higher. 

She had been handpicked for this assignment â€“ a prodigy with a mind for algorithms and an uncanny ability to anticipate her code's every quirk. But tonight, something felt different. A nagging sense of unease prickled at the back of her neck. The lines of code seemed to shimmer, pulsate even, as if whispering secrets she wasn't meant to hear.  

Amelia paused, taking a deep breath, and tried to shake off the feeling.  This was just stress, exhaustion playing tricks on her. There had to be a logical explanation for the anomaly in the code, something she could fix with a few well-placed edits. But as she reached for her mouse, a cold tremor ran through her. The screen flickered once, then twice, before plunging into absolute darkness.
