The desert sun beat down on Amelia "Ace" Hayes's neck, turning her sweat slick and leaving salt crusting at the corners of her mouth.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, their swirling forms mimicking the chaotic churn inside Ace's stomach. This wasn’t just another day operating a bulldozer for the Iron Horse Reclamation Company – this was Day One on Project Phoenix, the biggest land reclamation job in Nevada history. 

The sprawling site before her stretched like an open wound across the landscape: miles of scarred earth stripped bare by decades of mining. Rusting machinery sat like forgotten dinosaurs amidst the rubble, a testament to the industry's brutal hunger and its inevitable decline. Today, Ace and her team were tasked with leveling the terrain, prepping it for the first phase of reforestation – a long shot at bringing life back to this barren wasteland. 


Ace gripped the joystick tighter, the rumble of the engine vibrating through her bones. The smell of diesel and baking earth filled her nostrils, a familiar scent that usually soothed her. But today, anxiety tightened its grip like a vise. This wasn't just about clearing land; it was about mending the past, about reclaiming something lost. Ace glanced at the horizon, where the setting sun painted the sky in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple, a fragile beauty amidst the desolation. 

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenge ahead. This desert wouldn't break her. Project Phoenix would rise from the ashes, just like it had to.
