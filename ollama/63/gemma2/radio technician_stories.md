The humid Louisiana air hung thick as molasses in the cramped repair shack behind Madame Evangeline's Emporium of Curiosities. A chorus of cicadas buzzed their incessant rhythm, punctuated by the distant rumble of a passing truck on Highway 16. Inside, Elara Bellweather, sweat beading on her brow, wrestled with a tangle of wires protruding from the guts of an ancient Zenith radio.  

She squinted at the schematic diagram taped to the wall, its lines blurring in the dim light filtering through the dusty windowpanes. The radio belonged to Mr. Dupree, a regular customer who claimed it had been possessed by a stray spirit since he'd purchased it from a traveling salesman five years ago. Elara scoffed at such notions, attributing strange noises and static bursts to faulty capacitors and loose connections â€“ all solvable with a steady hand and a well-stocked toolbox. 

Yet, as she tightened a particularly stubborn screw, the radio emitted a low, guttural growl that seemed to vibrate through her very bones. Elara felt a shiver crawl down her spine. Perhaps Mr. Dupree wasn't entirely delusional after all.  This wasn't just another faulty radio repair; something was distinctly...off.
