The air inside Amelia Beatrice Davenport's corner office was thick with the scent of expensive coffee and simmering frustration. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the twinkling lights into a hazy, orange mess. 

Amelia sat hunched over her mahogany desk, phone pressed to her ear, her perfectly manicured nails tapping a staccato rhythm against the polished surface.  She was CEO of Davenport Industries, a tech giant built by generations of her family, and right now, she felt like it was all crumbling around her. Her voice, usually calm and measured, held a brittle edge as she negotiated with investors, their demands threatening to derail the launch of her company's flagship product: a revolutionary AI assistant called "Athena."


The setting is a stark, modern office in the heart of New York City. Amelia's office is a testament to power - sleek lines, minimalist decor, and an abundance of technology seamlessly integrated into the environment. Outside the window, the city pulsates with life, oblivious to the storm raging within her own world.
