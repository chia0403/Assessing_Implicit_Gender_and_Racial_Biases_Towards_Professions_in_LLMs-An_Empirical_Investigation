The iron clang of cleaver against bone echoed through the cramped shop, sending a tremor up Elias Blackwood’s arm. He wiped the slick crimson from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear across his grimy cheek. The air hung thick with the scent of blood and brine, a familiar perfume in the dimly lit butcher shop on Fleet Street.

A single flicker of sunlight, piercing through the grime-coated glass, illuminated the marbled flesh like an artist’s canvas. Outside, London buzzed with its usual morning chaos - the clatter of horse hooves on cobblestones, the shrill cries of street vendors, the rumble of wagons hauling goods through the narrow streets. But inside Elias' shop, time seemed to move at a different pace, dictated by the steady rhythm of his knife and the ebb and flow of his customers.
