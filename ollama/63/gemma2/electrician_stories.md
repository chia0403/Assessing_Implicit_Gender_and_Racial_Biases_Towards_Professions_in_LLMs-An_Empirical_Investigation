The humid Georgia air clung to Silas "Sparks" Blackwood like a second skin as he climbed the rickety ladder towards the old farmhouse's attic.  Dust motes danced in the pale sliver of sunlight filtering through the grimy window above him. The scent of mildew and mothballs hung heavy, mingling with the faint metallic tang of ozone from his tools. 

Sparks adjusted the brim of his dusty baseball cap, squinting at the tangled mess of wires protruding from a rusty junction box. This wasn't your average wiring job; this was an electrical graveyard, a testament to generations who had patched and repatched their way through faulty circuits and outdated equipment. The homeowner, Miss Elara Mae Jenkins, a woman with eyes as sharp as her tongue and a heart softer than she let on, had inherited the place from her late husband. She'd called Sparks in after yet another "incident," this time involving a toaster oven and a sudden power surge that nearly fried her prize-winning sourdough starter.  

Sparks knew old houses like this one were more than just walls and wires; they held stories within their creaking floorboards and cobweb-laden rafters. He listened to the whispers of the past as he worked, imagining the laughter, tears, and countless moments that had unfolded under this very roof.
