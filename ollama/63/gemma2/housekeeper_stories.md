The scent of lavender and lemon clung to Amelia Thistlewood's apron like a second skin. It was her signature blend, meant to mask the lingering odors of past lives that seemed to cling to the grand, old manor.  She stood in the cavernous entryway of Blackwood Hall, its polished oak floor reflecting the flickering candlelight cast from the massive crystal chandelier overhead. Dust motes danced in the pale beams, swirling like tiny galaxies against the backdrop of faded grandeur. 

Amelia surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. The worn velvet curtains that framed the arched windows were drawn tight against the encroaching dusk, their crimson fabric whispering tales of forgotten elegance. A grand tapestry depicting a hunting scene hung crookedly on one wall, its once vibrant colors now dulled by time and neglect.  The air was heavy with the silence of solitude, broken only by the occasional creak of the ancient timbers settling beneath the weight of years. 

She straightened her spine, smoothing down the starched white collar of her uniform. It was a familiar ritual, a way to prepare herself for the long night ahead. For Amelia Thistlewood, housekeeper at Blackwood Hall, solitude wasn't a void but a canvas upon which she could paint her own quiet stories.
