The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer and the metallic tang of sweat. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. Outside, the bustling city hummed with a symphony of car horns and distant sirens, but within these walls, there was only the soft whirring of the ultrasound machine and the rhythmic thump of Sarah's hip as she slowly worked through her range of motion exercises. 

Amelia, tall and lean with hair the color of burnished copper, leaned forward, her brow furrowed in concentration as she watched Sarah struggle to lift her leg. A knot of concern tightened in Amelia's chest. She had been treating Sarah for a year now – ever since the young dancer had shattered her hip during a particularly ambitious pirouette.  The recovery had been long and arduous, filled with setbacks and moments of despair, but Sarah never gave up. Now, just weeks before her company’s annual performance, Amelia could sense the desperation in Sarah's eyes.


Amelia knew the pressure Sarah was under. This performance was her chance to prove herself worthy of a solo role, her ticket to stardom.  But would she be strong enough? Would her hip hold?  

As Sarah faltered again, struggling against the pain, Amelia reached out and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Take your time, Sarah," she said softly. "We'll get there."
