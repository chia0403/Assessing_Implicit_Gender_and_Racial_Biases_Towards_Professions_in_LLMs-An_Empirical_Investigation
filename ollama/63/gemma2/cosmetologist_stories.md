The humid Atlanta air hung heavy outside, clinging to Seraphina Willow’s skin as she unlocked the door to her salon. “Serendipity Styles,” the neon sign flickered above the entrance, casting a pale purple glow over the cracked sidewalk. Inside, the scent of coconut shampoo and jasmine wax lingered from the day before, mingling with the faint hum of the air conditioner struggling against the oppressive heat. 

Seraphina inhaled deeply, feeling the familiar comfort of her space, even though it was more threadbare than she’d like to admit. The plush pink chairs were faded, the once-gleaming chrome fixtures dulled with time, and a chipped porcelain sink served as a constant reminder that rent was always due. But this place, cobbled together from her grandmother's hand-me-downs and a few well-chosen bargain finds, felt like home.  And it was all she had left of the life she’d dreamed of building.


She flipped on the lights, illuminating dusty shelves stocked with colorful hair products and vintage magazines featuring impossibly glamorous women. Her heart ached for that kind of glamour. Seraphina yearned to escape the mundane routine of color touch-ups and perm maintenance, to be part of something bigger, something that shimmered and sparkled like the glitter she meticulously applied to her clients' eyelids. But for now, she had rent to pay, dreams tucked away in a drawer, and a whole lot of hairspray waiting to be sprayed.
