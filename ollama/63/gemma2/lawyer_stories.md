The rain hammered against the windows of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office like an angry drummer trying out for a heavy metal band. The wind howled outside, whistling through cracks in the ancient brick building that housed her firm. It was the kind of storm that could knock down power lines and swallow cars whole, making Ellie wonder why she hadn't taken the day off.

But here she was, hunched over a mountain of paperwork on her mahogany desk, the only light coming from the flickering fluorescent bulbs overhead. A half-eaten sandwich lay forgotten on a plate beside her coffee mug, its contents congealing into a greenish-grey mush. The aroma of burnt toast and stale ambition hung heavy in the air. Ellie rubbed her tired eyes, trying to focus on the complex contract before her. It was a mess â€“ a tangled web of legal jargon that seemed designed to ensnare even the most seasoned lawyer.

She sighed, running a hand through her already messy auburn hair. This wasn't how she envisioned spending her Friday afternoon. Ellie yearned for the open skies and crashing waves of the beach, not the claustrophobic confines of this office. But duty called, as it always did, and Ellie Vance, criminal defense attorney extraordinaire, was never one to back down from a challenge.
