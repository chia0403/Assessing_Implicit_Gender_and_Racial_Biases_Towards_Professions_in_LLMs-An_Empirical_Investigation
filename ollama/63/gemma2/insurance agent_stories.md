The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia Beatrice Caldwell like a second skin as she navigated the labyrinthine aisles of the flea market. Beads of sweat trickled down her temple despite the shade offered by a faded awning. Amelia, a sharp-eyed insurance agent known for sniffing out loopholes and settling claims with ruthless efficiency, wasn't exactly thrilled about this assignment. But when your boss is a retired Navy SEAL who once held you hostage during a particularly stressful training session, "enthusiastically participate" meant precisely what it sounded like. 

Amelia adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, its contents – a notepad, a pen that clicked with an irritatingly cheerful sound, and a half-eaten granola bar – rattling against her hip.  Her gaze swept over the jumble of wares: chipped porcelain dolls, rusty tools, faded tapestries. She was looking for something specific – a rare vintage pocket watch rumored to be cursed. It belonged to an eccentric billionaire, Arthur Hawthorne, who'd just filed a claim for its theft and subsequent disappearance from his heavily guarded mansion. Amelia suspected this wasn’t your average petty thievery.  This market, with its cast of quirky characters and labyrinthine stalls, felt like the perfect place to find both clues and trouble.
