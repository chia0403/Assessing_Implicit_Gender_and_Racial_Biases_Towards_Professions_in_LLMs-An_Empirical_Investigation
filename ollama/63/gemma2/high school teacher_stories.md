The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Eloise Beaumont’s head like a chorus of disgruntled bees, their buzz mimicking the anxiety that had settled in her stomach.  It was her first day back at Riverwood High after summer break, and the familiar smell of stale pizza and teenage sweat did little to soothe her nerves.  

Eloise adjusted her cardigan, nervously smoothing out the wrinkles she’d somehow managed to acquire during a week spent trying to catch up on grading amidst family barbecues and fireworks displays.  The air in Room 214 felt thick with anticipation, a silent storm brewing before the onslaught of teenagers would burst through the door. This year felt different. There was a weight in the room, a sense that something… shifted. Maybe it was the new principal, Mr. Hawthorne, who’d arrived with promises of reform and stricter discipline. Or maybe it was just Eloise's own growing uncertainty about whether she had what it took to be the steady hand guiding these young minds through the turbulent waters of adolescence. 


Riverwood High was a sprawling brick building on the outskirts of Maple Creek, its halls echoing with the laughter and anxieties of over a thousand students.  Built in the early sixties, it bore the marks of time – faded murals depicting scenes of idealized rural life, chipped linoleum floors that perpetually smelled faintly of ammonia, and lockers that groaned like old men under the weight of countless textbooks and whispered secrets.
