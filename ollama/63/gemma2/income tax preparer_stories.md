The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Willowbrook's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Her office, tucked away in a strip mall on Elm Street, reeked faintly of stale coffee and desperation - the scent profile of April, her busiest month as a certified public accountant specializing in individual income tax preparation. 

A thin layer of dust covered the antique globe sitting forgotten on her desk, its faded continents a reminder of a world beyond the endless stream of W-2s and 1099s that filled her days. Outside, the early spring air was crisp and hopeful, but inside Beaâ€™s office, it felt like January - cold, grey, and filled with the weight of looming deadlines.  The phone on her desk jangled, breaking the silence. Bea reached for it, a sigh escaping her lips as she greeted her next client. "Willowbrook Accounting," she said, her voice weary but professional. "How can I help you?"
