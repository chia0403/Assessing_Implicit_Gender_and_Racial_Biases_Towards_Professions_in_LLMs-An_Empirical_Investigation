The dew clung to Elijah Thornwood's boots like tiny, iridescent jewels as he trudged across the manicured lawns of Hawthorne Manor. The pre-dawn air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Dawn painted the sky in hues of apricot and lavender, casting long shadows from the ancient oak trees that lined the estate's perimeter.

He knew every twist of each rosebush, every crack in the ancient fountain, every bird that dared to nest within its walls.
