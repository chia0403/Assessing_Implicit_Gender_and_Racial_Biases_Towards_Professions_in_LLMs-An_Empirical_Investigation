The amber glow of the neon 'Lucky Clover' sign cast long, wavering shadows across the slick pavement outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation - a heady aroma that was as familiar to Amelia 'Amy' Rose as her own heartbeat.  She polished a glass, the rhythmic clinking echoing through the near-empty bar like a solitary metronome marking the passing hours. 

It was Tuesday night, slow even by their standards. A lone trucker sat hunched over a pint in the corner booth, his weathered face illuminated by the dim light of a flickering television showing some forgotten game show.  The only other patron was a young woman nursing a glass of wine at the bar, her eyes fixed on a point somewhere beyond the dusty shelves lined with forgotten bottles.

Amy sighed, wiping down the counter once more. She knew every crack in this faded wood, every stain on the worn leather of the chairs. This dive bar, nestled on the outskirts of Pine Ridge, had been more than just a job for years; it was her family's legacy, inherited from her grandfather who'd poured his heart and soul into its weathered walls. 


Now, she felt the weight of that legacy pressing down on her like a shroud. The bar wasn't making ends meet, the regulars were dwindling, and the whispers about closing up shop were starting to sound more like pronouncements than idle chatter.
