The diner hummed with its usual Friday night symphony: clattering plates, sizzling bacon, cheerful banter blending into the tinny jazz emanating from the jukebox in the corner. It was a chaotic melody Amelia "Amy" Rose knew by heart. She weaved between tables, balancing precariously stacked orders like a practiced tightrope walker, her smile never faltering even as a stray ketchup packet bounced off her knee. 

The Starlight Diner wasn't fancy, just a beacon of greasy comfort food and warm lights in the sleepy town of Havenwood. It was Amyâ€™s world - familiar faces, predictable routines, and endless cups of lukewarm coffee. But tonight, a strange energy crackled beneath the usual hum. A lone figure sat hunched over a booth by the window, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, whispering into a phone in hushed tones. 

Amy couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease.  This wasn't Havenwood. This wasn't *her* world. Whatever secrets were brewing beneath that shadowed hat, she had a feeling they were about to spill all over the Starlight Diner floor.
