The aroma of stale crayons and burnt sugar cookies hung thick in the air of Miss Eloise Evergreen's fourth-grade classroom. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust dancing in the quiet pre-dawn light. Outside, the sleepy town of Maple Creek was just beginning to stir, a symphony of birdsong replacing the nocturnal hum of crickets. But inside room 204, the only sound was the gentle tick of Miss Evergreen's vintage clock, each second marking another precious minute before the chaos of twenty bright, curious children descended upon her classroom.  

Miss Eloise, as she preferred to be called by her students, sat perched on a wobbly stool at her desk, grading papers. Her auburn hair, streaked with silver, was pulled back in a loose bun, revealing a pair of kind, hazel eyes that crinkled at the corners when a smile touched her lips. She hummed softly under her breath, a lullaby from her childhood, lost in the familiar comfort of numbers and spelling tests. 


But even as she reveled in this brief moment of tranquility, Miss Eloise couldn't shake a nagging feeling â€“ an intuition that today would be different.  A day unlike any other they had experienced before. And a shiver ran down her spine, a premonition of something extraordinary about to unfold within the walls of room 204.
