The humid Atlanta air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's skin like a second shirt as she trudged down Peachtree Street. Her heels clicked rhythmically against the cracked pavement, each beat echoing in the desolate quiet of the early morning. Even at this hour, the city pulsed with an undercurrent of restless energy, but Ellie felt strangely disconnected from it all.  Her phone buzzed in her pocket, a notification reminding her she had five missed calls from Brenda, her manager at Ace Realty. Five missed calls. Not good.

The glass and steel monoliths flanking her, glittering under the rising sun, seemed to mock her anxieties. They were symbols of success, of the deals Ellie desperately craved to land, the clients she yearned to impress. But today, the buildings felt more like looming adversaries, their cold facades reflecting her own sense of unease.  She adjusted the strap of her designer handbag, a gift from her last successful sale, hoping it would somehow inspire confidence. 


Instead, all Ellie could think about was Brenda's terse text message: "Meet me at your desk in five. Urgent."
