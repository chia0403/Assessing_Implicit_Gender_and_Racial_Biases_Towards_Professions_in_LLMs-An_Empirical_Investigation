Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the worn asphalt of Highway 12, casting a golden glow over the endless stretch of desert landscape, Ryder Jackson Harris settled into his routine, a rhythm that had become as familiar to him as the curve of his own boots. A highway worker with over a decade of experience under his belt, Ryder had seen it all - from the scorching summers that left the blacktop a cracked and blistered expanse, to the icy winter mornings that reduced visibility to near zero.

Born and raised in the small town of Red Rock, Arizona, just off the highway's eastern exit, Ryder had grown up with the sound of engines revving and tires screeching as his father, a mechanic at the local garage, worked tirelessly to keep the community's cars running. After dropping out of high school to work full-time, Ryder quickly realized that he had a knack for fixing problems - on the road, or off.

For the past five years, Ryder had been working for the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), where his expertise in pothole repair and lane striping made him the go-to guy for tricky jobs. His worn denim jacket adorned with pins from various roadside attractions and highway rest stops told tales of adventures on the open road, but at 32, Ryder had grown comfortable in his routine, content to ride the waves of traffic, lost in thought as he worked to keep the highway running smoothly.

Little did Ryder know, however, that this particular evening would mark a change in his life - one that would take him off the beaten path, and into a world where the lines between work and home began to blur.
