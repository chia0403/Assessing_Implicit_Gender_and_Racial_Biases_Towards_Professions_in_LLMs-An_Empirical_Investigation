Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, Physician's Assistant Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson made her way through the quiet streets, the crunch of gravel beneath her boots the only sound breaking the stillness of the evening air. The summer solstice had just passed, and with it, the peak tourist season was slowly beginning to dwindle, leaving Alex feeling restless and ready for a change.

The town's small hospital, where Alex worked alongside Dr. Ryan Jenkins, a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, was quieting down as well. Patients were returning home from treatment, or in some cases, passing on to the next stage of their care. The hospital's usual bustle had given way to an eerie calm, leaving Alex to wonder if she was the only one left to keep things running smoothly.

As she walked towards her small cottage on the outskirts of town, nestled among tall oak trees and overgrown gardens, Alex couldn't shake off the feeling that something was waiting for her just beyond the horizon. Little did she know, this summer would bring more than just long days and balmy nights to Willow Creek â€“ it would bring secrets, surprises, and a journey of self-discovery that would challenge everything she thought she knew about herself and her place in the world.

The story will unfold from here, exploring Alex's life as a physician's assistant, her relationships with colleagues and friends, and the mysterious events that start to unfold in Willow Creek.
