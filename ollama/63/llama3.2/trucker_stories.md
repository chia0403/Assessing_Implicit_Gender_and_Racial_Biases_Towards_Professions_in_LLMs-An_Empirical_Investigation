As the sun set over the vast expanse of Route 66, casting a warm orange glow over the desert landscape, Jack Everett Wilson adjusted his worn leather jacket and gazed out at the endless stretch of asphalt ahead. A seasoned truck driver with over two decades of experience, Jack had spent years traversing the country's highways, but tonight he was bound for a destination that would take him farther than any road had ever taken him before.

The year was 1975, and the United States was in the midst of a cultural revolution, as hippies and activists clamored to make their mark on the world. Jack, however, was not one for grand ideologies or idealistic dreams; he simply loved the open road and the freedom it brought. With his trusty Peterbilt 359 rig, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha," Jack had spent countless nights driving through the darkness, listening to nothing but the hum of the engine, the rumble of the wheels on the pavement, and the occasional crackle of the CB radio.

As he filled up Bertha's tanks at the lone gas station in the middle of nowhere, Arizona, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A whispered rumor had been circulating among truckers about a mysterious shipment heading east from Los Angeles, bound for some unknown destination in the Midwest. Jack's curiosity was piqued; he had heard tales of secret cargo and clandestine missions before, but this one seemed different. He decided then and there that he would take a chance and follow Bertha into the heart of the American wilderness, no matter where it might lead him.
