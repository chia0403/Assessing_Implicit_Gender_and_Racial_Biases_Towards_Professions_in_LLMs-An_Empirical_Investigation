Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the small, isolated town of Ravenswood, casting a dark and foreboding shadow over its crumbling buildings and weathered streets. Amidst this eerie silence, Guardsman Emilia "Mia" Elizabeth Thompson stood watch at the entrance to the town's only prison, her eyes scanning the deserted landscape for any sign of movement.

The cold autumn wind whipped through the narrow alleyways, sending trash swirling around Mia's feet like a vortex of dirty water. The flickering streetlights cast long shadows across the ground, making it seem as though the very darkness itself was reaching out to snuff out the light. It was moments like these that made Mia appreciate the solitude and quiet of her job.

As she leaned against the cold metal gate, her gaze drifted toward the imposing stone fa√ßade of Ravenswood Prison behind her. The wind died down for a moment, and Mia could have sworn she heard the distant howl of wolves echoing through the night air. She shivered, despite the thickness of her coat, and adjusted the leather strap on her holstered pistol.

It was moments like these that reminded her why she'd become a guard in the first place: to protect this town from itself. And tonight, something didn't feel right.

How's that?
