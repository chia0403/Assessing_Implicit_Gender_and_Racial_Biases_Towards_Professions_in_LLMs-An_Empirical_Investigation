Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her small, cluttered office and into the crisp evening air of the Pacific Northwest. The sound of seagulls filled the air as she gazed out at the misty coastline of Cannon Beach, Oregon. It was a view she had grown to love during her many years as a doctor, watching the sun set over the ocean from the comfort of her coastal home.

As a pediatrician with a specialty in neonatology, Emily had seen her fair share of life-or-death situations. But it was moments like these, where the only sounds were the waves and the wind, that reminded her why she became a doctor in the first place: to make a difference in the lives of others, one tiny human at a time.

Tonight, however, Emily's thoughts were not on patients or hospital rounds. She had received a mysterious phone call earlier that day from an unknown number, with only a single sentence spoken before the line went dead: "Your sister is in trouble."
