Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays after five. The misty rain-soaked evening air clung to the skin like a damp shroud, as if trying to erase the day's sweat and troubles. Amidst this melancholy backdrop, Ember Wellesley polished her glassware with a practiced flourish, her gaze drifting out the steam-streaked window of the Raven's Rest tavern.

As a server, Ember had grown accustomed to the ebb and flow of the evening crowd: rowdy college kids looking for a cheap buzz, couples on date nights trying to recapture their youth, and the occasional lost soul seeking refuge in the warm, golden glow of the tavern's fire pit. But tonight felt different. Tonight, Ember sensed a tension in the air that had nothing to do with the beer or the barroom chatter.

A shiver ran down her spine as she carefully placed a tray of whiskey glasses on a table by the window, where a lone figure huddled in the shadows. The stranger's face was obscured by the hood of their worn leather jacket, but Ember could sense their eyes fixed intently on her, like a predator sizing up its next meal.

"Can I get you something to drink?" she asked, her voice steady despite the growing unease in her chest.

The figure hesitated for a moment before responding, their low voice sending shivers down Ember's spine: "Just a coffee."
