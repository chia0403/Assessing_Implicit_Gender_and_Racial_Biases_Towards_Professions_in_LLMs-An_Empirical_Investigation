Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays, when the last remnants of daylight struggled to pierce through the grey skies like a faint whisper of hope. In the cramped, dimly lit offices above the bakery on Elm Street, Emilia Alexandra Wynter hunched over her desk, her eyes straining beneath the weight of a single sheet of paper.

As the chief bookkeeper for Wynter & Sons, Ashwood's oldest and most venerable family-owned business, Emilia was no stranger to late nights and tedious spreadsheets. She had spent the past five years mastering the intricacies of tax law and financial reporting, earning a reputation as one of the most diligent and meticulous accountants in the city.

But on this particular Friday evening, Emilia's attention was not on the ledgers or invoices; it was fixed on a peculiar entry that had caught her eye earlier that day. A small, almost imperceptible notation hidden within the margins of the company's latest balance sheet. It read: "Meet J at midnight. -J"

Who was J? And what did they want from Emilia Wynter?
