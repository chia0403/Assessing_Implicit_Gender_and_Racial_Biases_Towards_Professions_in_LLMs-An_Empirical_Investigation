Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that clung to the skin like a wet blanket. It was the kind of day that made you want to stay indoors with a cup of coffee and a good book, but for Jack Harris, the fog was just another part of the job.

As a carpenter, Jack had spent his fair share of days working in the damp, chilly air of Ravenswood's many old buildings. He had learned to appreciate the smell of saltwater and wood shavings, and the way the fog seemed to seep into every pore of his skin like a cold, clammy kiss.

Jack stood on the edge of the dock, his eyes scanning the water as he waited for the tide to bring in the day's shipment. He was waiting for a special piece of wood, one that would be the key to finishing a project he had been working on for months. The wood was said to come from a long-lost shipwreck, and Jack had a feeling that this particular piece was going to make all the difference in his design.

As he waited, the fog swirled around him, tendrils of mist curling up off the water like ghostly fingers. Jack shivered, despite himself, and reached for the worn leather jacket that hung from the hook by his toolbox. It was a habit he had developed over years of working in the weather, and one that he knew would get him through even the coldest, most miserable days.

Little did Jack know, however, that this day was going to be different. This day was going to bring with it secrets, surprises, and a whole lot of trouble.
