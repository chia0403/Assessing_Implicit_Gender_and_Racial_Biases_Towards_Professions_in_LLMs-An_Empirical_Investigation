Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building, gazing up at the grey, rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to match the somber mood that had been weighing on her lately. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice, Lexi had spent years helping others navigate their own struggles and find a sense of peace and purpose. But as she stood there, watching the raindrops slide down the windowpane like tears, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing her own way.

The envelope was addressed to her, but there was no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. Curiosity getting the better of her, Lexi picked up the package and turned it over in her hands, wondering what secrets it might hold...
