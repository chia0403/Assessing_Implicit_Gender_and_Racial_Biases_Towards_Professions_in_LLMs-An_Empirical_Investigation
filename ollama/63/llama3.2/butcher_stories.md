Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn broke over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, casting a golden glow over the cobblestone streets and the bustling market square. In the midst of this quiet morning scene, Emrys Fletcher, a ruggedly handsome butcher with a wild shock of curly brown hair, stood outside his family's shop, polishing the brass handle of his meat cleaver.

Emrys had inherited the old-fashioned butcher shop from his father, who had passed away just a year ago. The shop itself was a Ravenswood institution, with its wooden sign creaking in the gentle breeze and the enticing aroma of fresh meat wafting out onto the street. Inside, rows of gleaming carcasses stretched along the counter, each one carefully labeled and arranged to tempt the hungry residents of this close-knit community.

As Emrys took a final sweep of his shop, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something was brewing in Ravenswood, something that seemed to be simmering just beneath the surface of everyday life. Strangers had been spotted lurking around town at night, and there were whispers of a mysterious illness sweeping through the population. And Emrys knew – as if he could smell it on his fingers like the fresh blood from last night's butchery – that this was going to be a summer no one would ever forget.
