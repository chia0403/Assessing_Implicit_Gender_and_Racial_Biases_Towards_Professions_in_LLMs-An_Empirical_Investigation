Here's a potential story opening:

As she steamed through the morning mist that clung to the small town of Willow Creek, Dr. Emily Joy Taylor pulled up to the old dental office on Elm Street, its worn sign creaking in the gentle breeze. She had worked at Dr. Taylor's Family Dentistry for five years now, as a certified dental hygienist with a passion for keeping teeth clean and healthy. The familiar routine of morning coffee and patient preparation was about to become her reality once again.

The town of Willow Creek was quiet that morning, its residents still waking up from their overnight slumber. Emily took a deep breath, savoring the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the office as she unlocked the door. The building's weathered facade seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets only known to those who'd spent years tending to its teeth.

Emily smiled to herself as she began her daily ritual: prepping for a day of scrubbing teeth and soothing anxious patients with her warm smile. Little did she know, this ordinary morning would soon take an extraordinary turn...

How's that?
