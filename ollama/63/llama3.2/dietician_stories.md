Here's a story opening and setting:

---

The fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Crescent Bay in a damp, grey mist. It was the kind of day that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and a good book, but for Dr. Sofia Elena Vasquez, a registered dietician at the local hospital, it was just another typical morning on the coast.

Sofia had grown up in Crescent Bay, where everyone knew each other's business and the smell of saltwater and freshly caught fish filled the air. She loved her hometown, but she also felt a sense of restlessness, like there was something missing from her life that she couldn't quite put her finger on.

As she walked to work, Sofia checked her phone for what felt like the hundredth time. It was going to be a busy day at the hospital, with patients coming in for everything from routine check-ups to emergency surgeries. She had a long list of people to see, including Mrs. Jenkins, who was struggling with weight loss after surgery, and Juan Carlos, a young athlete who was trying to get his diet back on track after a nasty injury.

Sofia took a deep breath and stepped into the hospital, feeling a sense of purpose wash over her. She loved being a dietician - it wasn't just about telling people what to eat; it was about helping them find their own path to health and wellness. And she was determined to make today one of those days.

But as she made her way to the nurses' station to start her rounds, Sofia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The hospital seemed quieter than usual, with fewer people milling around in the corridors. It was almost... eerie.
