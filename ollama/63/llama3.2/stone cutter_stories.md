The sun had long since set over the rugged coastline of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the small village that clung to the edge of the sea. The air was crisp and salty, filled with the scent of seaweed and the distant tang of the quarry's smoke.

In a small, cramped workshop nestled between two rows of worn stone cottages, Emrys ap Rhys sat hunched over his workbench, his eyes fixed on the lump of Carrara marble that lay before him. A skilled stonemason, Emrys had spent years honing his craft in the quarries and workshops of Ravenshire, learning the ancient techniques passed down from his father and grandfather before him.

As he delicately chipped away at the marble's surface, a faint knock echoed through the workshop, followed by a hesitant voice calling out to Emrys. "Emrys ap Rhys? Emrys, is that you?" The sound was unmistakable - it belonged to Ieuan, his apprentice and closest friend.

With a grunt of effort, Emrys set aside his chisel and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a dirty rag. He knew that look; it meant trouble. Or perhaps, something far more significant than that.
