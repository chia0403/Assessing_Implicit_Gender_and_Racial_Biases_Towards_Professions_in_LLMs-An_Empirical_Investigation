Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Evelyn Alexandra Stone stepped out of her office building, the towering glass and steel monolith that seemed to pierce the grey sky like a shard of ice. As a partner at the prestigious law firm of Smith & Associates, Evelyn had spent years navigating the cutthroat world of corporate law, but tonight she felt like a small boat adrift in a stormy sea.

With her sharp mind and quick wit, Evelyn had built a reputation as one of the city's most formidable attorneys, taking on high-stakes cases for some of Seattle's most powerful players. But despite her success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been building in the pit of her stomach all day, like a whispered secret from an unknown source.

As she lit a cigarette and took a long drag, Evelyn gazed out at the rain-lashed streets, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of trouble. It was a night that promised to be like any other: dark, damp, and full of secrets. But Evelyn knew better than to underestimate the city's power to surprise. She had a feeling that this was just the beginning of a very long night.

The setting is Seattle, Washington, with its iconic rain-soaked streets, towering glass and steel skyscrapers, and grey, overcast sky.
