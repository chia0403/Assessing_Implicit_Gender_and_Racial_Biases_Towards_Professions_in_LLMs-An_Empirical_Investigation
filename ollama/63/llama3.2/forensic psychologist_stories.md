Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Adelaide "Addie" Wynter stepped out of the misty dawn air and into the sterile fluorescent glow of the forensic psychology unit's waiting room. The early morning sunlight filtering through the grimy windows cast an eerie pallor over the rows of worn armchairs, as if even the furniture itself felt drained by the weight of the secrets it held.
