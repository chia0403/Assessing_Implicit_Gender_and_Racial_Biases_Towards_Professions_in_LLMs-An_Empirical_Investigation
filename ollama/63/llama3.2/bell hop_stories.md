Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the dusty streets of New Haven, Arizona, a lone figure emerged from the fading light. Elijah "Eli" Thompson, a soft-spoken but fiercely loyal bellhop at the local motel, adjusted his worn fedora and gazed out at the dilapidated facade of the Traveler's Rest Inn. The once-thriving roadhouse on Highway 66 had seen better days, its neon sign flickering like a dying ember in the desert breeze.

Eli took pride in being the first face guests saw when they arrived, the one who greeted them with a warm smile and a welcoming handshake. But as he stood there now, his eyes scanned the deserted parking lot, his mind wandered to the cryptic message scrawled on a torn piece of paper that had been slipped under his room door earlier that day: "Meet me at the old windmill at midnight. Come alone." Eli's gut told him it was trouble, but something about the whispered summons felt tantalizingly familiar â€“ like a promise he'd almost forgotten.

The Traveler's Rest Inn may have seen its better days, but for Eli Thompson, tonight would be a night that would change everything.
