Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn broke over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a mystical veil over its quaint streets and sleepy residents. In a cramped, pipe-lined shop on Elm Street, Jack "Haul" Hawkins stirred from his slumber, the sound of dripping water and snores from his neighbor's apartment serving as an alarm clock. As a plumber with a penchant for fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains, Haul had grown accustomed to the early mornings. He rubbed the grit from his eyes and swung his legs over the side of the creaky bed, his worn jeans and faded work shirt a testament to his profession.

The year was 1955, and Willow Creek was a place where time moved at a slower pace. Haul's shop, "Haul's Pipe Fixin'," had been a staple on Elm Street for as long as anyone could remember. Its sign creaked in the morning breeze, adorned with a rusty wrench and the words "Plumbing - Jack 'Haul' Hawkins" in bold, hand-painted letters.

With a yawn, Haul shuffled to the kitchen to start his day, where he cracked open a cold glass of milk from the local dairy farm and gazed out the window at the misty dawn. Little did he know, today would be different from any other day on Elm Street â€“ one that would bring him face-to-face with a mystery that would test his skills as a plumber and challenge everything he thought he knew about his quiet town.

How's that? I've set up Haul's world, introduced him, and provided some context for the story. Let me know if you have any other requests or need further assistance!
