Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the dense forest that loomed at its edge. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was November in the Pacific Northwest, and the logging season had just begun.

In a small cabin on the outskirts of town, Ethan Julian McCormick sat on his porch, sipping a cup of black coffee and watching the stars begin to twinkle overhead. He wore worn jeans, scuffed up leather boots, and a plaid flannel shirt, the usual attire for a logger like himself. His dark hair was mussed from a long day's work in the woods.

Ethan had grown up in Ravenswood, the son of a logging family that had been operating in these very forests for generations. He had learned the trade from his father, who had taught him everything he knew – from how to fell a tree with precision to how to navigate the treacherous terrain of the forest. Over the years, Ethan had become one of the best loggers in the region, respected by his peers and admired by his family.

But tonight, as the stars shone brightly overhead, Ethan felt a sense of restlessness wash over him. Something was bothering him, something he couldn't quite put his finger on. Maybe it was the strange letter he had received that morning – an old, yellowed envelope with no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. Maybe it was the feeling that this season's logging would be different, that there was something more to it than just the usual rhythm of harvest and preparation.

Whatever it was, Ethan knew that he needed to get out into the woods tomorrow morning, to clear his head and try to make sense of it all. Little did he know, the forest had its own secrets, and some of them were about to come crashing down on him like a falling tree.
