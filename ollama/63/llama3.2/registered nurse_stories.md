Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The stormy night air clung to the small coastal town like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy veil over the sleepy streets of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea. The waves crashed against the rocky shore, their rhythmic pounding echoing through the empty sidewalks as the only sound in the stillness.

Inside the quiet hospital on the outskirts of town, Registered Nurse Alexandra Elizabeth Thompson scrubbed out of her patient's room, her eyes fixed on the floor as she mentally prepared for another long night ahead. As a seasoned ICU nurse, Alex had seen it all - the life-and-death struggles, the tears and tantrums, the endless rounds of beeping machines and antiseptic smells that could put even the toughest souls to sleep.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Alex's own past was finally catching up with her, threatening to upend the carefully constructed life she'd built as a nurse. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, shrill and insistent, as if it knew exactly what was lurking just beneath the surface of this quiet coastal town.

Alex took a deep breath, letting the familiar scent of antiseptic and disinfectant wash over her like a comforting blanket. She'd been back in Ravenswood for only a few weeks, trying to escape the ghosts of her own making and start anew. But tonight, with the storm raging outside and the hospital's eerie quietness hanging in the air, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking right into the heart of trouble.

And then, just as she was about to step into the elevator, it happened - a soft knock on her locker door, followed by a low, raspy voice that sent shivers down her spine: "Alex...can I talk to you for a minute?"
