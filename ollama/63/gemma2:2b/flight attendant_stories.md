The humid air hung thick as syrup in the galley, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a second skin. A wave of nausea rolled through her stomach as she scrubbed another dish, its porcelain surface stubbornly resisting the grime. 30,000 feet above the earth, she was surrounded by a sea of pale faces and the hum of tired engines.  

The plane's air conditioning struggled against the relentless summer heat, making even Amelia's usual calm demeanor flicker into something akin to an irritated sigh. This flight from New York to Los Angeles had been one long string of demanding passengers, each one trying to squeeze their way through the confines of cramped space and simmering frustration. It was a typical Wednesday in the skies, Amy thought bitterly, a day that would likely only be remembered as another tick on the clock of her own weary existence.

But tonight, a new passenger had entered the plane's universe, disrupting the usual predictable chaos. A man with sharp features framed by a thick mane of brown hair and eyes that seemed to hold centuries of unspoken stories sat in the aisle seat next to hers. He was dressed in faded denim and a worn leather jacket, a quiet presence that both intrigued and unsettled Amy. She couldn't help but feel drawn to him, his quiet aura somehow mirroring her own inner turmoil.

Amy took a deep breath, willing herself to focus on the task at hand -  the endless symphony of mundane chores that went with being a flight attendant. She was just supposed to keep things running smoothly and make sure these passengers were ready for landing, but tonight, something felt different. This man, this mystery he represented, threatened to disrupt her carefully constructed routine and reveal her own hidden desires.
