The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery oranges and reds as if trying to chase away the encroaching darkness.  A gentle breeze rustled through the towering pines surrounding Highway 50, their branches casting long shadows over the worn asphalt. This was always Daniel "Danny" Lawson's favorite time of day on the job – the quiet hum of his own machinery a counterpoint to the symphony of nature around him. He finished up securing the last piece of steel for the new median barrier, whistling softly to himself as he surveyed his work. The setting sun was a fitting backdrop for his weary smile. 

Danny wasn't your typical country boy; he worked a trade that felt more suited to a machine than a man – a highway worker. He’d spent years meticulously crafting a life out of the dirt, hauling heavy loads and wielding tools like an extension of himself. The calloused hands, roughened from years of work, still possessed surprising dexterity.  Tonight, though, even his usual sense of calm was dulled by an unsettling tightness in his chest. A job this close to home always had a way of making the quiet anxieties roar into full-fledged fears.
