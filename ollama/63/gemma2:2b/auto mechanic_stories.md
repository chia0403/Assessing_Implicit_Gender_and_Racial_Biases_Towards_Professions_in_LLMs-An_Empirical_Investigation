The air hung thick with the smell of gasoline and burnt oil, a scent that was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  He ran his callused hands over the hood of a cherry-red 1967 Mustang, its curves and lines etched in memories long before he'd even thought about driving.  The garage door groaned open behind him, letting in the light of a setting sun that splashed the concrete floor with hues of orange and purple.   Elias wasn't just an auto mechanic; he was a curator of dreams, coaxing dusty vintage machines back to life for those who dared to dream again.  

His workshop, nestled between a bustling diner and a quiet antique shop, was his sanctuary. The walls were lined with grease-stained manuals and blueprints, while old tools hung like weathered soldiers from hooks in the rafters. Elias, known around these parts as "Ellie" by his regulars, took pride in his vintage collection; each car held within its metal shell a story waiting to be told. Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, he had a case of amnesia and a customer with more questions than answers.
