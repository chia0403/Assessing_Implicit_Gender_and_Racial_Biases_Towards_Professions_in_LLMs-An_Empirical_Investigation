The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Thornton's head, their sickly glow painting stripes across the cluttered desk where she hunched over a spreadsheet. She chewed her pen thoughtfully, its plastic tip worn smooth from countless hours spent battling the yearly financial onslaught of her clients. The smell of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid scent of printer ink and desperation - two familiar scents in this small office space nestled in the heart of New Orleans's French Quarter. 

It was tax season, and Amy, despite her own meager savings, felt a surge of pride when she saw how many people she helped navigate the labyrinthine world of American taxes. Her clients were as diverse as the city itself: retired seamstresses with meticulous handwritten ledgers; struggling artists whose income came in fleeting bursts; and young entrepreneurs who dreamed bigger than their bank accounts allowed them to. But for all of them, Amy offered a steady hand, a friendly face, and the hope that they could finally claim their rightful financial dignity, one tax return at a time.
