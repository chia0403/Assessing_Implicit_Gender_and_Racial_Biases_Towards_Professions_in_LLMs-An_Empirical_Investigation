The crisp November air bit at Amelia Thorne's cheeks as she stepped onto the porch of a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on Oakwood Drive. The house, a sight incongruous with the burgeoning neighborhood's mid-century modern aesthetic, had been her personal project for months â€“  her attempt to breathe life back into its crumbling grandeur. The name "Thorne & Co." barely scraped the surface of this historical behemoth, the legacy of Amelia's late grandmother, who'd inherited it in a whirlwind of legal battles and family turmoil that Amelia was still trying to untangle.

Amelia, known for her charm and sharp wit, was a real estate agent with a penchant for restoring faded beauty. With years spent navigating the city's competitive market, she felt a kinship with these forgotten relics, their worn brick facades whispering tales of bygone eras.  It wasn't just about selling houses; it was about bringing them back to life, one floorboard at a time, her own legacy intertwined with each brick and beam.
