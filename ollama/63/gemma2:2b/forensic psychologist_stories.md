## Setting:

**The air in Dr. Alana Sinclair’s office hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and anxiety.** Bookshelves overflowed with well-thumbed tomes on neurobiology, criminal profiling, and the psychology of serial killers – an eclectic mix reflecting her diverse clientele. Sunlight streamed through the blinds, casting long shadows across the neat desk littered with files and a half-eaten bag of granola bars. Outside, the city hummed, the pulse of its existence a stark contrast to the quiet tension crackling in this room. 

**The Setting:** A prestigious New York City university, housing a Forensic Psychology department known for cutting-edge research and the occasional dark secret within its walls. 


## Story Opening:

Dr. Alana Sinclair tapped her pen against the worn table, tracing patterns on the chipped surface as she stared at the file in front of her. The case was haunting; a young woman found dead in an abandoned warehouse, seemingly no signs of struggle, just a single crimson stain marking the centre of her back like a macabre rose. The official reports called it a suicide, but something about Dr. Sinclair’s gut twisted with unease. 

“It just doesn't add up,” she murmured to herself, frustration lacing her words as she reread the police report, "No suicide note, no witnesses. It was an isolated incident. How does one just…vanish into thin air?"  

The more she examined the case, the more Alana felt a familiar tug at her sense of dread. The woman’s death echoed the chilling details of another unsolved case from years ago: A man found in a similar warehouse, his body seemingly untouched but with an unsettlingly blank stare. 

“It’s like trying to understand a puzzle where all the pieces are missing,” Alana muttered, rising from her chair and pacing the room.  "But maybe that's just me. Maybe I'm looking for something that isn't there."
