## The Crimson Apple

**Setting:**  The bustling metropolis of New Zenith holds within its neon-lit heart a quiet sanctuary: Hawthorne Academy, a prestigious private school steeped in history. 
A tapestry of ivy-clad buildings, ornate archways, and the constant hum of student life surround Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom. A worn wooden desk sits near a cobbled fireplace that roars into life with occasional bursts of wood smoke.  The scent of fresh ink and old paper hangs heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the swirling tides of teenage ambition and angst.

**Main Character:**  Elias Thorne, 37, stands tall at five-eleven with a sharp jawline and eyes that reflect years spent studying the intricacies of human behavior. He’s a history teacher whose passion for the past bleeds into every lesson plan, his mind a labyrinth of historical facts, forgotten revolutions, and epic sagas. But beneath this meticulous exterior lies a secret: Elias is haunted by the disappearance of his sister, Amelia, during her freshman year at Hawthorne - a case that still chills him to the core.

**Opening Scene:** 
The bell rings, echoing through the classroom with a hollow clang. The students file in, their faces filled with the familiar mixture of boredom and expectation. Elias watches them like a seasoned conductor, his attention locked on his most challenging student: Cassandra Grant, whose defiant smirk and sharp intelligence constantly challenge his carefully constructed world.

"Class, settle down," he begins, his voice calm but firm. "Today's topic is… well, it might surprise you."  He pauses dramatically, letting the silence crackle with anticipation. "The fall of Rome.” 
But before he can continue, a frantic knock on the door interrupts him. His face pales as the door swings open and his gaze catches sight of Cassandra, her eyes wide and uncharacteristically panicked. The crimson apple necklace that usually adorns her neck is missing.  

"Mr. Thorne," she whispers, fear lacing her voice, "there's someone in your room." 
Her words hang heavy, a storm brewing behind their innocent tone. Elias knows there’s no time to be polite – the clock has started ticking with alarming urgency. The mystery of Amelia’s disappearance intertwined with this sudden disturbance, paints a horrifying picture.
