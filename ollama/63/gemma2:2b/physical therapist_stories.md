Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Rehab, each drop an echoing drumbeat against the rhythmic whirring of ceiling fans. The air hung thick with the sterile scent of bleach and disinfectant, a familiar, almost comforting aroma for Amelia "Amy" Carter, physical therapist extraordinaire.  It was 7:30 p.m., prime time in the small-town clinic, and Amy's tired eyes caught the reflection of her own face in the stainless steel sink – a testament to countless nights spent tending to post-surgery patients who were both fragile and fierce.

The storm had been brewing for hours, mirroring the tumultuous emotions swirling inside Amy.  The recent fire at the local diner, where she’d known most of the patrons for years, had shaken her deeply. Even amidst the chaos of their lives, a sense of community that felt more familiar than blood ties was evident in every shared tear and hug. Tonight, though, it felt like everything was on pause.  The storm's fury reflected something deeper, a fear blooming in Amy’s chest – fear for the town she loved so fiercely.
