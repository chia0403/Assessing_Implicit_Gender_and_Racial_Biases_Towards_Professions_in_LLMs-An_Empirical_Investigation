Rain lashed against the windows of the opulent Grand Astoria Hotel, mimicking the symphony of unease playing out in its grand lobby.  Inside, nestled amongst the polished mahogany and gleaming chandeliers, stood Ezra "Eazy" Thorne, a bellhop whose worn leather shoes whispered tales of countless journeys. His gaze, usually filled with warmth, held a flicker of worry as he surveyed the scene: a hushed murmur among the wealthy patrons, the clattering of silver on silver, a frantic phone call echoing through the cavernous space. 

It was all too much for Eazy. He knew something was amiss, his years at the Grand Astoria honing him to recognize the subtle shifts in human nature. The usual boisterous energy had been replaced by an almost imperceptible tension, punctuated by brief, panicked exchanges between guests and the hotel staff. The grand ballroom, usually a vibrant stage for lavish parties, remained empty, its ornate ceiling shrouded in a palpable silence. 
 
Eazy took a deep breath, his worn uniform feeling stiff against his back as he adjusted the worn bellboy badge around his neck. This wasnâ€™t just about lost luggage or misplaced hats anymore; this felt like something far more significant, something that echoed through the very heart of the Grand Astoria, and into Eazy's soul.
