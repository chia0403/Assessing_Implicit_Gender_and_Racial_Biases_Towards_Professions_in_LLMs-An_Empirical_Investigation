The rhythmic scraping of metal against acrylic was Amelia's heartbeat, the only melody that filled the hushed air of "La Bella Mano".  A symphony of polish, scrub, and file, conducted by her nimble fingers, had been her life for the past decade. The salon itself hummed with the quiet confidence of an aging masterpiece - warm mahogany walls, a vintage chandelier casting shadows in the corners, and rows of meticulously organized nail polishes that whispered secrets of countless transformations. 

Amelia sighed, pushing aside a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her tight bun.  She loved this place. The scent of almond extract clung to the air like memories, each brushstroke on a client's nails a reminder of the stories they held. Tonight, though, was different. An unfamiliar tension vibrated in the room, a prickling sensation she couldn't quite grasp. A woman stood by the door, shrouded in a heavy shawl, her face obscured by shadows. Her presence sent an unsettling ripple through the usual calm of "La Bella Mano."
