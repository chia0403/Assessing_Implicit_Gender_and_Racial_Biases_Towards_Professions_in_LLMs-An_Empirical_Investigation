The "Welcome" banner hung crookedly above Amelia's desk, a permanent fixture on the wall since 2013.  Its once-vibrant blue paint was now faded to a dull, almost-white hue that seemed to amplify the overall dreary atmosphere of the Grandview Plaza office complex. It wasn’t just the building itself; the whole city seemed to be dragging its feet in progress, stuck somewhere between yesterday and tomorrow. 

Amelia ran a tired hand through her hair, already feeling the knot forming in her neck from the endless stream of irate clients demanding to speak to "Mr. Finch" or "Ms. Smith," who were seemingly just as confused by Amelia's presence.  Her name was Amelia Thorne, not to be confused with the infamous Mr. Finch (who was always a mystery) or Ms. Smith (who never stayed long enough for Amelia to get any real information about her clients). 

Amelia sighed, picking up a pile of unanswered emails on her desk: "Urgent Financial Advice," "Legal Notice Regarding Missing Pet," and "Property Dispute – Requesting Mediator." It seemed like every day brought some new chaos to the office, fueled by the city's own growing frustration. 


**Setting:**  A small, run-down office complex in a bustling yet forgotten corner of Chicago. The offices are cramped, dusty, and smell vaguely of stale coffee and desperation.  The only window on Amelia’s desk faces a dull cityscape, where skyscrapers loom above streetlights like giants lost in the fog.
