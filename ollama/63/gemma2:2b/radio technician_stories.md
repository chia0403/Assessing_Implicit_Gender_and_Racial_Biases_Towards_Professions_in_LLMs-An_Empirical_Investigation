Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of Bartholomew “Bart” Sterling’s shack, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his heart. The air thrummed with static, punctuated by the occasional crackle of interference that only added to the disquiet in the cramped space.  The flickering neon sign outside announced "Sterling's Signals" – a beacon of hope and despair for both desperate families and adventurous thrill-seekers across the desolate plains of Nevada.  

Bart wasn’t one for excitement, not even when his hands were covered in greasy grease and his overalls were splattered with sputtering copper wire. He preferred the soothing hum of his equipment to the howling winds that threatened to tear down the shack or the raspy pleas from the families waiting on the other end of his crackling radio. 

Tonight, though, was different. The static crackled louder than usual, and Bart felt a cold dread creep up his spine as he focused on the receiver. An uncharacteristically clear voice boomed over the speaker, "Bart? This is it. I need your help."   His hand trembled as he reached for the tuning knob, fear twisting in his stomach like a vine choking him.  He was about to enter into something far more complicated than just connecting two lonely souls through static and a shared dream of communication. The words echoed over the radio, "There's someone out there, Bart, an anomaly…and it’s dangerous."
