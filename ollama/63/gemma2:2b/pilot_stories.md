The amber twilight bled across the vast canvas of the Pacific as Amelia "Storm" Hawthorne checked her instruments one last time before pulling back on the throttle of her vintage Grumman Albatross. Salt spray stung her face, but she barely noticed the sensation; her eyes were fixed on the shimmering horizon, where the sun was slowly sinking into the ocean's heart.  She was heading north, towards the jagged peaks of the Alaskan Cascades, seeking a challenge that would leave even the most seasoned pilot speechless. 

Amelia’s worn leather flight jacket felt heavy on her thin frame as she adjusted the headset over her ears. The cockpit hummed with the familiar symphony of mechanics and whispers of the wind;  a comforting sound against the backdrop of the endless blue. Today was different, though. A rare weather anomaly had brought a shimmering veil of mist to the usual stark Alaskan landscape, making navigation treacherous even for seasoned pilots like herself. 

Her eyes scanned the charts one last time before reaching out and gently turning the lever on her left console. The engine purred in anticipation of the journey ahead, eager to be unleashed upon this uncharted expanse. The challenge was waiting – a flight path through the infamous ‘Mist Maze’, a place where even seasoned veterans lost their way.  But Storm had never been one to shy away from a good challenge.
