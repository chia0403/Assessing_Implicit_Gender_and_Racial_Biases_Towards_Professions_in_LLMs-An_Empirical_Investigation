The humid air hung thick over the island like an unwanted guest.  Its salty tang permeated even the sterile scent of disinfectant in Dr. Elias Davenport’s clinic, which was perched precariously on the edge of a cliff overlooking the turquoise expanse of the Aegean Sea. The idyllic setting masked the stark reality: this wasn't some Caribbean paradise resort; it was a remote island outpost where time seemed to slow down and ailments clung to the shadows like ghosts. 

Elias Davenport, his name as eloquent as the pronouncements he made during rounds, adjusted his glasses – a habit that somehow amplified the already intense seriousness of his features. At 32 years old, he’d been a Physician's Assistant for five years, ever since graduating from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The island had been his last year-long assignment before taking on more responsibilities at a larger practice back home. Now, with every passing day, the allure of the remote life clung to him like a warm hand in winter – an alluring yet daunting prospect. 

As he surveyed the crowded waiting room, Elias's gaze fell upon Ms. Sophia Dimitriou, an elderly woman who was being wheeled in by a young nurse.  She was frail and her face bore the marks of time, as if it belonged to another century. A tremor ran through Elias’s hand as he gripped his stethoscope. This wasn't just a routine check-up; it was his first encounter with a real islander in days.
