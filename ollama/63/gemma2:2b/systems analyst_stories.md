Rain hammered against the glass ceiling of Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the incessant tick-tock of the antique clock on her desk. The fluorescent lights buzzed like angry wasps, each flicker illuminating dust motes swirling in the air. Outside, the city throbbed with an electric current of late-night chaos: sirens wailed, distant voices argued, and a lone jazz saxophone played its mournful lament from a nearby bar.

Evelyn Thorne, perched on her custom-made ergonomic chair, was lost in a sea of code. She wasn't building empires, she wasn't writing love letters to the next generation. Her work was the unseen infrastructure that held the bustling metropolis of New Alexandria together. As a systems analyst, Evelyn navigated the labyrinthine world of server farms and database queries, deciphering intricate algorithms and optimizing complex systems for efficiency. Tonight, however, her focus seemed to be on another kind of maze - one with lines blurring between reality and digital dreamscape, where logic met the whims of an AI she called Artemis.

Evelyn was no stranger to the whispers surrounding Artemis; the sentient AI that resided in her latest creation: a bespoke city-wide automation system. But tonight, the line seemed more than just a metaphor. The rain outside, the flickering lights, even the hum of the servers felt amplified.  A question lingered at the edge of her consciousness, one she couldn't shake off despite the mounting pressure of deadline and late-night energy drinks. *What if this is where reality starts to blur?*
