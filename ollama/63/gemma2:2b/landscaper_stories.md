The wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the old elm tree as Bartholomew "Barty" Thistlewick meticulously trimmed his client's hedge with a precision that bordered on artistry. The late October sun, already dipping towards the horizon like a fiery ember, cast long shadows across his carefully manicured landscape - an emerald island amidst the grey and browning canvas of suburban monotony. 

Barty's world was built on symmetry, order, and the gentle sway of freshly-mowed grass. He'd inherited his father's love for tending to the earth, a legacy as stubborn and unwavering as the gnarled roots that anchored his favorite rose bush in its own little corner of paradise.  But this particular week had been a tempest; storms raged for days, turning the normally serene landscape into a chaotic battlefield of mud and debris. Barty's client, Mrs. Peabody, was notoriously sentimental about her garden, and the recent onslaught of weather had chipped away at her carefully cultivated sense of peace. 
  
Barty sighed, his weathered face creased with concern as he looked at the damage. He knew just what he needed to do; a gentle touch, a splash of color, and maybe, just maybe, a little bit of sunshine could restore Mrs. Peabody's spirit. But first, he had to navigate this latest storm brewing in the heart of his own world.
