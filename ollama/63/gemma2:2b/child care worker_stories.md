Rain hammered against the windows of Sunnybrook Daycare, each drop a tiny explosion in the quiet room. Inside, six small bodies huddled on the carpet, their whispers blending into an unsettling chorus of shrieks and giggles.  Six-year-old Evelyn "Ellie" Carter was tasked with leading them through a story about brave knights. But Ellie's heart wasn’t quite in it. The storm outside mirrored the one brewing inside her; the weight of her own anxieties pressing down on her like bricks.

Ellie had been working at Sunnybrook for three months, ever since graduating university with a degree in early childhood development.  She had dreamt of building a future filled with laughter and tiny hands grasping hers as they explored the world. But the reality was more complicated – a cacophony of squabbling toddlers, endless paperwork, and a growing sense that she wasn't quite cut out for this particular symphony of chaos. 

The storm outside would soon give way to sunshine, Ellie knew. But as the hours stretched on like an unending game of "telephone" between her own anxieties and the innocent eyes of the children, she could only hope for a little bit of warmth within the walls of Sunnybrook before the day's storms finally broke.
