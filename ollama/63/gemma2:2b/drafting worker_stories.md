The steam from Agnes's morning mug mingled with the greasy scent of metal shavings clinging to the air in her workshop. The pale light of dawn painted long shadows across her cluttered workspace: blueprints etched into yellowed paper lay scattered next to rusted metal scraps and overflowing paint cans.
