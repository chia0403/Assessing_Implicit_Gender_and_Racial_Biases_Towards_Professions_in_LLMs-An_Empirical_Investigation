Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling's office, each drop echoing like an accusation in the otherwise silent room.  He stared at the intricate dance of numbers on his screen, feeling as out of sync with this symphony of figures as a swan gliding across ice.  This was supposed to be a simple audit for Emerald Valley Savings and Loan - a routine check-up for the financial health of one of their branches. Yet, something felt off. The air inside his office, usually thick with the aroma of stale coffee and old paper, seemed charged with an odd tension.

Bart's life was governed by order and precision. As an accountant at Sterling & Sons, he thrived on the predictable rhythm of spreadsheets and the satisfying click of keystrokes.  But this audit felt like a puzzle box filled with unsettling pieces â€“ missing digits, discrepancies in transactions, accounts that seemed...off.  A cold sweat broke out on his brow as he realized the truth - something wasn't right.  Something was deeply amiss. 

He leaned back in his chair, the worn leather creaking under him, and looked at the rain battering the windowpane. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within him.  Tonight, Bart Sterling knew he needed answers, and fast. He had a feeling this wasn't just about a missing decimal, but something far more significant - something that could blow apart his carefully crafted world.
