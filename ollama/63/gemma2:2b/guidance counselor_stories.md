The scent of stale coffee hung heavy in Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne's office as she stared out the window at the late afternoon drizzle. The gray sky mirrored the dull ache settling in her chest. A month ago, Mr. Davis had walked into her office, all bluster and a crumpled apology note in hand. He was supposed to be a pillar of strength for his kids, but now he was drowning under the weight of their teenage angst. 

Eleanor Hawthorne, guidance counselor at Westview High, had grown accustomed to navigating the turbulent waters of adolescence. It was always a challenge, but this particular storm – one with lightning-fast accusations and simmering resentment – threatened to capsize everything. Her gaze lingered on Mrs. Davis's face in the window reflection. She saw the weary exhaustion etched deep into her features.

"Mr. Davis needs help," Eleanor murmured to herself, her hand reaching for the worn photograph she kept tucked away in a drawer - her own son, Daniel, beaming wide-eyed at an amusement park with his father beside him.  The photo served as a constant reminder of the bittersweet joys and inevitable heartbreak of life. The storm was not just about Mr. Davis; it was about finding a way to weather the next one that would surely come.
