The late afternoon sun slanted through the windowpane, turning Arthur "Artie" Hawthorne's shop into an amber-tinged paradise. It was the kind of light that made even the most worn-down wood gleam and dust motes danced like tiny stars across the polished floorboards. Artie hummed softly as he worked, his hands a blur of practiced precision while the clippers sang with the gentle snip of fading hair. He ran his fingers over the freshly trimmed neck of a young man who sat before him, then glanced at the worn clock hanging on the wall, just past the 4:30 mark. 

His barbering shop, "The Razor's Edge," had been a cornerstone in this sleepy town for nearly a century. The walls were lined with the stories of its patrons – etched into the wood paneling, in faded photographs and even whispered tales around Artie's worn-out stool. This wasn't just a place for haircuts; it was a time capsule, a reflection of life itself. 

Yet today, something felt off. The usual calm hum of his shop had been replaced by an unsettling silence, the quietude punctuated only by the tick-tock of the clock and Artie's soft, almost melancholic humming. A chill, unrelated to the late summer air, snaked its way down his spine. He glanced at the man across from him – a face he knew well, yet felt strangely unknown – and a shiver ran through him. Something in that young man's eyes seemed...different.
