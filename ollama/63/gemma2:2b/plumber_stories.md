Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Plumber's Wrench," its relentless rhythm mirroring the inner turmoil of Edward Thorne.  He ran a calloused hand through his tired beard, squinting at the flickering streetlights outside. 10:07 PM, and the storm had been going on for hours. The city was a swirling mass of black water and gray smoke, each gust threatening to rip open the very foundation of his tiny workshop.  

Edward Thorne, a man who knew more about plumbing than he cared to admit, was trapped in another nightmare.  A nightmare that started with a call from Mrs. Pettigrew, whose leaky faucet had decided to stage an operatic performance just before she went into her nightly routine. A nightmare that escalated through the night, turning into a full-blown monsoon and leaving Edward drowning in frustration and overflowing pipes. Tonight's job wasn’t just about fixing a leaking tap; it was about surviving another night on the edge of despair. 

He glanced at the worn photo pinned to his toolbox: Mrs. Pettigrew smiling with her husband, George, their faces crinkled by years of laughter and shared stories - memories that felt as distant and blurred as the rain-washed cityscape outside his window. George had been a plumber, too, but an old-time craftsman, who'd passed away when Edward was just fifteen. It used to be a source of pride for Edward, a reminder of his father's legacy.  But now, in this echoing silence, that image felt like a phantom limb – achingly close yet unbearably distant. 

He needed a break, a change of pace, a sip of something stronger than the lukewarm coffee brewing in the corner. The storm was still raging, and he knew there were other calls waiting to be answered, others who needed his skill and grit - just like Mrs. Pettigrew, waiting for him to bring back some semblance of sanity to their lives one leaky tap at a time.  But first...he needed a moment for himself.
