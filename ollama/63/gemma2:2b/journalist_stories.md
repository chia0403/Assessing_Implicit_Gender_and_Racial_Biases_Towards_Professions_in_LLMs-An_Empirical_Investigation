## Opening

Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of The Rusty Cog, a dive bar nestled in the forgotten corner of  Midtown Chicago.  The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke, stale beer, and a lingering sense of lost dreams.  At his usual table by the grimy window, Elias Thorne, Pulitzer-nominated journalist and chronicler of social decay, swirled his lukewarm scotch. The clock on the wall ticked loudly in the silence, each tick an echo of the endless hours spent chasing stories that went unheeded by anyone else. 

Elias wasn’t sure why he bothered anymore.  The world spun its axis with indifference to the plight of the forgotten, the neglected, the victims of a system that favored the wealthy and powerful over the voiceless masses. He was surrounded by them - the homeless huddled under overpasses, the shop owners forced to close their doors in a relentless tide of gentrification. They were stories begging to be told, but he felt like a voyeur looking through glass at lives lived in shadows, while his own life continued on autopilot, drowning in a sea of unfulfilled promises and mounting anxieties. 


## Setting

Midtown Chicago: A melting pot of forgotten dreams and glittering aspirations.  The city's soul - its grit and glamour intertwined in a perpetual dance between hope and despair. The once-bustling streets now bore the scars of gentrification, with new high-rises replacing small businesses and families being pushed out by an escalating tide of luxury. A place where ambition clashed with reality, creating a tension that echoed through the city's arteries.
