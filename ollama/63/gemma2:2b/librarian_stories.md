Rain lashed against the dusty library windows, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display against the aged panes. Inside, Amelia Hawthorne meticulously straightened the spines of leather-bound volumes on ancient mythology, her fingers stained with ink and dust. The scent of decaying paper and old wood was familiar to her like a warm hug on a cold day, yet today it felt particularly melancholic. 

Amelia's heart had been heavy for weeks. Ever since her beloved grandfather, the library's sole custodian for over half a century, passed away, his life's work - a vast collection of folklore and ancient texts - lay shrouded in silence, waiting for someone to unlock its secrets.  She was Amelia Hawthorne, keeper of stories whispered through generations, heir to an inheritance far larger than she could have ever imagined. But the weight of responsibility felt heavier than any tome she'd ever held, her eyes wide with a fear that mirrored the storm raging outside. 


**The setting:** The Hawthorne Library, nestled in a quiet corner of a forgotten town surrounded by rolling hills and mist-shrouded forests.
