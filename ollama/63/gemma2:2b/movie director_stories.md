## Opening: 

The flickering neon sign cast a ghostly sheen on the cracked pavement outside "Sunset Drive-In." Inside, the air hung heavy with stale popcorn and pre-show jitters. The faded red velvet seats whispered stories of countless shared laughter and silent tears under a sky bursting with stars.  All around, anticipation thrummed like an unseen bass line. 

**Name:** Ava Sinclair
**Age:** 34
**Setting:**  A ramshackle drive-in movie theater nestled in the heart of Los Angeles, California. The year is 1987.


Ava was a hurricane in a faded blue sundress and a smoldering gaze. Her hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, was escaping at the temples, framing a face that had seen too much, laughed too loud, and cried too deeply. She stood by her old director's chair, its worn leather creaking beneath her weight as she reviewed the final edit of "Lost Horizon," her latest project. 

"This isn't working," Ava mumbled to herself, tapping her fingers impatiently on the control panel beside a battered reel-to-reel tape machine. The film was a descent into the dark underbelly of Hollywood, exploring themes of ambition, betrayal, and redemption – just like her own life she couldn't seem to escape.

"Is that what you think?" A voice rasped from behind her. 


The screen door opened, revealing the man who knew Ava’s soul better than anyone. His face was etched with lines of worry and respect, framed by his trademark fedora and a worn-down tweed jacket.  **Frank "The Fixer" Johnson**, Ava's confidant, friend, and sometimes reluctant therapist, stood with arms crossed, watching her with the steely gaze of a man who had seen it all before. 

“Is this what you think?," he repeated. “This isn’t your story anymore.”
