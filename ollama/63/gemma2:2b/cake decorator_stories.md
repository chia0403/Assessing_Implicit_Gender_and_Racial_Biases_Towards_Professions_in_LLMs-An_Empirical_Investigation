Rain lashed against the windows of "Flour Power," an independent bakery nestled between a bustling flower shop and a vintage bookstore in the charming seaside town of Saltwind. Inside, Elara Nightingale, her flour-dusted apron splashed with purple swirls from yesterday's blueberry buttercream creation, surveyed the chaos of pre-Christmas orders. It was December 15th, and the air vibrated with an anticipatory hum –  the magic of a season that seemed to amplify even the most ordinary tasks into something wondrous.

Elara’s fingers traced the delicate patterns on her latest creation: a masterpiece of intricately layered chocolate cake swathed in white fondant, adorned with hand-painted holly leaves and tiny silver stars. The cake was meant for Mayor Thompson's annual Yuletide gala, and its intricate design was said to be inspired by his childhood dream of sailing the seven seas. But as Elara stared at her creation, a nagging feeling settled over her like sugar icing on a warm cookie. 

Something was missing...
