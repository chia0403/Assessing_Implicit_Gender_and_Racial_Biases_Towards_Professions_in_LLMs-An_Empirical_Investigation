Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Sarah Bennett's small office, blurring the already faded cityscape outside. The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting long, unforgiving shadows across her desk, which overflowed with paperwork and half-empty coffee cups.  She stared at a probation report in front of her – another case, another life turned upside down by circumstance. 

Her name was etched into the small, worn badge hanging from a chain around her neck: "Sarah Bennett, Probation Officer." The irony wasn't lost on her. All these years she’d dedicated herself to guiding young adults through the rough tides of their own lives, only to be swept away by the same tempestuous currents herself, time and again. 

She sighed, reaching for a second cup of coffee.  The scent of stale beans and burnt sugar clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the face of another late night. The door creaked open with a tired groan, the rhythmic sound of her supervisor’s footsteps echoing through the office. "Sarah," her supervisor's voice was a weary rumble, "I need you in my study."
