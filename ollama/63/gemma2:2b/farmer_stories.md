The morning mist clung to the fields like damp wool as Elias Thorne awoke, his weathered face illuminated by the pale sliver of sunrise. The scent of hay and early dew hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that normally soothed his soul. Today, however, it did little to alleviate the gnawing fear that settled deep within him like a stone. A storm was brewing, one not just of wind and rain, but of a kind far more insidious. 

Elias Thorne stood at the precipice of his livelihood, a legacy passed down through generations, stretching back as far as he could remember.  His family's farm – Thornwood Manor, they called it, with its crooked stone walls and sprawling fields – was a testament to years of sweat and toil. It was where he’d found solace, where the rhythm of his days—the planting, the harvesting, the endless cycle of tending to the land—had formed a comforting framework for his life.  But now, facing the approaching storm, Elias felt like he was standing on the edge of an abyss.

The farm is a typical English farmland with traditional stone walls, barns, and fields where crops are planted with careful precision.  The air smells faintly of damp earth and livestock manure, creating an atmosphere of serenity that contrasts sharply with the growing unease within Elias.
