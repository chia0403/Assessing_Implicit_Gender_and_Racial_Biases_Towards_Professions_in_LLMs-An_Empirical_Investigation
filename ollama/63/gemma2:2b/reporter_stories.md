Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, each drop drumming out a staccato rhythm that mirrored the hammering in Amelia Thorne's chest. Her fingers tightened around her pen, its weight strangely comforting amidst the storm raging both outside and inside this rundown pub on the edge of Rivertown.  The air itself was thick with smoke from forgotten cigarettes and a potent brew of desperation, fear, and grief. 

Amelia Thorne, ever-diligent reporter for the local paper "The Observer", had been here for hours, trying to coax out a story from Agnes Carter, a woman whose face, etched with worry and exhaustion, seemed to reflect the storm's fury.  Agnes was the last surviving witness to a fire that ripped through Rivertown's oldest factory yesterday. It wasn't just about insurance claims; it was about lives lost, stories untold, whispers of what truly happened in those moments of chaos. 

The town's official narrative painted it as an accident - a faulty wiring incident. But Amelia knew better. Something more sinister lurked beneath the surface, like an unseen predator lurking in the shadows. The smell of burnt wood and the silence after the flames died down were unsettlingly familiar to her. This was no ordinary fire.
