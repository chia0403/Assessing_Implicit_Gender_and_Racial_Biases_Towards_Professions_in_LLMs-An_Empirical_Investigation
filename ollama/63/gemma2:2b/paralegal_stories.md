Rain lashed against the windows of the small office, drumming a steady beat like a frantic heart on the worn glass. Inside, Amelia Thorne hunched over her desk, a mountain of legal documents spread before her like fallen snowflakes.  Her eyes stung with fatigue, and the fluorescent lights hummed relentlessly, casting an unnatural chill across the room. The case she was working on was a tangled mess of red tape, intricate agreements, and accusations that felt more personal than professional. It wasn't just the case - it was everything else.

Amelia sighed, rubbing her forehead with the back of her hand.  The relentless grey skies mirrored the bleakness in her heart. Today marked two months since her father’s sudden passing, and her grief seemed to have seeped into every corner of her life – even the sterile world of law. He'd always been her rock, her source of unwavering support, and now, she felt utterly adrift. 

The phone on Amelia's desk chimed, breaking the silence.  Her boss’ voice, laced with his trademark weary sigh, filled the room. "Amelia, we have a court hearing tomorrow," he droned, his tone as flat as the rain outside. 

"Yes, Mr. Harris," Amelia replied, her voice barely audible above the steady drumming of the rain. A knot tightened in her stomach.  As she looked at the pile of legal papers before her, it all felt impossibly insurmountable.
