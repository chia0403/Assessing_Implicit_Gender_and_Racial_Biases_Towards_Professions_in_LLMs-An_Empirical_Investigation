Rain lashed against the windowpane at The Golden Anchor, blurring the bustling scene outside into a watercolour mess of greys and greens. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Thorne wiped down the worn mahogany table in her usual methodical manner. Her fingers trailed over the chipped paint on the surface as she muttered under her breath about the need for some real cleaning power; the cheap disinfectant just couldn't cut through years of spilled pints and dropped fries. 

The Golden Anchor was more than a pub, it was Amelia's lifeblood, its chaotic energy fueling her own. For years, she had navigated the tides of drunken brawls, heart-to-hearts about love lost and found, and whispered gossip exchanged over lukewarm beer.  Tonight, however, seemed different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thick enough to cut with a butter knife. 

Amy glanced at the door, its heavy oak frame barely visible through the storm's fury, waiting for the first sign of movement. It was almost time; her shift started in an hour, and with it, the pressure would ramp up. A new face had arrived earlier that day - tall and imposing, dressed in a charcoal suit and radiating an aura that seemed to shrink anyone who dared cross him.  His eyes, however, held a strange spark of mischief that Amy found both intimidating and oddly intriguing.
