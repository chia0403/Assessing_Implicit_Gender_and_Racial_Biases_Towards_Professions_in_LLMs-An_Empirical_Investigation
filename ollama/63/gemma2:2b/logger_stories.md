The rain hammered against Silas "Blackjack" Thorne's worn flannel like a thousand tiny fists.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the damp chill seeping through the layers and leaving him feeling more bone-chilled than he cared to admit. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles, wet earth, and impending snow – an olfactory assault that Blackjack had grown accustomed to on these logging runs. 

The sprawling landscape of the Olympic National Forest stretched before him, a tapestry woven from emerald green trees and bruised purple skies.  His truck, a battered Ford F-150 nicknamed "The Lumberjack," sat nestled amongst the towering pines like an unwelcome visitor in this natural cathedral.  He’d barely touched his coffee before the steady drum of the storm started to paint a picture of its own – one of isolation and unforgiving nature, a backdrop for the day's work.

His boots crunched on the packed earth as he made his way toward the logging site, the setting sun casting long shadows that stretched like skeletal fingers across the forest floor. The rhythmic clank of chainsaws filled the air with a metallic symphony, a familiar soundtrack to Blackjack's life, a rhythm he knew by heart even when others couldn't decipher it.
