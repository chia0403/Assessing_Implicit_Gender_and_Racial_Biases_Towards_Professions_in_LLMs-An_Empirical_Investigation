The sun was already dipping behind the row of apartment buildings, casting long shadows across the concrete courtyard as Evelyn Miller, OT, stood in her small office. The air hung heavy with the smell of chlorine and pine-scented cleaners, a familiar, almost comforting scent to most people but one that left Evelyn feeling strangely stifled. 

Her gaze drifted toward the window, catching a fleeting glimpse of movement from the adjacent building. A young woman, barely out of her teens, stood on the stoop, clutching a single backpack against her chest as if afraid it might burst into flames. Evelyn's heart tightened; she knew this scene all too well. 

The girl was struggling. More than just navigating the physical challenges of living on her own for the first time - the fear and isolation were starting to take root, twisting into something darker.  Evelyn sighed, pushing open the worn door leading back into her office.  "Alright," she murmured to herself, "Let's get this show on the road."
