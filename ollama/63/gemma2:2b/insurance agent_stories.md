The worn leather of the steering wheel was smooth beneath Elias Thorne's calloused fingers. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon sign above that read "Lucky's Diner." It was midnight, the hour when even the most cynical souls craved solace. But for Elias, tonight felt like a prison sentence. He stared at his reflection in the rearview mirror: a weary face framed by tired eyes, etched with lines deeper than any policy he'd ever sold.

Elias Thorne was an insurance agent, the kind whose job was to help people navigate life’s inevitable storms – and sometimes, their unexpected disasters. For years, he saw every facet of human existence through the lens of contracts and legalese.  His heart ached for his clients' struggles, but his own life felt as rigid and unyielding as the steel beams he insured against fire and collapse. 

Tonight, however, Elias was stuck in a bizarre loop: caught in the same dreary routine at work, driving home the same way, and facing the same quiet despair. A sudden burst of rain, heavier than usual, sent chills down his spine, mirroring the icy grip of loneliness that settled over him. He wasn't even sure what he was expecting to find outside his door tonight.
