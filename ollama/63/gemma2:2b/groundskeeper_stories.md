The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Cecil Thorne like a damp shroud as he trekked through the overgrown gardens of Blackwood Manor.  Years of neglect had transformed the once-ornate facade into a tangled web of thorns and gnarled roots. The once vibrant hues of flowers now withered, their petals yellowed by time and sunless days. Even the squirrels, normally skittering with energy among the oak and maple trees, seemed listless today. 

Cecil's worn boots crunched on gravel paths as he navigated the maze-like terrain. He had tended to Blackwood Manor's gardens for decades now, a quiet duty passed down from his grandfather and carried out with an almost spiritual devotion. But even his familiar route held a new strangeness; the silence was palpable, broken only by the rustle of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.  He paused, his weathered face creased with concern as he looked at a patch of withered lavender. It had been flourishing during the spring, a vibrant burst of purple in the bleak landscape. Now, it resembled a skeletal frame, mirroring the desolate state of the manor itself.
