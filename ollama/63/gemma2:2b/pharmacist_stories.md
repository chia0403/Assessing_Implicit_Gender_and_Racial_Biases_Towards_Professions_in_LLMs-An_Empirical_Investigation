Rain hammered against the pharmacy windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Evelyn's heart. Her fingers danced over the prescription pads, each page a silent scream demanding attention.  Just outside, storm clouds grumbled like old men, and even the streetlights seemed to cast long, distorted shadows that stretched like grasping claws towards her shop. 

Evelyn Thorne was more accustomed to dispensing kindness than facing fear, but tonight, the air hung thick with it. The usual calm hum of the pharmacy had been replaced by a palpable tension, the kind that made the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. Outside, the storm raged. Inside, Evelyn's gaze fell on a single bottle, its label shimmering with an unsettlingly vivid red glow in the dim light. 

"A strange case," she muttered to herself, her voice lost in the steady drumbeat of rain against the windowpane. "And yet another reminder that life isn't always so neatly contained." 


**Setting:** The story takes place at a cozy pharmacy nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood, seemingly untouched by the bustling urban sprawl just beyond its windows.
