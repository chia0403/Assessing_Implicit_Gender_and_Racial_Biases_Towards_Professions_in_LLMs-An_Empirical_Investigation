The gritty sun beat down on the face of Elara Thistlewood, baking her cheeks to an unhealthy shade of crimson. She squinted over the edge of the cliff, her brow furrowed as she gazed at the colossal grey granite monolith that loomed before her. The rock face was a jagged, unforgiving tapestry of light and shadow, etched with countless years of wind and rain. This wasn't just any stone; this was the heart of the mountain, the source of Elara’s livelihood, and the object of her latest obsession - to carve its legend into existence.

Elara Thistlewood was a woman forged by granite herself, her life spent in the shadow of these ancient mountains. Her family had been cutting stones for generations, their legacy etched in every smooth curve and chisel mark left on the mountain's face. Elara wasn’t like her father or grandfather, who saw the stone as something to be respected and revered, not understood and manipulated. She sought to reveal its secrets, whispering stories of forgotten myths and echoing legends into its raw form with each stroke of her chisel.

Today, she was attempting to carve a scene from an ancient legend - the tale of a mythical warrior who had climbed the mountain's peak in a desperate bid for immortality.  The weight of the task pressed upon Elara's shoulders like a physical burden. She took a deep breath, the air thick with dust and salt spray, and began to work.
