## Setting: The crumbling grandeur of Blackwood Manor

The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the shafts of fading sunlight that pierced through cracked windowpanes.  Blackwood Manor, once a monument to Victorian opulence, now stood as a gothic ruin. Its once vibrant paint peeled away like sunburnt skin, revealing weathered wood and moss-covered stone. Even the wind, whistling between the skeletal arches of its overgrown courtyard, seemed mournful, sighing its way through broken statues and decaying fountains.

Inside, the scent of mildew mingled with old polish and damp earth. This was where **Elias Winthrop** toiled, his mop a rhythmic companion against the unsettling silence. A man whose past was as forgotten as the mansion's lost grandeur, he found himself adrift in this place where time seemed to have stopped – or perhaps only moved at the slow crawl of decay. 


He wiped down another dusty table, his mind wandering to the whispers that clung to Blackwood Manor like cobwebs. He knew he wasn't allowed near the supposedly cursed rooms, a warning from the timid caretaker who preferred solitude and the unsettling creaking of the house to anything else. But Elias found himself drawn to those very chambers – maybe out of morbid curiosity or perhaps because they offered the solace of whispers in a silence that seemed louder than any voice he could hear.
