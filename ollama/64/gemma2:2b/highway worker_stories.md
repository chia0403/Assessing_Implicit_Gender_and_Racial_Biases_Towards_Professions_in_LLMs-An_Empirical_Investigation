The air hung thick with the smell of asphalt and diesel, heavy as a storm cloud above John "Hawkeye" Harris' head. He squinted at the sun, already a bruised orange sinking behind the mountains to the west. It was going down fast on this stretch of I-70, just another night under the Wyoming sky for Hawkeye.  He’d been patching potholes since he was a kid, his hands calloused and familiar with the rhythmic buzz of jackhammers and concrete saws. Tonight though, something felt different. An unsettling hum vibrated through the steel floor of the truck he'd been driving all day, a low-frequency whine that echoed in Hawkeye’s chest. It wasn't just the usual rumble from his old Chevy. Something was off. 

Hawkeye stepped out into the night, adjusting the brim of his worn Stetson to shield his eyes. The road stretched before him like a ribbon woven through the dark wilderness. A lone coyote howled somewhere in the distance, its cry swallowed by the vastness of the Wyoming plains.  The hum pulsed again, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
