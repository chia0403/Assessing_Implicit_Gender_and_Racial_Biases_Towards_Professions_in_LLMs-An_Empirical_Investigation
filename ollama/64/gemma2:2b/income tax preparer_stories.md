The fluorescent lights hummed above Hazel Miller's head as she sifted through stacks of paper documents, each one a tiny universe waiting to be deciphered. A million-dollar question mark hung over each return, and it was just another Tuesday in her cramped office at "Miller's Tax Haven." The air, thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale ambition, did little to soothe the nagging dread that had been gnawing at Hazel all morning. 

**Setting:**  Hazel Miller's tax preparation office is a small storefront tucked away on a quiet street in a bustling but rundown corner of Detroit. It's a place where hope meets desperation, and every year brings an avalanche of financial anxieties in the form of tax returns. The only windows overlook a tangle of overgrown trees on a backstreet, making for an atmosphere of both isolation and hidden potential.

**Main Character:**  Hazel Miller is a woman with weary eyes that reflect the burdens she carries, not just from her job but also from a life touched by hardship. She's known as "the tax whisperer" in the neighborhood for her ability to untangle the complexities of income tax forms and bring a semblance of order to lives on the brink of financial chaos.
