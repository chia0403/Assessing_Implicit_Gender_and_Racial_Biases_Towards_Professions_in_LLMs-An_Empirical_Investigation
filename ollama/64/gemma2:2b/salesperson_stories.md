The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he traversed the aisles of "Gadgets Galore."  His worn leather shoes slapped against the linoleum floor, each step an unwelcome assault on his already frayed nerves. This was not what he'd envisioned when he signed on for this particular gig.  He'd dreamt of sleek yachts and swanky penthouse suites, not the dizzyingly overcrowded expanse of a discount electronics store. His name - Elias Thorne - usually conjured images of high-end clientele, but here, amidst the cacophony of bargain shoppers vying for the last working Wi-Fi router, he felt like just another cog in the machine. 

He'd envisioned selling luxury products, not struggling to sell a "refurbished" VR headset for a price that barely covered the cost of shipping. But life had a way of throwing curveballs, and this was one Elias didn't want to see spiral out of control.  His eyes darted across rows stacked with flat-screen TVs, their displays flickering in an attempt to mimic hope. He couldn’t afford to let this job derail his aspirations – not when the next opportunity might just be a phone call away.
