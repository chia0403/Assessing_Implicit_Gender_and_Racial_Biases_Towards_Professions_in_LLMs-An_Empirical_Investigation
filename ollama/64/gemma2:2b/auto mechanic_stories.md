The scent of motor oil hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of old coffee and burnt sugar –  a peculiar combination that seemed as much a fixture of "Rusty's Wrench" as the grease-stained floors and the ever-present humming of the vintage Ford station wagon parked on the bay.  Ethan Thorne wasn’t your average mechanic. With hands calloused from years spent wrestling with engine internals, he was also a man haunted by the past, his face etched with lines deeper than the craters in old car engines. 

He ran a hand over the dented hood of the station wagon, its faded red paint flaking off like sunburned skin.  It wasn't just any machine; it belonged to Mrs. Henderson, a sweet but fiercely independent elderly lady who'd lived on Elm Street since before Ethan could remember.  For him, every car she brought in was a puzzle to solve, each one a piece of her life story he desperately needed to understand.  The silence of the shop, normally broken by rhythmic hammering and whirring machinery, was thick with expectation as Ethan pulled out a worn, leather-bound notebook from his workbench.
