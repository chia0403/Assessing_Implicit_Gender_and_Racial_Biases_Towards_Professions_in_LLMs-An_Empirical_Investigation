Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Maya Sanchez's tiny apartment, each drop like a small drum solo accompanying the thrumming pulse of her battered typewriter. The stale air hung heavy with the scent of cheap instant noodles and the lingering ghost of yesterday's burnt coffee.  Maya squinted at the words on the page, a tangled mess of notes and half-formed sentences.  Her phone buzzed again - another lead from "The Source," that shadowy online forum where whispers of corruption festered in the digital dark. 

**Setting:** A rain-soaked alleyway in the grimy underbelly of New Delhi. Maya's apartment, perched on the edge of a bustling market district, is a small space filled with the ghosts of stories she's yet to tell.

**Character:** Maya Sanchez,  a young investigative journalist known for her gritty tenacity and thirst for truth that burns as brightly as the streetlights reflecting in the oily puddles after a monsoon downpour.
