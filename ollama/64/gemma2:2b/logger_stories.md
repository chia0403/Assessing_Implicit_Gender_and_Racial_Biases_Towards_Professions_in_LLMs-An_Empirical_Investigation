The air hung thick and heavy in the forest, each breath tasting like pine needles and damp earth. Even the sun seemed to struggle against the dense canopy, its rays struggling to pierce the emerald green walls of towering redwoods.  It was the kind of day that felt more like climbing into a black hole than breathing life into a living thing. 

This was where Elias Thorne lived, worked, and breathed. He'd been a logger his whole life, inheriting the rugged homestead from his grandfather - an old, stoic man with hands gnarled by years spent carving wood and swearing at the sky.  He knew the woods as well as he knew himself, each curve of bark a memory etched into his soul. But today, even Elias' familiar comfort couldn't stave off a prickle of unease. 

Elias ran a calloused hand over his worn brow. The last month had been strange; days started out normal, then a chill would crawl across the air, and an unsettling stillness would settle in the woods like a shroud.  Tonight, there was a palpable energy, a buzzing beneath the ground that made the earth itself seem restless. 

Elias' eyes narrowed. He could feel it - something had changed. The woods held their breath, waiting. And he knew, deep down, that something had woken up in this ancient forest, and it wasn't about to slumber peacefully.
