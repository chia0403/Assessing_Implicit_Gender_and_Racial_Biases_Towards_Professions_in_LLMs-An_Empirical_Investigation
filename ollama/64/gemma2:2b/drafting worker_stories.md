The fluorescent hum of the factory floor was a low-level drone against the roar in Elias's ears. The air hung thick with sawdust and the cloying scent of fresh paint as he meticulously measured a piece of plywood for his latest project – a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower for an upcoming charity auction.  Elias, who went by Eli to avoid the formal "Mr." everyone else used, was a drafting worker in this bustling, ever-shifting steel and wood factory, his life a symphony of repetitive motions and measured angles.

His small, cluttered apartment above the shop felt like a cocoon after the noisy intensity of work.  Even the dim light of the streetlamp outside seemed to hold him back from venturing into the night. The hum of the city was just too loud – the distant sirens, the rhythmic clatter of cars, and the shouts from passing vendors all blended into a chaotic symphony that threatened to drown him out. Tonight, he'd let himself drown in his work – tracing over his plans, meticulously sketching lines, and adding tiny details to his miniature Eiffel Tower. 

Eli was a craftsman, drawn to the precision and elegance of mechanical design.  He saw beauty in the mundane, finding solace in the tangible form of his creations. It was an escape from the ever-looming uncertainty of the world outside these walls, a small rebellion against the monotony that had begun to suffocate him.
