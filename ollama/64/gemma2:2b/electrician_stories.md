The flickering neon sign above **Elias Thorne's** van cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked streets. "Electric Dreams" it proclaimed in faded paint, mocking Elias' own dreams, which felt as dim and distant as the streetlights reflecting off the puddles below. He squinted through the driving rain, his worn leather boots splashing against the wet asphalt as he pulled up to a dilapidated building. The rusty sign above the door was barely legible: "The Rusty Lantern." 

Elias was no stranger to damp, dingy alleys and grimy buildings. Years spent working as an electrician had given him a nose for trouble, or rather, wiring that hummed with it.  Tonight's case felt particularly ominous; the owner of the building, a shadowy man named Silas Blackwood, had been surprisingly vague about why he needed Elias’ help.  "Something unusual," Blackwood's voice rasped over the phone line last night, "A flicker in the wrong place."  As the rain continued to pour, Elias wondered if this was more than just a busted light fixture or a faulty circuit – something darker, perhaps even dangerous, lurked beneath the surface of The Rusty Lantern.
