Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, each drop exploding on the already damp glass like tiny fireworks. The scent of stale cigarettes and something vaguely floral, almost sickly sweet, permeated the air inside.  Evelyn Thorne, her navy blue uniform shimmering damp despite its synthetic fabric, shifted uncomfortably in the stiff leather chair. Across from her sat James “Jimmy” Walker, a young man barely out of his teens, who looked every bit the lost boy he was: pale, with wild hair and eyes that held a mix of defiance and resignation. 

Evelyn’s probationary period at the county courthouse was proving to be far more difficult than she’d anticipated. The stories were bleak even before you met the clients - drug busts, petty theft, domestic violence, the lot.  Jimmy's case was particularly unsettling. He'd been apprehended for burglary and vandalism, two charges that felt almost too youthful for a young man with such an air of innocence about him. The circumstances had been peculiar: Jimmy's father’s legacy - the local "Gentleman" Jim, who ran a chain of antique stores across the state - seemed to have left its mark on Jimmy in his darkest moments. 

Evelyn felt the weight of responsibility settle heavy upon her shoulders, like an invisible chain linking her to this young man, to the story he was trying to tell. But the storm outside mirrored the churning turmoil within her – she was a stranger navigating unfamiliar territory, and the echoes of unspoken truths were starting to drown out the rhythm of her own life.
