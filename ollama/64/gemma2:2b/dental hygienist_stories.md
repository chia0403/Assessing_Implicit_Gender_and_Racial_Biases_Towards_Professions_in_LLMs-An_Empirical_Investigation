The stale, antiseptic scent clung to Amelia's clothes like a second skin.  It was another Wednesday at Evergreen Dental, her haven amongst the whirring instruments and flashing lights. The fluorescent bulbs hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of stainless steel chairs. It wasn't glamorous – far from it – but somehow, amidst the clattering tools and nervous sighs of patients, Amelia felt a peculiar sense of peace. 

Her name was Amelia Bellwood, and for fifteen years she had been cleaning teeth, meticulously removing plaque, and gently coaxing smiles from those who often only remembered the sting of pain. Tonight, however, something felt different. A tightness in her chest, an inexplicable unease that sent a shiver down her spine.  As she adjusted the mouth guard for Mr. Henderson, his eyes seemed wide with a fear Amelia couldn't quite decipher. It was as if he held a secret within those steel-blue orbs, one that went beyond the usual anxieties of dental hygiene. 
 
The city lights shimmered outside, casting long, distorted shadows across the floor.  A gentle breeze carried the faint scent of freshly baked bread from the bakery down the street, but Amelia found herself fixated on the clock, the insistent ticking a metronome to a heartbeat she couldn't quiet. Tonight wasn't just another routine Wednesday at Evergreen Dental; it was something more.
