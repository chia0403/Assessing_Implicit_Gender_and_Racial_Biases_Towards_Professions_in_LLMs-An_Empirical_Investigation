## Story Opening:

**Setting:** A quaint beach town nestled between emerald cliffs and azure waters. The air buzzes with the rhythmic melody of waves crashing against the shore, and salty winds whip through sun-drenched streets lined with brightly painted shops selling souvenirs, locally roasted coffee, and artisanal soaps. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Amy" Bellwether - known in town as a woman with hands that could crack any stubborn back and a smile that could disarm even the grumpiest fisherman.  Her clinic, nestled in a charming cottage overlooking the bay, is a haven of comfort and quiet. 

**Opening Lines:**

"Another day, another seagull." Amy sighed, watching one dive-bomb her parked car with an exaggerated flourish of its wings. "They just don't know how to respect boundaries," she muttered, adjusting the oversized sunhat perched upon her head.  The summer heat shimmered off the asphalt; a tangible weight settled on her shoulders as she surveyed the bustling beach scene through the cracked windowpane. 

It was more than just the sweltering humidity or the relentless drone of tourists' happy chatter that weighed on Amy’s spirit. A knot of worry tightened in her gut, an unwelcome visitor who had chosen this sunny day to linger long after it had arrived.  She knew what was coming; the whispers from the beachside café, where gossiping housewives would gather over iced lattes and juicy secrets, were always a step ahead. 

It was time.
