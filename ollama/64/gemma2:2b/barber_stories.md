The midday sun beat down on the bustling town of Oakhaven, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street. The air hung heavy with the scent of blooming honeysuckle and freshly cut grass, yet a faint undercurrent of unease ran through the normally vibrant atmosphere.  Even the jovial banter of children playing in the square failed to dispel the pervasive feeling of something amiss. It was this unsettling dissonance that clung to Arthur "Artie" Thorne like his own barbershop’s heavy leather apron.

Artie's small, two-story building at the corner of Elm and Main Street had been a cornerstone of Oakhaven for generations – or so he'd thought. Today, it felt more like a crumbling monument to an era past. His clientele, usually a tapestry of men from all walks of life, was dwindling. The whispers about "trouble" in the town spread like wildfire, fuelled by fear and uncertainty.  Even Artie’s usual cheery banter couldn’t pierce the gloom that seemed to permeate every corner of Oakhaven. 

He stood behind his worn wooden counter, watching the clock tick with a weary sigh. His customers were usually his solace, yet today, they felt like specters of an empty life.  The once vibrant buzz of scissors and clippers had been replaced by a disconcerting stillness – almost too quiet for a barber’s chair.
