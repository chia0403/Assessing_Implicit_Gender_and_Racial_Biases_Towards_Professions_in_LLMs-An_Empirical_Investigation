The crisp autumn air stung Theodore "Teddy" Sinclair's cheeks as he hurried down Fifth Avenue, the scent of hot pretzels from a nearby street vendor filling his nostrils.  He paused for a moment to adjust his worn fedora and squint at the flickering neon sign above the Grand Majestic Hotel - it was barely visible through the swirling rain. He hated this time of year, especially with its sudden chills that seemed to seep deep into your bones.

Teddy wasn't from New York.  He had arrived just a few weeks ago, escaping the suffocating routine and endless monotony of his life in Cleveland, Ohio. The Grand Majestic promised anonymity, freedom, maybe even a bit of magic hidden somewhere within its opulent halls. 

This was Teddyâ€™s first night as a bellhop here, and he already felt the weight of countless stories contained within these four walls.  The city's heart beat beneath him - a symphony of honking taxis, muffled jazz from an underground speakeasy, and the constant, reassuring rumble of the subway system just beyond the hotel's facade.
