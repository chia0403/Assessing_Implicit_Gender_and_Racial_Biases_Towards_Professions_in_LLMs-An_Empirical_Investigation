Rain lashed against the rusted tin roof of the old Victorian house, each drop hammering like a tiny fist. Inside, Bartholomew "Bart" Plumb, his grease-stained overalls plastered to his broad frame, stood surveying the aftermath of another plumbing emergency. He'd been battling leaky pipes and clogged drains for nearly two decades now, and this one, nestled in the forgotten corners of Willow Creek, was particularly stubborn. The house belonged to Mrs. Hawthorne, a woman with eyes like faded emerald chips and a voice that rasped like wind through dry leaves. She was convinced her basement had become "a breeding ground for unwanted creatures," though Bart suspected it mostly involved mildew and a stray squirrel's nest. 

But tonight, the air hung heavy with something more sinister. A chill snaked down Bart's spine as he heard a low growl from behind the cobwebbed fireplace. It was faint, like the purr of an old engine hidden deep within the house. He held his breath, his heart drumming against his ribs like a frantic bird trapped in a cage. Something was amiss, and tonight, even the raindrops seemed to hold their silence, waiting for the darkness to fully fall over Willow Creek. 


**Setting:** A quaint, forgotten Victorian house on a quiet street named Willow Creek. The house has been neglected for decades, with damp walls, peeling paint, and a dusty grandeur that hints at its once-grand past.  The atmosphere is heavy with the scent of rain, mildew, and the faint aroma of decay.


**Main Character:** Bart Plumb. A gruff, kind, and resourceful plumber who has seen his fair share of strange sights and mysteries throughout his years in Willow Creek.
