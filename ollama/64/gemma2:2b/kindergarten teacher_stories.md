## The Whispering Walls

**Opening:** A gentle breeze rustled through the overgrown willow trees lining Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright's kindergarten classroom door, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Inside, the walls held their usual vibrant chaos: rainbow-colored posters depicting farm animals now partially obscured by a sticky finger smudge from tiny Amelia’s latest art project. The afternoon sun slanted through the blinds, creating an abstract tapestry of light and shadow on the floor. 

**Setting:** Mrs. Cartwright's classroom in a converted Victorian home in rural Vermont.  The old house had been lovingly restored to create an environment filled with charm but also prone to quirks. A whimsical touch – a rocking horse carved from driftwood, or an antique grandfather clock with a pendulum that seemed to tick at its own unpredictable rhythm – always added a bit of mystery and whimsy to the space. 

**Main character:** Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright


This setting is designed to evoke a sense of calm and comfort, but also hint at something slightly unsettling.
