Rain lashed against the windows of the Oakhaven Elementary School library, drumming a frantic rhythm on the aged glass like a thousand tiny fists.  Inside, Dr. Emily Carter sat hunched over her desk, a swirling kaleidoscope of emotions playing out on her face in the soft light of an old lamp.  Across from her sat Sarah Jenkins, 10 years old and smaller than her size implied, her eyes squeezed shut and chin resting on her knees like she was trying to disappear. Her tiny body trembled as she whispered through a choked sob, “It’s happening again.”

Emily leaned forward, brushing a stray strand of hair off Sarah's forehead with a practiced gentleness. She knew the routine all too well: a sudden wave of anxiety crashing over Sarah during her scheduled one-on-one session. This was her fifth visit this month, and Emily had yet to understand what triggered it. The library’s atmosphere seemed to amplify the quiet tension in the room.  Oakhaven Elementary's old building creaked and groaned with every floorboard groan underfoot, echoing the storm outside. 


Emily took a deep breath, hoping to calm her own anxieties before she could even begin. 
The setting of Oakhaven Elementary was as familiar as it was worn. A faded Victorian exterior whispered of a bygone era, while the interior held the weight of decades.  A labyrinth of hallways led towards classrooms, each a microcosm of childhood's boundless energy and unexpected moments of quiet desperation. The school's presence, both comforting and stifling, had always been Emily's professional stomping ground, yet the storm outside mirrored something she hadn't seen in years.
