Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Croft's clinic, turning the world outside into a blurred watercolour wash of greys and greens. Inside, however, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation - an aroma Amelia knew well after years tending to both pampered pets and skittish farm animals.  Tonight was no different; the late evening brought a steady stream of worried owners, each clutching their trembling companions. A husky puppy named Storm lay listlessly on the vet's table, its whimpers muted by the symphony of wind and water hammering against the roof. The storm, like the anxiety gripping Dr. Croft's heart, seemed to have no end in sight. 

Amelia ran a callused hand over her tired face, trying to conjure a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos.  She had been a veterinarian for over ten years now, and though she loved every aspect of the profession - from the delicate suture work on a tiny kitten's paw to the sheer joy of helping farmers bring their animals back from a near-death experience - tonight, it felt like her world was tilting precariously.
