The air hung thick with the mingled scent of burnt caramel and cheap bourbon, a familiar perfume for Elara Thorne. She worked the dimly lit corner booth at 'The Rusty Crow', her usual haunt after work. Outside, a storm raged - not a gentle patter of rain against the windows, but an unforgiving barrage of wind that whipped the city's alleyways into a frenzy. Rain lashed against the grimy glass, creating ephemeral rainbows that danced before vanishing like fleeting dreams.  

Elara ran her calloused fingers over the worn leather of her apron, tracing the faded emblem: a crow with outstretched wings, its gaze eternally fixed on something unseen beyond the bar's shimmering surface. This was where she spent her evenings, crafting concoctions for weary souls and listening to their stories - stories whispered in smoky haze, spilling out like broken promises and long-buried secrets. Tonight, though, the usual quiet hum of conversation was replaced by an unsettling stillness. 

The door creaked open with a rusty groan, letting in a gust of wind colder than the winter night outside. A lone figure stepped inside, their silhouette swallowed by the shadows cast by the storm's raging fury. Elara felt a prickle of unease crawl down her spine. It was never quiet enough here for anyone to truly disappear.
