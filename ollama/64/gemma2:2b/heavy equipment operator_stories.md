The air hung thick and sticky with humidity, pressing down on Amelia "Amy" Dubois like a thousand tiny hands. Sweat clung to her forehead even as she stood at the edge of the demolition site, a tangle of steel skeletons against the bruised purple sky.  Sunrise was an hour behind schedule, a slow bleed into a pale orange that bled across the cracked asphalt, and Amy's headache throbbed in sync with the throbbing earth beneath her boots.

The sun was already scorching her back as she adjusted the safety harness on her worn Nomex shirt. She took a deep breath, filling it with the sharp tang of diesel and dust, the acrid smell a familiar companion after years spent navigating the brutal symphony of construction sites. This wasn't just any job for Amy; this was The Red Rock Project, a behemoth demolition scheduled to shake the foundations of the city itself. She ran her calloused fingertips over the controls of her massive Bulldozer - "Ruthless," its name read in faded red paint on the cab â€“ and sighed. It was going to be a long day.
