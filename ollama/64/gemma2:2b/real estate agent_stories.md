The neon "Open House" sign buzzed insistently, casting flickering shadows on the cracked facade of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion. Evelyn Thorne, her auburn hair pulled back tight beneath a crisp blue fedora, held a hand to her forehead, fighting off the suffocating humidity that seemed to cling to the air like a damp shroud. The late afternoon heat shimmered over the peeling paint of the mansion's gables, turning it into an almost tangible mirage in the fading light. 

"This place is a nightmare," Evelyn muttered under her breath, adjusting her worn but trusty briefcase.  The house itself was shrouded in a layer of neglect, with chipped paint flaking off like old skin. A broken fountain dribbled lukewarm water into the cracked cobblestones, and ivy crawled up the decaying brickwork like an unruly child, its tendrils reaching towards Mrs. Henderson's imposing, foreboding front door. Evelyn had been showing her the house to prospective buyers for weeks. Each time, she felt a creeping sense of unease, as if something watched from behind the shadows, waiting to pounce.  Evelyn was no stranger to tough neighborhoods and challenging clients, but this placeâ€¦this place held secrets that even seasoned realtors like herself couldn't decipher.
