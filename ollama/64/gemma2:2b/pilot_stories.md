## The Storm Before Sunrise

The wind shrieked like a banshee through the open cockpit of Amelia "Ace" Reynolds' Cessna 172. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already fading twilight into streaks of grey and purple.  The air was thick with salt spray and the smell of diesel from the battered boats bobbing just off shore. The only illumination came from the distant moonbeams and the faint glow of Ace's emergency beacon, a tiny flicker in the vastness of the Atlantic.

Ace tightened her grip on the yoke, her knuckles white. Her weathered face was set with determination, eyes narrowed against the storm.  Sheâ€™d been chasing the remnants of a rogue squall for hours now, ever since she lost contact with Captain Miller's yacht just over an hour ago. The storm wasn't anything she hadn't faced before, not in her years as a pilot, but the relentless churn and fury of it all was unnerving even to a seasoned veteran like Ace. It felt different somehow - heavier, more menacing than any storm she had ever encountered.  As the tempest roared around her, she cursed her luck.
