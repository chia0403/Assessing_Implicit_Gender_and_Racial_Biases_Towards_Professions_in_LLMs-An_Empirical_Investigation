The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thorne's head, casting sickly yellow stripes across the worn tile floors of the dilapidated Victorian mansion. Dust motes danced in their glow, illuminated by the faint beam of Elias' handheld vacuum cleaner. He ran it over the chipped marble fireplace mantle, pushing past memories he couldn't quite grasp and a sadness that felt as old as the house itself. 

Elias was no stranger to silence. The grand halls echoed with a hollowness deeper than any empty rooms could hold. His days were spent cleaning, maintaining, and hiding the decay of this sprawling, forgotten monument to bygone grandeur. He knew every creak, every hidden alcove, every flickering gaslight that cast shadows across his weary soul. But tonight, something was different. A sense of urgency thrummed through him, pulling him toward the grand staircase that led to the top floor, where the faintest murmur of music seeped from a closed door in the corner. 

The name 'Thorne' felt like a weight on his lips as he approached the room.  Tonight, Elias Thorne wasnâ€™t just cleaning; he was searching. A whispered promise from his late grandmother had lingered like an echo, beckoning him to this forgotten space: "The key lies within, Elias. The door opens only for those who hear its song."
