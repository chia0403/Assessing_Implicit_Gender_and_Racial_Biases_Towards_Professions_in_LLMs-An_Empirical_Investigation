Rain hammered against the window, blurring the bustling city lights into an anxious dance of yellow and red. Inside, Amelia Thorne's small office felt like a refuge from the storm. The scent of lemon cleaner lingered in the air, juxtaposing the earthy aroma of freshly-baked cookies left on the desk â€“ her attempt at bringing a sliver of home to the patients who often struggled with navigating their own worlds. 

Amelia ran a hand through her short auburn hair, feeling the tension knotting between her shoulder blades. The phone rang, its shrill tone jolting her out of her thoughts. It was Dr. Miller, another therapist from the clinic on the other side of town.  "Amelia," his voice was a low rumble as he spoke, "We've got a new case...a young boy, eight years old. A hit-and-run accident left him paralyzed in both legs."

Amelia exhaled, letting the tension flow out like smoke through her fingertips. The weight of this job, of these stories, was always present, but tonight it felt heavier than usual.  With a deep breath, she started to speak, "I'll be there tomorrow, Dr. Miller. I'll meet you then."
