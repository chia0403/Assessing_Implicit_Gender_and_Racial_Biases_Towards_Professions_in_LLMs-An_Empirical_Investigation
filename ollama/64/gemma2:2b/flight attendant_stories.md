The air shimmered in the humid, tropical air as Amelia "Amy" Dubois adjusted her headset, trying to ignore the cacophony of chattering passengers and the ever-present drone of the plane's engine.  Her smile felt like a mask, plastered on over the weariness that threatened to overwhelm her. 14 hours into her journey from Los Angeles to Honolulu, Amy was already exhausted, the monotonous routine of air travel taking its toll. She had been a flight attendant for five years now, ever since graduating college with dreams bigger than the sky itself. But today, those dreams felt as far away as the lush, green islands dotting the horizon she desperately wanted to see.

Amy scanned the cabin, her eyes landing on a young man hunched in his seat, face buried in a worn copy of "The Odyssey."  He looked lost and forlorn, almost like Odysseus himself after wandering the Aegean for ten long years. The setting sun cast long shadows across the aisle, painting the faces of the passengers with hues of orange and red. Outside, the world was shrinking, replaced by an endless tapestry of clouds and distant stars. Amy's eyes drifted towards him, a quiet sense of empathy tugging at her heart. Perhaps, she thought,  she could make this journey a little less mundane after all.

**Setting:** A Boeing 787 Dreamliner as it crosses the Pacific, nearing its final descent into Honolulu International Airport.
