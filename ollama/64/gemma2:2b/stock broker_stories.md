Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Mr. Alistair Sterling's office at Sterling & Co., blurring the glittering cityscape of Chicago into an impressionistic watercolor.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old wood polish and stale coffee – a constant aroma that clung to the walls and lingered on his crisp white shirts despite Alistair’s best efforts to maintain a semblance of order. 

Alistair Sterling wasn't your typical stockbroker. His office, with its mahogany desk and vintage leather chairs, was more akin to an antique library than a trading floor. He preferred reading Jane Austen novels in the evenings to watching the market fluctuations on his holographic monitor.  His clients were mostly high-net worth individuals who appreciated his meticulous research and calm demeanor amidst the chaotic whirl of Wall Street.

Tonight, however, he found himself staring at a series of stock options that looked less like a financial chart and more like an unsettling game board. The numbers danced before him, mocking his sense of control. It was as if the market itself were testing him, whispering a dark, unspoken warning through each fluctuating price tag.
