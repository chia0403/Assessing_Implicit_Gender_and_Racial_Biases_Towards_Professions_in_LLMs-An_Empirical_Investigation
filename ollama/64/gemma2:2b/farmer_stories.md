## The Setting: 

The wind whipped across Willow Creek, carrying with it a symphony of complaints from the dry earth itself.  It whistled through bare branches of ancient oaks that clung stubbornly to the mountainside, their leaves long since surrendered to the unforgiving drought.  Deep in its shadow, nestled amongst gnarled roots and whispering grasses, stood The Crooked Willow Farm. It was a testament to resilience – sturdy stone walls weathered by time, crooked beams groaning with centuries-worth of secrets, and a barn that seemed to defy gravity itself. 

## Character: 

**Elias Thorne**, his calloused hands still as sure as they'd been when he was young, was the sole inhabitant of The Crooked Willow Farm.  His eyes, once bright blue, now held the deep, tired grey of a man who had wrestled with nature for too long. He stood on the threshold of the barn, its wooden door groaning in protest at his touch. 


## Opening:

The air tasted of dust and despair, a reflection of Elias's own spirit as he surveyed the fields that stretched out before him like thirsty husks.  He ran a hand through his thinning hair, the gesture worn smooth by years of worry. "This drought," he muttered to himself, "it's got us all trapped."  The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the already parched land into a mirage – a cruel joke painted across the canvas of his dreams. The air hung heavy with the promise of another scorching day, and the unspoken weight of hope that Elias couldn't bear to name. 

He walked towards the well, its rusted metal bucket swaying gently in the wind.  The water was as parched as the earth itself, a bitter reminder that even the lifeblood of his land felt hollow.  Elias sank the bucket into the ground, hoping for some flicker of life, but all he received was a sigh – a lament from a drought-stricken world.
