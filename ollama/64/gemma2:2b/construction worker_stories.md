The midday sun beat down on Everett "Big Ed" Thompson's neck as he hoisted another bundle of rebar into his battered work vest.  Dust swirled around him, clinging to his dirt-smudged face like an unwelcome guest. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of fresh concrete and burnt diesel fumes. 

Everett squinted at the towering steel skeleton against the grey sky, a monstrous testament to human ambition rising from the barren earth in the heart of the Rust Belt.  This wasn't his idea of heaven - no sprawling vineyards or idyllic mountain resorts. This was a brutal, unforgiving world carved out of concrete and steel where progress meant more than just comfort, it meant survival. 

The project promised hundreds of jobs for men like him, a beacon in a time when the factories had all but shuttered.  His wife, Sarah, had been skeptical at first - she'd seen too much hardship to ever get swept up in the mirage of prosperity. But then, her hand had rested on his calloused one and he'd realized; there was no denying the pull of a future built on brick and steel. 

Everett "Big Ed" Thompson wasn't looking for fortune or fame - just a place to build, a place to belong. And in this city of rising towers and relentless industry, that's exactly what he was trying to do.


**Setting:**  The decaying industrial town of Iron River, Pennsylvania. Once a thriving center of steel production, it now faced an uncertain future amidst the decline of the American manufacturing sector. Despite this grim reality, a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of "Project Steel," an ambitious new construction project promising to revitalize the town's economy and create hundreds of jobs.
