The air hung thick with the sweet, heady scent of jasmine as Elara tended to her late-summer blooms. Her fingers, roughened by years of work, coaxed delicate lavender stems into the precise formation for a funeral arrangement.  "Rosewood Memories," she muttered under her breath, referencing the faded charm plaque hanging above the shop door. "The most beautiful kind of decay." 

Elara's shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a dusty antique store, was more than just flowers; it was a sanctuary in the heart of Oakhaven, a town where time seemed to slow down like a wilting bouquet left unwatered.  Oakhaven, with its quaint streets lined with Victorian houses and their equally charming inhabitants, felt frozen in an era of charm, but Elara was its most vibrant thread. 
 
A chill wind whipped through the alley behind the shop, rattling the windowpanes and sending a scattering of fallen leaves swirling down onto the worn cobblestones.  Elara sighed, tucking a strand of auburn hair behind her ear, then glanced over at the clock on the wall. 5:17 pm. It was almost closing time. The last few customers of the day were already trickling in - a young couple for a birthday bouquet, a woman with a grief-stricken face seeking a final, quiet blossom for a departed loved one. Elara's heart felt as heavy and drooping as a wilting hydrangea on display.
