The air in Mr. Blackwood's office always felt thicker than the velvet curtains that draped his mahogany desk. It was the smell of old books, stale cigar smoke, and repressed ambition, all mixed into one pungent aroma that clung to Amelia Thorne like a second skin.  She wasn’t supposed to linger, especially not after her latest 'mishap' with Mrs. Winthrop’s petunia collection (the culprit: a misplaced water bottle). But Amelia couldn't escape the allure of the office – each corner whispered stories of power and intrigue, secrets waiting to be unraveled. 

Amelia was a secretary in name only. While she diligently kept Mr. Blackwood’s calendar, filed away his handwritten notes on obscure international treaties, and managed his overflowing inbox (which, according to him, was 'a reflection of the world's chaotic nature'), her true passion lay hidden beneath layers of starch and polished shoes: a love for languages and history that went unacknowledged by Mr. Blackwood, who saw her as nothing more than a cog in his elaborate machinery of power.  The city hummed outside, but within these walls, Amelia was adrift in a sea of hushed whispers, her heart yearning for something she couldn't quite name – adventure, perhaps, or maybe, just the chance to be seen, understood.
