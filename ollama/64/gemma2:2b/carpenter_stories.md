The rhythmic thudding of hammer against wood was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne. His workshop, nestled at the edge of the ancient town of Oakhaven, hummed with an energy that only a craftsman's heart could understand. The scent of pine and sawdust mingled with the faint tang of beeswax, a comforting aroma he found soothing in the midst of the storm brewing outside. 

Elias was known throughout Oakhaven for his work, not just for its beauty, but for its resilience - sturdy furniture crafted to withstand generations.  Today, however, a shadow hung over him, heavier than the worn boards stacked on his workbench. He stared at the intricately carved oak door he had been working on for weeks - it was supposed to be the centerpiece of an important wedding, yet a gnawing sense of unease held him captive. 

It wasn't just the looming deadline, but the peculiar silence from the betrothed couple, Eleanor and Thomas. They hadn't spoken since their initial meeting at Elias' shop, each avoiding the other like they were carrying secrets - perhaps he was too close to them to truly understand their plight.


**Setting:** A quaint town of Oakhaven, nestled within a sprawling forest where generations have built lives and stories. The workshop is located on the edge of town, with a view towards the sprawling woods that form a silent border between it and the natural world.
