The morning mist hung thick in the air like a shroud, clinging to the manicured lawns and the towering redwood trees that lined the streets of Redwood Heights.  It wasn't quite sunrise, not yet the sharp crackle of dawn breaking through the clouds, but even in this pre-dawn stillness, a sense of unease lingered in the air. This was just how it felt for Silas Thorne, a landscaper who lived and breathed the rhythm of nature. 

His name echoed in his ears like a song played on an old, dusty guitar - a lonesome melody that he carried with him through every swing of his clippers, every delicate pruning of a rose bush, every meticulously-designed landscape he brought to life. He'd been tending the manicured grounds of Redwood Heights for almost ten years now – each day bringing a fresh wave of faces and anxieties, all intertwined with the sprawling green tapestry woven beneath them.  His hands knew this place like the back of his hand, but today, something felt different. Something was out of sync, off balance. 

A heavy silence hung over him as he surveyed his work – a masterpiece in shades of emerald, sapphire, and silver that stretched towards the horizon. It had been almost a decade since Silas felt truly challenged by anything in Redwood Heights, until today. The air held an unnatural stillness, even the birds seemed to hold their breath. And there, nestled between two towering oak trees at the edge of his domain, lay a single crimson poppy, its petals stained with something other than dew.
