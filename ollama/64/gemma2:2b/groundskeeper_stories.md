The wind whipped across Silas's weathered face, tugging at his worn tweed cap as he surveyed the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor. Sun-drenched leaves swirled around him in an emerald haze, their scent thick with the earthy aroma of spring. The air itself seemed alive today, buzzing with a restless energy that hummed against Silas's skin like a secret melody.  He was used to quiet mornings at Blackwood, a gentle rhythm of tending to the rose bushes and trimming the overgrown paths. But something felt different today, an undercurrent of excitement vibrating through the very air he breathed.

Silas’s hands tightened around his worn gardening tools as he gazed towards the manor's grandest creation - The Rose Terrace -  a meticulously sculpted garden where roses bloomed in a riotous array of colors, their perfume a sweet counterpoint to the earthy scent of soil and wood. 

But today, the usual charm was marred by a curious silence. The normally boisterous birds had fallen strangely quiet, their chirping replaced with an unnerving stillness. And then he noticed it - a shimmering, almost translucent orb hovering just above the rose bushes, its edges swirling like smoke on a summer breeze.  Silas’s heart pounded in his chest as he knelt down, drawn by an unseen force towards the strange and wondrous phenomenon.
