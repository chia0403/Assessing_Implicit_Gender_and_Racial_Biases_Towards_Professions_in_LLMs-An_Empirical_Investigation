The wind whipped Elric Thorne's cloak around him as he stood at the edge of the Obsidian Keep's courtyard. The storm had started brewing just after midnight, sending rain lashing down in sheets that blurred the already-dim moonlight.  He was sworn to guard the King's inner sanctum within these stone walls; a responsibility he bore with a heavy heart. For Elric knew that behind those iron gates resided not only power and wealth, but also a secret so dark, it could consume them all. 

The sky above crackled with an ominous purple glow as thunder boomed like the wrath of giants, and the wind howled through the towering spires of the keep, echoing his own unease. Elric shifted his weight from one foot to the other, adjusting the heavy hilt of his sword at his side. He was a guard of honor, a protector of those who resided within these walls, but even he could not escape the chilling premonition that this night would be unlike any other.  Something was coming, something dark and hungry.
