Rain hammered against the windowpanes like a hundred tiny fists trying to burst through. Inside, the dimly lit office of Inspector Rex Mallory felt like an icy mausoleum. The scent of old cigarettes, stale coffee, and something vaguely floral hung in the air, all contributing to the overall mood of melancholy that clung to him like cheap cologne.  He tapped his worn leather-bound notebook on his desk, a frown etching deeper lines into his face than any storm ever could. 

His client, a woman named Evelyn Thorne whose name was as sharp and unforgiving as her demeanor, stood rigidly beside the window, staring out at the swirling chaos of the city. The only light in her eyes burned with an urgency that mirrored the flashing neon signs outside. "She's been missing for days," she said finally, her voice brittle and thin like a shattered glass shard. 

"Gone without a trace?" Rex asked, his brow furrowing as he examined a photograph of Evelyn â€“ a woman whose youthful beauty was now marred by exhaustion and worry, framed by the sharp lines of an aging face. "Not that easy, Mrs. Thorne. Not in this city."
