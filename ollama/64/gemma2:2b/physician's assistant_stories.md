## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A dilapidated Victorian mansion perched on the edge of a windswept moor, shrouded in perpetual mist that clung to its crumbling stone walls like an ethereal shroud. 

**Main Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Croft, a sharp-witted and pragmatic physician's assistant with auburn hair tucked under a worn flat cap. She’d always felt drawn to the mansion, despite the chilling tales of forgotten family tragedies and rumored hauntings that clung to its air like dust motes in the dying sunlight.

The old iron gates creaked open, releasing an acrid breeze laced with salt spray as Amy stepped onto the property. The moor stretched before her, a vast expanse punctuated by craggy rocks and gnarled trees whose branches clawed at the overcast sky. 

"Miss Croft," whispered a voice from within the shadowed recesses of the mansion's facade, "You have been summoned."  Amy shivered, not entirely sure if she was imagining it or if the house itself held its breath before her arrival. The words echoed through the empty hall, carrying the weight of generations past and an unspoken invitation. 

The mansion’s air hung heavy with secrets, its ancient bones creaking under the onslaught of time, yet there was a strange allure to it, a pull she couldn't quite explain. Was it a sense of duty? A morbid curiosity? Or something darker, something that whispered of buried truths and hushed whispers behind closed doors?
