The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and caramelized sugar, a familiar comfort to Elara Willowbrook. Her small bakery, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Savannah's historic district, buzzed with the low hum of her stand mixer and the rhythmic tapping of her spatula against the countertop.  Sunlight streamed through the arched window above the sink, casting warm squares onto the worn wooden floor where flour dusted every surface like fallen snow. 

Today was different. Today wasn't about the usual assortment of cupcakes and layered cakes for birthdays and celebrations. Today, Elara was crafting a masterpiece â€“ a five-tiered wedding cake destined to be the centerpiece of a lavish ceremony at the Wormsloe Historic Site. The delicate sugar roses she painstakingly sculpted, each petal meticulously textured with her fingertips, were meant to evoke the timeless beauty of the moss-draped oaks that stood sentinel over the estate.
