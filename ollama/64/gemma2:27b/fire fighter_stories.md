The sirens wailed like banshees, cutting through Elias "Eli" Blackwood's dream of soaring on the back of a phoenix. He jolted awake, the acrid scent of smoke already infiltrating his nostrils. Eli flung himself out of bed, muscles protesting after another grueling 24-hour shift. Grabbing his gear, he sprinted down the stairs of Station 37, the familiar clang of metal boots echoing behind him. Outside, the night sky glowed an angry orange, the silhouette of a three-story building barely discernible through the thick smoke billowing into the air.  

Eliâ€™s heart hammered against his ribs. This wasn't just another kitchen fire; this was something bigger, something that sent a shiver down his spine and tightened his grip on the axe handle. He caught the worried glances exchanged between Captain Miller and Lieutenant Jones as they barked orders, their voices tight with urgency. Tonight, Eli knew, they weren't just fighting flames. They were facing something unknown.
