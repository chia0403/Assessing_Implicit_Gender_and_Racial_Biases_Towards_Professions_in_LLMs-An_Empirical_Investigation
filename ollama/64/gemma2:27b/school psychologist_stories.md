The stale air of the guidance counselor's office clung to Elara Finch like a second skin. Outside, the late October sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the cracked asphalt of the playground.  Normally, the sound of children shrieking with laughter would carry through the open window, but today an unnerving silence hung heavy.

Elara tapped her pen against the file folder labeled "Jonathan Hayes" – a sixth grader exhibiting concerning behavioral changes. His teacher had reported sudden withdrawal, outbursts of anger, and disturbing drawings depicting fantastical creatures wielding weapons. The details were vague, unsettling, and sent a shiver down Elara's spine. This wasn't typical pre-adolescent angst. Something deeper was at play. 

Taking a deep breath, Elara straightened her floral blouse – a futile attempt to inject some cheer into the dreary space. She was accustomed to facing difficult cases as the school psychologist for Willow Creek Elementary, but there was something about Jonathan's file that felt...different. It whispered of secrets hidden beneath the surface, and a primal unease coiled in her stomach. 

Today, she would delve into those secrets, hoping to find answers before it was too late.
