The neon glow of the "Last Chance Diner" flickered like a dying firefly against the endless black canvas of the Nevada desert. Dust devils danced in the distance, their ethereal forms twisting and swirling beneath the unforgiving glare of the moon.  

Behind the wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, Jeremiah "Red" Blackwood squinted at the weathered sign, his calloused hand tightening around the worn leather of the steering wheel. Fatigue gnawed at him, a relentless beast demanding rest. He'd been on the road for three days straight, hauling a load of steel beams from Phoenix to Reno.

Red sighed, a plume of condensation escaping his lips and vanishing into the cool desert air.  He needed coffee, strong enough to strip paint off a car. And maybe a slice of pie, something sweet to counter the bitter taste of loneliness that lingered on his tongue.

The diner's parking lot, already mostly filled with other weary travelers seeking refuge from the road, held a lone spot under a flickering sodium lamp. Red maneuvered his rig into the space, the diesel engine groaning in protest after its long haul.
