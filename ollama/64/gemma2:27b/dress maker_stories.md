Rain hammered against the warped glass of Seraphina Rosalind Blackwood's attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart. Below, the cobblestone streets of Whitechapel were slick with mud and shadowed by a perpetually overcast sky. London in November was rarely kind, but this year, it seemed determined to snuff out even the last embers of hope within Seraphina's weary soul.

Her workshop, bathed in the pale light filtering through dusty skylights, was cluttered with bolts of silk, velvet, and lace â€“ remnants of a life once brimming with creativity. Now, the once vibrant fabrics lay draped over dress forms like forgotten dreams, each one whispering tales of gowns she'd crafted for elegant ladies attending opulent balls and society gatherings.

But those days were long gone. A whispered rumour, a hasty accusation, had stripped Seraphina of her reputation and left her adrift in a sea of poverty and shame. Now, she struggled to make ends meet, mending tattered clothes for the neighbourhood children and altering worn-out aprons for weary housewives. The once renowned dressmaker of Whitechapel was reduced to a mere shadow of her former self, haunted by the ghosts of her past and the chilling reality of her present.
