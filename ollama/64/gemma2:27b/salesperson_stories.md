Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Emilia Cartwright's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Outside, the neon glow of Times Square pulsed with an indifferent energy, oblivious to Emilia's mounting anxiety. Today was pitch day – the day she’d present her innovative new marketing campaign to the notoriously hard-to-please executives at Titan Industries. 

Her heart thumped a frantic rhythm against her ribs as she stared at the presentation slides projected onto the wall. The air in the tiny office felt thick and stifling, laced with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Emilia chewed on her lip, her gaze flitting between the bold typeface proclaiming "Project Phoenix" and the clock ticking ominously on the wall. Titan Industries was a titan indeed – a behemoth in the tech world, and landing their account would catapult Emilia's career into the stratosphere. But failure wasn’t an option. Not today.  

Not when she’d poured her heart and soul into this project for months.
