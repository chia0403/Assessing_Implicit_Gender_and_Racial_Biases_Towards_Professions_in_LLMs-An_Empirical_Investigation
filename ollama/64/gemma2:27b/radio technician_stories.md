The air in the cramped workshop hung thick with the scent of soldering flux and ozone. Outside, the Alaskan winter raged – wind howling like a banshee, snow piling against the windowpanes in thick drifts.  Inside, Elias Finnigan, his face illuminated by the flickering glow of a faulty vacuum tube, wrestled with a recalcitrant radio receiver. 

Elias wasn't your typical Alaskan. He didn't yearn for the thrill of dog sledding or ice fishing. His passions lay amidst tangled wires and humming circuits.  He’d come to this remote outpost, nestled in the shadow of Denali, seeking solitude and the quiet satisfaction of bringing voices from afar into the stillness of the wilderness. 

But today, even the comforting hum of his tools seemed muffled by a growing unease. The receiver crackled with static, refusing to yield its secrets. And beyond the howling wind, Elias thought he heard something else – a faint, rhythmic pulse, almost imperceptible beneath the storm’s fury. It was unlike anything he'd ever encountered before.
