The scent of crayons and desperation hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne’s kindergarten classroom. It was 3:15 on a Thursday, which meant two things: the afternoon slump had officially set in and it was only fifteen minutes until herding twenty five-year-olds onto the school bus. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the playground, turning the plastic slides into miniature saunas.

Eleanor sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. The day had started promisingly enough – vibrant artwork depicting spring flowers adorned the bulletin board, the snack table was laden with apple slices and yogurt pouches, and the reading corner beckoned with a worn copy of "Corduroy". But somewhere between circle time and finger painting, chaos had ensued.

First, there was Timmy, who insisted on wearing his Spiderman mask while attempting to build a skyscraper out of blocks, much to the chagrin of Olivia, whose meticulously crafted princess castle he accidentally demolished. Then came the glue incident, resulting in sticky fingers, tearful outbursts, and a suspiciously purple stain on Eleanor's otherwise pristine floral blouse. Now, as she surveyed her exhausted charges, all buzzing with the pent-up energy of a sugar rush, Eleanor couldn't help but wonder if she was cut out for this job after all.
