The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty chalkboard in Ms. Eloise Beaumont’s English classroom. Outside, the cicadas droned their relentless summer song, but inside, a heavy silence reigned. Eloise leaned against her desk, exhaustion etched into her normally lively features. Papers, graded and ungraded, formed precarious towers on every surface, threatening to topple with the slightest breeze.  

For years, she'd loved teaching, igniting young minds with the power of words. But this year felt different, heavier. The spark was flickering, threatened by a relentless tide of standardized tests, apathetic students, and dwindling resources. Today’s class had been particularly trying - a battle against boredom and indifference that left Eloise feeling drained and questioning her purpose.
