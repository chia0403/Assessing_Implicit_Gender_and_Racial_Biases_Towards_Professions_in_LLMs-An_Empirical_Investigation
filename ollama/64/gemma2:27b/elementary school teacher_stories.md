The worn bell above the classroom door clanged with weary familiarity as Eleanor Winthrop ushered her gaggle of second graders into their seats. Sunlight, already slanting low in the afternoon sky, spilled through the dusty windows onto the mismatched collection of desks and chairs that populated Room 203. The scent of crayons, glue sticks, and slightly stale pizza crusts hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume for Eleanor after ten years at Oakhaven Elementary. Today, however, even the comforting chaos felt off-kilter.

A letter had arrived that morning, crisp white envelope stark against the usual clutter on her desk. It bore no return address, only her name scrawled in elegant cursive. Inside, a single sentence, chillingly out of place amongst her lesson plans and student artwork: "The clock is ticking." 


Eleanor glanced nervously at the battered clock above the blackboard, its hands inching towards three o'clock dismissal. The letter felt like a cold finger tracing down her spine. What did it mean? Who sent it?
