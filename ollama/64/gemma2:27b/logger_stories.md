The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A thin mist clung to the towering Douglas firs, obscuring their peaks in an ethereal veil.  Sawdust drifted lazily on the breeze as Silas Jeremiah Blackwood wrestled a stubborn log onto the waiting flatbed truck. His calloused hands, scarred and knotted from years of battling nature's giants, gripped the winch cable with unwavering strength.

Silas squinted through the early morning light filtering down through the ancient canopy. The forest whispered secrets around him, its symphony composed of rustling leaves, chirping birds, and the occasional guttural cry of a raven.  He knew these woods like the back of his hand â€“ every twist in the trail, every hidden glade, every whispering stream. This was his domain, a world of towering trees and earthy scents, where he felt most at peace.

But today, a knot of unease tightened in Silas's gut. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. The silence seemed too heavy, punctuated only by the rhythmic whine of his chainsaw. Even the birdsong was strangely subdued.  As he finished securing the log and climbed down from the truck bed, a shiver ran down his spine. Something was amiss in this familiar sanctuary.
