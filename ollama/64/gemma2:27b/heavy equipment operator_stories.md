The frigid Alaskan air stung Jasper "Jazz" McKinley's cheeks as he wrestled the massive Caterpillar excavator into position. The Aurora Borealis shimmered overhead, painting the snow-covered expanse in ethereal green and violet hues. Jazz barely noticed. His focus was laser sharp on the task at hand: clearing a path for the new pipeline that would snake its way across the unforgiving tundra.

He gripped the controls with calloused hands, years of operating heavy machinery etched into the lines on his face. The engine roared to life, a mechanical beast awakened from its slumber. Jazz eased the excavator forward, its treads churning through the snow, leaving deep gouges in its wake.
