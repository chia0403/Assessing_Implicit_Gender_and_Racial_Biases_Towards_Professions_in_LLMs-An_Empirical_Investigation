The polished marble floor reflected the opulent chandeliers above like a galaxy trapped beneath glass.  Evelyn Hawthorne smoothed her starched uniform, a tiny frown creasing her brow as she surveyed the grand lobby. A symphony of clinking champagne flutes and hushed conversations mingled with the lilting strains of a piano concerto drifting from the salon. It was the usual Friday night ballet at The Grand Blackwood Hotel: wealthy patrons swirling in silk gowns and tailored suits, their laughter echoing off the ornate gilded walls.

Evelyn, however, found little pleasure in the glittering facade. Ten years as chief concierge had taught her that behind every extravagant smile and perfectly coiffed hair hid a tapestry of secrets, desires, and sometimes, desperation. Tonight, she felt it keenly – an undercurrent of tension humming beneath the surface of this polished world.

Her gut churned with unease as she noticed a lone figure seated in a shadowed alcove, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. He hadn't spoken since arriving hours ago, simply sipping his whiskey and watching the crowd with unnervingly sharp eyes. There was something about him that pricked at Evelyn's intuition – a dangerous aura veiled beneath an air of casual indifference.
