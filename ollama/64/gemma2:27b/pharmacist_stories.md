Rain lashed against the pharmacy windows, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an abstract smear of red and green. Eloise Cartwright sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she straightened a row of cough syrup bottles. The rhythmic drumming on the glass was punctuated by the occasional distant clap of thunder, adding to the dreary atmosphere that had settled over Ashwood since morning.

It was Tuesday, which meant double-duty for Eloise. The senior pharmacist was out sick with a nasty flu – ironic considering their profession – leaving Eloise to handle both the prescription counter and the backroom inventory. She didn't mind the extra work, but the relentless drizzle and the near-empty pharmacy were starting to get to her.

Eloise glanced at the clock. 5:42 pm. Only another eighteen minutes until closing time. Just enough time to finish restocking the pain relievers and maybe catch a glimpse of the sunset – if it wasn't obscured by clouds, that is. As she reached for a box of ibuprofen, the bell above the door chimed, startling her.

A figure, shrouded in a dark raincoat, stood hesitantly in the doorway, their face obscured by the hood. Eloise straightened, plastering on her best customer service smile. "Good evening! How can I help you?" she asked, hoping the stranger wasn't about to unleash a torrent of last-minute prescription requests.
