Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Seven" bar sign across the street. Inside his cramped office, Bartholomew Quill adjusted his fedora, pushing back a stray lock of silver hair that always seemed to want to rebel against the gel. The air hung heavy with cigarette smoke and the faint scent of stale coffee – a familiar comfort in this dingy corner of Chicago’s South Side.

Bartholomew, or Bart as everyone called him, was known for two things: his uncanny ability to solve cases most cops wouldn't touch, and his unwavering habit of wearing a fedora indoors. He surveyed the photograph on his desk – a young woman with laughing eyes and auburn hair framing a delicate face. Her name was Clara Beaumont, and she'd vanished without a trace three days ago. Her brother, Edward, sat nervously opposite him, fidgeting with his tie.

"Mr. Quill," he said, his voice thin and strained, "Are you sure you can find her? Everyone else seems to think…" He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.


Bart met his gaze with a steady, almost unnerving calm. 
“Don’t worry, son,” he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of chain-smoking and cheap whiskey. "Clara Beaumont's case is just another puzzle waiting to be solved. And Bart Quill doesn't leave puzzles unsolved." He tapped the photograph with a calloused finger.

"Now," he said, leaning forward, his eyes narrowing. "Tell me everything."
