Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Archibald Finnegan's tailoring shop, blurring the gaslights into shimmering orbs. A chill wind whistled through the cracks in the aging doorframe, carrying with it the scent of damp cobblestones and chimney smoke. Inside, the air hung heavy with the comforting aroma of beeswax and wool. 

Archibald himself, a man whose stooped frame seemed to mirror the crooked angles of his shop, hunched over a length of crimson velvet. His nimble fingers, gnarled but surprisingly strong, worked tirelessly, guiding the needle through the thick fabric. He was meticulously crafting a waistcoat for Lord Beaumont, a notoriously difficult client who demanded perfection in every stitch. 


The rhythmic click-clack of Archibald's shears against the wooden counter punctuated the silence, a steady counterpoint to the symphony of rain outside. But despite the comforting familiarity of his work, Archibald couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease. Something felt amiss in the swirling storm outside, a prickle of foreboding that tugged at the edges of his mind.
