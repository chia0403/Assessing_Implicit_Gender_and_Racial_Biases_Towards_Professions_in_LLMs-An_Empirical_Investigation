Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond. Amelia Rose Santiago gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather. Sirens shrieked, piercing the storm's chaotic symphony, urging her onward through the flooded streets. Tonight, every streetlight seemed to flicker with a ghostly pulse, casting long, distorted shadows that danced along the slick asphalt. 

The call had come in minutes ago: multiple victims, possible stabbing at a downtown nightclub. Adrenaline surged through Amelia's veins, a familiar cocktail of fear and focus. She’d seen enough violence in her five years as an EMT to know this wouldn’t be pretty.

“ETA two minutes,” she barked into the radio, her voice tight with urgency. Her partner, Marco, a stoic giant with hands as steady as a surgeon’s, checked the medical supplies one last time. His face was impassive, but Amelia knew he felt it too – that gnawing anticipation, the chilling certainty that tonight, they were walking into something dark.

The ambulance screeched to a halt in front of the nightclub, its neon sign now a sickly yellow smear through the downpour. The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid scent of fear. Amelia knew then that this wouldn’t be just another night on the job. This was something different – something raw and unsettling.
