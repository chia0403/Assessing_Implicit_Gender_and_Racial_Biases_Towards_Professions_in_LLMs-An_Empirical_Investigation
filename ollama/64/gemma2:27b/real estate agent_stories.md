Rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the already fading twilight into an impressionistic smear of grey and orange. Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix drummed her manicured nails on the steering wheel, frustration simmering beneath her carefully composed facade. 

She was late. Again. Not for a showing – those were meticulously timed, down to the minute. But for dinner with Mama, who had the uncanny ability to detect even the slightest hint of tardiness in Esme's normally punctual life. The quaint Italian bistro on Oak Street, Mama's favorite haunt, loomed through the rain-streaked glass.  

Esme sighed. Today hadn’t gone as planned. The charming Victorian on Hawthorne had fallen through – a last-minute inspection revealing some unexpected structural issues.  And then there was the frustratingly enigmatic Mr. Blackwood, who seemed intent on dragging his feet over the sale of his historic mansion on Magnolia Avenue, despite Esme's best efforts to sweeten the deal.

Tonight, she just wanted Mama's comforting lasagna and a glass of their favorite Chianti – an escape from the relentless pressure cooker of the Charleston real estate market.
