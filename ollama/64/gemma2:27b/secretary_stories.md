The aroma of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air of the cramped office like cheap perfume. Eleanor Ainsworth tapped her manicured nails impatiently against the worn Formica desk, the rhythmic click-clacking competing with the incessant drone of the ancient air conditioner wheezing its last breaths. The flickering fluorescent lights cast a sickly yellow glow across stacks of dusty files and overflowing inboxes, mirroring the dull ache throbbing behind Eleanor's temples. 

It was Tuesday, which meant Mr. Hawthorne, her notoriously demanding boss, would be back from his weekend golfing escapades with renewed vigour for tormenting his overworked staff. Today's agenda: deciphering his scrawled notes on a potential merger, a task that promised to unravel Eleanor's already frayed nerves.  The phone shrilled, jolting her from her anxious reverie. With a sigh, she picked up the receiver, bracing herself for another onslaught of unreasonable demands.
