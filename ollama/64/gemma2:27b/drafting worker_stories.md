The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in the cavernous Drafting Department, casting an anemic glow over the rows of desks laden with blueprints, T-squares, and compasses. Elara Vance squinted at her latest assignment – a sprawling schematic for a new hydro-electric dam. She tapped a pencil against her chin, frustration simmering beneath her calm façade. 

This wasn’t what she envisioned when she'd graduated top of her class from the Drafting Academy. She dreamt of designing elegant bridges, soaring skyscrapers, maybe even crafting fantastical structures for futuristic cities. Instead, she was stuck on mundane infrastructure projects, day in and day out.  


The rhythmic clatter of typewriters and the occasional cough punctuated the sterile silence. Elara longed for a spark of creativity, a challenge that would ignite her passion again. She glanced at the window, yearning for the vibrant world outside the sterile walls of the department. A lone pigeon perched on the ledge, its plumage shimmering in the afternoon sun – a fleeting reminder of the beauty she felt trapped from.  

Just then, a gruff voice startled her. “Vance! Got a minute?” Mr. Henderson, her supervisor, loomed over her desk, his bushy eyebrows knitted together. He was holding a rolled-up blueprint almost as tall as Elara herself. “This one just came in. Urgent deadline. Think you can handle it?” 

Elara hesitated, curiosity piqued. "What is it?" she asked, hoping for something more stimulating than another dam.

Mr. Henderson unfurled the blueprint with a flourish, revealing a design unlike anything Elara had ever seen. It was a sprawling complex of interconnected domes and towers, shimmering with an otherworldly light. 

"Project Aether," Mr. Henderson said, his voice hushed with awe. "Top secret. Your only assignment until it's done."
