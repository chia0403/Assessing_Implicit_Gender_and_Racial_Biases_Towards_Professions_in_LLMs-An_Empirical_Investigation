Rain lashed against the warped glass of The Rusty Lantern, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already grimy facade. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, sawdust, and regret. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan, his face etched with the lines of countless late nights and whispered confessions, polished a chipped pint glass with practiced ease. 

The Lantern was his domain, a dimly lit sanctuary for the lost souls of Oakhaven - miners drowning their sorrows after a hard shift, lonely housewives seeking fleeting moments of escape, and drifters who seemed to materialize out of the swirling mist that perpetually clung to the town.  Bart knew them all by name, their stories etched into the grain of the bartop just as surely as his own were etched onto his weathered face. Tonight, though, the usual murmur of conversation was replaced by an unnerving silence. Even the flickering gas lamps seemed to cast longer shadows than usual, as if anticipating something sinister.
