The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of Bargain Bin Bonanza.  Amelia Thistlewick sighed, her fingers drumming a restless tattoo on the chipped laminate countertop. A lone fly buzzed lazily against the windowpane, mirroring Amelia's own sense of stagnation. 

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the graveyard shift of retail hell. The usual trickle of pensioners and bargain hunters had dwindled to nothing, leaving Amelia alone with the echoing silence and the faint scent of stale popcorn from the microwave in the break room.  She idly flicked through the dog-eared pages of "Romance Weekly," her eyes skimming over titles like "Billionaire Sheikh's Secret Baby" and "Rancher's Redemption," stories that seemed worlds away from her own humdrum existence.


Amelia longed for something more, a life less ordinary than scanning discount toothpaste and arguing with customers over expired coupons.  But for now, she was stuck behind the register, dreaming of escape routes paved with adventure and romance â€“ anything but another day in Bargain Bin Bonanza.
