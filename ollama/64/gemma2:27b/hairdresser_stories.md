The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and burnt hair, a peculiar perfume unique to Marcella Rose's salon, "Marcella's Mane Attractions."  Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpane onto a mosaic of chipped ceramic tiles, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, shimmering stars. Outside, the cacophony of New Orleans rumbled and pulsed: a symphony of horns honking, jazz spilling from doorways, and the raucous laughter of tourists mingling with the guttural cries of street vendors. But within Marcella's domain, a sanctuary of peace reigned.  

Marcella herself, her dark curls piled high in a gravity-defying tower, meticulously snipped at a client's unruly mane. Her nimble fingers moved with the precision of a surgeon, transforming tangled chaos into sleek elegance. Despite the sweltering heat outside, Marcella was clad in her usual uniform: a crisp white smock adorned with an embroidered phoenix rising from ashes – a symbol of transformation and renewal, much like the magic she wove with scissors and combs.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled over Marcella as a new client entered the salon, his silhouette stark against the midday sun. He wore a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow over his face, concealing his features in an intriguing veil of mystery. As he approached the counter, his eyes, a piercing blue like glacial ice, met hers with unsettling intensity.

“Marcella Rose?” His voice was deep and gravelly, tinged with an unfamiliar accent. "I've come for a very specific… transformation."
