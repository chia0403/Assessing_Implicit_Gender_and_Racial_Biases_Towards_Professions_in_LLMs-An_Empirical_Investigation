Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the bustling cityscape beyond into an Impressionist painting. Amelia Rosalind Finch, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, sighed as she surveyed the empty waiting room. A typical Tuesday afternoon lull, she supposed.  She glanced at the clock – 3:15 p.m. – and wondered if maybe she should have scheduled that grocery delivery for later.

Amelia was no stranger to slow days. As a registered dietitian in a competitive market like Chicago, building a clientele wasn't easy. Especially when your niche was helping people with food intolerances and allergies navigate the minefield of modern eating. 

She stood, stretching her stiff muscles from hours hunched over meal plans. The scent of cinnamon and ginger drifted from the small kitchenette where she kept a stash of herbal teas. Maybe a cup of chamomile would calm her nerves before her next appointment. A ping from her phone jolted her back to reality. An email notification: "Urgent Appointment Request - Penelope Beaumont."

Amelia's heart skipped a beat. Penelope Beaumont, Chicago's most celebrated fashion designer, notorious for her impeccable style and even more impeccable demands. What could bring someone like Penelope Beaumont to "Nourish & Thrive"?
