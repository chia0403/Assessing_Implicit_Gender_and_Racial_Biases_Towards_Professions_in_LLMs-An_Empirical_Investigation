Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop a miniature hammer blow against Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's mounting anxiety. The power flickered ominously, casting dancing shadows across the cluttered examination room. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the skeletal branches of the old oak tree into a frenzy.

Amy, her auburn hair escaping its braid and falling in damp strands around her face, stared at the shivering creature huddled on the table. A young Border Collie, barely more than a pup, whimpered softly, his eyes wide with fear. His leg was twisted at an unnatural angle, a sickening crunch echoing in Amy's memory from when she first examined him. He had been found cowering by the side of the road, likely hit by a careless driver who hadn't bothered to stop.

The clinic, nestled on the edge of the remote Scottish village of Glenfinnan, was her sanctuary, a place where she poured her heart and soul into mending broken bodies, both animal and human. But tonight, the storm mirrored the turmoil within her. This wasn't just another injured dog. It was a reminder of why she'd left the bustling city behind, trading sterile operating rooms for muddy boots and the constant companionship of barking dogs and mewing cats. 

She needed to save this pup, not just for him, but for herself. For the flicker of hope that still burned within her, a hope threatened by the rising tide of loneliness and the gnawing feeling that she was running out of time.
