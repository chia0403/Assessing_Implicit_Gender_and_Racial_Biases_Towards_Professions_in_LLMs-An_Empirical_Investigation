The scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud for Eleanor Beatrice Finch, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Public Library.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing above the polished oak tables where students hunched over textbooks and elderly patrons sipped tea from delicate china cups. The library, with its vaulted ceilings and towering shelves groaning under the weight of centuries-old tomes, was Eleanor's sanctuary. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of turning pages, spoke a language she understood intimately.

But today, a discordant note disrupted the familiar symphony. A frantic rapping on the heavy oak doors jolted her from her contemplation of a particularly intriguing first edition of "The Odyssey."  A shiver ran down her spine. Visitors rarely arrived at this hour, and the insistent knocking held an urgency that was unsettling.
