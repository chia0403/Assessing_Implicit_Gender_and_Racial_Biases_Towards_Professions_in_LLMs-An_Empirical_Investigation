The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of fear that clung to every patient who walked through Dr. Theodore Alistair Finch's door.  His practice, nestled on a forgotten side street in the heart of old London, was as unassuming as its owner: chipped paint, faded brass lettering above the window proclaiming "Dr. Finch - Dentist," and a perpetually flickering gas lamp casting long shadows across the worn waiting room chairs. 

Theodore himself, despite his name suggesting an air of scholarly refinement, possessed a rumpled appearance â€“ perpetually stained lab coat, unruly grey hair escaping his tie, and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose.  His patients rarely saw him smile; his expression was usually one of intense concentration, furrowed brow, and a twitching left eyelid that betrayed his simmering anxiety.

Today, however, was different. Theodore sat ramrod straight in his worn leather chair, staring out the window at the fog rolling in off the Thames. He wasn't waiting for a patient; he was awaiting a visitor, one who held the key to unlocking a secret that had haunted him for years. A secret buried deep beneath the cobblestones of London, hidden within the echoing chambers of his own heart.
