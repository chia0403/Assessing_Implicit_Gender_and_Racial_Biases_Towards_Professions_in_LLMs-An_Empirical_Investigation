The air in "Nails by Nina" hummed with the low buzz of electric files and the sweet, chemical tang of acetone. Nina Petrova, her fingers stained coral from a recent acrylic set, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye. The intricate floral design on Mrs. Goldberg's nails was impeccable, each petal delicately rendered in shimmering gold gel polish.

Nina sighed contentedly. There was something deeply satisfying about transforming dull, lifeless nails into tiny canvases of beauty. In this bustling Brooklyn salon, nestled between a bodega and a halal butcher shop, Nina found her sanctuary. She wasn't just polishing nails; she was polishing lives, one intricate design at a time. 

But today, the usual tranquility was disrupted by an unexpected arrival. The bell above the door jangled sharply, and a figure shrouded in shadows stepped inside.  Nina froze, the electric file buzzing ominously in her hand. This wasn't one of her regulars. Something about the visitor's slouched posture and the way their face remained hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat set Nina on edge.
