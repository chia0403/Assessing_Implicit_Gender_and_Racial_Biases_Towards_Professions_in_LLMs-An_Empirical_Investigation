The midday sun beat down on the quarry, turning the already dust-choked air thick and hazy. Silas Blackwood wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel was punctuated by grunts and curses as he and the other stone cutters wrestled a stubborn block of granite into submission. 

Silas had been carving stone since he was a boy, learning the trade from his father before him. He could read the grain of the rock like a book, understanding its hidden strengths and weaknesses. But this particular block seemed determined to resist his will. It fought back with every blow, sending tremors through his arms and shoulders. 

He paused, taking a deep breath and surveying the uneven surface he had carved so far. The intended shape, a graceful archway for the new cathedral in town, felt impossibly distant. Silas sighed, wondering if perhaps this was a task meant for someone with younger, stronger hands.
