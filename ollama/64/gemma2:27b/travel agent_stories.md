Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Wanderlust Travel" sign hanging precariously above Eleanor Cartwright's office door. The relentless drumming mirrored the anxiety thrumming in Eleanor's chest. Her fingers danced nervously over the worn leather of her desk, tracing the grooves etched by years of travel brochures and frantic itinerary planning.

Eleanor Cartwright wasn't just any travel agent; she was a weaver of dreams, a cartographer of experiences. For ten years, she had guided clients through sun-drenched beaches, bustling cityscapes, and ancient ruins, crafting personalized journeys that ignited their wanderlust. But today, her own spirit felt tethered, anchored by a growing sense of dread. A phone call earlier that morning had delivered news that threatened to unravel everything: Wanderlust Travel, her beloved haven of adventure, was facing imminent closure unless she could secure a major contract within the next two weeks.
