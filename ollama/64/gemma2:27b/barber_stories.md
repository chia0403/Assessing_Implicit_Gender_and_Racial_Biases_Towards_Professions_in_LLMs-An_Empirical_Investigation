The rhythmic snip-snip of shears against hair was Elias Bartholomew's symphony. His tiny barbershop, nestled between a fishmonger reeking of brine and a bakery perpetually wafting cinnamon and sugar, was his stage. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature ballerinas. Outside, cobblestones slick with morning rain reflected the grey sky above; but inside, Elias' world was warm and inviting. The scent of bay rum and talcum powder mingled with the faint aroma of lavender water, creating a comforting cocoon against the damp chill of the London street. Today, however, Elias felt an unsettling dissonance. His usually steady hand trembled as he trimmed Mr. Higgins' mutton chops. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its crisp cream envelope bearing a seal he hadn't seen in years - the crest of his estranged father's estate.
