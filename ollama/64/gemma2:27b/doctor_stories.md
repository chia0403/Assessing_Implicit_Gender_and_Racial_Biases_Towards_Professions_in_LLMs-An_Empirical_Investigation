Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Blackwood's clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the insistent buzzing of the lone fluorescent light overhead. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and something else, something indefinable that Elias had come to associate with desperation. His waiting room was sparsely furnished - a couple of mismatched chairs, a table stacked high with outdated medical journals - mirroring the bare bones existence of the clinic itself, nestled in the heart of Havenwood's forgotten industrial district. 

Elias sighed, rubbing his weary eyes. He hadn't slept properly in days.  The relentless influx of patients, each bearing the weight of poverty and ill health, was taking its toll. He knew he couldn't afford to falter. This clinic, a ramshackle haven against the storm of Havenwood's neglected underbelly, depended on him. 

A sudden cough broke through the silence, followed by the tentative creak of the door. Elias looked up, his gaze meeting the downcast eyes of a young woman clutching a tattered shawl around her shoulders.  Her face was pale and drawn, etched with worry lines that belied her years.
