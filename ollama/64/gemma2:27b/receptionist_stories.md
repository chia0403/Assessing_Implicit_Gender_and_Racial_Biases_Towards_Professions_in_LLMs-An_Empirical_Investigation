Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Blackwood Clinic, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a smudged smear of red.  Emilia Thorne, her fiery hair pulled back in a tight bun, sighed as another gust rattled the ancient building. Thursdays were always slow, but today's deluge seemed to have chased away even the most dedicated hypochondriacs. She idly tapped a crimson talon nail against the worn mahogany desk, the rhythmic click echoing through the cavernous waiting room.

The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral - probably Dr. Blackwood's lavender hand soap. Emilia surveyed her domain: faded velvet chairs huddled in mismatched groups, a dusty stack of outdated magazines precariously balanced on a side table, and a lone potted fern struggling valiantly against the gloom.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, startling her from her reverie. A figure materialized through the swirling rain, water cascading off their dark coat in shimmering sheets. Emilia straightened, plastering on her most welcoming smile, and prepared for the inevitable: a sniffle, a cough, or perhaps just someone seeking refuge from the storm.
