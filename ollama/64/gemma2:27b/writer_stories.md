Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Elara Blackwood's attic apartment, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her fingers tapping on the keyboard. The old typewriter sat neglected in the corner, its once-gleaming keys now dulled with disuse. Elara preferred the sterile click of her laptop, the instant gratification of seeing words appear on the screen instead of waiting for the satisfying thunk of inked ribbon on paper.

But tonight, the familiar comfort of technology couldn't soothe her gnawing anxiety. Her deadline loomed, a menacing shadow cast by the flickering streetlight filtering through the grime-coated window.  The blank document on her screen mocked her, a yawning abyss threatening to swallow her whole. Elara Blackwood, once celebrated for her darkly lyrical prose and chilling tales of the macabre, was now staring down the barrel of writer's block.

She lived in a world perpetually shrouded in mist, a crumbling Victorian town nestled amongst the brooding peaks of the Cairngorms. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, whispering secrets only the ancient stones could decipher. It was a place that bred stories, both real and imagined, but tonight, the wellspring of Elara's creativity seemed to have run dry.
