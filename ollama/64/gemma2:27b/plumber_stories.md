Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-colored water. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and copper, punctuated by the occasional hiss of escaping steam from a temperamental radiator Bart was wrestling with. His calloused hands, stained the colour of aged brass, tightened on the wrench as he wrestled the stubborn valve into submission.

Outside, the neon sign advertising "Higgins' Plumbing: No Job Too Big or Too Leaky" flickered weakly against the tempestuous backdrop. The storm had been raging for hours, turning the narrow cobblestone streets of Waterdown into churning rivers. Bart knew his phone wouldn't stop ringing anytime soon. Burst pipes were a plumber's best friend in weather like this. 


He sighed, wiping a smear of grease from his forehead with the back of his hand. He wasn't complaining, not really. Work was work, and Waterdown, despite its name, was notoriously prone to plumbing emergencies. But tonight, Bart longed for something besides the clang of pipes and the gurgle of overflowing sinks. Tonight, he yearned for a warm fire, a steaming mug of tea, and perhaps the company of someone who appreciated his unique brand of gruff charm.

Little did he know, a phone call was about to arrive that would upend his predictable routine and plunge him into a mystery far more intriguing than any leaky faucet.
