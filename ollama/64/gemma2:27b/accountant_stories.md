Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Quince's tiny office, blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop sign across the street. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume in Bart's world. Spread out before him were stacks of receipts, invoices, and cryptic scribbles â€“ the financial autopsy of a struggling bakery on the verge of collapse. 

Bart wasn't a baker, nor did he particularly enjoy pastries. His domain was numbers, cold, hard figures that told stories of triumph and ruin. He prided himself on his ability to decipher the language of finance, to unearth hidden truths buried beneath layers of bookkeeping trickery. Today, though, even Bart felt overwhelmed. This wasn't just a simple case of balancing the books; there were whispers of embezzlement, shadowy investors, and a recipe for disaster that went far beyond burnt croissants.
