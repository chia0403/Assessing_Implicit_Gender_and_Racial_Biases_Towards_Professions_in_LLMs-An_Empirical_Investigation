The rusted bell above the door jangled a discordant welcome as Eloise "Ellie" Finch pushed her way inside the ramshackle shelter.  A cacophony of barks, meows, and chirps greeted her, each sound a plea for attention, a yearning for warmth and a home. Ellie inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of disinfectant and wet dog fur settling around her like a comforting blanket. This was her sanctuary, a haven for creatures abandoned, lost, or simply forgotten. 

Sunbeams slanted through dusty windows, illuminating rows of kennels where scruffy mutts lay sprawled on blankets, their tails thumping hopefully against the concrete floor. In the far corner, a chorus of meows rose from stacked cages, inhabited by sleek black cats and fluffy calico kittens batting at dangling toys. Ellie smiled, her heart already brimming with the quiet joy she always felt within these walls. Today was feeding day, and she couldn't wait to dole out kibble and cuddles in equal measure. 

But as Ellie rounded the corner into the back room, a jarring sound stopped her in her tracks: a frantic scratching coming from one of the rarely used isolation cages. Her breath caught in her throat. Something wasn't right.
