Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Beaumont's office, blurring the already hazy cityscape beyond. The rhythmic drumming felt oddly comforting, a steady counterpoint to the storm brewing inside her own mind. A new patient was scheduled for 3:00 pm sharp, and despite years of experience, Amelia couldn't shake off a feeling of unease. This wasn't just any client; it was someone she knew, someone whose life had intersected with hers in a way she hadn't anticipated.

Amelia glanced at the file on her desk: "Elias Thorne," it read in bold font. The name sent a shiver down her spine. Elias was the younger brother of her childhood best friend, Clara. A friendship that, after a devastating falling out years ago, Amelia had buried deep within her own heart's vault. 

The clock ticked ominously towards 3:00 pm.  Amelia took a deep breath, attempting to quell the whirlwind of emotions swirling within her. This was professional, she reminded herself. Elias Thorne was merely another client seeking help, and her duty as a counselor was to provide it, regardless of past connections.


But as the rain intensified, Amelia couldn't help but wonder what secrets Elias held, what pain he carried, and whether their shared history would become an obstacle or an unexpected bridge towards healing.
