The November wind clawed at Amelia "Ace" Cartwright's face as she stared across the frost-covered practice field. The bleachers, usually brimming with boisterous parents and impatient siblings, sat desolate under a steely sky.  

Even the football team wasn’t immune to the biting chill, their breath puffing out in white clouds as they huddled around Coach Davis, who was barking plays louder than usual, as if trying to drown out the wind's mournful howl. Ace, wrapped tight in her signature red varsity jacket and clutching a thermos of steaming coffee, watched them with a flicker of concern.  

This wasn’t their usual fiery energy. The Wildcats were champions for two years running, but something felt off. A gnawing doubt settled in Ace’s gut. Was it the pressure of defending their title? Or was there something deeper, a simmering tension she couldn't quite grasp? Whatever it was, Ace knew this season wouldn't be won on touchdowns and tackles alone. It would take grit, heart, and maybe even a little magic.
