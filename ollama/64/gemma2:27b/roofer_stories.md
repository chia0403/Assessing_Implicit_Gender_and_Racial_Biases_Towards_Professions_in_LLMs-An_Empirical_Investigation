The rusted ladder groaned under Elias Thorne's weight, each step sending a tremor up his calloused arms. The midday sun beat down on the asphalt shingles below, radiating heat that shimmered in waves off the pavement. Above him, the skeletal frame of Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s Victorian mansion stretched towards the cloudless sky, its gables and dormers like crooked teeth against the vibrant blue. Elias adjusted the heavy roll of roofing felt on his shoulder, grimacing as it dug into the ache already blossoming in his upper back. 

This wasn't his favorite job, but Mrs. Henderson had promised a hefty bonus if he could get the roof patched before the impending thunderstorm. Thunderstorms meant leaks, and leaks meant Elias losing sleep over frantic phone calls from panicked homeowners. So, he climbed, step by grunting step, the smell of hot tar and dust filling his nostrils. 

As he neared the apex, a flash of movement caught his eye. A crow perched on the chimney, its obsidian eyes fixed intently on him. Elias paused, meeting its gaze for a moment before shaking his head and pushing onward. He didn't have time for superstition today.
