Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" nightclub sign across the street. Amelia Blackwood, her trench coat dripping onto the threadbare carpet of her cramped apartment, sighed. It was going to be another night spent chasing leads that fizzled out like damp fireworks.

Amelia wasn't your typical reporter. Sure, she had a nose for a story and a hunger for truth, but her beat wasn't politics or celebrity scandals. She delved into the shadowy underbelly of Neo-Shanghai, unearthing tales of forgotten alleyway gods, whispers of ancient technology buried beneath the city's gleaming skyscrapers, and the ever-present struggle between humans and augmented beings vying for power in a world constantly on the brink of change.


Tonight, though, her lead was cold. A rumour about a missing scientist who'd been working on something called "Project Chimera" had yielded nothing but dead ends and suspicious glances from shady informants. Amelia grabbed a half-empty bottle of jasmine tea, its warmth barely penetrating the chill in her bones, and stared out at the rain-soaked cityscape. The neon lights reflected off the slick pavement, painting a kaleidoscope of colours that hid more darkness than light.

A buzz on her wrist communicator broke her contemplation. It was a message from an anonymous source, simply stating: "Meet me at the Jade Serpent, midnight. Bring your questions."


Amelia's heart quickened. Was this finally the break she needed? She grabbed her battered fedora, pulled it low over her eyes, and stepped out into the rain-swept night. The city was calling, its whispers promising danger and intrigue in equal measure. Amelia Blackwood wouldn't hesitate to answer.
