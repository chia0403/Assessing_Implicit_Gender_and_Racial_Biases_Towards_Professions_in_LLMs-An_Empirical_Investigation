The chandelier cast elongated, shimmering shadows across the grand marble lobby of The Grand Blackwood Hotel. Dust motes danced in the warm glow, barely visible against the opulent crimson velvet curtains framing the arched windows. Outside, rain hammered against the glass, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolour.  A symphony of coughs and murmurs echoed from the crowded reception area, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of suitcases being dragged across the polished floor.

Bartholomew "Bart" Quince stood rigidly at attention by the double doors, his navy bellhop uniform pristine despite the humidity. Sweat prickled under his starched collar as he scanned the faces entering the lobby: a harried businessman clutching a briefcase, a giggling family with overflowing suitcases, a solitary woman cloaked in shadows, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Bart knew better than to judge. The Grand Blackwood housed every type imaginable, from blushing honeymooners to jaded socialites, each with their own secrets hidden behind carefully constructed facades. 

Tonight, however, Bart felt an unfamiliar prickle of anticipation. He hadn't seen her in months, but he knew she was coming. A woman with eyes like amethyst and a laugh that could melt glaciers. His heart hammered against his ribs as the clock ticked towards seven, the hour they had agreed upon.
