Rain lashed against the shop windows, mimicking the frantic drumming in Amelia Rosalind Finch's chest. The bell above the door chimed mournfully as another gust of wind threatened to rip it from its moorings.  Amelia glanced at the clock - 4:57 PM. Closing time was in three minutes, and she was still elbow-deep in a mountain of crimson roses destined for a Valentine's Day extravaganza.

But today, the storm had chased everyone away except for a lone, dripping figure huddled beneath the awning. Amelia sighed, wiping her damp forehead with the back of her hand.  It looked like she wouldn't be joining her friends for their pre-Valentine's Day cocktail hour after all.
