The aroma of roasted garlic and rosemary wafted through the open kitchen window, an unwelcome intrusion into Amelia Blackwood's meticulously organized world. Amelia, a registered dietician with a penchant for precise portion sizes and color-coded meal plans, sighed as she surveyed the chaos unfolding in her neighbor's backyard. Mr. Henderson, bless his soul, was attempting to grill a rack of lamb, but judging by the plume of black smoke rising skyward, he was having some difficulty. 

Amelia lived in a charming Victorian terrace house on a quiet street lined with blooming lilac bushes and meticulously manicured lawns. It was a neighborhood where everyone knew their neighbors' names and politely averted their eyes when someone forgot to take out the recycling bin. Amelia, despite her friendly demeanor, preferred solitude, finding solace in the rhythm of chopping vegetables, blending smoothies, and crafting balanced meals that nourished both body and soul.

Today, however, peace seemed elusive. The tantalizing scent of Mr. Henderson's culinary disaster was a constant reminder that life rarely followed a strict recipe, much like Amelia's carefully planned existence was about to be upended by an unexpected visitor: her estranged sister.
