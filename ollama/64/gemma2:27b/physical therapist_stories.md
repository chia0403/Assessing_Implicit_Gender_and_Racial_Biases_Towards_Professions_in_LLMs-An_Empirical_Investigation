The air in the Salt Lake City rehab center was thick with the scent of disinfectant and strained hope. Sunlight slanted through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. Amelia Nguyen, her dark ponytail escaping its elastic band, adjusted the height of the parallel bars for her next patient. She'd been a physical therapist for five years now, drawn to the profession by the quiet satisfaction of helping people reclaim their bodies.

But lately, something felt off. The usual hum of progress seemed dulled, replaced by a sense of unease that Amelia couldn't quite place. It started subtly: patients complaining of phantom pains, unexplained muscle spasms, and an unsettling sense of disorientation. Then came the nightmares - vivid, disturbing dreams shared by multiple patients, all centered around a shadowy figure lurking in the periphery.


Amelia glanced at her watch. Time for her next session. The door creaked open, revealing a young woman named Lily with a hesitant smile and eyes that seemed older than her years. "Ready to tackle those stairs today?" Amelia asked, trying to inject some cheer into her voice.

Lily nodded slowly, but her gaze drifted towards the far corner of the room, where the shadows deepened. Amelia felt a shiver crawl down her spine.
