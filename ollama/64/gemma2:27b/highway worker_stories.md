The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Cartwright's neck like a branding iron. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy horizon where endless asphalt met a sky bleached white by summer heat. The roar of traffic was a constant thrumming in Eli's ears, punctuated by the sharp shriek of brakes and impatient honks. He wiped his brow with a grimy rag, the scent of hot tar mingling with diesel fumes filling his nostrils. Today, Eli was patching potholes on Highway 17, a ribbon of cracked concrete stretching through the desolate heart of Nevada. The endless expanse of scrubland, dotted with Joshua trees and bleached bones, felt like another world. A place where solitude was a given, and the only company came in the form of rattling trucks and the occasional hawk circling overhead.

Eli squinted at the monstrous pothole gaping before him. It looked more like a small crater, a testament to the relentless pounding Nevada highways endured from summer heat and overloaded semis. He sighed, knowing this patch would be temporary at best. The desert had a way of reclaiming what it lost, swallowing asphalt whole with its unforgiving sun and shifting sands.

Eli grabbed his shovel, the worn wooden handle familiar in his calloused hands.  Heâ€™d been working this stretch of highway for years, a solitary figure battling against the elements and the relentless flow of traffic. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck, a sense of being watched. He looked up, scanning the barren landscape, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual shimmer of heat rising from the asphalt and the distant blur of oncoming vehicles.

Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
