The fluorescent lights hummed an insistent tune above Silas Bartholomew Pendleton III as he pushed his mop across the cold linoleum floor. The air in the Grand Meridian Hotel ballroom was thick with the ghosts of waltzes past – the faint scent of lavender polish, the lingering echo of laughter and clinking champagne glasses. Silas imagined them swirling around him, shimmering specters in their finery, forever frozen in a moment of joy.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space.

It was always quietest after midnight. The last stragglers from the gala had long since departed, leaving behind a trail of scattered confetti and forgotten lipstick stains. Silas preferred it this way – the solitude gave him time to think, to dream of a life beyond mopping floors and emptying trashcans. He longed to be among those dancing figures, not cleaning up after them. Tonight, though, something felt different. A faint chill snaked through the ballroom, raising goosebumps on his arms. The air shimmered, the lavender polish scent intensifying until it was almost cloying.  Silas paused, his mop hovering mid-stroke. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
