Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s teetered precariously on his desk, each form representing another sleepless night spent deciphering deductions and navigating the labyrinthine code of the IRS. Spring was approaching, but for Teddy, it felt like the tax season blizzard would never end.

His office, nestled above a noisy Chinese takeout joint in a forgettable strip mall, wasn't exactly conducive to zen bookkeeping. The greasy smell of fried dumplings often permeated the air, mingling with the scent of stale coffee and desperation that clung to Teddy's worn cardigan like a second skin.
