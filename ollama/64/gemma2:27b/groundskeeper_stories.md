The first rays of dawn kissed the dew-laden roses, their blush deepening to a vibrant crimson as they unfurled towards the sky.  Elias Thorne adjusted his faded straw hat, pushing back a stray lock of greying hair that threatened to fall into his eyes. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, a familiar symphony that had been the soundtrack to Elias's life for the past twenty years. He surveyed his domain - the sprawling gardens of Ashwood Manor â€“ with a critical eye.

A lone oak, ancient and gnarled, stood sentinel at the edge of the rose garden, its branches casting long shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns. Beyond the formal hedges lay a wilder expanse: a rambling woodland path leading to a forgotten grotto veiled in moss and whispering ferns. This was Elias's sanctuary, a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of nature, far from the echoing emptiness of the manor house.
