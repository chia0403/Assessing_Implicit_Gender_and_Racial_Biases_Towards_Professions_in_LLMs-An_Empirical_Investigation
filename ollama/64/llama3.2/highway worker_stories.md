Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun rose over the desert horizon, casting a golden glow over the endless stretch of asphalt, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins stretched his arms and yawned, feeling the familiar ache in his back from another night spent on the job. The highway worker, who had spent years maintaining the crumbling infrastructure that crisscrossed the rural landscape, knew every inch of the Arizona Territory like the back of his hand. He'd watched the sun rise and set on this stretch of road countless times, but today felt different - a sense of restlessness lingered in the air, like the promise of a storm yet to come.

Jack's truck, a beat-up old Peterbilt with a faded "Arizona Department of Transportation" logo emblazoned on the side, sat quietly beside him as he surveyed the morning's tasks: inspecting the potholes on Highway 60, replacing a broken guardrail post near the abandoned mining town of Redemption, and finally, making his way to the remote intersection of Highways 80 and 95, where a mysterious collision had brought the entire stretch of road to a grinding halt.

Little did Jack know that this ordinary day would soon turn into something extraordinary, as he stumbled upon a mysterious message scrawled on the side of the highway, in handwriting that seemed to match the exact shade of rust on an old car's engine block.
