Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. Amidst the tranquil scene, one man stood out - Jaxon Tyler Thompson, a ruggedly handsome landscaper with calloused hands and a weathered face that spoke to years of working outdoors.

Jaxon had spent his entire life in Willow Creek, the youngest son of a family-owned landscaping business that had been around since the 1950s. As a child, he'd spent countless hours sweeping leaves and raking gravel alongside his father and older brother. When his father passed away suddenly five years ago, Jaxon took over the reins, determined to keep the legacy alive.

Jaxon's gut told him something was off about this deal, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. As he gazed out at the neglected gardens, he wondered if he was making a mistake by even considering it...
