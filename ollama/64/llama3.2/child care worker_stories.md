In the nearby town of Oakdale, where the local elementary school was located, 22-year-old Maya Elizabeth Thompson was finishing up her final tasks as the morning shift supervisor at the Sunny Days Child Care Center. She had spent the past four years working with some of the most precious members of society, from toddlers to pre-teens, helping them navigate the ups and downs of childhood.

As she locked the front door and turned off the lights, Maya couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction and exhaustion wash over her. Another day of playing dress-up with dolls, singing silly songs, and mediating squabbles between friends had come to an end. She took a deep breath, grabbed her bag, and headed out into the crisp evening air, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead for her and the children she cared for.

As Maya walked home, she couldn't help but think about the upcoming winter break and all the fun activities she had planned with her own 7-year-old niece, Ava, who was also a regular at Sunny Days.
