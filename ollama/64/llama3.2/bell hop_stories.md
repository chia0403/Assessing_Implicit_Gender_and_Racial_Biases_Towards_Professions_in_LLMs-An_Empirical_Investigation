Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the Pacific Coast Highway cast a gaudy glow over the small coastal town of Beachside, California, as the sun set over the ocean. The sound of seagulls and the distant hum of traffic mingled with the murmur of conversation from the patrons of the local diner. It was a chilly autumn evening in October 1955, and the smell of saltwater and cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air.

In a small, weathered hotel nestled between a used car lot and a souvenir shop, bell hop Reginald "Reg" Thistlewaite polished the last of the day's shine from his prized possession, a 1947 Mercury coupe. Reg had worked at the hotel for three years, and he knew every room, every guest, and every quirk of the old building like the back of his hand. But despite his familiarity with the place, Reg felt a restlessness tonight, a sense that something was about to change.

As he locked up the last of the luggage carts and headed out into the cool evening air, Reg couldn't shake the feeling that he was on the cusp of something big â€“ something that would take him beyond the confines of his small town, beyond the limits of his humble job as a bell hop. But what, or who, that might be, only time would tell.
