Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby desert plants that stretched as far as the eye could see. The air was thick with the scent of sagebrush and the distant hum of bees, a soothing melody that had been a constant companion to rancher Ethan Ryder Wallace since he was a boy.

Ethan, now in his mid-30s, stood tall at 6'2", his broad shoulders and chest a testament to years of hard work and physical labor. His dark hair was messy and unkempt, and his eyes, a deep shade of blue that seemed almost purple in the fading light, were fixed intently on some point beyond the horizon.

He had inherited the Red Rock Ranch from his father, who had died suddenly just six months prior, leaving Ethan to pick up the reins and carry on the family legacy. It was a daunting task, but one that Ethan was determined to see through. The ranch was struggling, with years of drought and economic downturn taking their toll on the land and its people.

As he gazed out at the vast expanse of his beloved ranch, Ethan felt a sense of restlessness wash over him. Something was off, something that had been nagging at him for weeks. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew that he needed to get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took.
