Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Professor Everett Wystan Blackwood stood at the edge of the mist-shrouded lake, his eyes fixed on the weathered wooden dock that stretched out into the darkness like a skeletal finger. The trees surrounding the lake seemed to lean in, their branches tangling together above him like a mourner's veil. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a primordial smell that stirred something deep within Everett.

As he gazed out across the water, the lights of the old university town twinkled like fireflies in the distance, casting a warm glow over the deserted streets. It was late October, and the academic year had just begun, but already the autumnal chill had settled over the campus like a shroud. The students were still in their summer haze, languid and carefree, but Everett knew that the coming weeks would bring a change, a shift from the languor of late summer into the frenzied rhythms of midterms.

Everett's eyes drifted back to the dock, his mind preoccupied with the task at hand. He had spent years researching the strange occurrences on this lake, poring over dusty texts and conducting interviews with locals who claimed to have seen things that couldn't be explained. And now, as he stood there in the fading light, he was convinced that it was all about to come to a head.

The professor's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned to see his colleague, Dr. Sophia Patel, approaching from the direction of the campus buildings. Her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, and her eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief as she smiled at Everett.

"What brings you out here, Everett?" she asked, falling into step beside him on the dock.

Everett hesitated for a moment before answering, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've got a feeling that tonight's going to be different."

Sophia raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. But as they walked in silence across the creaking planks, the darkness seemed to grow thicker around them, like a living thing waiting to pounce.

And then, without warning, the mist around them began to stir, as if something beneath the surface was stirring, watching and waiting...
