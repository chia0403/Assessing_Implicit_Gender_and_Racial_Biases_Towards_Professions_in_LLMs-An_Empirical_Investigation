Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the river, shrouding the streets of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist. It was a typical autumn morning in the small town, where the air was crisp and the smell of wood smoke and damp earth hung heavy over the cobblestone roads.

In the heart of Ravenswood's bustling market square stood "Harrison's Fine Cuts," the local butcher shop owned by Emrys Harrison. A third-generation butcher with a passion for traditional techniques and a deep love for his community, Emrys had spent years perfecting his craft. His shop was a beloved institution in Ravenswood, where locals came to buy their meat and gossip about the latest town news.

As Emrys unlocked the door and stepped out into the misty morning air, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been a week since the strange occurrences began – equipment malfunctioning, strange noises at night, and an unshakeable feeling that something was watching him from the shadows. The townsfolk were on edge, and Emrys was starting to wonder if his own skills as a butcher would be enough to keep his shop – and his customers – safe.

With a deep breath, Emrys pushed open the door to his shop and stepped inside, the warm light of the display cases enveloping him like a hug. It was going to be a long day.
