Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays. The smell of wet pavement and soggy coffee hung heavy in the air as Emily Rose Thompson trudged through the office door, her bright yellow umbrella a pathetic attempt to shield herself from the deluge. As the receptionist for the prestigious law firm of Smith & Associates, Emily had spent the better part of the week fielding phone calls, answering queries, and generally keeping the wheels of the firm's bureaucratic machine well-oiled.

As she shed her coat and boots at the front desk, Emily gazed out the rain-streaked window at the darkening cityscape. The Willamette River snaked its way through the heart of Portland like a shimmering ribbon of silver, its waters reflected in the gleaming skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever.

It was going to be one of those days.

Just as Emily was starting to feel a familiar sense of dread creeping over her, the phone jolted the silence with an insistent ring. Her boss, the formidable Mr. Smith himself, picked up on the first ring. "Emily? Get in here, now."
