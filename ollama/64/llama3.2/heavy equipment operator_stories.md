Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a golden glow over the dusty terrain as 35-year-old Jackson "Hawk" Hawkins climbed into the cab of his trusty Caterpillar D9 bulldozer. Hawk had spent countless hours operating this machine, hauling heavy loads and clearing rough terrain on the Phoenix Mountain Retreat's construction site. As a seasoned heavy equipment operator with years of experience under his belt, he took pride in his work, always ensuring that every load was precisely placed and every trench was perfectly dug.

As the sun dipped lower, Hawk fired up the engine and began to prepare for another long day of digging and hauling dirt on the retreat's sprawling 5,000-acre property. The air was thick with the smell of creosote and mesquite, and the only sounds were the rumble of the engine and the occasional howl of a coyote in the distance. Hawk yawned, feeling the familiar ache in his back and shoulders from years of manual labor, but he knew that come dawn, he'd be ready to tackle whatever challenges the mountain threw his way.

The Phoenix Mountain Retreat was an exclusive eco-resort catering to the wealthy and wellness-obsessed, and its construction had been a massive undertaking. As Hawk began to roll out of his parking spot, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride knowing that his work would be part of creating this luxury oasis in the heart of the desert. Little did he know, however, that tonight would bring more than just routine maintenance â€“ it would bring an event that would change everything.

How's that? I've introduced our main character Hawk (which is actually a nickname), and provided some context about his job, setting, and surroundings.
