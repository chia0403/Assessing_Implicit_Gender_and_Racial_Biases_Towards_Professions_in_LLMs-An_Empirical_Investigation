Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Ava Alexandra Moreno stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air, gazing out at the gray, rain-soaked streets of Seattle. As a forensic psychologist specializing in personality disorders, she had seen her fair share of darkness and desperation. But on days like this, when the fog rolled in off Puget Sound and shrouded the city in a damp, impenetrable veil, she couldn't help but wonder if the world outside was just as twisted and broken as the minds she spent her days studying.

Ava took a deep breath, feeling the chill of the rain seep into her bones. She had an early appointment at the Seattle VA Hospital, where she would be assessing a new patient - a 25-year-old veteran struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and what his records suggested was a nascent narcissistic personality disorder. As she made her way to her car, a worn Toyota Corolla parked in a spot marked " reserved for emergency vehicles," Ava couldn't shake the feeling that this latest case would be different. That something about this young soldier's story - about the horrors he'd witnessed on patrol in Afghanistan, and the long, dark road to recovery he was embarking upon - would somehow unravel the tangled threads of her own past, revealing secrets she thought were forever buried.

Little did Ava know, as she drove into the hospital's parking garage that morning, a storm was brewing not just outside, but within. A storm of its own making, forged from the very darkness and desperation she spent her days trying to heal.
