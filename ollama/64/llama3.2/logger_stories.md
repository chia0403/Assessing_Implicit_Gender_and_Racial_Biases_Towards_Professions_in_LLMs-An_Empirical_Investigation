The mist-shrouded dawn broke over the small town of Raven's Peak, casting a dim, eerie glow over the crumbling Main Street. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, where the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.

But something felt off, a lingering sense of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach like a cold stone. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew that this trip would be different from all the others...
