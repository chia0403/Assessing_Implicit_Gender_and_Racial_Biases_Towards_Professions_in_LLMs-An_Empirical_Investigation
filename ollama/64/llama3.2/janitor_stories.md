Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above flickered and hummed, casting an eerie glow over the drab, beige walls of Ravenswood High School. It was a chilly autumn evening in October 2023, and the halls were eerily quiet as the students had long since headed home for the day.

In a corner office near the main entrance, 25-year-old janitor Julian Edwin Blackwood stood hunched over his worn, manual trash compactor, methodically crushing last night's cafeteria waste into tiny, compact cubes. He was a fixture at Ravenswood, having started as a part-time high school student and worked his way up to full-time custodial duties after graduating in 2018.

Julian's life had always been one of quiet routine â€“ long hours spent sweeping floors, emptying trash cans, and making sure the school's bathrooms were spotless. Despite his dedication to his work, Julian felt like an invisible presence, often overlooked by his colleagues and supervisors alike. As he worked, his mind wandered to the strange occurrences that had started happening around school lately: unexplained noises in the hallways, flickering lights in classrooms, and whispers of a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows.

Little did Julian know, his mundane life as a janitor was about to take an unexpected turn, one that would lead him down a dark path of discovery, danger, and ultimately, transformation.
