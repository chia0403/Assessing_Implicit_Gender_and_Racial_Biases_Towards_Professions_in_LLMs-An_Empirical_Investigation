The misty dawn broke over the rugged town of Ravenshire, casting a golden glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that seemed to lean inwards, as if sharing ancient secrets. Amidst this picturesque backdrop, Eryndor Thorne, a master stoneworker, emerged from his cramped workshop, his eyes already fixed on the day's task.

As he breathed in the damp air, redolent with the scent of wet stone and damp earth, Eryndor felt a sense of purpose wash over him. His fingers, worn and scarred from years of shaping granite and marble, itched to take hold of the rough-hewn block that would soon become his masterpiece.

Ravenshire, nestled in the heart of the Wysteria Mountains, was a place where stone cutters like Eryndor ruled the town's lifeblood. The townspeople relied on their skills to shape the very fabric of their reality – homes, churches, monuments – all crafted from the rich veins of stone that ran through the mountains like veins on a living body.

Eryndor's workshop, tucked away in a narrow alleyway off the bustling Market Square, was a testament to his art. Shelves lined with dusty jars of pigments, bundles of rough-hewn stone, and an assortment of chisels, each one imbued with the history of countless projects past, stood alongside the half-finished masterpieces that seemed to sprout organically from the walls.

With a quiet resolve, Eryndor shouldered his worn leather satchel – containing an assortment of carefully selected stones, each chosen for its unique texture and hue – and set off towards the day's task. Little did he know, this ordinary day would become anything but ordinary, as whispers began to spread through the town about a mysterious figure seeking out the finest stone cutters in Ravenshire...
