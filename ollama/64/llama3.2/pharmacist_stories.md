Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Elliot Thompson-Smythe walked out of his apothecary shop, The Healing Arts. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the smell of wet earth and damp leaves filled the air. Elliot, a bespectacled pharmacist with a kind smile, adjusted his waterproof coat and gazed out at the crowded streets, his eyes scanning for the familiar figure of his partner, Alex Chen.

As he waited for Alex to arrive, Elliot couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The shop's phone had been ringing nonstop all day, each call ending with an urgent message scrawled on a piece of paper: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone." Elliot's curiosity was piqued, but he had tried to brush it off as mere curiosity, attributing the mysterious messages to the mischievous chatter of the city's eccentric crowd.

Little did Elliot know, his quiet life in The Healing Arts was about to take a drastic turn.
