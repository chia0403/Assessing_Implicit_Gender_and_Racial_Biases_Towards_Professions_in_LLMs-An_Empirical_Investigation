Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Emilia "Mia" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment, ready to face another soggy day as a plumber. The faint scent of wet earth and ozone hung in the air, mingling with the hum of traffic from the nearby highway. Mia breathed it in, feeling a sense of comfort and familiarity wash over her.

As she made her way down the stairs, the flickering fluorescent lights above cast eerie shadows on the walls, making the already-gloomy space seem even darker. But Mia was no stranger to the dampness that seemed to seep into every pore of Seattle's rain-soaked infrastructure. She had grown up in this city, and her father, a gruff but lovable plumber himself, had taught her everything he knew.

Mia's own small business, Thompson's Plumbing Co., had been thriving for years, despite the occasional grumble from the city's notoriously finicky bureaucratic system. But as she walked to the shop, her mind was elsewhere â€“ on the mysterious phone call she had received the night before, from an anonymous stranger who claimed to have a job that required "a very specific set of skills."

The words still lingered in Mia's ears like a puzzle waiting to be solved. What kind of plumbing problem could require such secrecy? And what lay at the end of this mysterious job? As she pushed open the door to her shop, a bell above it rang out, and the scent of pipe cleaners and mildew enveloped her once more.
