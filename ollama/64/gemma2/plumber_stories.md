The insistent drip, drip, drip echoed through Silas Finch's skull like a miniature hammer tapping out a rhythm of impending doom. It was 3:17 am, and the source of the relentless percussion was undoubtedly the leaky pipe in Mrs. Peabody's kitchen, a symphony of plumbing despair heâ€™d been reluctantly summoned to silence.  

Silas stood outside the quaint Victorian cottage, its pale yellow paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The streetlamp cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the overgrown lawn, and a lone cat hissed from behind a rose bush, its eyes reflecting the sickly glow of the lamp. 

He checked his toolbox one last time, making sure his trusty wrench, pipe cutter, and plunger were all present and accounted for.  Silas Finch was no hero, just a weary plumber on call in a town where even plumbing emergencies seemed to have an old-fashioned charm about them. He sighed, shouldered his bag, and stepped towards the front door, the drip-drip-drip driving him deeper into the night's embrace.
