The humid Florida air hung heavy with the scent of salt and sunscreen as Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her floral-print blouse. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the breeze rustling through the swaying palms lining Ocean Avenue.  Amelia wasn't built for this kind of heat; she was more accustomed to the crisp autumn winds of her childhood in Maine. But here she was, a month into her new job at Coastal Claims Insurance, trying to make her mark in the sun-soaked world of Miami Beach. 

She sighed, squinting at the crumpled insurance policy clutched in her hand. This particular client, Mr. Ricardo Alvarez, had called in a "total catastrophe" - his prized flamingo collection allegedly decimated by an errant golf ball. Amelia had been to stranger scenes before, but this one promised colorful chaos.  It was going to be another long day on the beach, and Amelia wasn't sure if she was cut out for it.
