The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Arthur's Authentic Cuts," illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden beams. Arthur Bartholomew "Bart" Peabody meticulously honed his straight razor on a leather strop, the rhythmic scraping a familiar melody to his ears. The barbershop, tucked away on a quiet side street in Savannah, Georgia, was his sanctuary â€“ a world of faded photographs, worn leather chairs, and the comforting hum of conversation punctuated by the snip-snip of shears. Outside, the humid July air pulsed with the rhythm of cicadas, but within these walls, time moved at a different pace, dictated by the cadence of Bart's craft.  Today, though, a ripple of unease stirred beneath the surface of the familiar routine. A new face was in the doorway, his eyes veiled behind dark sunglasses and his demeanor shrouded in an air of secrecy that made even the old regulars shift uncomfortably in their seats.
