The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of fresh varnish and the ever-present aroma of Earl Grey tea brewing on the stove. Outside, the sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across Elias Blackwood's workshop, a ramshackle building nestled at the edge of Willow Creek.

Elias, his calloused hands still slick with wood shavings, surveyed his work. A beautifully crafted rocking horse, destined for a little girl named Lily, stood proudly in the center of the room, its paint gleaming like polished amber. He ran a finger over the smooth curve of the neck, a quiet satisfaction warming him from within. 

The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner served as a gentle reminder that time was slipping away. Soon, Willow Creek would be shrouded in darkness, and Elias would retreat to his small cottage behind the workshop, content with the day's work and the quiet hum of the crickets serenading him to sleep. 


This, however, was not just any ordinary evening. A letter, sealed with a wax crest he didn't recognize, lay on his workbench, its presence as jarring as a discordant note in a familiar melody.  He had never received mail before, and an unexpected tremor ran through Elias as he picked it up. He knew, instinctively, that this letter would change everything.
