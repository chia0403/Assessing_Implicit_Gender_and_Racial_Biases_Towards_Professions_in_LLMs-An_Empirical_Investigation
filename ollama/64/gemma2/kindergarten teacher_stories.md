The scent of crayons and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Miss Amelia Rose Thistlewood. Her rainbow-colored classroom buzzed with activity: miniature hands clutching paintbrushes, tiny feet racing across the carpet, and the melodic babble of children discovering their voices. 

Amelia surveyed her kingdom from behind her desk, adorned with a plastic alphabet puzzle and a hand-drawn portrait of a purple unicorn. She smiled, watching as little Ethan tripped over his own shoelaces, giggling at his clumsy fall. This was her sanctuary, a world built on finger painting and impromptu dance parties, where even the most mundane day felt like an adventure. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Ameliaâ€™s spine, replacing the usual warmth she felt surrounded by these vibrant little souls. There was a tension in the air, a palpable shift that whispered of secrets waiting to be unearthed. As if sensing her unease, Ethan looked up, his blue eyes meeting hers with an unsettling intensity.  "Miss Thistlewood," he said, his voice barely a whisper, "something bad is coming."


**Setting:** A brightly decorated kindergarten classroom in a suburban elementary school.
