The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and disinfectant. 

Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, more affectionately known as 'May' by those few who dared to address her outside of official announcements over the PA system, pushed her mop across the linoleum floor of the third-floor hallway in the Grandview Museum. Each swish left a shimmering trail, momentarily banishing the dust bunnies and stray coffee grounds that seemed to multiply overnight. 

May knew this museum like the back of her hand. She'd cleaned its hallowed halls for nearly twenty years, watching generations of visitors marvel at the ancient artifacts and Renaissance masterpieces within these walls.  But tonight, under the dim glow of the emergency lights flickering in the wake of a power outage, it felt different. Eerie. The usually comforting silence was punctuated by an unsettling stillness, broken only by the rhythmic drip-drip of a leaky pipe somewhere in the depths of the building. It was the kind of quiet that made your senses sharper, attuned to every creak and groan of the ancient structure.


May hated working nights.  The loneliness, the shadows stretching like claws across the polished floor, the constant awareness of her own vulnerability. But tonight, she had a strange premonition â€“ a sense that something was amiss, that this quiet wasn't just an absence of sound but a presence in itself.
