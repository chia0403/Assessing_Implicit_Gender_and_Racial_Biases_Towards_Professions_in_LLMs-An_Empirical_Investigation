The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Thorne's head like a chorus of anxious cicadas.  Her small office, tucked away in the corner of Elmwood Elementary School, felt more like a pressure cooker than a place of healing. Outside, the cacophony of recess - squealing children and shrieking laughter - was a distant echo, replaced by the rhythmic tapping of Evelyn's pencil against her notepad. 

She reviewed Amelia's file again, the bright yellow folder bulging with teacher notes, parent emails, and standardized test scores. Six-year-old Amelia, quiet and withdrawn, had suddenly become a shadow of her former self. Her once vibrant drawings now sported blank faces, her stories devoid of the whimsical creatures she used to invent. Something was deeply wrong, but the clues remained elusive, like whispers lost in the wind. 


Evelyn sighed, massaging her temples. This wasn't just another case; it felt personal. Amelia reminded her of herself at that age - shy, misunderstood, yearning for a connection that never seemed to come. She knew she had to crack this puzzle, not just for Amelia, but for every child struggling in the shadows, waiting for someone to see them.
