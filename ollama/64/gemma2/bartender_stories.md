The air in The Rusty Mug hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation. Neon flickered above the sticky bartop, casting long, distorted shadows across the faces gathered within.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the outside world into a watercolour smear of greys and yellows. 

Elara "Ellie" Blackwood wiped down a glass, the clinking of the dishcloth a lonely counterpoint to the muffled chatter and the occasional off-key strumming of a battered guitar from the corner. It was a Tuesday night, her least favorite night. Tuesdays were for ghosts â€“ regulars who haunted the bar with their regrets and loneliness, seeking solace in cheap liquor and even cheaper company. 

Ellie caught the eye of a man slumped at the end of the bar, nursing a beer that seemed to be losing its fight against his sorrow. His name was Daniel, she knew, or at least he'd introduced himself as such last week. He'd been here ever since, muttering to himself and occasionally launching into mournful renditions of blues songs nobody remembered.  Ellie sighed.  Another Tuesday night, another soul drowning in The Rusty Mug.
