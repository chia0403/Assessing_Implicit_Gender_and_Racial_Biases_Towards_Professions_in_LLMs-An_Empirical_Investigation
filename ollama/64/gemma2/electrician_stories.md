The humid Georgia air clung to Elias "Eli" Blackwood like a second skin as he wrestled with the rusted conduit. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the porch of the dilapidated Victorian mansion, highlighting the peeling paint and overgrown rose bushes. Eli grimaced, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. This job was already proving to be more trouble than it was worth. 

He'd been called in by Mrs. Amelia Hawthorne, a woman known for her eccentricities and rumored wealth. The house, her family home for generations, had lost power inexplicably days ago. Eli, one of the few electricians willing to brave the rumors and overgrown gardens surrounding the mansion, hoped it was just a tripped breaker and not some supernatural occurrence whispered about in hushed tones by the townsfolk. 


He tugged again at the conduit, cursing under his breath as it refused to budge. He could feel the weight of countless unseen eyes upon him, watching his every move from within the shadowy depths of the house.  Eli swallowed, a knot tightening in his stomach. This was more than just an electrical issue; this was a test. And he wasn't sure if he was up to it.
