The neon glow of the ramen shop sign cast flickering shadows across Anya Petrova's tired face as she hunched over her laptop. The scent of soy sauce and pork broth mingled with the bitter tang of stale coffee, a familiar aroma in her makeshift studio - a cramped corner booth at "Ramen Rhapsody" on 14th Street. Outside, the pulse of New York City vibrated through the thin glass window; taxi horns blared, construction clanged, and a chorus of distant laughter spilled onto the sidewalk. Inside, Anya's world was contained within the glowing rectangle, her cursor blinking impatiently at the bottom of a document titled "Project: 'Meow Meow Madness'".  

It was due tomorrow. 


Her client, a flamboyant cat toy company owner with a penchant for the dramatic (and questionable puns), wanted something eye-catching, something that would make their new line of interactive feline toys the talk of the town. Anya just needed to conjure up some inspiration. Her usual wellspring of creativity seemed as dry as the instant ramen she had been subsisting on for the past week.
