The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on Eleanor Beatrice Finch's neatly stacked spreadsheets. Numbers danced before her eyes, each figure meticulously categorized, cross-referenced, and reconciled.  Eleanor, an accountant by trade and an introvert by nature, found solace in the predictable order of her world – the rhythm of the calculator keys, the satisfying click of the stapler, the comforting scent of old paper and fresh toner.

Her office, a cramped cubicle nestled deep within the bustling bowels of the Hamilton & Co. building, was her sanctuary. Walls adorned with motivational posters featuring impossibly cheerful people holding oversized cheques served as a constant reminder that success was just another equation waiting to be solved. Outside her window, the city throbbed with life – honking taxis, blaring sirens, and the distant murmur of a thousand conversations. But here, in her cubicle, Eleanor found peace amidst the chaos.


Until today.
