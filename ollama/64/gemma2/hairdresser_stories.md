The rhythmic snip-snip of shears echoed through the small salon, a comforting counterpoint to the buzz of the hairdryers and the low murmur of conversation. Sunlight streamed through the front window, casting long rectangles of warmth onto the worn linoleum floor.  

Amelia Beatrice "Millie" Thorne ran her hand over the smooth surface of a client's freshly trimmed bob, checking for stray hairs. Millie had been cutting hair in this very shop since she was fifteen, back when the name on the awning still read "Mrs. Henderson's Hair Haven." Now it was simply "Millie's," and while the clientele had changed over the years, the feeling of community remained. 

Today, though, a familiar unease gnawed at Millie's stomach. Her phone vibrated with another unanswered call from her estranged brother, Daniel. He hadn't reached out in months, not since their father's funeral, and his sudden interest felt like a storm cloud gathering on the horizon.  


Millie sighed, glancing at the clock. It was almost time for Mrs. Peabody's perm appointment, and Millie knew that she couldn't afford to dwell on Daniel's phone calls. She had people to look after, hair to cut, and lives to touch, one strand at a time.
