The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of blood. Dr. Amelia Harper adjusted her surgical mask, the thin fabric failing to muffle the rhythmic whirring of the drill beside her. The fluorescent lights cast a harsh glare on the open mouth before her, revealing a cavity that seemed to yawn like a miniature abyss. 

Amelia's office was tucked away in a quiet corner of Oakhaven, a quaint town nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering forests. Its name, "Harper & Son Dentistry," hung above the door in faded gold letters, a testament to its long history as the town's trusted dental practice. The waiting room, once bustling with children clutching worn teddy bears and adults nervously tapping their feet, was eerily silent now. The pandemic had swept through Oakhaven like a wildfire, leaving behind an unsettling stillness. 

Amelia sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the polished steel instruments on the tray.  She longed for the days when laughter echoed through the office, the clinking of dentures and the chatter of patients filling the air. Now, she was mostly left with the company of ghosts - the echoes of past conversations and the lingering scent of cinnamon gum that clung to the furniture like a memory.
