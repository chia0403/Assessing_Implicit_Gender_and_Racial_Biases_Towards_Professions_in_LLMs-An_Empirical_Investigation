The insistent whirring of the adjustment table’s electric motor filled the small, sun-drenched office. Outside, San Francisco hummed with its usual frenetic energy, but inside Dr. Eleanor Vance's practice, "Spine & Soul,"  a hush fell whenever she entered a room. Her hands were strong, honed by years of manipulating vertebrae and easing tension, yet they moved with a surprising grace. Today, though, the usual focus felt brittle around the edges. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock – 9:45 AM. She was already running late, her mind preoccupied with a recurring nightmare that had plagued her sleep for weeks. It involved an avalanche of paperwork, each page demanding her immediate attention, and a chilling voice whispering, “You’re not enough.”  Pushing the unsettling dream aside, she focused on the next patient waiting in the examination room – a young woman named Clara, struggling with chronic back pain that threatened to derail her burgeoning career as a ballerina.
