The morning mist hung heavy over Oakhaven Manor, shrouding its sprawling lawns in an ethereal veil. Dewdrops clung to the vibrant emerald blades of grass like miniature diamonds, reflecting the first pale rays of dawn.  

Elias Blackwood adjusted his spectacles and surveyed his domain with a critical eye. He was the head groundskeeper at Oakhaven, a position he'd held for over thirty years. His gnarled hands, calloused from years of toil, traced the patterns in the well-worn path leading to the manor's grand oak doors.  

Elias knew every inch of this sprawling estate â€“ the secret weeping willow nestled by the rose garden, the ancient apple tree that bore fruit only once a decade, the hidden patch of wild violets where butterflies danced on sunbeams. Oakhaven held his heart as surely as it held the secrets whispered through generations. 


But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a disquiet that tugged at Elias's soul like a stray thread in his carefully woven tapestry of routine. He couldn't quite place it, but he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this day would not be ordinary.
