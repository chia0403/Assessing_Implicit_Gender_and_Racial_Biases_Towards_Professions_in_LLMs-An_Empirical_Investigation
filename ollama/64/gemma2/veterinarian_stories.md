The pungent scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of hay from the stables next door.  Sunlight streamed through the high windows of Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's small clinic, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. A stray cat, ginger and skinny, curled up on a worn rug by the front desk, purring softly despite its ribs showing prominently. 

Amelia stood at her workbench, meticulously sterilizing her instruments for the afternoon’s appointments. Her brown eyes, usually sparkling with warmth and humor, were clouded with a weariness that had become all too familiar lately. The clinic was struggling to keep afloat, a victim of the economic downturn and rising costs of running a practice in a rural town like Harmony Ridge.  


The quiet was broken by the frantic barking of a golden retriever at the entrance. A young woman, her face etched with worry, followed behind, leading the dog on a leash. 

"Dr. Hawthorne? Please help him! He's been acting strange all day," she pleaded, her voice trembling. 


Amelia sighed, setting down her instruments. She always felt a pang of sympathy for worried pet owners, but today, that empathy was tangled with her own anxieties.  She forced a smile and beckoned the woman and her dog inside. "Come in, come in. Let's see what’s wrong."
