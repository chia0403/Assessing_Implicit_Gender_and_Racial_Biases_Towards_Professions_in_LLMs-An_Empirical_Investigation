Ellie squinted at her notes, their messy scribbles reflecting the chaos swirling within her own mind. This wasn’t just another missing person case. There was something off about these vanishings, a pattern she couldn’t quite decipher. A shiver ran down her spine despite the stuffy room; this story felt heavy, like a weight settling in her gut. It was the kind of story that could make or break you, and Ellie, with a burning need to uncover the truth, was ready to risk it all.
