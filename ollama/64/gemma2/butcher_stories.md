The air in "Cleaves & Co." was thick with the scent of iron and salt, a familiar perfume that clung to Bartholomew Cleaver like a second skin. He stood hunched over his workbench, a symphony of clanging steel against bone filling the cramped shop. Outside, London's fog swirled through the cobblestone streets, shrouding the gas lamps in an ethereal haze. The rhythmic clatter of hooves and the distant rumble of carriages formed a steady backdrop to Bartholomew's work.  His hands, calloused and scarred from years of wielding cleavers and knives, expertly worked the carcass of a recently butchered ox, separating muscle from bone with practiced precision. 

Bartholomew Cleaver wasn't just any butcher. He was known throughout Whitechapel for his exquisite cuts, his ability to predict the perfect roast or stew based on a simple glance at the animal, and most importantly, his uncanny knack for knowing exactly what cut each customer craved, even before they voiced their desires. But beneath the surface of this skilled craftsman lay a man haunted by secrets, whispered rumors that followed him like the fog itself. Secrets that threatened to spill out from the shadowed corners of "Cleaves & Co." and into the bright, harsh light of day.
