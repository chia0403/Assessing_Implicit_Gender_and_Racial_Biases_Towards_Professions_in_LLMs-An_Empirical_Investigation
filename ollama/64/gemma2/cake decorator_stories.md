Her tiny bakery, "Sugar & Stardust," nestled between a bustling bookstore and a grumpy antique shop on Elm Street, was her sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating swirls of pink frosting and edible glitter, catching the shimmer of fondant roses in their velvet cases.

She was known throughout town for her whimsical cakes, each one a miniature world of edible delight, imbued with her own brand of magic.
