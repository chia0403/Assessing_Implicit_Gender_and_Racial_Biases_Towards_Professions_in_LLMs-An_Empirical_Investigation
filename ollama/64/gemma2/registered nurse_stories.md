The air in Emergency Room Three hung thick with antiseptic and unspoken fear. The rhythmic beeping of monitors punctuated by the occasional gasp from a patient in the next cubicle created a symphony of distress. Amelia Claire Hawthorne, her face set in a mask of practiced calm, meticulously scrubbed her hands, the motion almost hypnotic in its precision. Five years on this floor had taught her to anticipate every crisis before it arrived, to read the subtle shifts in patients' expressions and vitals that foretold disaster. Tonight, however, something felt different. The tension was tighter, the breaths shallower, like the ER itself was holding its own heart captive.  

Amelia caught the eye of Dr. Jackson, a grizzled veteran with eyes that had seen too much. He offered a curt nod, his expression mirroring her own apprehension. 

"Trauma two," he grunted, gesturing towards the gurney wheeled into the bay. "Likely alcohol-related. Get ready." 


The setting: A bustling urban emergency room in Chicago during the early hours of a winter night.
