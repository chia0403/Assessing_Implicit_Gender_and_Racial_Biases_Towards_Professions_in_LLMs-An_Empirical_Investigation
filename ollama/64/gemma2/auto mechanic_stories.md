The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt coffee in Hank "Gearhead" Gibson's garage. It was a cramped, cluttered space tucked away on a dusty side street in the forgotten industrial district of Port Blackwood. The faint murmur of the interstate hummed in the distance, punctuated by the occasional screech of brakes or the rumble of an eighteen-wheeler passing through. 

Hank, his grease-stained overalls hanging low on his wiry frame, wiped sweat from his brow with a rag that smelled vaguely of gasoline and despair. He was hunched over a rusted Ford pickup truck, its engine disassembled in front of him like a metallic puzzle. The owner, a grizzled old fisherman named Captain Jake, had insisted it needed fixing for the upcoming lobster season, even though the truck looked like it belonged in a museum dedicated to rusty relics. 

Hank sighed.  Fixing this thing was going to be a monumental task, but he couldn't say no to Captain Jake. The old man had been his best customer for years, and besides, Hank had a soft spot for forgotten things. Just like himself, sometimes it seemed.
