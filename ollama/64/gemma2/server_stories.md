The clatter of silverware against ceramic sang a discordant symphony in Beatrice Clementine Hawthorneâ€™s ears.  

It was Friday night at The Crimson Spoon, always a cacophony of boisterous laughter, clinking glasses, and the rhythmic scrape of chairs being pulled back from tables. But tonight, Beatrice felt every clang, every giggle, like a tiny hammer tapping on her skull. 

The heat radiating from the open kitchen, usually comforting in its familiar warmth, felt oppressive today.  Beatrice wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of flour on her already stained apron. Another Friday night, another rush. She wished she could just disappear into the shadows beneath the dusty, floral-patterned wallpaper that adorned the walls. 


The Crimson Spoon was a relic of a bygone era, its faded grandeur clinging desperately to life like a moth to a flickering flame. The mahogany booths were worn smooth from countless dinners and whispered secrets, the chandeliers cast dim halos over the mismatched tables, and the air hummed with the ghosts of forgotten laughter. It wasn't glamorous, but it was familiar, and Beatrice had learned to find solace in its comforting chaos.  Tonight, though, even the familiar felt suffocating.
