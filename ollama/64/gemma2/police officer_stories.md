The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and decay, a familiar aroma in Port Azure. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Vargas squinted at the horizon, where the sun was sinking into the churning sea like a bruised plum.  Grimy fishing boats bobbed listlessly in the harbor, their hulls painted with faded murals of mythical sea creatures that seemed to mock the grim reality of the scene before her.  A young woman's body, pale and lifeless, lay sprawled on the cobblestones at the foot of the old lighthouse. 


Izzy stepped cautiously over the cordoned-off area, her sturdy boots crunching on the loose gravel. The victim was draped in a tattered crimson dress, a stark contrast against the muted greys and blues of the harbor. Her long, dark hair was tangled with seaweed, and a single pearl earring glinted dully amidst the grime on her face. 


The usual symphony of seagulls and distant foghorns seemed to have fallen silent, replaced by an unsettling stillness that pressed down on Izzy like a shroud. This wasn't just another body in Port Azure; something about this scene felt different, colder, more deliberate.
