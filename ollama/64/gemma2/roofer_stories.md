The midday sun beat down on Santiago Alvarez's back, turning the asphalt shingles he was replacing into shimmering heat islands. Sweat trickled down his forehead, stinging his eyes, but Santiago barely flinched. He’d been battling New Mexico’s summer heat since he was a boy, learning the trade from his father on these very rooftops. 

The old house, nestled in Santa Fe's historic district, was a sprawling adobe structure, its weathered walls telling tales of generations past. Red tile roofs lined the street, each one unique, a patchwork quilt against the sapphire sky. Santiago paused, wiping his brow with a grease-stained rag, and looked out over the city. He loved this view – the distant Sangre de Cristo mountains, their snowcapped peaks a stark contrast to the terracotta hues below, the faint scent of piñon wood smoke carried on the warm breeze. 

This was home. This was where he belonged.  But lately, Santiago had been feeling restless, like a bird with clipped wings, yearning for something more than this familiar sky. He glanced at the calloused hands gripping his hammer, imagining them crafting something new, something that would take him beyond these rooftops, beyond Santa Fe’s boundaries.
