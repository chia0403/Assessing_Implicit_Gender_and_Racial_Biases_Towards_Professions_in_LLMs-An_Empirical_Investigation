The humid air clung to Bartholomew “Bart” Featherstone like a damp shroud as he wheeled his laden cart through the cavernous lobby of the Grandview Hotel. 

Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, painting the polished marble floor in a mosaic of emerald, ruby, and sapphire. The air buzzed with polite chatter punctuated by the clink of silverware from the adjacent café and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock that seemed to keep time with Bart's weary heart. 

He paused at the ornate reception desk, placing a worn suitcase on its polished surface with a soft thud.  "Mr. Alistair Finch," he announced, glancing up at the haughty receptionist who barely spared him a glance. "Room 312."


The Grandview, a relic of the Gilded Age, held secrets as deep and tangled as its ornate carpets. Bart had seen it all during his years as a bellhop – whispered romances, clandestine meetings, and the occasional scandal that would leave the city buzzing for weeks. But tonight, something felt different, a prickling unease crawling up his spine like ivy.  He just couldn't shake the feeling that Mr. Finch's arrival was about to unravel something more than just another forgotten suitcase.
