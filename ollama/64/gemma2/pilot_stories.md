The harsh Arizona sun beat down on the tarmac, turning the metal skin of Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne's vintage Stearman biplane into a shimmering mirage. The air crackled with heat, but Ace barely noticed. Her focus was laser-sharp, her hands hovering above the worn leather controls, waiting for the signal to taxi. 

She glanced at the dusty hangar behind her, a faded paint job proclaiming "Hawthorne Air Services" in peeling letters. It had been her grandfather's legacy, passed down through generations, now struggling to stay afloat in an age of sleek jets and high-tech airlines. Ace wouldn't let it go. This old bird, this piece of history, was more than just a machine; it was a link to the past, a symbol of freedom and adventure.

Today, she wasn't flying for glory or profit. She was ferrying a single passenger – a man shrouded in mystery, known only as "Mr. X" –  to a remote airstrip deep in the Mojave Desert. The details were scant: a briefcase full of cash, a whispered promise of a hefty sum, and a chilling warning to stay silent about the destination. Ace had flown dangerous missions before, but something about this one felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, but she pushed it aside. This was just another job, another flight into the unknown.
