Priscilla Finchley, his ever-patient secretary for the past twelve years, sighed and adjusted her spectacles. Mr. Featherstonehaugh was on a roll, fueled by a triple espresso and an unyielding deadline. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across his cluttered desk, drowning it in a warm orange glow. Stacks of yellowed paper rose precariously high, threatening to topple over with each errant keystroke. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging overhead. The air was thick with the scent of old ink and stale ambition. 

Outside, London hummed with life – a symphony of traffic, distant laughter, and clanging streetcar bells. But inside Mr. Featherstonehaugh's cramped office, time seemed to stand still, suspended in the tense bubble of impending doom as the clock ticked relentlessly towards five o'clock.
