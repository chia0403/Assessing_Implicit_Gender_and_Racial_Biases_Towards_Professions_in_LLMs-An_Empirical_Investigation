The air in the grand lobby of The Astoria was thick with anticipation, laced with the scent of lilies from the floral arrangement near reception. It wasn't unusual for such opulent displays, considering it was always someone's special day within these gilded walls.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted her crisp black uniform and smoothed down the perfectly pressed collar. Her gaze swept across the polished marble floor, past the roaring fireplace, where a gentleman in a tweed suit debated the merits of champagne with a woman draped in diamonds. It was just another Tuesday at The Astoria, a symphony of carefully orchestrated chaos that Ellie orchestrated with practiced grace. She was the maestro of mundane needs and extraordinary requests, the silent guardian of secrets whispered behind closed doors, and the confidante to souls seeking solace within these luxurious confines. Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, like a storm brewing behind the perfect fa√ßade. 


The Astoria itself was a monument to bygone glamour, built in the early 20th century as a haven for the city's elite.  Its towering facade of intricate stonework overlooked Central Park, its vast ballroom had witnessed countless social triumphs and whispered scandals, and its labyrinthine hallways held echoes of forgotten dreams. Each room, from the opulent suites to the cozy library, whispered stories of the lives that unfolded within its walls.
