The air in the Blackwood Manor hung heavy with dust motes dancing in the morning sunbeams that slanted through grimy windows. Eleanor Thistlewood, her knuckles raw from scrubbing ancient brass fixtures, paused to survey the grand but decaying foyer. A cobweb clung precariously to the ornate grandfather clock, its hands frozen at half past three. It had been like this for years – forever teetering between grandeur and neglect. 

Eleanor sighed, smoothing down the starch-crisp collar of her uniform. The Blackwood Manor hadn't seen a true celebration in decades, not since Lord Blackwood’s untimely demise. Now, it was just her and Mr. Bartholomew Blackwood, the deceased lord's distant nephew, who flitted about like a lonely moth, lost in his memories and refusing to let go. 


The manor itself seemed to mirror its master – grand, with faded glory clinging to every chipped marble step and dusty velvet curtain. It was a place of whispers and shadows, where secrets lingered like the scent of lavender polish Eleanor used on the impossibly high shelves in the drawing-room.
