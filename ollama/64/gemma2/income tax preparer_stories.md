The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile white glow over Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's cluttered desk. Paperclips danced in miniature tornadoes around her overflowing wastebasket, each one a tiny monument to another completed Form 1040. Outside, the February wind howled like a disgruntled tax auditor, rattling the windows of Hawthorne & Sons Tax Preparation. It was officially tax season, and Amelia was in her element â€“ surrounded by numbers, deciphering deductions, and wielding calculators with the ferocity of a warrior queen.  

This year, though, something felt different. The air crackled with an unusual energy, like static electricity about to discharge. Perhaps it was the new intern, Ethan, who seemed more terrified than trained, or maybe it was the ominous news on the radio about a looming tax reform bill that threatened to upend their entire profession. Whatever it was, Amelia knew that this year's filing season would be anything but ordinary.
