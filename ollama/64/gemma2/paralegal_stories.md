The hum of the fluorescent lights in the cramped office did little to dispel the oppressive heat clinging to Amelia Beatrice Jones like a second skin. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, churning out legal memos that would likely never see the light of day, let alone influence the course of any high-stakes case. It was Wednesday, and as usual, the air crackled with the static tension only a firm on the brink of collapse could produce. 

Amelia, a paralegal for over five years and seemingly immune to both coffee and sleep deprivation, surveyed the scene: her boss, Mr. Sterling, pacing frantically in his makeshift office (a partitioned cubicle illuminated by a lava lamp), and the other two remaining staff members hunched over their desks, staring at computer screens with the vacant expression of someone staring into an abyss. 

The walls were plastered with motivational posters – “Think Outside the Box,” “Believe You Can and You’re Halfway There” – ironic reminders in this crumbling legal fortress where belief was a luxury they couldn't afford.
