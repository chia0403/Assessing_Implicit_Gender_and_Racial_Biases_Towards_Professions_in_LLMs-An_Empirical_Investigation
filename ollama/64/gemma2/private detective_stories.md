Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Kettle, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign across the street. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer. Amelia "Amy" Grace Harper, her trench coat dripping onto the threadbare carpet, hunched over a chipped mug of coffee that tasted like despair. She wasn't a woman who cared much for ambiance; she preferred cases that were clean, straightforward, and paid well.  

The bell above the door jangled, announcing another customer. A hulking man with shoulders wider than Amy's whole torso swaggered in, his face obscured by a fedora pulled low. He slid onto the stool beside her, the worn leather groaning under his weight. 

"You Amelia Harper?" His voice was a gravelly rumble, like stones grinding together.  

Amy didn't bother looking up. "Depends. Who's asking?"


The setting is a seedy, rain-soaked part of a nameless city. The Rusty Kettle is a rundown bar frequented by the city's underbelly - shady characters, desperate souls, and the occasional private investigator seeking refuge from the storm.
