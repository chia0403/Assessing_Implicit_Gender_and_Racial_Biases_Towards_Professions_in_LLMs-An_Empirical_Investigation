The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Vance sighed, straightening the stack of patient charts on her desk. Another day, another mountain of paperwork. She glanced at the clock – 3:45 pm. Only fifteen minutes until she could escape this sterile, fluorescent-lit haven and dive into the quiet comfort of her book club meeting.

Ellie was an occupational therapist, dedicated to helping people regain their independence after illness or injury. It wasn't always glamorous.  The stories were often heartbreaking -  a young woman robbed of her mobility by a car accident, a man grappling with the loss of his cognitive abilities due to a stroke. But Ellie found solace in the small victories: a patient learning to use adaptive utensils again, a child rediscovering the joy of painting after a surgery. 


Today's caseload was particularly demanding.  A new patient, Arthur Finch, had arrived just that morning with severe tremors from Parkinson’s disease, making even simple tasks like buttoning a shirt impossible. Ellie knew it wouldn't be easy, but she felt a familiar spark of determination – the desire to help Arthur reclaim his autonomy and dignity. As she picked up his chart, a tremor ran through her own hand, a reminder that life, in all its unpredictable ways, could take unexpected turns.
