The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar aroma that clung to everything in Redwood Creek. Dawn was just breaking, painting the towering redwoods in shades of amber and rose as Silas Blackwood stood on the precipice of another day. The early morning chill bit at his exposed skin, but he barely registered it, his focus fixed on the vast expanse before him – a sea of emerald green punctuated by the skeletal remains of fallen giants. 

Silas, calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, took a deep breath, savoring the earthy tang that lingered in the air. He was born into this world, the son of a logger who taught him the rhythms of the forest before he could walk. The thud of his axe against bark, the rasping whine of the saw, the rumble of the logging truck – these were the sounds of his life.

Today, however, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Silas's chest, a premonition he couldn’t shake off. It wasn't just the persistent feeling of being watched, or the unsettling stillness that blanketed the forest floor. No, there was something else, something intangible but undeniable, whispering warnings on the wind. 


This day promised to be unlike any other in Redwood Creek.
