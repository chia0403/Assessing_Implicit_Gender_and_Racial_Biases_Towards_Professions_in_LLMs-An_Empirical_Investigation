The stage lights cast harsh shadows across Amelia Rosalind Hawthorne's face as she surveyed the chaos that was her rehearsal space. The air hung thick with the scent of sweat, stale coffee, and simmering frustration. A crumpled script lay discarded on the floor next to a rogue prop â€“ a chipped porcelain teacup, seemingly destined to become an extra in its own right during this production.
