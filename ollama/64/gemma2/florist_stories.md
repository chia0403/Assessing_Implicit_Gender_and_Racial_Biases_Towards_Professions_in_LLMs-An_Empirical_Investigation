The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and damp earth. Dew clung to emerald ferns, casting tiny rainbows across the wooden floor of "Petal & Pine," Amelia Willowbrook's haven nestled in the heart of Oakhaven. Sunbeams slanted through the stained-glass window above the counter, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet air. 

Amelia, her hands dusted with pollen and her auburn braids tucked behind her ears, arranged a bouquet of fiery sunflowers and delicate lavender sprigs, their vibrant colors echoing the warmth spreading through her chest. This was her sanctuary – a place where wilting spirits bloomed anew, where grief found solace in fragrant lilies, and where joy erupted in cascades of brightly colored roses.  

But today, an unfamiliar tension crackled beneath the usual hum of tranquility. A single, ominous-looking black rose sat on the counter, its velvety petals unfurling like a shadow against the bright blooms surrounding it. Amelia knew this wasn't just any customer; this was something…different.
