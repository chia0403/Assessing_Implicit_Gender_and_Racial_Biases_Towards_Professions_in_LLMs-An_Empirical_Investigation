Rain lashed against the stained glass window of The Grizzled Goose, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear of crimson.  Inside, Amelia “Milly” Reyes, a journalist for the struggling Ashwood Gazette, hunched over a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, her notebook open but empty. The pub, nestled in the heart of the forgotten mining town of Blackwood, Pennsylvania, usually buzzed with the low hum of gossip and the clinking of pint glasses. Tonight, however, only a handful of patrons huddled in booths, their faces illuminated by the flickering gas lamps that cast long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Milly shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her.  Blackwood had a way of seeping into your bones, a chilling dampness that lingered long after the rain stopped.  Tonight, that chill felt deeper, more ominous.  She’d come seeking a story, a spark to ignite her stalled career, but all she found was an unsettling quiet, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the ceiling fan and a sense of foreboding as thick as the coal dust that still clung to the air.
