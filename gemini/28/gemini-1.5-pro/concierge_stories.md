The rain hammered against the ornate glass doors of the Hotel Magnifique, a relentless rhythm echoing through the cavernous lobby.  Gilded cherubs perched on marble columns seemed to shiver in the downpour, their painted eyes reflecting the flashes of lightning that illuminated the opulent space.  This Parisian landmark, perched on a hill overlooking the Seine, was a haven of luxury, a world removed from the grey, sodden streets below.  Tonight, however, the usual air of serene elegance was tinged with a nervous energy.  A hushed murmur rippled through the gathered guests, their whispers punctuated by the staccato clicks of stiletto heels on the polished floor.  At the center of this swirling vortex of anticipation stood Antoine Dubois, the hotel’s esteemed Head Concierge, his impeccable navy suit seemingly impervious to the storm raging outside. He adjusted his silk tie, a flicker of unease momentarily disturbing the placid mask he habitually wore. Tonight, the Magnifique was hosting the unveiling of the legendary “Serpent’s Eye” diamond, and Antoine had a feeling his evening was about to become considerably more complicated than simply securing theatre tickets and restaurant reservations.
