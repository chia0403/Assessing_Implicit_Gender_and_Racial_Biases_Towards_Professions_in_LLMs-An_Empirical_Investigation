The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face, the fine mist clinging to her eyelashes like miniature dewdrops.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Porcupine Sea, she braced her easel against a jutting rock. Below, the ramshackle fishing village of Treaclewick clung to the cliffside like a barnacle colony, its brightly painted houses a riot of color against the gray granite.  October had arrived in Cornwall, bringing with it the blustery promise of winter, but Elara, bundled in a thick wool coat and fingerless gloves, felt a thrill of inspiration course through her.  The dramatic light, the wild energy of the sea, the way the clouds scudded across the vast canvas of the sky â€“ it was a scene begging to be captured, a masterpiece waiting to be born.  She squeezed a dollop of cobalt blue onto her palette, the pungent oil paint a familiar comfort.  This was where she belonged, amidst the chaos and beauty of the Cornish coast, her brush a conduit between her soul and the world.
