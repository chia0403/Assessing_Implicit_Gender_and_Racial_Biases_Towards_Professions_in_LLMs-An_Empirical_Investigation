The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that mirrored the throbbing in Elias Thorne's temples.  Neon signs advertising long-defunct breweries flickered intermittently through the grimy window, casting streaks of sickly green and watery orange across the dust-coated bottles lining the back bar.  Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead, wiped down the already spotless mahogany counter with a grey rag, the silence broken only by the drumming rain and the occasional groan of the ancient refrigerator struggling to keep the beer cool.  The Rusty Mug, nestled in the forgotten corner of a once-booming mining town called Dust Devil Gulch, rarely saw customers after nine, especially on a Tuesday night like this. But Elias stayed open, partly out of habit, partly out of a stubborn refusal to let the town's slow decay drag him down with it.
