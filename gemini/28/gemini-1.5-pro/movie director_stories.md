The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, director of critically-acclaimed indie films like "Whispers of Rust" and the less-acclaimed "Robot Dentist."  He pulled his threadbare tweed coat tighter, the damp wool scratching against his neck.  He stood on the precipice of a defunct quarry, its grey, jagged walls dropping precipitously into a murky pool far below.  Around him, the desolate landscape of the Scottish Highlands stretched, a tapestry of muted browns and greens under a sky the colour of bruised plums.

And Elias Thorne, a man who dealt in fiction, found himself facing a terrifying reality.
