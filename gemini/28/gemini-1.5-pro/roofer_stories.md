The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised-purple sky, beat down on Elias Thorne's back.  He squinted, sweat stinging his eyes, as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion below. Slate tiles, the color of a raven's wing, shimmered with trapped heat.  Chimneys, twisted like gnarled fingers, clawed at the oppressive humidity hanging over the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Illinois.  Elias shifted his weight, the worn leather of his tool belt creaking a familiar song against his faded denim overalls.  A rogue gust of wind whipped through the towering oaks surrounding the property, carrying with it the scent of impending rain and the faint, metallic tang of ozone. He knew, with a roofer's instinct, that the storm brewing on the horizon wasn't just atmospheric.  Something else was gathering over the Thornecrest Manor, something dark and unsettling.
