The biting November wind, sharp as a freshly honed axe, whipped through the towering pines of the Bitterroot Mountains, whistling a mournful tune through the gaps in Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's thick, plaid jacket.  Ice crystals glittered on his bushy, salt-and-pepper beard, reflecting the weak, grey light filtering down through the canopy.  Around him, the air hung heavy with the scent of pine resin and damp earth, a smell Elijah had inhaled since he was a boy barely big enough to swing a hatchet. He stood at the edge of Blackwood’s Claim, a swathe of ancient forest his family had worked for three generations, gazing up at the marked giant, a Douglas Fir older than any living man.  This behemoth, with a trunk thicker than a wagon, was the last tree slated to fall before the first snows closed the mountain passes, effectively shutting down Elijah’s operation for the winter.  He reached out a calloused hand and touched the rough bark, a familiar pang of regret tightening his chest. Each fallen giant was a loss, but also a necessity. It was a cycle he'd wrestled with his whole life.  This winter, however, felt different. The bite in the wind was colder, the silence of the forest deeper, and the weight on Elijah's shoulders, heavier.
