The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, causing the already precarious stack of essays he clutched to sway precariously.  He squinted against the icy gusts, the Gothic spires of the University of Aldonshire blurring momentarily through the swirling snow.  Built on a dramatic cliff overlooking the tempestuous North Sea, the university, with its labyrinthine corridors and echoing halls, had been Alistair's haven for the past fifteen years. Tonight, however, the usually comforting weight of its ancient stone felt more like a prison.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast a skeletal light across the cobbled quadrangle, illuminating the empty stone benches and the skeletal branches of a gnarled oak tree, its leaves long since surrendered to winter's embrace.  The only sound, besides the wind's howl, was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Alistair's own leather-soled shoes against the frosted cobbles, a lonely percussion in the gathering darkness. He knew he should hurry back to the warmth of his rooms in St. Jude's Hall, but something kept him rooted to the spot, a prickling unease that settled deep in his bones.
