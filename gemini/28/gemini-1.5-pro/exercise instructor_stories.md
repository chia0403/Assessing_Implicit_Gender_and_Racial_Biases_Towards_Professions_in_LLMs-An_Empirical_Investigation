The relentless Miami sun, even at 7:00 am, beat down on the turquoise-tiled rooftop of the Solara Grand Hotel.  A gentle ocean breeze, thick with the scent of salt and sunscreen, did little to quell the rising humidity.  Beatrix "Bea" Rodriguez, clad in vibrant coral leggings and a matching sports bra, surveyed her domain.  Twenty yoga mats, rolled out in a perfect grid, awaited her disciples.  Beyond the mats, the infinity pool glittered, tempting swimmers with its cool promise.  Palm trees swayed in rhythmic unison, framing a breathtaking view of South Beach, a kaleidoscope of Art Deco architecture shimmering in the morning light.  Bea, adjusting her microphone headset, took a deep breath and smiled, a flash of white against her tanned skin.  Today was the first day of her new sunrise yoga class, and the energy buzzing in the air was palpable â€“ a mixture of nervous anticipation and the promise of a perfect Miami morning.
