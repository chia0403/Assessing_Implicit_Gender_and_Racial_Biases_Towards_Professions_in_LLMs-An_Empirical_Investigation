The flickering gaslights of the Moulin de la Lune cast an eerie, emerald glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Montmartre.  A chill wind, sharp with the scent of the Seine and something vaguely metallic, whipped through the narrow alleyways, tugging at the edges of posters advertising Mademoiselle Élodie Moreau, "The Nightingale of Paris." Inside the Moulin, the air was thick with the mingled aromas of cheap perfume, absinthe, and anticipation. Élodie Moreau, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, adjusted the emerald feather boa draped over her crimson velvet gown.  Tonight was the night. Tonight, she would finally sing her original composition, "La Chanson de l'Ombre," and prove she was more than just another pretty face warbling the familiar tunes of the day.
