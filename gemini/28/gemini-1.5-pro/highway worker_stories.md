The sun beat down on Elias Vance’s orange vest, the heat radiating off the asphalt of Interstate 80 like a furnace.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering air above the cracked blacktop, and the rhythmic thrum of passing eighteen-wheelers vibrated through the soles of his steel-toed boots.  Elias, sweat plastering dark curls to his forehead, wiped a grimy hand across his brow and squinted at the pothole he was patching.  Around him, the vast expanse of the Wyoming high desert stretched to the horizon – a tapestry of sagebrush and windswept rock under a cloudless, turquoise sky.  Mile marker 147.  Just another Tuesday for a Wyoming Department of Transportation road crew, but Elias had a feeling this one was going to be different. The air crackled with a strange static, and a flicker of something unnatural danced at the edge of his vision.
