The hum of the air conditioner fought a losing battle against the oppressive July heat radiating through the expansive windows of Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s studio apartment.  Located above a bustling Vietnamese pho restaurant in the heart of Toronto’s Little Italy, the space served as both living quarters and creative sanctuary for the 28-year-old graphic designer.  Stacks of Pantone color guides leaned precariously against overflowing bookshelves, vying for space with half-finished canvases and a collection of vintage concert posters.  Strings of fairy lights, draped haphazardly around the room, cast a warm, almost ethereal glow over the controlled chaos. This evening, however, the whimsical ambiance was lost on Amy. She sat hunched over her glowing iMac, the light reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes. A half-eaten bowl of instant ramen sat forgotten beside her, a testament to the all-consuming deadline looming over her head. The rebranding campaign for “Caffeinated Carl’s,” a burgeoning coffee chain with aspirations of hipster domination, was due tomorrow, and Amy’s creative well had run drier than the Sahara.
