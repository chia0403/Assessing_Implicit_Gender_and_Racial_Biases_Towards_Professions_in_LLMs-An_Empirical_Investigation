Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Amelia Reyes's twenty-seventh-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of downtown Chicago.  The city, normally a vibrant grid of twinkling activity, was obscured by a thick, grey curtain of November misery. Inside, the air thrummed with the low hum of servers stacked in the adjacent climate-controlled room, a constant, electronic heartbeat that Amelia found oddly comforting.  She, Amelia Reyes, Senior Systems Analyst for Chimera Technologies, was hunched over her ergonomic keyboard, fingers flying across the keys, chasing a phantom glitch in the companyâ€™s new payroll system. It was 10:47 pm on a Tuesday, and she was the only person left in the sprawling office suite, save for Steve, the perpetually tired security guard downstairs.  The deadline for the system launch was looming, a monstrous digital clock ticking away in the back of her mind, and this elusive bug threatened to derail the entire project.  The air smelled faintly of stale pizza and burnt coffee, a testament to the long hours Amelia and her team had poured into this launch.  This night, however, was different.  Tonight, she was alone, and the silence, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard and the relentless drumming of the rain, was starting to feel oppressive.
