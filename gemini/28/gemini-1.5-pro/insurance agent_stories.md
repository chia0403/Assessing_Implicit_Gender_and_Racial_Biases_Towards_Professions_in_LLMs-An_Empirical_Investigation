The chipped porcelain mermaid on Amelia Grace Blackwood's desk trembled as a semi-truck rumbled past her office window, momentarily obscuring the already dreary view of downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania. Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the persistent drumming headache that had plagued Amelia since Monday. It was now Thursday, and the only thing keeping her tethered to her sanity was the lukewarm cup of instant coffee balanced precariously on a stack of claim forms.  Her office, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery, wasn't much to look at, a testament to the less-than-glamorous life of an insurance agent in a perpetually overcast city.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a fragrance Amelia was becoming intimately familiar with.  This week, in particular, had been a parade of burst pipes, fender benders, and one particularly unfortunate incident involving a squirrel, a power line, and Mrs. Higgins' prized petunia collection.  Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples, and wished, not for the first time, sheâ€™d pursued her childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist.  At least then she'd be surrounded by something other than damp carpet and the looming threat of another insurance claim.
