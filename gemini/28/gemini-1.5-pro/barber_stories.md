The rhythmic snip of Elias Thorne's shears punctuated the humid air of the Havenwood Barbershop.  Outside, the late afternoon sun baked the brick facade of the tiny shop, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique store on Elm Street. Havenwood, a sleepy town draped over the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania, wasn't known for much, but Elias's precise cuts and effortless fades were a point of pride. The shop itself, with its faded checkerboard floor and worn leather chairs, smelled of bay rum and sandalwood, a scent as familiar and comforting to the townsfolk as the church bells that chimed on Sunday mornings.  A dusty ceiling fan whirred lazily overhead, barely stirring the air thick with anticipation for the annual Havenwood Founder's Day picnic, just two days away.
