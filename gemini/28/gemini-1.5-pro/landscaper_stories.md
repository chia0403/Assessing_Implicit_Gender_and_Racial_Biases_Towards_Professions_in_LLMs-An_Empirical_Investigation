The biting wind whipped at Elias Kettering's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the brick-red geraniums he was meticulously planting. Frost clung to the edges of the terracotta pots, a testament to the stubbornly late spring that had plagued the Hudson Valley this year.  Elias, his knees sunk deep in the damp earth of Mrs. Vandergelt's prize-winning rose garden, hummed a tuneless melody against the chill.  Greystone Manor, a sprawling Victorian behemoth overlooking the river, loomed behind him, its intricate gingerbread trim a stark contrast to the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the property.  Elias, despite the cold seeping through his worn work gloves, felt a strange sense of peace here.  He understood the language of the earth, the quiet whispers of the newly budding roses, and the impatient rustle of the wind urging the world to wake up.  He just hoped Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman known for her exacting standards and a voice as sharp as pruning shears, would appreciate his efforts.
