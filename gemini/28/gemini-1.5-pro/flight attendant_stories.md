The stale recirculated air hung heavy with the scent of lukewarm coffee and someone's overly enthusiastic application of duty-free perfume.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her smile plastered on with the same practiced ease as her impeccably applied lipstick, surveyed the cabin of Oceanic Airlines Flight 42 from Honolulu to Tokyo.  Outside, the vast expanse of the Pacific stretched beneath a sky bleeding shades of tangerine and rose as the sun began its slow descent.  Inside, the usual pre-flight cacophony reigned: the insistent beep of electronic devices being powered down, the restless murmur of conversations, the clatter of overhead compartments slamming shut.  Amy, despite the serene composure she projected, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  It wasn't the turbulence forecast over the Marianas Trench, nor the notoriously demanding business class passengers booked on this flight.  It was a prickling sensation at the back of her neck, a whisper of something amiss, like a forgotten line in a pre-flight safety demonstration, something crucial she couldn't quite place her finger on.
