The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and cedar through the deserted streets of Port Blossom, Washington.  A lone streetlight flickered weakly against the pre-dawn gloom, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced across the brick facades of the antique shops lining Water Street. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, her breath misting in the frigid air, pulled her collar tighter against the chill and surveyed the scene with a grim set to her jaw.  The flashing blue and red lights of her patrol car painted the cobblestone street in alternating hues of emergency, illuminating a shattered storefront window and the dark, ominous stain spreading across the pavement just inside.  This picturesque tourist town, usually so quiet and charming, held a secret tonight, and Izzy was determined to uncover it.
