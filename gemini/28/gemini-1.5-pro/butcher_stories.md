The biting wind, scented with brine and woodsmoke, whipped around Elias Thorne as he hoisted the carcass of a stag onto the hook in his shop.  The bell above the door jingled a mournful tune, the sound swallowed by the constant drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof. Thorne's Butcher Shop and Smokehouse stood solitary against the grey expanse of the Saltfen, a bleak, windswept marshland bordering the eastern edge of the Whispering Woods.  Here, the gnarled trees clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers, and the fog rolled in thick and fast, often obscuring the narrow, dirt track that served as the only road in or out. Elias, his thick, calloused hands red from the cold, glanced out at the swirling mist, a frown etching itself deep into his weathered face. It was the kind of weather that kept sensible folk indoors, the kind of weather that brought outâ€¦others.
