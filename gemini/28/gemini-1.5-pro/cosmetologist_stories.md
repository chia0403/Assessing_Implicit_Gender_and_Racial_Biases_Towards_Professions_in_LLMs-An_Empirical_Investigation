The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, creating the unique olfactory cocktail that permeated Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's salon, "Curl Up & Dye."  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Rain lashed against the large picture window overlooking the harbor, blurring the usually vibrant hues of the fishing boats into a muted watercolor. Inside, the warm glow of the salon's art deco lamps cast long shadows across the checkered tile floor. Gen, a woman whose own fiery red hair was a testament to her mastery of color, tapped her foot impatiently, waiting for her 2 pm appointment to arrive. The rhythmic click of her stiletto heel against the tile was the only sound besides the mournful foghorn from the lighthouse out on the point.  A shiver ran down her spine, and it wasn't just from the damp chill seeping in under the door.  Something feltâ€¦off.
