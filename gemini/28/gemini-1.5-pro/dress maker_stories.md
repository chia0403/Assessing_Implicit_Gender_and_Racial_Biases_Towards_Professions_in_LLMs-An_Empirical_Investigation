The clatter of the El train rumbled through the floorboards of Seraphina Moreau's tiny apartment, shaking the mismatched teacups hanging precariously above her sewing machine.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the chaos of her workspace: spools of silk ribbon overflowing baskets, half-finished gowns draped over a rickety dress form, and sketches pinned to every available surface. It was 1923, and Chicago pulsed with a restless energy that seemed to seep into every corner of Seraphina's cramped atelier, nestled above a bakery on the bustling corner of Clark and Diversey.  The scent of yeast and sugar perpetually hung in the air, a sweet counterpoint to the sharp tang of the pins and needles constantly pricking her fingertips.  Seraphina, with her dark bobbed hair and eyes the color of melted chocolate, hummed along to a scratchy Louis Armstrong record, her nimble fingers already coaxing life into a bolt of emerald green silk destined to become a flapper dress for the city's most notorious jazz singer.
