Rain lashed against the grimy window of Silas Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  Neon light from the pawn shop across the street bled through the blinds, painting zebra stripes across the faded floral wallpaper.

The flickering bulb above his desk cast elongated shadows that danced with the swirling cigarette smoke, turning the already cramped space into a cavern of gloom.  The ringing telephone cut through the oppressive silence like a rusty saw blade.
