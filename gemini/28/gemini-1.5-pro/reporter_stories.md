The biting November wind whipped Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of stale beer and frying onions battling for dominance in the frigid air. Greenwich Village, usually buzzing with bohemian energy, seemed subdued tonight, the storefronts shrouded in a pre-Thanksgiving gloom.  Eleanor clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the edges of her notepad digging into her palm. Inside, nestled between half-eaten granola bars and a crumpled pack of cigarettes, lay the crumpled flyer that had lured her out on this unforgiving night: a grainy, photocopied image of a black cat with emerald green eyes above the words "The Whispering Society Meets Tonight." Beneath it, a single address scrawled in shaky handwriting: 13 Carmine Street.  A dead end, most likely.  Another wild goose chase in Eleanor's relentless pursuit of a story that would finally get her out of the "local interest" section of the Village Voice and onto the front page.
