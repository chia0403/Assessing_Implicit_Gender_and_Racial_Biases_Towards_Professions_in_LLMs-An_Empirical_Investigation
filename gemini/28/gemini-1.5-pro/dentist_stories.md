The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled marketplace of Port Blossom, Maine.  Her breath puffed out in frosty plumes, clinging to the air before dissipating against the backdrop of the slate-grey sea. The scent of brine mingled with the sweeter aroma of woodsmoke drifting from the chimneys of the brightly painted clapboard houses that lined the harbor.  Port Blossom, a town clinging to the rocky coastline like a barnacle, was picturesque, even in the encroaching gloom of a late autumn afternoon. Eleanorâ€™s heels clicked rhythmically on the uneven stones, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of gulls overhead. She clutched her satchel tighter, its leather cold against her gloved hand. Inside lay the impressions for Mrs. Gable's new dentures, a particularly tricky case that had occupied her thoughts for most of the day. Eleanor was eager to get back to the warmth of her small practice above the bakery, a space filled with the comforting whir of her drill and the faint, antiseptic smell of dental disinfectant.  But something about the deserted marketplace, the unnatural quiet that had fallen over the normally bustling square, gave her pause.  She stopped, her gaze sweeping over the closed shutters of the fishmonger's, the empty stalls usually overflowing with pumpkins and late-season apples.  It was as if the town itself was holding its breath.
