The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the persistent ache in his own shoulders.  The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center," a modest brick building nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront on Bleaker Street, usually hummed with the low thrum of an ultrasound machine and the gentle clicks of adjusting vertebrae.  But tonight, at 9:17 pm, the only sound was the rhythmic drumming of the downpour and the occasional sigh escaping Elias's lips as he reviewed patient files. The flickering neon sign outside cast an eerie green glow across the empty waiting room, illuminating the slightly worn, but comfortable, armchairs and the overflowing basket of slightly outdated magazines. Bleaker Street, aptly named, lived up to its moniker tonight. The streetlights reflected in the slick asphalt, creating a distorted, watery world outside, a stark contrast to the warm, herbal-scented sanctuary Elias had cultivated within.  He rubbed his temples, wishing heâ€™d gone home hours ago. This last patient, a new case with a mysteriously persistent crick in her neck, had kept him late.  And now, as he locked up, a strange, almost metallic, scraping sound came from the alleyway beside the clinic, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
