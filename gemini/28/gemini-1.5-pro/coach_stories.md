The biting November wind whipped across the deserted bleachers of Harmon Field, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn astroturf, illuminating only Coach Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she surveyed the empty field, the silence broken only by the distant rumble of a passing train. Amy, bundled in a thick parka and a wool beanie pulled low over her ears, clutched a steaming thermos of coffee in her gloved hands.  Harmon Field, home of the struggling Northwood High Ravens, had seen better days.  The faded paint on the scoreboard peeled like sunburnt skin, and the chain-link fence surrounding the field sagged in places, a testament to years of neglect.  This was Amy’s kingdom, a kingdom desperately in need of a miracle.  This season, the Ravens had yet to win a single game, and the weight of their losing streak pressed down on Amy's shoulders like a physical burden.
