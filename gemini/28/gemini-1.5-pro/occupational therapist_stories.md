The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the windowpanes of Eleanor Vance’s small office.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the view of the Olympic Mountains normally framed perfectly by the window.  Eleanor, a registered occupational therapist with a decade of experience under her belt, sighed and rubbed her temples. The salty air always aggravated her migraines, and today was proving no exception. Her office, nestled within the sprawling Evergreen Rehabilitation Center on Bainbridge Island, was usually a haven of calm. Today, however, a low thrum of anxiety seemed to permeate the usually soothing beige walls. The source, she suspected, was the new patient arriving that afternoon: a renowned cellist with a severely injured hand, a precarious recovery timeline, and a reputation for being…difficult.  Eleanor glanced at the clock.  2:57 pm. Three minutes until her life potentially took a dramatic turn, for better or for worse.
