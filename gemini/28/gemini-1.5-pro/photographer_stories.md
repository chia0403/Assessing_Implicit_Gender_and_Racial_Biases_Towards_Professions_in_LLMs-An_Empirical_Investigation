The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Elsie Amelia Cartwright's cheeks and tugging at the edges of her thick wool scarf.  Salt spray kissed the lens of her Hasselblad, blurring the already hazy outline of the Skegness pier in the distance. Grey clouds, heavy with unshed rain, pressed low over the Lincolnshire coast, mirroring the muted colours of the deserted beach.  It was November, a time when even the hardiest of holidaymakers abandoned this windswept stretch of England, leaving only the cry of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves for company.  Elsie, however, thrived in this desolate beauty.  She saw a stark poetry in the skeletal remains of summer attractions, in the weathered faces of the fishermen's cottages huddled against the elements, and in the endless, restless expanse of the sea.  This wasn't just a photograph; it was a story waiting to be told.
