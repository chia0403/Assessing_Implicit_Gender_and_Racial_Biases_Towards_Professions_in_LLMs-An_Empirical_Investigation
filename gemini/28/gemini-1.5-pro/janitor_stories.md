The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech labs hummed a lonely tune, reflecting off the sterile, polished floors.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the oversized windows that offered a panoramic view of a city shrouded in pre-dawn gloom. Inside, the air was thick with the lingering scent of bleach and something faintly metallic, a smell Elias Thorne had grown accustomed to over his fifteen years as the building's night janitor.  He pushed his mop bucket across the gleaming white tiles of Lab 4, the squeak of its wheels a counterpoint to the rhythmic swish-swash of his mop. Elias, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform,  sighed, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the empty lab.  Tonight, like most nights, he was alone, his only company the ghosts of scientific breakthroughs and failed experiments that clung to the air like the persistent odor of disinfectant.  But tonight, something felt different.  A low hum, distinct from the usual electrical thrum of the building, vibrated beneath his feet.
