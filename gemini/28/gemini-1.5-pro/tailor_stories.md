The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, the cries of street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present aroma of coal smoke and brewing coffee formed the symphony of Elias Thorne's mornings. His small tailor shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually gloomy pawnbroker's on Grimshaw Lane, was his sanctuary.  The year was 1888, and the fog, a familiar blanket across London, clung to the gaslit streets, muting the vibrant colours of the fabrics draped across Elias's window display.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint, sweet perfume of lavender Elias used to deter moths. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windowpanes, illuminated the organized chaos of his workroom: spools of thread in every imaginable hue, half-finished garments draped over mannequins, and a worn leather-bound ledger open on his cluttered desk.  Elias, a man of precise movements and quiet contemplation, stood hunched over his workbench, meticulously stitching the sleeve of a gentleman's coat.  The only sound, aside from the muted roar of the city beyond, was the rhythmic click of his needle, a sound as familiar and comforting to him as his own heartbeat.
