The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheek as she wrestled a "For Sale" sign into the unforgiving sand.  The wind, a constant, restless presence on the desolate stretch of beach known as Whispering Sands, whipped her auburn hair across her face, temporarily blinding her.  Behind her, perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling cliff, stood the property: Saltwind House. A three-story Victorian relic, its peeling paint the colour of seafoam and regret, it stared out at the churning Atlantic.  It had been on the market for two years, a testament to its remote location, exorbitant price, and the unsettling rumours that clung to it like the ever-present fog. Amelia, however, saw not a crumbling ruin, but potential. A blank canvas on which to paint a masterpiece of a sale, a triumph that would finally cement her reputation in the notoriously cutthroat coastal real estate market of Port Blossom, Maine.  This sale, she knew, would make her.  Or break her.
