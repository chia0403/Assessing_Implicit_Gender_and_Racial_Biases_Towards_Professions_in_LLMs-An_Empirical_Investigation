The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the turquoise paint until it radiated heat like a furnace.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," living up to its name this sweltering July afternoon.  Inside, with the AC struggling against the oppressive heat,  Delilah "Del"  Rodriguez wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, her hand leaving a streak of grime across her forehead.  The CB radio crackled with static punctuated by the occasional drawl of a fellow trucker miles away.  Del adjusted her mirrored aviators and squinted at the endless stretch of road ahead, the shimmering heat haze making the horizon wobble.  Her destination: Eureka, Nevada, a town smaller than the truck stop she'd just left behind.  The cargo: a load of antique slot machines destined for a newly renovated casino.  Del hoped they paid well; this leg of the trip was already shaping up to be more trouble than it was worth.
