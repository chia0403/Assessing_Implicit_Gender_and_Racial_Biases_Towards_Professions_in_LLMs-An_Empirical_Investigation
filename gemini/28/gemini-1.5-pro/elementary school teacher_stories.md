The insistent clang of the old school bell, a sound Amelia Grace Hawthorne had once found charmingly rustic, now grated on her nerves like chalk on a blackboard.  Rain lashed against the tall windows of her classroom, blurring the already fading autumn colours of the Vermont woods beyond. Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Havenwood, was usually a picture of idyllic New England charm. Today, however, it felt more like a gothic prison.  The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient windowpanes, and the persistent drizzle had turned the playground into a muddy swamp. Inside, the air crackled with the restless energy of twenty-seven third-graders, trapped indoors by the inclement weather.  Amelia, her usually bright smile a little strained, surveyed the chaos with a sigh. This was going to be a long afternoon.
