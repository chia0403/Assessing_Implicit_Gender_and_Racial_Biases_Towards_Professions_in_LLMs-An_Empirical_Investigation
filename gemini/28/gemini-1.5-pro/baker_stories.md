The aroma of burnt sugar and simmering plums hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume clinging to the brick walls of "The Gilded Crust."  Rain lashed against the bakery’s large front window, blurring the view of the cobbled Gaslamp Quarter streets outside.

The warm yellow glow of the overhead lamps illuminated the flour dusting her apron and the stray strands of auburn hair escaping her braid. It was late, much later than Amelia usually worked, but the annual Plum Pudding Festival was only two days away, and she had a reputation to uphold – the reputation for baking the best darn plum pudding in all of New Birmingham.
