The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked streets of downtown Grimsborough. Inside, amidst the scent of hairspray and anticipation, Elias Thorne, his name stitched in elegant cursive on the pocket of his crisp white shirt, surveyed his domain.  The salon was a study in contrasts: chrome and glass juxtaposed with warm, dark wood, sleek modern chairs offset by ornate, gilded mirrors. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the city lights into a kaleidoscope of colours. It was a Thursday night, usually quiet, but tonight, a strange tension hung in the air, thick as the humidity clinging to Elias's perfectly styled dark hair.
