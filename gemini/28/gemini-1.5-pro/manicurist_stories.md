The humid Miami air hung thick and sweet, scented with hibiscus and exhaust fumes.  Inside "Nailed It," the tiny salon sandwiched between a laundromat and a botanica, the whir of electric nail files buzzed like trapped cicadas.  Elena Maria Rodriguez, her name embroidered in looping cursive on her crisp white uniform, leaned over a client's hand, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously painted a tiny flamingo onto a pale pink nail.  Sunlight, fractured by the palm trees lining the street outside, splashed across the linoleum floor in shifting patterns.  The radio, tuned to a salsa station, pulsed with a frenetic energy that mirrored the city itself.  It was a Thursday afternoon, the kind that promised thunderstorms later, but for now, the world outside Nailed It felt a million miles away.  Inside, it was all the click of acrylics, the gentle scrape of files, and the low murmur of conversation â€“ a haven of perfectly polished order in the chaotic sprawl of Little Havana.
