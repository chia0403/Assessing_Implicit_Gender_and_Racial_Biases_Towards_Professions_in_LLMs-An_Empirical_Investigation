Tonight, the ancient stones seemed to radiate an almost palpable chill, a premonition of the difficult surgery that awaited him. The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the courtyard, transforming the familiar space into something unsettling, almost sinister.  Inside, the warm glow emanating from the operating theatre windows beckoned, a stark contrast to the encroaching darkness.  Elias pulled his coat tighter around him and pushed through the heavy oak doors, the scent of antiseptic and impending drama washing over him.
