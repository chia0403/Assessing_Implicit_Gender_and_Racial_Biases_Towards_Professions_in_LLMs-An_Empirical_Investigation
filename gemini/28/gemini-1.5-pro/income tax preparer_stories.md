The stale scent of cheap coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Amelia Prescott's office, a cramped space sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery on Bleaker Street.  Amelia herself, a woman whose practical brown bob and sensible cardigan did little to disguise the sharp intelligence in her hazel eyes, was hunched over a mountain of 1040 forms. Outside, the February sky over Chicago was a bruised, gunmetal gray, spitting a mixture of sleet and icy rain that mirrored the general mood of her clientele. Tax season was in full swing, and for Amelia Prescott, CPA, that meant navigating a minefield of questionable deductions, forgotten W-2s, and the occasional tearful confession of a gambling addiction.  This year, however, something felt…different.  A prickle of unease ran down Amelia’s spine, a feeling she usually associated with audits from the IRS, not the steady stream of harried taxpayers filing through her door.  Little did she know, this tax season was about to become a whole lot more complicated than just calculating deductions.
