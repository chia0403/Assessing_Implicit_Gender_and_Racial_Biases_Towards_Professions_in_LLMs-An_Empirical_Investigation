The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee, punctuated by the rhythmic sizzle of the grill and the clatter of mismatched cutlery.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, sighed, tucking a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, and the Starlight, usually bustling with late-night theatregoers and NYU students, was eerily quiet.  Only two occupied booths dotted the vinyl landscape, their occupants hunched over half-eaten plates of fries and lukewarm coffee. Eleanor leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup with a stained dishrag, the boredom a palpable weight settling in her bones. Outside, the rain continued to fall, a steady, melancholic rhythm that mirrored the dull ache in her heart.  She had dreams, big ones, that extended far beyond the chipped Formica countertops and sticky menus of the Starlight. But tonight, those dreams felt as distant and improbable as the stars twinkling faintly beyond the city's luminous haze.
