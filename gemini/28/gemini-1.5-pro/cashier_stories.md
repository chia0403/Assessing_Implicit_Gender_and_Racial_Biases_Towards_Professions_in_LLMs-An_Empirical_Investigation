The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, 24/7, cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Reyesâ€™s tired face.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour in this particular corner of Bakersfield, California, where the only sounds were the hum of the refrigerators and the occasional rumble of a passing semi-truck on Highway 99.  Amelia, nametag slightly askew, leaned against the counter, idly spinning a keychain with a miniature plastic burrito attached. The linoleum floor was sticky, smelling faintly of spilled soda and despair.  Outside, the desert stretched out, vast and indifferent, under a sky dusted with a million uncaring stars. This was Amelia's kingdom, her fluorescent-lit fiefdom, and tonight, it felt especially desolate.
