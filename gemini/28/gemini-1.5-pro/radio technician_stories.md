The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal girders of the half-constructed radio tower, rattling the loose cables like skeletal fingers drumming a nervous rhythm.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her breath clouding in the frigid air, cinched her thick parka tighter and adjusted the hardhat perched precariously on her head.  Below, the small town of Alder’s Bend, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, looked like a scattering of gingerbread houses dusted with icing sugar, the first snowfall of the season having arrived overnight.  Amy squinted at the intricate web of wires and antennae that crowned the tower, a metal behemoth that seemed to pierce the very sky. This was her canvas, her symphony, her Frankenstein’s monster – the KABE-FM transmitter, and she was determined to bring it to life before Thanksgiving, even if it meant wrestling with frozen coaxial cables and battling gale-force winds at two thousand feet.
