The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the November wind gusted in, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from conditioning hydrangeas, glanced up from her work.  The shop, nestled between a dusty antique store and a perpetually bustling bakery on Oak Street, was a haven of warmth and vibrant color against the gray backdrop of the approaching winter.  Sunlight, weak but persistent, filtered through the large front window, illuminating the rows of buckets overflowing with roses, lilies, and chrysanthemums.  A faint scent of cinnamon, courtesy of the bakery next door, mingled with the perfume of the flowers, creating a comforting, almost festive atmosphere, despite Eliza Jane's lingering sense of unease. This November felt different. Colder. Quieter.  Like something was waiting just around the corner.
