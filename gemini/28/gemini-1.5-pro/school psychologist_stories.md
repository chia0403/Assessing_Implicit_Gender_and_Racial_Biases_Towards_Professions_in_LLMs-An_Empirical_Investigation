The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he climbed the worn steps of Crestwood High. Dead leaves, the color of burnt toffee, swirled around his ankles.  Above him, the school loomed, a hulking brick edifice that seemed to absorb the weak afternoon sunlight rather than reflect it. Crestwood was perched on the edge of Hollow Creek, a once-thriving mill town now clinging to the frayed edges of its former glory. The textile mill, the town's lifeblood, had closed a decade ago, leaving behind economic stagnation and a palpable sense of despair that permeated even the crisp autumn air.  Elias, new to both the town and the school, pulled his threadbare coat tighter around him, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach. He hadn't expected Hollow Creek to feel quite soâ€¦ desolate.  He clutched his briefcase, containing the files of the students he was scheduled to meet today, each one a small window into the complex web of anxieties and struggles hidden beneath the town's quiet surface.
