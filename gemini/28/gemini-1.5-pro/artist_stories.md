The biting November wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The view from her attic studio, usually a panorama of the vibrant Portobello Road Market in London, was today a blur of dripping canvas awnings and hunched, hurrying figures. Amelia, clad in a paint-splattered smock over a threadbare jumper, ignored the dismal weather.  Her focus was entirely consumed by the canvas in front of her, a half-finished portrait of a wizened old bookseller she'd met down the street. His face, etched with a thousand stories, was slowly emerging from the chaos of burnt umber and cadmium yellow, his kind eyes twinkling even in their two-dimensional form. The cramped attic room, with its sloping ceiling and exposed beams, was a haven of creative clutter. Tubes of paint lay scattered across a battered wooden table, brushes bristled from jam jars filled with turpentine, and canvases, both finished and blank, leaned against the walls like silent observers.  The air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and the faintest hint of woodsmoke drifting up from the fireplace below.  This chaotic space, tucked away above the bustling market, was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary, her world.
