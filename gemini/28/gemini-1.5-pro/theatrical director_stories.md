The chipped porcelain cherub dangling from the flickering gas lamp cast a jaundiced glow over Elias Thorne, his face a mask of theatrical exhaustion. It was half-past midnight in the cavernous belly of the Grand Majestic Theatre, Chicago, 1923. Dust motes danced in the weak light, disturbed by the rustle of Elias's worn script as he flipped through its dog-eared pages.  The ornate, gilded theatre, usually brimming with the intoxicating perfume of anticipation and expensive cigars, now smelled only of damp velvet and the faint metallic tang of approaching snow.  Outside, a wind howled, rattling the metal fire escape like a skeleton trying to break free.  Elias, oblivious to the chill seeping through the drafty walls, muttered lines under his breath, his brow furrowed in a perpetual knot of creative anxiety. The premiere of his daring, avant-garde adaptation of "Hamlet" was a mere week away, and the weight of expectation pressed upon him like a physical burden. He was gambling everything on this production, his reputation, his meagre savings, and perhaps, most importantly, his sanity.
