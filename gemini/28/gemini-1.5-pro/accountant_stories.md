The damp chill of a London November seeped through the ill-fitting window of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, prickling the skin on her arms despite the threadbare cardigan she wore over her blouse.  Rain lashed against the grimy panes, blurring the already dismal view of Charing Cross Road below.

It was 5:57 pm, precisely three minutes before she habitually locked up her cramped office above Higgins & Sons Booksellers, a dusty labyrinth of forgotten tomes and the faint, perpetual scent of aging paper.  Her world was one of meticulous order: balanced ledgers, reconciled accounts, and the comforting predictability of debits and credits.  But tonight, something felt decidedly off-balance.
