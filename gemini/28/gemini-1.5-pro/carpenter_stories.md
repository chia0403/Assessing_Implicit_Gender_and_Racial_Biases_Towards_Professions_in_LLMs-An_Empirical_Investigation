The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elms lining Sycamore Street, whistling a mournful tune as it snaked down the collar of Elias Thorne's worn wool coat.  Sawdust, clinging stubbornly to the fabric like a second skin, offered little insulation against the encroaching cold. Elias, his breath puffing out in ghostly white plumes, tightened his grip on the toolbox he carried, its metal handle frigid against his calloused fingers.  He paused before number 17, a grand but dilapidated Victorian house, its peeling paint the color of a bruised plum.  A faded "For Sale" sign creaked rhythmically on the porch, a testament to the property's prolonged vacancy.  The gingerbread trim, once intricate and proud, now sagged with neglect, and several of the stained-glass windows were cracked, like the weary eyes of an old man.  This was Elias’s latest project, a restoration job he’d taken on with a mixture of trepidation and excitement. The house whispered of forgotten stories, and Elias, a carpenter with a keen sense for history embedded in the wood he worked with, felt a pull towards its secrets. He had a feeling this house held more than just rotted floorboards and leaky roofs.
