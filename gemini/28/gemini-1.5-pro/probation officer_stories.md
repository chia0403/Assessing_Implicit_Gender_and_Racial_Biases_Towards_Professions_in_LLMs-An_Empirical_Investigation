The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Grace "Amy" Rodriguez as she navigated her battered Corolla through the labyrinthine streets of Little Havana, Miami.  Mangoes hung heavy and ripe from the trees lining the sidewalks, their sweetness a stark contrast to the acrid smell of exhaust fumes and the simmering tension that always seemed to permeate the air.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted her oversized sunglasses and sighed.  It was already pushing ninety degrees at 9:00 AM, and her first appointment of the day, with a repeat offender named Rafael "Razor" Vargas, promised to be anything but refreshing. Razor’s file, a thick compendium of petty theft, assault, and drug possession charges, sat on the passenger seat, its weight a physical manifestation of the challenges she faced every day as a probation officer in one of Miami’s most volatile neighborhoods. The faded stucco buildings, vibrant murals, and pulsating rhythm of salsa spilling from open doorways hid a complex web of gang activity, poverty, and desperation, and Amy, despite her five years on the job, still felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach every time she stepped out of her car.  This morning, that knot was pulling particularly tight.
