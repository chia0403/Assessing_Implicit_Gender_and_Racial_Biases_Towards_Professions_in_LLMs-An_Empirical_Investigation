The revolving door of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed with every rotation, exhaling gusts of frigid January air into the opulent lobby.  Snow dusted the shoulders of the arriving guests, sparkling like crushed diamonds under the crystal chandeliers. Elias Finch, a bellhop of slight build but considerable charm, straightened his crimson uniform and offered a practiced smile.  He'd been at the Majestic for five years, long enough to know the regulars' preferred newspapers and the precise angle to hold the door for maximum tip potential.  Tonight, however, a strange energy crackled in the air, a premonition of something unusual â€“ something beyond the usual flurry of check-ins and misplaced luggage.  The lobby, typically a symphony of hushed conversations and the tinkling of ice in crystal glasses, held a subtle tension, a stillness like the moment before a thunderstorm.  The scent of pine from the enormous Christmas tree, usually comforting, tonight seemed laced with something...unsettling.
