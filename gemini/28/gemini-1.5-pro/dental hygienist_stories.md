The insistent Vermont wind rattled the paned windows of Dr. Finch’s Family Dentistry, whistling a mournful tune that seemed to seep into Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s bones.  Ice crusted the edges of the parking lot, reflecting the weak January sun in blinding flashes.  Inside, the air hung thick with the medicinal tang of fluoride and the faint, metallic scent Amelia always associated with nervous patients.  She adjusted the crisp, robin’s-egg blue scrubs she wore, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the examination room.  This Monday morning felt particularly bleak, even for a January in Bellows Falls, a small town nestled between the Green Mountains and the Connecticut River, a place where everyone knew your name and the gossip traveled faster than the icy gusts outside.  Amelia sighed, picking up a sterilized scaler, its sharp edge glinting under the fluorescent lights. She hoped today wouldn’t bring any surprises – chipped teeth from weekend hockey games or, worse, a sudden influx of emergency root canals. This small-town practice might be quiet, but it had its share of dental dramas.
