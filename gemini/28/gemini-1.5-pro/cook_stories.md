The clatter of pans, the sizzle of butter, the fragrant steam of rosemary and garlic – these were the sounds that composed Amelia "Amy" Dubois' symphony.  Her kitchen, tucked into the back corner of the Salty Squid, a weathered seafood shack perched precariously on the edge of the Oregon coast, wasn't much to look at.  Cracked linoleum, mismatched chairs scavenged from yard sales, and salt spray etched onto the windows like frosted lace, it was a far cry from the gleaming stainless steel temples of celebrity chefs. But for Amy, it was a sanctuary.  Outside, the November wind howled, whipping the grey Pacific into a frenzy and rattling the lobster traps stacked against the shack.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon.  Inside, however, a warm, golden glow emanated from the ancient gas stove, illuminating Amy's face as she meticulously chopped fresh chives. Tonight’s special was her grandmother's cioppino, a rich, fragrant stew that held the warmth of generations past and the promise of comfort against the raging storm.
