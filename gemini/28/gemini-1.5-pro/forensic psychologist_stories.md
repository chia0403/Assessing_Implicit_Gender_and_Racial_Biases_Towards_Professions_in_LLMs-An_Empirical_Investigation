The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark hair across his face as he stepped out of the cab, the city lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of fractured brilliance against the pre-dawn gloom.  Gotham, ever restless, hummed with a low thrum of activity even at this ungodly hour.  Rain slicked the grimy streets of the Narrows, reflecting the neon signs of all-night diners and pawn shops back at him with an oily sheen.  Elias adjusted his collar, the damp chill seeping into his wool coat despite its thickness.  He was standing before the Gotham City Morgue, a squat, brutalist structure that seemed to exude an aura of quiet despair. The harsh fluorescent light spilling from a single window on the second floor cast a sickly yellow glow that painted the scene in unsettling hues.  Tonight, or rather, this morning, promised to be particularly grim.  A triple homicide, they'd said.  And the calling card left at the scene suggested the work of someone Elias knew all too well – someone he hoped he’d never have to face again.
