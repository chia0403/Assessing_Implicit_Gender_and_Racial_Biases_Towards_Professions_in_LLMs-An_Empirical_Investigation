Rain lashed against the attic windows of Windhaven Cottage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of Elias Thornecroft's heart.  Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee across the desolate Yorkshire moors, rattling the ancient eaves and whipping the bare branches of the lone hawthorn tree that stood sentinel over the property.  Inside, huddled in a threadbare armchair beneath the weak glow of a single desk lamp, Elias clutched a crumpled manuscript, the ink smeared by the nervous sweat clinging to his palms. Windhaven, purchased with the modest advance from his first and only published novel, *The Shadow of the Spire*, had become less a sanctuary and more a prison.  Three years had passed since its publication, three years of crippling writer's block, three years spent staring at the blank page, the words refusing to flow, the stories trapped within him like butterflies struggling against a glass jar. The looming deadline for his second book, a gothic thriller titled *The Whispering Fells*, hung over him like a guillotine, its sharp edge glinting in the flickering lamplight.
