The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled a recalcitrant sample book of Italian silks out of her oversized tote bag.  Auburn leaves, the color of burnt caramel, swirled around her ankles on the cobblestone walkway leading to the imposing wrought-iron gates of Eventide Manor.  Perched atop a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the Puget Sound, the manor, a sprawling Victorian relic, looked more suited to a gothic novel than a seaside retreat.  Its gables and turrets were draped in creeping ivy, and a single, flickering gas lamp cast long, eerie shadows across the manicured lawns.  Eleanor, usually unfazed by architectural challenges, felt a shiver crawl up her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.
