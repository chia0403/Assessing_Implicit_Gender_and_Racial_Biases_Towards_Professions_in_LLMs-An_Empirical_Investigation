## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent hum of the office was a constant, irritating drone, a soundtrack to the January tax rush that hammered at Agnes Bartholomew's sanity like a persistent woodpecker. She hadn't seen daylight in what felt like days, fueled instead by lukewarm coffee and the grim determination to finish just *one* more Schedule C. Across her desk, Mrs. Higgins, a kindly woman with a perpetually worried expression and a carrier bag overflowing with receipts, was currently explaining, for the fifth time, how her prize-winning begonias qualified as a "necessary business expense." Agnes pinched the bridge of her nose. This was it. This was the year she finally cracked. She'd run away to the Alaskan wilderness and live amongst the bears, exchanging spreadsheets for salmon and W-2s for wildlife.

**Setting:**

The setting is the cramped and chaotic office of "Bartholomew & Sons, Income Tax Specialists," located on the second floor of a tired-looking brick building in the small, Midwestern town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The decor is a mishmash of well-intentioned but outdated choices: dusty artificial ferns perched precariously on filing cabinets, motivational posters featuring stock photos of majestic mountains (presumably meant to inspire Agnes and her colleagues, rather than mock their sedentary existence), and walls painted a shade of beige so generic it could be classified as "Government Issue Neutral."

The office consists of three small cubicles, each overflowing with paperwork and surrounded by stacks of tax preparation manuals dating back to the Reagan administration. Agnes’ cubicle, the largest, is distinguished by a framed, slightly faded photograph of her late father, the original "Bartholomew" of Bartholomew & Sons, gazing benevolently from his perch above a mountain of 1040s. The air is thick with the scent of stale coffee, toner cartridges, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Higgins’ potent, home-grown begonias. A perpetually malfunctioning printer spits out documents with a rhythmic, agonizing groan, serving as a constant reminder of the impending deadline.
