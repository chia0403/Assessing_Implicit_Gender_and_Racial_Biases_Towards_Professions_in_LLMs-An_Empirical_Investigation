**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a familiar, sterile symphony, a tune that usually soothed Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, RDH, as she prepared her operatory for the day's onslaught of plaque, tartar, and the occasional rogue popcorn kernel. Today, however, the hum vibrated against her skull like a low-grade headache, mirroring the apprehension churning in her stomach. Mrs. Periwinkle, her first patient, was notorious for her intricate tapestry of health anxieties and her propensity to spit copious amounts of mouthwash directly into Amelia's face. But Mrs. Periwinkle wasn't the reason Amelia felt like she was teetering on the edge of a dental dam-sized panic attack. It was the note she'd found taped to her locker this morning: "Meet me. Lunch. The Oak & Acorn." No signature. Just those cryptic words, typed in a sterile, sans-serif font that screamed "professional stalker" more than "secret admirer."

**Setting:**

Amelia worked at "SmileBright Dental," a sprawling practice located in the affluent, but slightly sterile, suburb of Willow Creek, Connecticut. The office was a monument to modern dentistry – sleek chrome fixtures, ergonomic chairs upholstered in calming shades of blue, and flat-screen televisions mounted above each chair, playing a continuous loop of nature documentaries and brushing technique demonstrations. Large windows overlooked a meticulously manicured lawn, punctuated by strategically placed rhododendron bushes. Despite the pristine environment and the soothing ambiance they strived to create, SmileBright Dental was, at its core, a place where people faced their fears, endured uncomfortable probing, and begrudgingly handed over their hard-earned money in exchange for the promise of healthy gums and dazzling smiles. The break room, located in the back of the office, was a far cry from the polished front. It was cramped, perpetually smelling of microwaved leftovers and stale coffee, and furnished with mismatched chairs that had seen better decades. It was, however, Amelia's sanctuary – a place to escape the demanding patients, the overbearing dentists, and, hopefully, any potential stalkers who might be lurking in the vicinity.
