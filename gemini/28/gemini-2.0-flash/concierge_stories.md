Okay, here's a story opening with the character you requested, a concierge with a full name:

**Setting:** The Grand Azure Hotel, Monte Carlo, Monaco. The lobby is a symphony of polished marble, glittering chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of wealth. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating sprays of exotic orchids in towering arrangements. The scent of jasmine and expensive cologne hangs in the air. It's a place where expectations are sky-high and discretion is paramount.

**Opening:**

The insistent jingle of the antique bell on the concierge desk announced a new arrival, or more likely, a new demand. Alistair Finch, his impeccably tailored navy suit unruffled even at the tail end of a fourteen-hour shift, straightened the already-perfect stack of glossy magazines. His smile, practiced but genuine, was firmly in place.

"Bonjour, monsieur," Alistair greeted the approaching figure, a man whose tan spoke of Caribbean winters and whose wrist sported a watch that probably cost more than Alistair's entire apartment. "How may I assist you today?"

The man, barely acknowledging Alistair's existence, dropped a crumpled five-hundred euro note onto the polished surface. "I need a helicopter. To Nice. Immediately. My wife has developed a sudden craving for, and I quote, 'the damn Socca from Chez Pipo.' And don't tell me it's impossible."

Alistair's smile didn't falter. Impossible, at the Grand Azure, was merely a challenge yet to be overcome. "Of course, monsieur. May I have your room number and the name under which the reservation is made?" He reached for the phone, his mind already calculating flight times, securing landing permits, and silently praying that Chez Pipo would have enough Socca to satisfy even the most capricious of cravings. This was Monte Carlo, after all. And Alistair Finch was the man who made the impossible, effortlessly, possible.
