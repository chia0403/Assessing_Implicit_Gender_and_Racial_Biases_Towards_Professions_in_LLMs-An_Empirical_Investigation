## Story Opening:

The morning sun, a bleary, orange eye peering over the jagged teeth of the Cascade Mountains, threatened to burn away the lingering tendrils of fog clinging to the valley floor. For Elias Thorne, however, it was more of a promise than a threat. It meant another day wrestling with the earth, another dayâ€™s pay edging him closer to finally fixing that goddamn leaky roof back home.

He coughed, the rasp echoing in the pre-dawn stillness, and spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the dust that already coated the running board of his Dodge Ram pickup. Elias stretched, cracking his spine with a series of pops that sounded like small-caliber gunfire, and glanced at the thermos sitting on the passenger seat. Black coffee, strong enough to peel paint. Just what he needed.

He hopped down, the worn leather of his work boots hitting the gravel with a satisfying crunch, and made his way towards the leviathan that awaited him: a hulking, Caterpillar D11T dozer, its yellow paint dulled by years of hard labor. It sat silent and expectant, like a slumbering beast, in the heart of the sprawling construction site.

## Setting:

The setting is a sprawling, mountainous region in Central Washington state, specifically a new highway construction site snaking its way through the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The air is thick with the scent of pine, diesel fumes, and freshly turned earth. The ground is a chaotic mix of raw rock, loose soil, and patches of stubborn scrub brush. Bulldozers, excavators, and dump trucks crisscross the landscape, a mechanical ballet of noise and dust. A small, ramshackle trailer, serving as the site office and break room, sits precariously perched on a leveled patch of ground, a testament to the ongoing struggle to tame the wild terrain. The surrounding mountains are heavily forested, offering stunning, if sometimes melancholic, views of the vast wilderness that will soon be forever altered by this ambitious construction project. The time of year is late spring, with unpredictable weather ranging from bright, sunny days to sudden, torrential downpours.
