Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dentist named Alistair Reginald Finch:

**Opening:**

The persistent hum of the dental drill, usually a soporific lullaby to his patients, grated on Dr. Alistair Reginald Finch's nerves like chalk on a blackboard. It wasn't the sound itself, per se, but the cacophony that followed its cessation: the wet gurgle of rinsing, the hesitant suction, the inevitable… *the sigh*. Each sigh was a tiny hammer blow to Alistair's already fraying sanity. He hated sighs. They were loaded with unspoken criticism. *“Was it necessary to drill quite so deep, Doctor? Did you have to use the big one?”* Of course, no one ever *said* that. They just sighed, letting their discomfort hang heavy in the sterile air of his practice.

This particular sigh belonged to Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose molars had survived two World Wars and a disastrous marriage, and were now staging a full-scale rebellion against the encroaching forces of time. Alistair carefully removed his mask, trying to project an aura of calm expertise despite the internal turmoil.

"Alright, Mrs. Higgins, how does that feel?" he asked, his voice meticulously even.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the quaint, slightly decaying seaside town of Seabreeze, Maine. Alistair's dental practice, "Finch Family Dentistry," is located in a converted Victorian house on Main Street. The exterior is painted a cheerful, if somewhat faded, sky blue, with white trim and a small, meticulously kept garden bursting with hydrangeas in the summer. Inside, the waiting room is a curious mix of seaside charm and dental practicality. Nautical prints featuring lighthouses and schooners adorn the walls, competing for attention with pamphlets on proper flossing techniques and anatomical charts of the human mouth. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic and the faint, lingering aroma of bubblegum-flavored fluoride treatments.

The examination rooms are modern and well-equipped, but retain a certain old-fashioned feel, thanks to the antique dental chair in Alistair's favorite room (which he swears is more comfortable than the new ergonomic models) and the framed diploma from the esteemed "Harvard School of Dental Medicine" hanging slightly askew on the wall. The view from the windows offers a glimpse of the choppy Atlantic Ocean, a constant reminder of the unforgiving power of nature, and, unfortunately, the occasional seagull looking to make a deposit on his patients' car windshields.
