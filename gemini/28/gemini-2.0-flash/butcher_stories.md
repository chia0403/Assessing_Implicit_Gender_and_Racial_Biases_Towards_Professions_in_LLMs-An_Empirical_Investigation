The air hung thick with the aroma of sawdust, rendered fat, and something vaguely metallic – the comforting, if somewhat morbid, perfume of Edgar Thomas Willoughby’s life. He was knee-deep in it, quite literally, as he hoisted a quarter of beef onto the steel table with a grunt. The early morning sun, a pale smear behind the grime-coated windows of Willoughby & Son's Meats, cast long, distorted shadows across the shop.

Willoughby & Son's wasn't actually a 'son' situation anymore. Edgar's father, Thomas (hence the name), had passed on some twenty years ago, leaving Edgar to inherit not just the butcher shop on Bleecker Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, but also the legacy of meticulous craftsmanship and a clientele fiercely loyal to its traditions. The Village was changing, of course. The old Italian families were thinning out, replaced by wide-eyed tourists and college students craving artisanal coffee and Instagrammable everything. But Willoughby's, with its handwritten price tags and stubborn refusal to accept anything but cash, remained an anchor, a meaty testament to a bygone era.

Edgar, a man whose face was as ruddy and weathered as the oak chopping block he'd inherited, wiped his brow with the back of a hand already stained crimson. He surveyed the cut of beef, his expert eyes tracing the marbling, assessing its texture. Today was Wednesday. Wednesday was for brisket. And this brisket, he knew, would become the foundation for Mrs. Rosenblatt's famous corned beef, a recipe she'd fiercely guarded for over fifty years. He reached for his trusty boning knife, its handle worn smooth from years of use, and began to work.
