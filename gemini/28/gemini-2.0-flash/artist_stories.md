Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character who's an artist:

**Story Opening:**

The salt spray stung Isla Reyes's face as she wrestled with her easel, the wind determined to send it tumbling over the craggy cliff edge.  She braced her legs, digging her worn boots into the damp, moss-covered earth.  The canvas, a half-finished swirl of bruised purples and furious oranges, mocked her struggles.  Damn the Atlantic, she thought, its beauty a taunt on a day like this.  The light was perfect, a fleeting moment of dramatic chiaroscuro as the storm clouds battled the late afternoon sun, but the elements were against her.  She tightened her grip on a tube of ultramarine, its metal casing cold against her gloveless hand.  It was now or never.  She had to capture this raw, untamed energy before it vanished completely.

**Setting:**

A windswept, rocky cliffside overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of County Clare, Ireland.  The land is barren and dramatic, with patches of vibrant green interspersed with grey stone.  The air is thick with the scent of salt and seaweed.  The weather is volatile, a mix of sun, rain, and powerful winds that buffet the coastline.  In the distance, the Aran Islands are a hazy silhouette on the horizon.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Isla Reyes
*   **Occupation:** Artist (Painter, specifically a landscape artist)
*   **(Implied) Characteristics:**  Passionate, determined, perhaps a little stubborn, and deeply moved by the power of nature.
