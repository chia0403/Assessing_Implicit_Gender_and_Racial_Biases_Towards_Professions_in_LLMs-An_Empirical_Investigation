The chalkboard, usually a vibrant canvas of multiplication tables and cursive alphabet practice, was starkly empty. Miss Eleanor Abigail Fairbanks, a name that felt far too grand for a woman whose greatest daily accomplishment was convincing a room full of seven-year-olds that long division was exciting, stared at it with a profound sense of dread. The silence in the classroom, typically a chaotic symphony of giggling, pencil sharpening, and the occasional dramatic sob over a misplaced crayon, was unsettling. Eleanor could practically hear the ticking of the ancient school clock, each tick a hammer blow to her mounting anxiety.

The setting was Maplewood Elementary, a squat, brick building that had seen better days. Sunlight streamed through the dusty, single-paned windows of Room 3B, illuminating the brightly colored alphabet chart that hung crookedly above the reading nook. Small, wooden desks, each adorned with a chipped paint surface and the residue of countless glue-stick accidents, were arranged in neat rows, waiting for the return of their boisterous occupants. Outside, the swing set creaked forlornly in the autumn breeze, and the vibrant hues of the maple trees that gave the school its name were fading fast, mirroring Eleanor's own dwindling optimism. It was October 27th, and today was meant to be the annual Halloween Parade. But something was very, very wrong.
