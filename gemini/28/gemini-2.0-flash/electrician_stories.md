Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an electrician named Elara Vance:

**Setting:** The story opens in the small, perpetually damp coastal town of Oakhaven, Oregon. Nestled between the turbulent Pacific Ocean and a dense, brooding forest, Oakhaven feels perpetually trapped in a sepia-toned photograph. Salt spray coats everything, blurring the edges of the brightly painted Victorian houses that cling to the steep hillside. The air hangs thick with the scent of brine, decaying seaweed, and the ever-present aroma of woodsmoke from the chimneys of houses struggling against the persistent chill. Winter has a particularly brutal grip, but even in the peak of summer, a heavy fog can roll in without warning, swallowing the town whole and leaving only the mournful cry of the foghorn to pierce the silence.

**Story Opening:**

Elara Vance, her breath misting in the pre-dawn air, slammed the back door of her rusted-out pickup truck with a frustrated groan. Another call-out. Another elderly resident convinced their wiring was possessed by demons, or, more likely, just corroded by years of neglect and the relentless damp of Oakhaven. Elara tugged her wool beanie lower, its bright orange a stark contrast to the muted palette of the town. She hadn't even finished her coffee.

The address scrawled on the crumpled work order led her to a towering, gothic-revival house perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning sea. "The Blackwood Manor," the locals called it, though Elara knew old Mrs. Hawthorne, the last living member of the Hawthorne family, still stubbornly clung to it. A single, flickering light pulsed weakly from a third-story window, like a dying firefly. Elara shivered, not entirely from the cold. The Blackwood Manor had a reputation, a reputation whispered in hushed tones over steaming mugs of coffee at the Oakhaven Diner. A reputation for strange occurrences, unexplained shadows, and a lineage steeped in local lore.

She grabbed her heavy-duty toolbox, the metal cold against her gloved hands. "Alright, Blackwood Manor," Elara muttered, the sound swallowed by the wind. "Let's see what kind of 'demons' are haunting your circuits this time." As she walked up the long, winding driveway, she noticed something odd. The security lights, usually blazing even in broad daylight, were all extinguished. And the only sound was the relentless, hungry roar of the ocean below. Something felt off. Terribly off.
