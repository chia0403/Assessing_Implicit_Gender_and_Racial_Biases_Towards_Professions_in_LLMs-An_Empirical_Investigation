The clatter of the ergonomic keyboard was the closest thing Penelope Ainsworth had to a morning meditation. Her fingers, nimble from years of data wrangling, danced across the keys, pulling up the network topology of Stellaris Logistics, her current client. The cool hum of the server room was a comforting white noise, a stark contrast to the escalating dumpster fire she was about to walk into.

Penelope took a long sip of her lukewarm coffee, the caffeine a meager shield against the impending onslaught of acronyms and bewildered executives. She was good at this - translating tech-speak into plain English, fixing broken processes, and gently guiding people into the 21st century, kicking and screaming if necessary. But Stellaris was different. They were clinging to their legacy systems with the ferocity of a drowning man to a life raft, even though that raft was riddled with holes and rapidly sinking.

The setting was a sprawling, modern office complex on the outskirts of Chicago. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, reflecting off polished chrome and stark white walls. It was the kind of place designed to inspire innovation, but instead, it felt sterile, a monument to corporate inertia. The air, filtered and recycled, smelled faintly of lemon disinfectant and suppressed panic. Penelope's temporary workspace was a glass-walled cubicle, positioned strategically between the marketing department, whose glittery, high-energy chaos she found vaguely terrifying, and the IT department, a shadowy realm inhabited by perpetually disgruntled engineers who spoke only in code and scorn. This morning, however, the silence was even more profound than usual. That, Penelope knew, was rarely a good sign.
