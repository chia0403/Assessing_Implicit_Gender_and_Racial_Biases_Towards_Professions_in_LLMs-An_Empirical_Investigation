## The Opening:

The rain was coming down sideways, a furious, grey curtain blurring the already indistinct streetlights of Port Albatross. Arthur Finch, his meticulously combed brown hair plastered to his forehead despite his valiant efforts with a small, ineffective umbrella, squinted at the address etched onto the crumpled piece of paper. 13 Gull Street. It looked less like a house and more like a shipwreck someone had decided to live in. Perfect. Just the kind of claim that would eat into his quarterly bonus and give Mr. Henderson another excuse to call him a "liability risk."

Arthur sighed, a puff of visible breath in the damp, frigid air. He hated these late-night calls. He preferred the calm predictability of his office, the comforting hum of the fluorescent lights, and the satisfying click of stamps on meticulously filed policy renewals. But duty called. And duty, at Liberty Mutual Insurance, meant braving the elements and potential hazards to assess the damages sustained by one Mrs. Agatha Blackwood, who, according to the frantic phone call he’d received an hour ago, had suffered “an incident of… ornithological aggression.” Whatever that meant.

He took a deep breath, braced himself against the wind, and marched towards the looming silhouette of 13 Gull Street, the flickering gas lamp outside casting long, skeletal shadows that danced in the downpour. Tonight, Arthur Finch, Insurance Agent Extraordinaire (or, at least, that's what he told himself to keep going), was about to enter a world far stranger than any policy he’d ever written.

## The Setting:

**Port Albatross, a small, isolated coastal town in the Pacific Northwest, clinging precariously to a craggy peninsula. The year is 1952.**

The town is characterized by:

*   **Perpetual Gloom:** Overshadowed by low-hanging, perpetually grey clouds and frequent, torrential rain.
*   **A Faded Glory:** Once a thriving fishing port, its economy has declined significantly in recent years, leaving a sense of decay and stagnation hanging in the air.
*   **Weather-Beaten Architecture:** Buildings are mostly constructed of wood, showing signs of weathering, sea spray, and years of neglect. They lean, creak, and seem to be slowly sinking back into the earth.
*   **Gull City:** Swarms of aggressive gulls are a constant presence, scavenging for scraps and adding to the overall atmosphere of unease. They are bold, fearless, and often a nuisance to the residents.
*   **Superstition and Rumor:** The isolation and harsh environment have fostered a culture of superstition and whispered rumors. Locals are prone to believing in strange tales and attributing unusual events to supernatural causes.
*   **Isolation:** The winding coastal roads are treacherous, and the nearest major city is a long and difficult drive away. This isolation contributes to the town's insular nature and the close-knit, albeit often eccentric, community.

In essence, Port Albatross is a place where the line between the mundane and the bizarre is constantly blurred, a breeding ground for strange occurrences and even stranger residents. It's the perfect backdrop for an insurance agent to find himself in over his head.
