## Story Opening:

The incessant drizzle of the Pacific Northwest had been a constant companion for weeks, but for Silas Abernathy, groundskeeper of the crumbling Blackwood Manor, it was more than just weather. It was a shroud, a tangible weight pressing down on the ancient stone, mirroring the ache in his own bones. He gripped the handle of his rusty shears, their teeth dull against the overgrown ivy choking the gargoyle statue that stood sentinel above the manor's west wing. Each snip was a sigh, each falling leaf a whispered lament.

Silas knew this estate held secrets, whispered on the wind that howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient cedars, secrets clinging to the moss-covered headstones in the family cemetery tucked away in the woods. Secrets the Blackwood family themselves had taken great pains to bury, along withâ€¦ well, along with other things. And Silas, more than anyone, was starting to unearth them.
## Setting:

**Blackwood Manor:** Situated on a remote, windswept headland overlooking the churning grey waters of Puget Sound, Blackwood Manor is a gothic monstrosity built in the late 19th century by the wealthy and eccentric Blackwood family. The house itself is constructed of dark, moss-covered stone, with soaring turrets, arched windows, and a labyrinthine layout that's said to contain hidden rooms and passages. The manor is surrounded by sprawling, unkempt grounds, featuring:

*   **Overgrown gardens:** Once meticulously manicured, the gardens are now a wild tangle of roses, ivy, and thorny bushes. Statues stand half-hidden amongst the foliage, their faces weathered and obscured by moss.
*   **Ancient cedars:** Giant cedar trees dominate the landscape, their gnarled branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal arms. The wind howls through their needles, creating an eerie and unsettling sound.
*   **A hidden cemetery:** Tucked away in the woods behind the manor, the Blackwood family cemetery is a collection of weathered headstones, many of which are illegible. The air here is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.
*   **The coastline:** The manor overlooks a rugged coastline, with jagged cliffs and crashing waves. A narrow, treacherous path leads down to a secluded beach.

The atmosphere is one of isolation, decay, and lingering secrets. A sense of unease pervades the air, as if the manor itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
