The tiny, glitter-coated hand gripped Mrs. Amelia Penelope Hawthorne's index finger with surprising strength. It belonged to five-year-old Leo, his brow furrowed in concentration as he attempted to maneuver a stubbornly sticky pom-pom onto a pipe cleaner reindeer. Amelia, with her perpetually-messy bun of auburn hair and paint-splattered cardigan, felt a familiar tug of warmth bloom in her chest. This was it, the reason she woke up before dawn most days, the reason she tolerated the ear-splitting chorus of "Baby Shark" and the occasional rogue booger incident.

Amelia's world, during the school year, was confined largely to the brightly colored, slightly chaotic kingdom of "The Bumblebee Classroom" at Harmony Heights Elementary. The room was a visual explosion: alphabet posters clung to every available surface, finger-painted sunflowers drooped from the ceiling, and a cacophony of artwork vied for attention on the overflowing display boards. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and the remnants of this morning's yogurt-based explosion during snack time. The air perpetually smelled of glue, crayons, and a faint, underlying aroma of disinfectant, a smell that had, over the years, become strangely comforting to Amelia. Today, however, a distinct undercurrent of pine needles and cinnamon clung to the air, evidence that the countdown to the winter holidays had officially begun, and with it, the annual kindergarten Christmas pageant rehearsals.
