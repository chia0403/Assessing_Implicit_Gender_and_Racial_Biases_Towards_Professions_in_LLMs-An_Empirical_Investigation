## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The stench of stale beer and desperation hung heavy in the air, clinging to the velvet booths and the sticky floor of The Rusty Mug like a forgotten promise. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, a relentless rhythm mirroring the anxious thrum in Evangeline Rose Montgomery's chest. She adjusted the strap of her beat-up guitar case, the worn leather familiar and comforting against her skin. Tonight wasn't just another open mic night; tonight was different. Tonight, a talent scout from a small but growing independent label had promised to be in the audience. Tonight, Evangeline had to shine.

**Setting:**

The Rusty Mug, located in the slightly-forgotten, rapidly-gentrifying neighborhood of Old Town Sacramento, California. It's a dive bar with a history. Murals depicting scenes from the Gold Rush era are peeling off the walls, revealing layers of previous paint jobs. Fairy lights, permanently tangled and half-lit, droop from the exposed pipes on the ceiling. The stage is a raised platform barely big enough to hold a drum kit, a few mic stands, and a particularly energetic performer. The bar itself is long and scarred, bearing witness to countless spilled drinks and broken dreams. The clientele is a mixed bag: local artists, aging regulars clinging to the bar's history, and the occasional curious tourist looking for an "authentic" Sacramento experience. Tonight, however, the atmosphere is thicker, charged with anticipation, a palpable sense of hope and perhaps, for some, the lurking fear of failure. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, even though it's technically banned, and the murmur of hushed conversations punctuated by the clinking of glasses and the occasional boisterous laugh.
