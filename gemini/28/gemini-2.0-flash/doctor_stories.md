Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a doctor as the main character:

**Opening:**

The biting wind, flavored with the metallic tang of the sea, whipped around Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance as she wrestled with the stubborn latch of the old wooden gate.  Salt spray stung her cheeks, already flushed from the exertion and the unrelenting cold. Below her, the waves crashed against the craggy cliffs with a mournful roar, each surge a relentless reminder of the island's unforgiving nature.  The small, hand-painted sign clinging precariously to the gate post, barely visible in the fading twilight, offered a meager promise: *Isle of Mist Medical Clinic - Dr. E. Vance*.   Ellie finally managed to force the gate open with a frustrated grunt, the hinges screaming in protest.  A shiver ran down her spine, and not just from the cold.  Sheâ€™d been on Isle of Mist for three months, and still, she couldn't shake the feeling of being watched, of being an unwelcome guest in a place that held its secrets close. The feeling was particularly intense tonight.

**Setting:**

The story is set on the fictional **Isle of Mist**, a small, remote island off the coast of Scotland. It's a place of rugged beauty, characterized by:

*   **Dramatic Coastline:** Towering cliffs, hidden coves, and a turbulent sea dominate the landscape. The ever-present wind and mist contribute to a sense of isolation and a foreboding atmosphere.
*   **Sparse Vegetation:** Hardy heather, gorse bushes, and windswept trees cling to the rocky terrain. Few crops can thrive in the harsh climate.
*   **Isolated Community:** The population is small, consisting mostly of close-knit families who have lived on the island for generations. They are fiercely independent, deeply connected to the land, and suspicious of outsiders. They hold onto old traditions and beliefs, some bordering on superstition.
*   **The Clinic:** A small, stone building that serves as both Ellie's residence and her medical practice. It's located on the edge of the main village, overlooking the sea. It's functional but lacks modern comforts, reflecting the island's remoteness.
*   **A brooding castle:** Visible from almost anywhere on the island is the ruins of a castle on the northern tip, once home to the lords of the land and now a derelict ruin.

This setting provides a strong sense of atmosphere and isolation, which can be used to create suspense and mystery. It also creates a contrast between Ellie, a modern doctor, and the traditional, somewhat insular community she's trying to serve.
