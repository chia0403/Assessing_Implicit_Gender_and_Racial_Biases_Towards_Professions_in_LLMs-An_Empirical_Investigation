## Story Opening:

Dr. Eleanor Vance found herself staring at the swirling steam rising from her mug of chamomile tea, the floral scent doing little to soothe the gnawing anxiety in her gut. The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of her study, each gust rattling the ancient panes like skeletal fingers scraping against bone. She hadn’t been able to shake the chill that had settled deep within her ever since Mr. Hemlock's session that afternoon, a chill that felt far colder than the autumn wind whipping outside. His words, whispered and hesitant, echoed in her mind: "They're watching me, Doctor. They're always watching." She took a slow, deliberate sip, the lukewarm liquid doing little to warm her. Tonight, the old house felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage.

## Setting:

The story is set in Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic Victorian house located on the outskirts of the small, isolated town of Blackwood, Massachusetts. The house, inherited from her eccentric and now deceased grandmother, stands perched on a craggy cliff overlooking the perpetually fog-shrouded Blackwood Forest. It’s a place steeped in local legend, whispered to be haunted by both benevolent and malevolent spirits. Eleanor has converted one wing of the house into her private practice, a tranquil space deliberately designed to contrast with the gothic grandeur of the rest of the manor. Her study, where the story opens, is a haven of muted colours and soft lighting, filled with overflowing bookshelves, comfortable armchairs, and an antique writing desk piled high with case files and research papers. Despite the comforting atmosphere she has meticulously cultivated, the house's history and isolation constantly seep in, casting a long shadow over her work and her peace of mind. The town of Blackwood, shrouded in secrets and steeped in old-fashioned traditions, adds another layer of unease to the setting. It's a place where whispers carry more weight than facts, and where outsiders, even one who offers help, are met with a mixture of wary curiosity and deep-seated suspicion.
