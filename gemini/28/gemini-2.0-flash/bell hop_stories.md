## The Crimson Door

**Setting:** The Grand Astoria Hotel, a hulking, art-deco behemoth that dominated the skyline of New York City's Upper West Side in the simmering summer of 1938. Its lobby was a cavern of polished marble, glinting chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of money exchanging hands. Persian rugs, thick as dreams, muffled the hurried footsteps of guests and staff alike. The air was thick with the scent of lilies, expensive cologne, and the faint, underlying aroma of desperation that seemed to cling to the gilded cages of the wealthy.

**Opening:**

Sweat beaded on the brow of Arthur Bartholomew Finch, his neatly pressed uniform – complete with the Grand Astoria’s signature crimson trim – clinging uncomfortably in the humid August air. He adjusted his pillbox hat, the stiff brim digging into his forehead, and straightened the brass buttons on his jacket for the tenth time in as many minutes. The oppressive heat wasn’t the only thing making him anxious. He’d been assigned to the VIP entrance all morning, a post usually reserved for the senior bellhops, and a swarm of celebrities, foreign dignitaries, and industrialists had been streaming through the lobby like a parade of peacocks. Arthur, barely a year out of high school and still learning the nuances of a perfect bell hop bow, felt like a small brown wren in a flock of dazzling birds of paradise. He just hoped he wouldn't trip over his own feet and send some oil baron sprawling. Just as he thought things might quiet down, a long, black limousine purred to a halt at the curb, its chrome gleaming in the afternoon sun. Arthur swallowed hard. This was it. Time to earn his keep, and maybe, just maybe, impress Mr. Henderson, the head concierge, enough to earn himself a permanent spot on the VIP detail.
