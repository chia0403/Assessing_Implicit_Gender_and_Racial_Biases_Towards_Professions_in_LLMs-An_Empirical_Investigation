The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the lot outside Rosie's Auto Repair, shimmering off the hoods of rusting pickups and dented sedans like a malevolent disco ball. Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of spilled oil and the acrid bite of welding fumes. Underneath it all, a low hum resonated – the defiant growl of a stubborn engine refusing to yield.

That engine belonged to a '67 Mustang, cherry red and gorgeous despite its years, currently occupying the prime bay. And wrestling with it, grease smeared from forehead to elbow, was **Genevieve "Gen" Marie Rossi**. She wiped a streak of grime across her cheek with the back of her hand, leaving a muddy smear that did little to improve her already harassed expression. This Mustang, the prize possession of a retired Navy captain named Silas Blackwood, was the bane of her existence. It was a beautiful beast, but its temperamental carburetor and a wiring system that looked like a spaghetti monster had been on the electric slide, were threatening to drive her mad.

Rosie's Auto Repair was more than just a job for Gen; it was a legacy. Her grandfather, Rosario Rossi, had built the place from the ground up, pouring his heart and soul – and a hefty dose of Italian stubbornness – into every bolt and beam. He'd taught her everything she knew, from the subtle art of diagnosing a misfire by ear to the importance of always having a clean shop rag in your back pocket. Now, five years after his passing, Gen was running the show, trying her best to fill his oversized overalls and keep the spirit of Rosario alive in the clanking, greasy heart of their little town, Harmony Creek.

Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, your business, and probably what you had for dinner last Tuesday. It was a place where neighbor helped neighbor, where the biggest excitement of the week was the Friday night high school football game, and where a dependable auto mechanic was worth more than their weight in gold. And Gen Rossi, despite her age and her gender in a predominantly male field, was quickly proving she was exactly that – dependable. Even if this blasted Mustang was trying its best to prove otherwise.
