## Story Opening:

The metallic tang of bleach hung thick in the air, a testament to Edgar Arthur Plimpton's tireless efforts. Another Friday night, another graveyard shift at the Grand Majestic Theatre. He hummed a low, tuneless melody, pushing his industrial-sized mop bucket across the crimson carpet, its plush pile still damp from the earlier soaking. The Grand Majestic, with its faded glory and creaking bones, felt more like a mausoleum than a temple of entertainment this late, and Edgar, alone with the ghosts of forgotten performances, was its reluctant caretaker.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily within the **Grand Majestic Theatre**, a once-opulent vaudeville house in the fictional city of Atherton, somewhere in the American Northeast.

**Key details of the setting include:**

*   **A decaying grandeur:** The theatre boasts ornate plasterwork, peeling paint, and tarnished gilt details. The seats are worn, the velvet curtains faded, and the crystal chandeliers are perpetually dusty.
*   **The main stage:** A large, wooden stage, dimly lit by a single bare bulb. Backstage is a labyrinth of narrow corridors, dressing rooms with cracked mirrors, and prop storage areas filled with forgotten remnants of past productions.
*   **The auditorium:** Filled with rows of empty seats, casting long shadows under the balcony. The air is thick with the scent of old wood, dust, and the faint echo of applause long past.
*   **Edgar's small office:** A cluttered space in the basement, filled with cleaning supplies, a small radio, and a worn armchair. This is Edgar's sanctuary, a place where he can escape the echoing silence of the theatre.
*   **The city of Atherton:** A city clinging to the remnants of its industrial past, with a struggling economy and a general air of melancholy. The Grand Majestic stands as a symbol of a bygone era, its fate hanging precariously in the balance.
