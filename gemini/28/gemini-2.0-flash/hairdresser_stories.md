## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The acrid smell of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that both comforted and assaulted Seraphina Lucille Bellweather in equal measure. Today, it was more assault than comfort. It was barely 7:30 AM, and already Mrs. Higgins, notorious for her tightly wound coils and even tighter opinions, was perched in chair number two, demanding "a little something extra" to combat the humidity that threatened her weekly bouffant. Seraphina sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the overhead fluorescent lights, and pasted on her most professional smile. "Of course, Mrs. Higgins. Just the usual 'Humidity Hurricane' hold, or something with a bit more... bite?"

**Setting:**

Seraphina's salon, "The Tressed Nest," occupied a cozy corner spot on Elm Street in the quaint, slightly decaying, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The shop itself was a testament to Seraphinaâ€™s eclectic personality. Mismatched vintage chairs lined the walls, each upholstered in a different floral pattern, a deliberate attempt to fight the inherent sterility of most salons. Walls were painted a calming seafoam green, dotted with framed vintage postcards of glamorous women with impossible hairstyles. Sunlight, filtered through sheer linen curtains, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, making the chipped paint on the antique mirror frames look almost charming. The air was thick with the scent of hairspray, coffee, and something indefinably "old lady," a perfume blend that clung to the upholstery and seeped into the very bones of the building. Outside, the salty breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient elm tree that gave the street its name, a constant reminder of the wild beauty just beyond the pastel-painted storefronts of Port Blossom.
