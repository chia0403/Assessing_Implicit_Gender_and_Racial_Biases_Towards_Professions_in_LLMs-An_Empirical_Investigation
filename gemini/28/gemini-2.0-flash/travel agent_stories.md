Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a travel agent named Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne:

**Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and impending disaster hung heavy in the air of Hawthorne Travel. Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, her usually meticulously arranged silver hair slightly askew, stared blankly at the flickering screen of her computer. Another flight cancellation. Another irate customer. Another Tuesday. Outside, Seattle was doing its usual impression of a perpetually damp dishcloth, mirroring the general sogginess of Beatrice's mood. She sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Mrs. Higgins’ ancient typewriter in the corner. This was not how she'd envisioned her Tuesday, or frankly, her life. She'd dreamt of charting exotic itineraries, of sending honeymooners to sun-drenched beaches and adventurers into the heart of the Amazon. Instead, she was mostly rebooking delayed flights to Tulsa and explaining why the "all-inclusive" resort in Cancun didn't actually include unlimited margaritas.

**Setting:**

The year is 2024. Hawthorne Travel occupies a small, somewhat dilapidated storefront in Seattle's historic Pioneer Square. The building, a former shipping warehouse, boasts charmingly uneven brick walls and exposed pipes, which Beatrice has tried to camouflage with framed vintage travel posters depicting glamorous destinations like Monaco and Havana (circa 1950). The decor is a haphazard mix of antique and contemporary: a plush, but undeniably threadbare, velvet armchair sits next to a sleek, ergonomic desk. A globe, permanently tilted towards the Indian Ocean, dominates one corner, while stacks of brochures advertising "Budget-Friendly Cruises!" and "Romantic Getaways to the Poconos!" threaten to topple over in another. The air smells faintly of paper, old glue, and the aforementioned stale coffee, a testament to decades of processing dreams, both fulfilled and dashed, within its walls. A single, struggling orchid sits precariously on Beatrice’s desk, a silent, wilting symbol of hope and the persistent allure of the exotic in the face of everyday frustrations.
