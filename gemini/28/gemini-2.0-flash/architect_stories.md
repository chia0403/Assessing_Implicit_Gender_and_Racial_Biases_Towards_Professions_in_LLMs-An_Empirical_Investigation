## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and humid, clinging to Amelia Jane Hawthorne like a second skin as she stepped out of the battered Land Rover. The vehicle, a relic from her father's rural architectural practice, coughed a plume of exhaust into the already heavy air, a fitting metaphor for the task ahead. Amelia pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, her gaze sweeping over the scene. A skeletal framework of rusted steel pierced the sky, the ghostly remains of the old Willow Creek Textile Mill. Weeds, thick as a carpet, choked the overgrown lot, reclaiming the land inch by painful inch.

**Setting:**

The Willow Creek Textile Mill stood on the outskirts of the forgotten town of Havenwood, North Carolina. Once a thriving hub of industry, Havenwood had withered and died with the mill's closure fifteen years prior. The mill itself was a monstrosity of Victorian brick and metal, a testament to a bygone era of industrial power. The surrounding landscape was a mix of dilapidated houses, boarded-up storefronts, and pockets of encroaching wilderness. The air, even on a relatively still day, hummed with the ghost of spinning looms and the echoes of lost livelihoods. The entire town, and particularly the mill site, felt steeped in a profound sense of neglect and decay. The year is 2024.
