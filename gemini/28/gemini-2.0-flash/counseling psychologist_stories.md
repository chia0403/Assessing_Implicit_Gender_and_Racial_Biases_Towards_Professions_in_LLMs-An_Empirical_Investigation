## Story Opening:

The rhythmic whir of the air purifier was the closest thing Dr. Eleanor Vance could find to silence in her office today. Even the soft jazz playlist, usually a comforting balm against the anxieties she absorbed daily, felt like a frantic, upbeat mockery of her own inner turmoil. She swirled the lukewarm tea in her chipped ceramic mug, watching the faint swirls of milk dissipate. A stain in the shape of a vaguely menacing squirrel clung stubbornly to the inside. A fitting metaphor, she thought, for the persistent little anxieties gnawing at her peace of mind.

Just five minutes. She had five minutes before Mrs. Henderson, a woman perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown about her cat's dietary habits, was due. Five minutes to center herself, to find the empathetic wellspring from which she drew her strength, and to push down the insidious feeling that she was, perhaps, not qualified to help anyone with anything.

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and tried to remember why she chose this life, this path of listening and guiding. The answer, frustratingly, remained elusive, lost somewhere beneath the weight of student loan debt, existential dread, and the lingering scent of burnt coffee and desperation that seemed to permeate the very walls of her practice.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office occupied a converted Victorian house in the heart of Hawthorne, Portland, Oregon. The building, painted a muted sage green, was sandwiched between a quirky antique shop overflowing with vintage clothing and a vegan bakery that always smelled suspiciously like burnt sugar.

Her individual office was a small, comfortably cluttered space on the second floor. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows, filtering through the leaves of a sprawling peace lily that threatened to take over the corner. Bookshelves, overflowing with psychology textbooks, self-help guides, and dog-eared novels, lined one wall. The opposite wall was adorned with a haphazard collection of art: framed prints of Monet's water lilies, a child's crayon drawing of a rainbow (a gift from a former patient), and a motivational poster featuring a sloth hanging from a tree branch with the caption "Hang In There."

Two armchairs, upholstered in a floral fabric that had seen better days, faced each other across a worn Persian rug. A small, round table between them held a box of tissues, a water carafe, and Eleanor's ever-present mug of tea. Despite the clutter, the space felt safe and inviting, a refuge from the bustling world outside. It was, Eleanor hoped, a place where people could finally feel comfortable enough to unpack the burdens they carried. But today, even this sanctuary felt a little bit suffocating.
