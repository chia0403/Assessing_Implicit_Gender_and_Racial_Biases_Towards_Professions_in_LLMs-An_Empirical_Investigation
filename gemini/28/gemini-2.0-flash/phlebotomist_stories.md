The flickering fluorescent lights of St. Jude’s Urgent Care hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the anxiety and low-grade illnesses that infested the late-night hours. Outside, the February wind howled, battering the windows with icy rain. Inside, the linoleum floor echoed the hurried footsteps of nurses and the occasional whimpering of a child.

This was familiar territory to Seraphina Isabella Moretti, a phlebotomist with ten years of experience etched into the lines around her kind, hazel eyes. Tonight, she was running point on the blood draw station, a small alcove crammed with vacutainers, tourniquets, alcohol swabs, and the ever-present biohazard bin. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of disinfectant and the subtle, unsettling aroma of fear.

Seraphina adjusted her medical mask, tugged down the sleeves of her worn, but clean, scrubs, and sighed. It wasn’t that she hated her job. In fact, she found a quiet satisfaction in the precision and skill it required. It was more that she was tired. Tired of the long hours, tired of the constant stream of patients, tired of the weight of knowing that for some, the vials she filled held the key to life-altering diagnoses. Tonight, especially, she felt the burden keenly. Her own life felt like a series of blood draws – a little bit of her being drained away each time.
