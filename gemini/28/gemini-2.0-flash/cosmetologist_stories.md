## Story Opening:

The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Esmeralda Guadalupe Rodriguez's skin as she wrestled with the recalcitrant roller door of "Salon Bella Mariposa." The metal shrieked in protest, a rusty soprano that seemed to mirror the tension coiled tight in Esmeralda's stomach. It was Tuesday, usually a slow day, but today felt different. Ominous, even. 

She finally managed to heave the door high enough to slip underneath, the familiar scent of hairspray, disinfectant, and simmering cafecito washing over her. The salon, normally a haven of vibrant chatter and expertly sculpted brows, felt unsettlingly silent. Even the usually boisterous salsa music piped through the hidden speakers seemed muted, swallowed by the oppressive quiet.

Esmeralda ran a weary hand through her own perfectly coiffed, auburn waves – a testament to her skills and a silent advertisement for her abilities. She knew the secrets to taming even the wildest of manes, but she wasn't so sure she knew how to tame the anxieties currently clawing at her. Maria Esperanza, her oldest and most reliable client, hadn’t called to confirm her usual weekly appointment, and Maria *never* missed her weekly appointment. Something felt… wrong. And Esmeralda Guadalupe Rodriguez, for all her expertly applied eyeliner and cheerful disposition, trusted her gut.
