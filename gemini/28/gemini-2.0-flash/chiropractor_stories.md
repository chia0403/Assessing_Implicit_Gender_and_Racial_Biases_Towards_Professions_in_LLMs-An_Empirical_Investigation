## The Story Opening:

The flickering neon sign of "The Cracked Spine - Dr. Alistair Humphrey, D.C." buzzed a mournful tune against the damp Seattle night. Rain, as usual, was slanting down in sheets, making the grimy storefront look even more desolate. Inside, Alistair Humphrey, slumped in his worn leather office chair, stared at the half-finished crossword puzzle on his desk. The answer to 7-Down, "Aching misery, six letters," eluded him, and frankly, he wasn't sure he had the energy to care. He'd been staring at the same grid for the past hour, the silence broken only by the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet in the back room.

He wasn't supposed to be here this late. The last patient, a grizzled fisherman with a back twisted from years at sea, had limped out hours ago. But sleep evaded him these days. The silence of his small apartment above the clinic felt too loud, the emptiness too profound. He preferred the hum of the city, even if it was muted by the perpetually damp air. He preferred the lingering scent of liniment and disinfectant to the ghost of lavender that clung to his lonely rooms. Tonight, though, even the familiar smells of his trade offered little comfort.

A sudden, sharp rap at the door startled him. Alistair blinked, the crossword puzzle momentarily forgotten. Who on earth would be seeking chiropractic care at this hour? He rubbed his tired eyes and stood, a sliver of hope, fragile as a butterfly's wing, fluttering in his chest. Maybe, just maybe, this would be something more than another aching back, another plea for relief. Maybe this would be...something.

## The Setting:

**The Cracked Spine**, Dr. Alistair Humphrey's chiropractic clinic, is located in a down-at-heel section of Seattle, a neighborhood clinging precariously to the edge of gentrification. The building itself is a two-story brick structure, its paint peeling and brickwork stained with years of Pacific Northwest rain.

*   **The Exterior:** The neon sign is the most prominent feature, a beacon in the gloom. A faded awning hangs limply above the entrance, offering minimal protection from the elements. A small, hand-painted sign in the window reads "Walk-Ins Welcome!" - a testament to Alistair's willingness to take on any patient, no matter how obscure.
*   **The Waiting Room:** Small and sparsely furnished, the waiting room contains a mismatched collection of chairs, a coffee table littered with outdated magazines (mostly focusing on back pain and lifestyle choices), and a dusty ficus plant stubbornly refusing to thrive. The walls are painted a sickly shade of beige, doing nothing to brighten the space.
*   **Alistair's Office:** Adjoining the waiting room, Alistair's office is equally cramped but slightly more personal. Shelves overflowing with anatomical models, textbooks on spinal manipulation, and framed diplomas line the walls. His worn leather chair sits behind a large, oak desk that's seen better days. A window overlooks a narrow alleyway, offering a depressing view of overflowing dumpsters and graffiti-covered walls.
*   **The Treatment Room:** Located at the back of the clinic, the treatment room is the most functional space. A chiropractic table dominates the room, surrounded by various tools of Alistair's trade â€“ rollers, wedges, and an impressive array of massage oils. The air here is thick with the scent of liniment and disinfectant, a testament to the countless hours Alistair has spent easing aches and pains.
