The humid August air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Grace O’Connell like a damp shroud as she unlocked the wrought iron gate of the Magnolia Retirement Residence. The scent of overripe gardenias, mixed with the faint antiseptic tang of the building's interior, was a familiar and oddly comforting assault on her senses. Magnolia wasn't a glamorous place. Built in the 1950s, its architecture was a boxy beige brick, softened only by the sprawling magnolia trees that gave it its name. But it was home to a collection of vibrant, resilient individuals, and for Amelia, it was more than just a job.

She tucked a stray strand of her perpetually escaping brown hair behind her ear and adjusted the strap of her well-worn therapy bag. Inside, nestled amongst the resistance bands and adaptive utensils, was a brand new set of dominos, purchased specifically for Mrs. Higgins. Amelia hoped they would reignite a spark in the woman, who had retreated into a silent world since her stroke. The rhythmic click of the dominos, the strategic placement, the shared victory – Amelia believed in the power of small things, of finding joy and purpose even in the face of overwhelming adversity. Magnolia Retirement Residence, with its peeling paint and institutional furniture, might seem like a place of endings, but for Amelia Grace O'Connell, Occupational Therapist, it was a place of endless possibilities.
