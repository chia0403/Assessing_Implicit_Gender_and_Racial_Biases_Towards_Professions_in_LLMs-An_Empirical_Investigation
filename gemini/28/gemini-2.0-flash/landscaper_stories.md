## Story Opening:

The persistent buzz sawed through the humid Louisiana air, each whine a tiny defiance against the oppressive stillness threatening to suffocate Jacob Alistair Thibodeaux. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of rich, dark soil across his forehead. He could almost taste the iron-tinged earth clinging to his skin, the tang of damp leaves and crushed pine needles. Jacob hated the smell, hated the heat, and hated, above all, the incessant gnawing in his gut that told him this wasn’t the life he was meant for.

He revved the saw again, a frustrated growl echoing his own inner turmoil. He'd been landscaping the lawns of the obscenely wealthy residents of River Bend Plantation for five years now, and each perfectly manicured lawn, each strategically placed rosebush, felt like another brick in the wall he’d built around his dreams.

## Setting:

River Bend Plantation wasn't a plantation in the historical sense, thank God. It was a gated community, meticulously planned and aggressively maintained, sprawling across what had once been fertile sugar cane fields just south of New Orleans. The houses were gargantuan, ostentatious displays of wealth and privilege, each vying for attention with its neighbor. Perfectly symmetrical gardens, imported Italian fountains, and sprawling driveways were the norm.

The air hung heavy with the scent of magnolia blossoms and money. It was a place where the grass was always greener (because Jacob and his crew meticulously fertilized it) and the weeds were nonexistent (because they diligently pulled them). The sky, a perpetually hazy blue, seemed to mock the vibrant life contained within the wrought-iron gates, promising rain that rarely came. It was a gilded cage, and Jacob felt increasingly trapped inside.
