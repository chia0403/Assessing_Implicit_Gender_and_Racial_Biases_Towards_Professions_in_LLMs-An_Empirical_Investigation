## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a lullaby for spreadsheets and the souls that dared to navigate their intricate columns. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, CPA, hunched over his desk, the glow of his monitor reflecting in his perpetually weary eyes. He was a man of order, a devotee to the precise balance of debits and credits, the kind of accountant who dreamt in numbers and woke with a yearning for a well-aligned balance sheet. Tonight, however, the numbers mocked him. They danced on the screen, refusing to cooperate, taunting him with a discrepancy of precisely $23.47.

Bart sighed, the sound a deflated balloon, and rubbed the bridge of his nose. It was almost midnight, and the rest of the office had long since succumbed to the siren call of sleep. He was alone, save for the faint rustling of the building's aged ventilation system, and the irritating, persistent feeling that something was terribly, terribly wrong. Not just with the numbers, but with everything. He just couldn't quite put his finger on it. Was it the oppressive silence? The lingering smell of stale coffee? Or the creeping suspicion that he was being watched?

He glanced around the empty office, a shiver tracing its way down his spine. It was probably just fatigue. After all, heâ€™d been working on the Harrison & Sons account for weeks. A multinational conglomerate whose finances were more tangled than a plate of spaghetti. He was used to late nights. He was *made* for late nights.

But then, the fluorescent lights flickered again, this time plunging the office into near darkness for a heart-stopping moment. When they sputtered back to life, Bart was certain he saw something move in the shadows at the end of the hall. Something...unaccounted for.

## Setting:

The story begins in the main office of Harrison & Sons headquarters, located on the 27th floor of the "Apex Tower" in downtown Chicago. The Apex Tower is a towering, modern structure of steel and glass, a symbol of corporate power and ambition. Inside, however, the accounting department, where Bart spends his days (and often nights), is a far more mundane affair.

Think gray cubicles arranged in neat rows, cluttered desks overflowing with files and paperwork, and the ever-present hum of computers and printers. The walls are adorned with generic motivational posters featuring soaring eagles and platitudes about teamwork. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee, stale pizza, and the faint, lingering odor of desperation. The windows offer a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline, a constant reminder of the wealth and power that Bart helps to manage, but rarely gets to experience himself. The entire atmosphere is one of quiet, almost sterile efficiency, a stark contrast to the unsettling feeling that Bart begins to experience.
