The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, hay, and something distinctly… skunky. Beatrice Amelia Hawthorne wrinkled her nose as she unlocked the heavy oak door of the Nocturnal Mammal House at the Havenwood Wildlife Sanctuary. Sunlight, still struggling to pierce the morning fog, filtered through the ancient oaks that ringed the enclosure, casting long, skeletal shadows across the leaf-strewn path. Beatrice pushed the door open wider, the hinges groaning in protest, and stepped inside. The temperature immediately dropped a good ten degrees, a welcome relief from the lingering summer heat that had plagued Havenwood.

Havenwood Wildlife Sanctuary was Beatrice’s sanctuary too. Nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, it was a sprawling network of enclosures, rehabilitation centers, and educational buildings dedicated to the rescue and conservation of native wildlife. Beatrice had been working there for five years, starting as a volunteer fresh out of college, and had slowly worked her way up to Head Animal Caretaker of the Nocturnal Mammal House, a position that suited her quiet, observant nature perfectly. She felt more at home amongst the rustling of bats and the sleepy sighs of opossums than she ever had in the bustling city she'd left behind.

This morning, though, the usual peace of the Nocturnal Mammal House was disrupted by a palpable tension. The skunk enclosure, typically emitting only a mild musky odor, reeked of defensive spray. And that wasn’t a good sign. Something was amiss. Beatrice Amelia Hawthorne straightened her shoulders, grabbed her flashlight, and prepared to face whatever the dawn had brought to the denizens of her little slice of the night.
