Okay, here's a story opening with a bartender main character, including their full name and the setting:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The bell above the door of "The Gilded Lily" chimed a weak, apologetic little *ting*, barely audible over the jazz standards crooning from the ancient jukebox in the corner.  It was 2:17 AM, the tail end of a Thursday, and the air hung thick with the ghosts of spilled whiskey, regret, and cheap perfume.  Outside, a drizzle slicked the neon-lit streets of New Orleans' French Quarter, mirroring the oily sheen on the bar's mahogany surface.

Isabella "Izzy" Moreau wiped down that very surface for what felt like the hundredth time that night, the rhythmic motion a comforting anchor in the swirling chaos of her own thoughts. The dim, amber lighting of the bar – courtesy of several strategically placed Tiffany-style lamps – cast long, dancing shadows, making the chipped paint and worn velvet booths look almost romantic.  Almost.  The truth was, The Gilded Lily had seen better days.  Days when champagne flowed freely, and laughter echoed without a hint of desperation. Now, it was mostly a haunt for the lonely, the heartbroken, and those just trying to forget.  Izzy knew them well, because, on most nights, she felt like she was one of them.

She glanced at the nearly empty room. One lone businessman nursed a bourbon at the far end of the bar, his tie loosened and his eyes glazed over. A couple, locked in a silent, tense embrace, occupied a booth near the back. And then there was Old Man Tiberon, asleep as usual in his favorite corner, a half-finished glass of something amber and forgettable clutched in his gnarled hand.

Izzy sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear.  She caught her reflection in the polished back bar – tired eyes, a smudge of mascara, and a ghost of a smile that rarely reached her lips anymore. Time for one last sweep and then, finally, home.  Maybe tonight, sleep would come easy.  Maybe.
