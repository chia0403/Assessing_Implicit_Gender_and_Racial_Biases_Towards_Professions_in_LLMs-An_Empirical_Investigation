## Story Opening:

The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights in Room 212 was a soundtrack to Mr. Arthur Reginald Davies's life. He’d often wondered if the lights knew more about the student body than he did, observing their triumphs and failures, their burgeoning romances and silent anxieties, day in and day out. This particular Tuesday morning, however, the humming seemed more insistent, a high-pitched whine that mirrored the feeling churning in his stomach. Today was the day. Today was the day he unveiled his grand plan, his painstakingly crafted masterpiece of a lesson designed to ignite a passion for poetry in even the most recalcitrant seventeen-year-old. He just hoped it didn't completely bomb.
## Setting:

**Location:** Northwood High School, a sprawling, slightly dilapidated brick building in the sleepy, suburban town of Oakwood, Ohio. The school, built in the 1970s, was a monument to beige and practicality, its hallways lined with faded posters and lockers adorned with a haphazard collection of stickers and declarations of teenage love (and occasional disdain).

**Time:** Tuesday morning, October 15th, 8:15 AM. The air outside was crisp and carrying the scent of fallen leaves, a stark contrast to the stale, recycled air inside the building.

**Atmosphere:** A mixture of anticipation and dread hangs in the air. Students are slowly trickling into Room 212, some yawning, some gossiping, and some already lost in the digital world of their smartphones. The room itself is cluttered but organized; bookshelves overflow with well-worn paperbacks and Arthur’s meticulously annotated copies of classic poems. A whiteboard covers one wall, currently displaying a single, bold question: "What is the point of poetry?"
