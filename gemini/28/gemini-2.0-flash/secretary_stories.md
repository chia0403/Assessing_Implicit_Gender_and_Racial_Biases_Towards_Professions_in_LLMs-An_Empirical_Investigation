## Story Opening:

The incessant drip, drip, drip from the leaky faucet in the breakroom was a symphony of torment this morning. Mildred Abigail Bottomley pressed her forehead against the cool, metallic surface of the ancient water cooler, hoping the frigid contact would quell the throbbing behind her eyes. Last night’s gin rummy game with her sister Beatrice had stretched well past midnight, fueled by cheap gin and simmering resentments about Beatrice’s seemingly effortless climb up the corporate ladder at Consolidated Staple Solutions. Mildred, on the other hand, remained firmly planted on the second floor of Bottomley, Bingley & Boone, Attorneys at Law, a bastion of tradition and paperclips where the phrase "out of the box" referred solely to the container of new stationery.

She sighed, the sound rattling in her chest like loose change in a tin can. Another Monday. Another week of answering phones, typing letters, and silently enduring Mr. Bingley’s persistent, if somewhat endearing, habit of leaving half-eaten danishes on her desk. The weight of the routine, the unwavering predictability of it all, felt like a lead apron draped across her shoulders.

**Setting:**

Bottomley, Bingley & Boone occupied the entire second floor of a pre-war building on Elm Street, a street that, despite its name, was sadly lacking in actual elm trees. The office space was a warren of cramped, dimly lit rooms, each more oppressive than the last. The walls were painted a shade of beige so bland it could induce a coma. The furniture was a mismatched collection of hand-me-downs and bargain-basement finds, clearly chosen more for functionality than aesthetics.

The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed relentlessly overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of legal documents that threatened to topple from every available surface. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, dust, and the faintest whiff of Mr. Bingley’s signature cologne, a potent concoction that Mildred privately referred to as "Eau de Obituary." From her desk by the window, Mildred had a view of the grimy brick facade of the building across the street and the occasional pigeon taking flight from a nearby ledge. It wasn’t inspiring, but it was her view, her small slice of the world.
