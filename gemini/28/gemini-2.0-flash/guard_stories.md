## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on Private Elias Thorne, baking the cracked flagstones of the East Gate until they radiated heat like a blacksmith's forge. He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his brigandine armor chafing against his sweat-soaked tunic. Dust devils danced across the barren plains stretching beyond the city walls, mimicking the restless anticipation gnawing at him. Another day, another watch, another procession of merchants, beggars, and pilgrims eager to pass through Aethelgard's sturdy gates. But today felt different. A tremor, subtle but undeniable, vibrated in the very air, a feeling Elias couldn't quite name but that prickled the back of his neck.

## Setting:

The city of Aethelgard perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Plains, a sprawling metropolis of sandstone buildings clinging to a rocky outcrop. Built centuries ago by the legendary Stonemasons, its walls were its pride and its salvation, protecting it from the harsh elements and the even harsher denizens of the plains. The East Gate, where Elias stood, was the main artery leading into the city from the fertile valleys to the east. Two massive iron gates, reinforced with oak and studded with iron, stood between the city and the unforgiving landscape. Guard towers, manned by vigilant soldiers, flanked the gate, their watchful eyes scanning the horizon. The air was thick with the smells of spice, sweat, and the ever-present dust, a symphony of life and commerce that usually filled Elias with a sense of comforting routine. Today, however, the routine felt oppressive, a suffocating blanket stifling the unspoken dread that coiled in his gut.
