The biting November wind whipped across the exposed skeletal frame of the forty-story office building, finding its way through even the thickest of thermals. Dust, a pale ochre borrowed from the parched earth surrounding Reno, swirled in miniature tornadoes around the rebar, stinging Frank Bartholomew's eyes. He squinted, pulling his worn Carhartt collar higher, and spit a glob of gritty saliva onto the unfinished concrete floor.

Reno, Nevada, in late autumn, was a cruel mistress. The days were short, the nights unforgivingly cold, and the only warmth to be found came from the camaraderie of his crew and the fiery burn of a shot of whiskey after a long day. He glanced down, the dizzying height momentarily stealing his breath, at the chaotic sprawl of the city below. Neon signs flickered to life, promising warmth and fleeting fortunes, but Frank knew better. He knew the city was just as hard and unforgiving as the wind that clawed at his face.

The building they were working on, the "Silver State Tower," was meant to be Reno's newest landmark, a testament to its burgeoning economic prosperity. Frank, however, saw it as just another job, another pile of concrete and steel destined to house nameless corporations and fuel the endless churn of money. Another job that paid his bills and kept him one step ahead of the creeping darkness that sometimes threatened to engulf him. He tightened his grip on the welding torch, its familiar weight grounding him in the reality of the moment, and prepared to begin his afternoon's work. The sparks would fly, the metal would sing, and for a few hours, Frank Bartholomew would forget everything but the task at hand.
