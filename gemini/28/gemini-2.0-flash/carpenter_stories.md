**Story Opening:**

The smell of sawdust and pine was a constant companion to Elijah James Blackwood, clinging to his clothes, his hair, and even, it seemed, his dreams. This morning, it was particularly potent, a sharp tang that scratched at the back of his throat and mirrored the gnawing anxiety in his gut. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, unblemished surface of the cherrywood coffin, the grain swirling like frozen honey under his fingertips. It was beautiful, he had to admit, even as a wave of nausea threatened to overwhelm him. It was also a lie.

**Setting:**

Elijah's workshop, a ramshackle, two-story building perched on the edge of the whispering woods bordering the small town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Inside, the air was thick with dust motes dancing in the slanting morning light that streamed through grimy windows. Tools, both antique and modern, hung from pegboards that lined the walls, each tool meticulously organized and cared for. The scent of wood – cherry, pine, oak, and occasionally, the exotic scent of imported mahogany – permeated everything.

A massive workbench, scarred with years of use and bearing the ghosts of countless projects, dominated the center of the room. It was here that Elijah breathed life into the raw materials, transforming them into furniture, carvings, and, lately, more frequently than he cared to admit, the ornate boxes that would house the dead. The second story, accessible by a creaking wooden staircase, served as storage for lumber and a small, sparsely furnished living space where Elijah retreated when the silence of the woods became too much, or when the weight of his craft threatened to suffocate him entirely.
