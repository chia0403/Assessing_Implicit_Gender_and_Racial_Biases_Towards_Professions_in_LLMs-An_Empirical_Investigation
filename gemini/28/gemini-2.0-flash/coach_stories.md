**Opening:**

The stench of stale coffee and pre-game anxiety hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Vance. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, threatening more of the relentless rain that had plagued their entire season. Ellie, her face etched with lines earned from a lifetime spent battling expectations and adolescent angst, rubbed her temples, trying to stave off the headache that had been building since the moment she woke. Today was it. The regional championship. Win, and they were going to states. Lose… well, let’s just say Ellie hadn’t packed for anything beyond a victory celebration.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolds inside the cramped, utilitarian confines of the visitor's locker room at Northwood High School, the rivals Eleanor and her team, the Crestwood Cougars, had fought tooth and nail with all season. The walls are cinder block painted a depressing shade of institutional grey, chipped in places from years of cleats scraping against them. A long, wooden bench, scarred with graffiti and hastily scribbled plays, runs the length of the room. Lockers, their metal doors dented and adorned with faded team stickers, line the opposite wall. The only splashes of color are the scattered clumps of crimson and grey Crestwood Cougars gear: discarded jerseys, muddy cleats, and the crumpled remains of pre-game pep-talk notes. A single fluorescent light flickers overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the scene. The air is thick with anticipation, and the muffled roar of the burgeoning crowd outside only amplifies the tension within the small, suffocating space. Beyond the locker room door, the rhythmic pounding of basketballs and the shrill whistle of opposing coaches filter through, a constant reminder of the challenge that lies ahead.
