## The Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Ainsworth's Thursday afternoon. She stared, unfocused, at the swirling pattern of the linoleum floor, a sea of muted greys that mirrored the dull ache behind her eyes. Another slow day at Evergreene & Finch, Attorneys at Law.

Penelope sighed, the sound barely audible over the muffled clatter of keyboards from behind the frosted glass doors. Honestly, even a rogue Jehovah's Witness would have been a welcome distraction. The phone, blessedly silent, remained obstinately on the hook. She'd already alphabetized the company directory three times, reorganized the pen cup (again), and even ventured to rearrange the decorative ferns, much to the (silent) disapproval of Mr. Finch, who seemed to think they were strategically placed to absorb bad energy.

Suddenly, the glass doors whirred open, startling Penelope out of her boredom-induced stupor. Not a client. Not a lawyer. Just... him. And with him, a gust of wind that rustled the offending ferns. Penelope sat up straight, smoothed an invisible wrinkle from her perfectly pressed navy skirt, and prepared to deploy her practiced "good afternoon" smile. This was going to be interesting.

## The Setting:

**Evergreene & Finch, Attorneys at Law, occupied the entire 7th floor of the Bradbury Building in downtown Boston.** The building itself was a monument to austere efficiency, a rectangular block of steel and glass that screamed corporate power. Inside, the lobby reflected this pragmatic aesthetic:

*   **Cold and Modern:** The color palette was strictly limited to shades of grey, black, and muted silver. The furniture was sleek and angular, upholstered in a scratchy, vaguely uncomfortable fabric.
*   **Impersonal Ambience:** Besides the two strategically placed (and aggressively green) ferns, the only decoration was a large, abstract sculpture made of polished steel tubing that Penelope had always secretly thought resembled a disassembled vacuum cleaner.
*   **The Reception Desk:** A large, imposing structure made of dark wood and polished granite, it was the focal point of the lobby. It housed Penelope's computer, phone, stationery, and the aforementioned pen cup and company directory. A small, framed photograph of Penelope's cat, Mr. Fluffernutter, sat precariously on the edge, a tiny splash of personality in the otherwise sterile environment.
*   **Frosted Glass Doors:** Lined the back wall, leading to the inner offices. Small brass plaques identified each partner and associate.
*   **Magazine Rack:** Stocked with outdated copies of "Harvard Law Review," "The New Yorker," and "Golf Digest."

The overall impression was one of quiet professionalism, bordering on the intimidating. It was a place where serious business was conducted, and frivolous distractions were discouraged. A place where a bored receptionist named Penelope Ainsworth was slowly losing her mind.
