## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The dust, fine and relentless as desert sand, clung to Elara Venetia Stonecarver's eyelashes, making her blink. Another tap of the hammer, another satisfying *thunk* against the stubborn granite. The stone, still rough and unyielding, was slowly, painstakingly yielding to her will, revealing the barest hint of the hawk that slept within. Elara imagined its feathered breast, the sharp, unwavering gaze of its eyes. These features were still locked deep within the grey, but she saw them, clear as a summer sky. Her breath hitched in her throat, anticipation a familiar ache.

**Setting:**

The setting is the small, isolated village of Oakhaven, nestled in a valley carved deep into the shadow of the Whisperwind Mountains. Life in Oakhaven was dictated by the rhythm of the mountains and the seasons. Winters were long and brutal, snow piling high against the stone houses, turning the village into a silent, white wilderness. Summers, though fleeting, were vibrant, bringing forth wildflowers in riotous colors and swelling the waters of the Silverstream that tumbled through the heart of the valley.

Elara's workshop, a ramshackle lean-to built against the back wall of her small stone cottage, stood at the edge of the village, closest to the quarries that provided her livelihood. Tools lay scattered about - chisels of varying sizes and sharpness, hammers worn smooth with years of use, mallets crafted from sturdy oak. The air hung thick with the smell of dust, the faint metallic tang of iron, and the earthy scent of the mountain stone. Beyond her workshop, the ground sloped upwards, leading to the jagged, grey peaks of the Whisperwinds, perpetually capped with snow, a constant, silent presence in Elara's life.
