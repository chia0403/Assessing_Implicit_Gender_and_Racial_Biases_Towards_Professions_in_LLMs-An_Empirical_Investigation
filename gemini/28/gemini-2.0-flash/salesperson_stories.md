## The Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne. Amy, a Regional Sales Manager for "Innovative Solutions," a purveyor of slightly-outdated yet surprisingly effective office software, chewed the inside of her cheek and stared out the rain-streaked window. The parking lot of the "Rest-Stop Diner" was a sea of grey asphalt reflecting the gloomy, pre-dawn sky. She watched a lone sparrow peck forlornly at a discarded French fry, a mirror of her own mood.

This meeting, scheduled by her demanding boss, Mr. Henderson, was a make-or-break moment. Three weeks, three presentations, and three lukewarm receptions later, Amy was relying on the charm (and cut-rate pricing) she'd perfected over five years to close the deal with "Northern Lumber & Logistics." If she didn't secure this contract, Henderson had made it abundantly clear her quarterly bonus, and potentially her job, were on the line. She took a deep breath, the greasy air doing little to settle the butterflies fluttering in her stomach. Time to put on the Hawthorne charm, even if it felt heavier than the rain threatening to flood the parking lot.

## The Setting:

**Rest-Stop Diner, Outside Millhaven, Wisconsin (Early Autumn):** The diner was a relic of a bygone era, all cracked vinyl booths, chipped Formica tables, and the faint echo of Elvis Presley singing softly from the ancient jukebox in the corner. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the patrons, mostly truckers and weary travelers fueling up before hitting the road again. The air reeked of stale coffee, frying bacon, and a lingering aroma of pine-scented cleaner struggling to mask the accumulated grime of decades. Outside, the landscape was a bleak expanse of rolling hills slowly shedding their autumnal foliage. Millhaven, a small logging town clinging to the edge of a vast, whispering forest, was visible in the distance, its smokestacks painting a dull grey streak across the horizon. It was a town forgotten by time, a fitting backdrop for the outdated software Amy was desperately trying to sell. The weather was typical for early autumn in Wisconsin: cold, damp, and threatening rain.
