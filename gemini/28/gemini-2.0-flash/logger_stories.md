Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a fully-named main character who is a logger:

**Opening:**

The first shudder went right through Ezekiel "Zeke" Tanner’s bones, mimicking the tremble of the ancient Douglas fir he was sizing up. Not the physical tremor, of course. This was a deeper, more primal thing, a hum that resonated with the centuries etched into the tree’s bark. Zeke squinted against the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy, his eyes tracing the imperceptible sway of the colossal trunk. A good one, this. A clean cut, a precise fall, and it would yield enough timber to keep the mill humming for a week. But as he raised his hand to signal to Danny, his spotter down below, that deeper shiver returned, whispering a warning he couldn't quite decipher. Maybe it was just the coffee, or maybe it was the old Indian stories his grandmother used to tell him about spirits dwelling in the heart of the forest. Whatever it was, it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, and for a moment, Ezekiel Tanner hesitated.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the heart of the Olympic National Forest in Washington State, specifically in the Hoh River Valley. This is a region known for its dense rainforest, characterized by towering evergreen trees draped in moss, ferns covering the forest floor, and a persistent, damp mist that hangs in the air. The year is 1978. The logging operation is situated on a relatively steep hillside, a patchwork of clear-cut areas interspersed with stands of old-growth forest. The air smells of damp earth, pine needles, and the ever-present scent of gasoline and motor oil from the logging equipment. A muddy logging road winds through the area, connecting the felling site to the nearby mill town of Forks, a town defined by its reliance on the timber industry. The rugged terrain and unpredictable weather make logging a dangerous and demanding profession, but it's a way of life that Ezekiel Tanner has known since he was a boy.
