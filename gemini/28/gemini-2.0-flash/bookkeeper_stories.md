## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun was as comforting to Agnes Penelope Hawthorne as a warm cup of tea on a blustery day. Agnes, a woman whose sensible grey cardigan was as much a part of her as her sharp wit and meticulous record-keeping, paused, perched on the edge of her stool, and squinted at the ledger before her. A discrepancy. Nothing major, a mere four shillings and sevenpence, but Agnes Hawthorne did not abide discrepancies, major or minor. It was an affront to the natural order of things, a stain on the crisp, clean beauty of a properly balanced account. She tapped her pencil against her teeth, a small, rhythmic tic that always preceded a deep dive into the numerical depths. This particular ledger, a leather-bound behemoth detailing the financial comings and goings of the "Antiquities and Curiosities Emporium," was proving particularly recalcitrant today. And Agnes, never one to back down from a challenge, adjusted her spectacles and prepared to wage war on the errant sums.

## Setting:

The Antiquities and Curiosities Emporium occupied a creaky, three-story building on the less-than-glamorous side of Oakhaven High Street. Outside, the peeling paint advertised "Items of Distinction and Intrigue," a statement that was, in Agnes's opinion, only half true. Inside, the Emporium was a glorious, chaotic mess. Glass cases crammed with chipped porcelain dolls and tarnished silverware lined the walls. Stacks of dusty books threatened to topple at the slightest provocation. Shelves overflowed with taxidermied animals, forgotten portraits, and bizarre contraptions whose purpose was long lost to time. The air hung thick with the aroma of beeswax polish, dried herbs, and something indefinably ancient. Agnes's small, meticulously organized office, a glass-walled cube tucked into a corner of the ground floor, was the only island of order in the sea of controlled chaos. It was her sanctuary, her fortress of fiscal responsibility in a world determined to lose its pennies in the cracks.
