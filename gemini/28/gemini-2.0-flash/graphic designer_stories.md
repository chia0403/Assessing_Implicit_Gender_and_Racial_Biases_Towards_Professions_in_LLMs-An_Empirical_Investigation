Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the full name of our graphic designer protagonist:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt sugar and desperation hung thick in the air of "The Daily Grind," a name which, ironically, served as a constant reminder of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's current predicament. She stared blearily at the chipped Formica tabletop, tracing the faint ring left by someone’s lukewarm coffee. Just twenty minutes until her meeting with Mr. Stern, and the ad campaign for "Stern's Strictly Steaks" was… well, it was a disaster. Her initial, confident vision of a sleek, modern approach had morphed into a chaotic mess of clip-art cows and garish fonts that screamed "Budget BBQ."

Outside, the persistent drumming of rain against the awning mirrored the frantic beat of her heart. She’d pulled an all-nighter, fueled by instant ramen and sheer willpower, but the resulting designs looked less like professional marketing materials and more like a cry for help. Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, the reflection of the neon "OPEN" sign bleeding across her vision. This project was make-or-break. If she lost Stern's, she might as well pack up her Wacom tablet and become a… a mime. The thought was almost appealing.

**Setting:**

*   **Place:** "The Daily Grind," a small, somewhat run-down coffee shop on the outskirts of the industrial district of **Port Blossom, Oregon**. It's the kind of place where truckers grab a quick bite, office workers fuel up before their shifts, and freelancers like Amelia hole up trying to meet deadlines. The interior is a mishmash of mismatched furniture, faded posters advertising local events, and the constant hum of the espresso machine. The large windows face a busy street, but today, they offer only a blurred view of the relentless rain.

*   **Time:** 7:40 AM, a Tuesday in late October. The sky is a perpetually overcast gray, and the air is damp and chilly.
