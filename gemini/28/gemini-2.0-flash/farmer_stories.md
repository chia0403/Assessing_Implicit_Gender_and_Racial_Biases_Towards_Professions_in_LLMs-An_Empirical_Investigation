The wind, a bitter, biting thing off the Saskatchewan plains, clawed at the frayed edges of Elmer Oliphant’s plaid shirt as he surveyed his field. The sun, a weak and watery disc behind a scrim of grey clouds, offered little warmth, and the stubble of last year’s wheat stood brittle and unforgiving against the frozen ground. Elmer, all six-foot-three of him, his frame hardened by decades of wrestling a living from this land, rubbed a gloved hand over his grizzled jaw.

His farm, Oliphant & Sons – though the "Sons" part was wishful thinking these days, what with both boys having traded wheat for Wi-Fi in the distant allure of Calgary – stretched out before him in a vast, monotonous grid. It was late March, still too early for planting, but Elmer was impatient. He’d spent the winter poring over seed catalogs, analyzing soil samples, and arguing with the bank manager about another loan, all fuelled by the stubborn hope that this year, *this* year, would be different. This year the rain would come at the right time, the pests would stay away, and the price of wheat wouldn't plummet faster than a hawk on a mouse. This year, Oliphant & Sons wouldn’t just survive; it would thrive.

The farmhouse, a squat, boxy structure painted a faded shade of yellow, stood huddled against a windbreak of skeletal poplars about a quarter mile away. Its windows, usually winking welcomingly, were dark and dull this morning, reflecting the oppressive sky. It had been a long winter, a lonely winter, and Elmer could feel the weight of it settling on his shoulders like the leaden sky above. But spring was coming. He could smell it in the faint, earthy scent that even the frozen ground couldn’t entirely suppress. And Elmer Oliphant, like the wheat waiting beneath the surface, was ready to break free.
