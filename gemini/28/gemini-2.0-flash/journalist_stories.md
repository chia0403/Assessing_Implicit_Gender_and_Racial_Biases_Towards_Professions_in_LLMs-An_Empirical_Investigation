**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Hayes' cheeks as she stood outside the decaying grandeur of the Medill Mansion on Chicago's Gold Coast. The late October air, thick with the scent of damp leaves and impending snow, seemed to seep into the very stone of the imposing structure. Once a symbol of Gilded Age opulence, the mansion now stood cloaked in shadows, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the glittering city skyline. A single, flickering gas lamp cast an eerie glow across the overgrown lawn, barely illuminating the 'KEEP OUT' signs haphazardly tacked to the wrought-iron gates.

**Opening:** Amelia Hayes, her gloved hands numb despite the layers, pulled her wool scarf tighter around her face. She squinted at the mansion, a knot of nervous anticipation tightening in her stomach. Tonight, she was trespassing. Tonight, Amelia Hayes, investigative journalist for the *Chicago Sentinel*, was finally going to uncover the truth behind the Medill Curse, a local legend dismissed by most as urban folklore but one that had haunted her family for generations. Her grandfather, a history professor, had been obsessed with the Medill Mansion, convinced a dark secret lay hidden within its walls. He'd died ten years ago, his research unfinished, leaving Amelia with a burning curiosity and a box of cryptic notes. Now, armed with a flashlight, a lock pick set, and her grandfather's fragmented theories, she was determined to pick up where he left off, even if it meant risking everything to enter this abandoned tomb.
