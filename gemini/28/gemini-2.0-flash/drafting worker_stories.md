Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a drafting worker named Evelyn Beatrice Sinclair:

**Setting:**

The year is 1936. The dust still whispers through the air in Oklahoma City, a gritty reminder of the devastating Dust Bowl that choked the life out of the region just a few years prior. The city, however, is clinging stubbornly to hope, fuelled by the black gold beneath its feet. Drilling rigs punctuate the skyline, and a new energy hums in the air, a promise of prosperity that clings to the grime-coated windows of the Petroleum Building on Robert S. Kerr Avenue. Inside, the air is thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of ink, blueprints, and desperation.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Beatrice Sinclair tightened her grip on the T-square, the cool metal a small comfort against the nervous sweat blooming on her palms. The afternoon sun, weak and watery through the grimy window, cast a long shadow across her drawing board, obscuring the delicate lines of the proposed drilling platform. She cursed under her breath, carefully adjusting her lamp to chase away the gloom.

A tremor ran through the floor, a familiar vibration caused by the incessant pounding of machinery extracting oil from the earth beneath them. Evelyn had grown used to it, almost deaf to the constant drone, but today it felt like a portent, a physical manifestation of the anxiety gnawing at her insides.

Today was the day. The day she presented her revised design to Mr. Harding, the chief engineer and a man whose temperament was as volatile as the nitroglycerin used in fracturing wells. If he approved, her design would be implemented on the new “Mammoth Gusher” rig, a project that could secure the future of the Sinclair family and prove, once and for all, that a woman could thrive in the unforgiving world of oil and gas drafting. If he disapproved… well, Evelyn didn't want to think about that.
