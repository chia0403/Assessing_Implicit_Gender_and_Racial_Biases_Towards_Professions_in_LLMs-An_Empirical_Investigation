**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights in the Grant & Sterling Publications office was a familiar comfort to Eleanor Vance. Comfort, and a low-grade headache inducer. Tonight, however, the hum was drowned out by the frenetic tapping of her keyboard, a sound she was determined to keep going until the last page of "Crimson Shadows," a vampire romance novel that was somehow both incredibly terrible and potentially lucrative, was wrestled into something resembling acceptable prose. It was past midnight, and the only other souls haunting the twenty-second floor were the security guard, who gave her a sympathetic wave on his rounds, and the ghosts of countless unpublished manuscripts yearning for her touch. Eleanor rubbed her tired eyes, took a long swig of lukewarm coffee, and dove back in, determined to excise yet another clich√© from a scene involving a moonlit graveyard and a brooding immortal.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the offices of **Grant & Sterling Publications** in midtown Manhattan. Located on the 22nd floor of a nondescript, steel-and-glass office building, the interior is a study in beige and corporate blandness. Rows of cubicles, separated by low, fabric-covered partitions, stretch across the open floor plan. Each cubicle is a personal island in a sea of paperwork and half-empty coffee cups. Eleanor's cubicle is slightly more personalized than most, adorned with a few quirky postcards, a small, struggling succulent named "Leaf Erickson," and an overflowing stack of manuscripts she really, really needed to get to. Beyond the cubicle farm are the more spacious offices of the senior editors and executives, identifiable by their slightly larger desks and framed artwork that probably cost more than Eleanor's annual salary. A small, communal kitchen area offers a haven for caffeine addicts and microwave enthusiasts. The entire space is perpetually lit by harsh, unforgiving fluorescent lights, making it feel perpetually like midday, regardless of the actual time. Outside, the twinkling lights of the city skyline offer a tantalizing glimpse of a world that isn't quite as beige.
