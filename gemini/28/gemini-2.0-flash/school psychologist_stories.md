Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a school psychologist:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune in the cramped office of Dr. Amelia Grace Harrington, school psychologist for Northwood High. The room was a testament to controlled chaos: stacks of student files teetered precariously on every surface, vying for space with colorful posters promising “Growth Mindset” and “Self-Care Strategies.” A half-eaten apple sat forlornly in a ceramic mug on her desk, surrounded by an army of brightly colored sticky notes. The aroma of stale coffee and simmering anxiety hung heavy in the air, a typical Tuesday morning cocktail at Northwood. Through the dusty blinds, Amelia could just make out the hazy outline of the school's football field, where, no doubt, some poor kid was being yelled at for dropping a pass.

**Opening:** Dr. Amelia Grace Harrington stared at the notification blinking on her computer screen, a small, red flag in the otherwise beige landscape of her workday. It was a referral – a student named Liam Davies, reportedly exhibiting "unspecified behavioral issues" in AP Calculus. Amelia sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Liam Davies. The name was vaguely familiar, probably one of the many faces blurring together in the endless stream of adolescents struggling to navigate the treacherous waters of high school. Usually, "unspecified behavioral issues" translated to "talking back" or "not paying attention," easily remedied with a gentle conversation and perhaps a chat with his parents. But something about the hurried, almost panicked tone of the email from Mr. Henderson, Liam's calculus teacher, set Amelia's teeth on edge. This felt different.
