## Story Opening:

The stale scent of rain-soaked pavement clung to Arthur Reginald Finch like a shroud as he pushed open the frosted glass door of "O’Malley’s Irish Pub." The sudden blast of warm air, thick with the aroma of stale beer and frying onions, was a welcome relief from the November chill that had been gnawing at his bones for the past hour. He shook the damp from his fedora, the movement revealing a hairline that was receding faster than a disgraced politician after an election. Across the crowded room, beneath a flickering neon shamrock, he spotted the man he was looking for: a beefy figure hunched over a pint of Guinness, his face obscured by the brim of a similarly sodden hat. Arthur sighed, the sound a tired rasp in the smoky air. This was shaping up to be one of those nights. He just hoped it didn’t end the way he suspected it would – with a broken nose and another unpaid bill.

## Setting:

**O’Malley’s Irish Pub**, located in the grimy underbelly of **Millhaven, a coastal city clinging to the edge of the Atlantic in the year 1947**. Millhaven was a city of contrasts: gleaming yachts bobbing in the harbor just a few blocks from crumbling tenements, silk-stockinged debutantes tripping over cobblestones beside weary dockworkers. O’Malley’s was a sanctuary for the city’s forgotten men, a haven of cheap whiskey, tall tales, and simmering resentment. The walls were a greasy, faded green, adorned with dusty pictures of Irish freedom fighters and faded advertisements for long-gone breweries. The floor, worn smooth by countless footsteps, was sticky with spilled drinks. The air perpetually hung thick with smoke and the murmur of hushed conversations, punctuated by the occasional burst of raucous laughter or the mournful wail of a blues record on the jukebox. It was a place where secrets festered and desperation bloomed, a perfect backdrop for the kind of trouble that usually found Arthur Reginald Finch.
