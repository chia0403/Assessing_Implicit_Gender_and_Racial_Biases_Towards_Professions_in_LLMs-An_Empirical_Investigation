Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a main character who works in emergency medical care:

**Story Opening:**

The scream was a jagged shard of glass, ripping through the quiet predawn. Amelia "Amy" Rivera felt it prick her awake, even through the thin walls of the EMT dorm.  One moment, she was lost in a dream where she was finally, finally getting some decent sleep; the next, adrenaline was flooding her system, the phantom weight of her jump kit already pressing against her shoulder. She bolted upright, heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs.  Outside, the wind howled, whipping off the Atlantic with a bitter bite that promised a long, brutal day.  "Rivera, to dispatch, Code 3!" the tinny voice squawked from the radio sitting on her bedside table. Code 3. Lights and sirens. Someone was having the worst day of their life, and Amy was about to be invited.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Provincetown, Massachusetts**, during a relentless late-November Nor'easter.  Provincetown, at the tip of Cape Cod, is a place of stark beauty even on a good day, with its weathered clapboard houses clinging to the dunes, the salty air thick with the scent of the sea, and the ever-present call of gulls. However, during this storm, the beauty is brutal, almost hostile.

*   **The EMT Dorm:** A converted section of the aging town hall, barely insulated against the elements. It smells faintly of disinfectant, stale coffee, and the faint metallic tang of blood â€“ lingering reminders of the lives they touch.
*   **The Town:** Ptown, usually vibrant and bustling, is mostly shuttered and deserted, with only the most hardy souls venturing out into the gale. The narrow streets are slick with rain and sand, and the power flickers intermittently.
*   **The Landscape:** The beaches are battered by monstrous waves, the iconic Pilgrim Monument shrouded in mist and rain. The wind howls through the dunes, carrying the sting of salt spray and the threat of downed power lines.

**Main Character:**

**Amelia "Amy" Rivera** - A 28-year-old EMT. She is dedicated, compassionate, and fiercely protective of the people in her community. Despite her calm demeanor during emergencies, she is haunted by a previous incident she was involved in. She is determined to live up to her duty and help those in need.
