## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped in Arthur Peabody's sweaty palm, slamming his knuckles against the cold, unforgiving iron of the pipe. He hissed, sucking in a breath that fogged the already humid air of Mrs. Higginbottom's basement. "Blast it all," he muttered, the sound echoing in the cavernous space filled with dust motes dancing in the single, naked lightbulb hanging precariously from the rafters. He needed to get this leak fixed, and fast. The water meter was spinning like a demented roulette wheel and Mrs. Higginbottom, a woman who could curdle milk with a glare, was upstairs, tapping her orthopedic shoe and occasionally shouting down demands for a detailed, and preferably discounted, explanation.

## Setting:

The setting is the **damp, dimly lit basement of Mrs. Elara Higginbottom's Victorian home** in the small, sleepy town of Oakhaven. The house itself is a hulking, gingerbread-trimmed structure that has seen better days. Paint is peeling, the porch sags, and the overall impression is one of genteel decay. The basement, however, is a different beast altogether. It's a maze of exposed pipes, cobwebs clinging to everything, and haphazardly stacked boxes filled with forgotten relics of decades past. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth, mildew, and something vaguely resembling mothballs. A single, unreliable lightbulb casts long, distorted shadows, making it feel larger and more menacing than it actually is. The only sound besides Arthur's occasional grunts and curses is the persistent *drip, drip, drip* of the leaky pipe, a constant reminder of the problem at hand, and the escalating impatience of the homeowner upstairs.
