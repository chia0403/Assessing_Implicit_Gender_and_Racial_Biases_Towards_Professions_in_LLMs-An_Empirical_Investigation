The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the damp strands of hair clinging to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's apron. Rain lashed against the single, grimy window of her salon, "Shear Madness," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley.  Sera, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of dye from a particularly vibrant magenta job earlier that afternoon, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  Inside, the salon was a cozy chaos:  half-finished dye bowls sat precariously on a chipped Formica counter next to a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, the air thick with the comforting aroma of hairspray and vanilla-scented conditioner battling the pervasive smell of wet concrete.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt oppressive, mirroring the storm raging outside and, perhaps, the storm brewing inside Sera herself.
