The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate open.  Rust groaned a mournful protest with each heave, echoing the desolate beauty of the landscape around her.  The Shetland pony farm, nestled deep within the windswept glens of the Scottish Highlands, sprawled before her, a patchwork of muddy paddocks dotted with shaggy, wind-battered ponies.  A thin, persistent drizzle clung to the heather, turning the already bleak moorland into a watercolour of greys and muted greens.  The air smelled of damp earth, peat smoke from a distant croft, and something else… something faintly metallic, a scent that pricked at Eleanor's professional instincts, sharpening the already keen edge of her apprehension.  This wasn't just a routine call-out;  something felt profoundly wrong.
