The salt spray stung Chef Aurelia “Rella” Dubois’s face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, the fishing trawler rocking gently in the choppy waters of the North Sea.  The pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, the only light coming from the scattered fishing boats bobbing like errant corks in the vast, inky expanse.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, carried a sharper, more alluring scent – the unmistakable tang of freshly caught haddock, still glistening with the sea's chill.  Rella pulled her thick wool scarf tighter, the biting wind a stark contrast to the warmth she planned to conjure in the galley below, where the day's culinary battle would begin.  This wasn't some fancy Parisian restaurant; this was the *Sea Serpent*, her floating kitchen, and today's menu was dictated by the unpredictable bounty of the ocean.
