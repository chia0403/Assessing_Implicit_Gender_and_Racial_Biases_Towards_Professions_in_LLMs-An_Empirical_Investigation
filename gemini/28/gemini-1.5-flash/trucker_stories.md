The pre-dawn chill bit at Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's cheeks, a familiar sting that mirrored the gnawing emptiness in his stomach.

The air hung heavy with the scent of creosote and diesel, a fragrance Zeke knew as intimately as his own name.  His rig, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," rumbled softly, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unnerving quiet of the Mojave Desert.  He’d been hauling a load of mining equipment from Ely to Las Vegas, a monotonous run he’d made countless times, but this trip felt different. A prickling unease, as sharp as the desert wind, clung to him, promising trouble ahead.
