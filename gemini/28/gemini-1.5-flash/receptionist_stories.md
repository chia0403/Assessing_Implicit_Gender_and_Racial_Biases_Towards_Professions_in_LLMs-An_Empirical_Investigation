The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Penelope "Penny" Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails on the polished mahogany desk.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air of the reception area, a miniature, swirling galaxy mirroring the chaotic swirl of emotions currently churning within Penny.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the skyscraper's windows and promising a blizzard of epic proportions.  Inside, the only sound besides the humming lights and Penny's tapping was the insistent, irritating drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet in the nearly deserted restroom down the hall.  It was 6:07 PM, officially past quitting time, and Penny was still fielding calls for Mr. Harrison, the notoriously elusive CEO, who was, as usual, "in a meeting" â€“ a meeting that had, according to Penny's internal clock, been ongoing for at least four hours.
