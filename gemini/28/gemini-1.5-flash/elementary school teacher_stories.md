The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom desk flaked onto the worn, floral-patterned tablecloth she used to protect it.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Hawthorne Elementary, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted fireflies. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient oak tree whose branches scraped against the school’s brick facade.  Inside, however, a strange sort of calm reigned.  The usual post-lunch chaos of chattering children and rustling papers was absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness.  Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from the school’s founding decades ago, broke the silence, each second a tiny hammer blow against Eleanor's growing unease.  The scent of stale crayons and impending rain hung heavy in the air.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and Eleanor Vance, fourth-grade teacher extraordinaire and unwitting participant in a most peculiar mystery, knew it in the pit of her stomach.
