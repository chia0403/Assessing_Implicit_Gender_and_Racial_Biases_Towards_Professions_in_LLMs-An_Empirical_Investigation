The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s elbow, a tremor mirroring the anxiety churning in her stomach.  Amelia, or Amy as most of the regulars at the Rusty Mug called her, braced herself against the rush.  It was Friday night, the unholy hour when the scent of stale beer and desperation hung thick in the air, clinging to the worn, vinyl booths like a second skin.  The Rusty Mug itself was a relic, a time capsule of faded glory nestled on the wrong side of the tracks in the perpetually twilight town of Havenwood.  Its walls, once a vibrant mahogany, were now a patchwork of scuffs and scratches, a testament to countless spilled drinks and late-night arguments.  The air conditioner sputtered a weak protest against the summer heat, battling a losing war against the collective body odor and the lingering aroma of fried onion rings.  Amy, perched precariously on a wobbly stool behind the counter, adjusted her name tag – slightly askew, as always – and took a deep breath.  Another Friday night, another wave of demanding customers, and another chance to survive until her next shift.
