The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestone street.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the reflections in the puddles.

It wasn't the weather that unsettled Eleanor, though; it was the oppressive atmosphere clinging to the very stones of the manor, a palpable sense of sorrow and secrets that seemed to seep from its ancient, decaying walls. This wasn’t her usual suburban practice in leafy, affluent Oakhaven; this was Blackwood, a village steeped in legend and shrouded in a chilling, persistent mist, both literal and metaphorical. Tonight, she was here to meet her newest patient, and the chilling premonition she carried was far more unsettling than the November chill.
