The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a rosy red that clashed horribly with the sickly yellow of the gaslight spilling from the nearby pub.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her dark coat to her thin frame.  She pulled her worn shawl tighter, the damp wool doing little to ward off the chill that seeped into her bones, mirroring the chill that had settled deep within her soul.  Amelia, a painter of renowned – albeit somewhat melancholic – landscapes, stood hunched on the cobbled lane overlooking the storm-tossed harbour of Port Blossom, her easel a forlorn sentinel against the encroaching darkness.  The once-vibrant colours of her half-finished canvas, depicting the usually majestic cliffs of Blackrock, were now muted, mirroring the grey despair that clung to the town like the clinging sea mist.  Tonight, even the usually boisterous cries of the gulls were swallowed by the relentless roar of the ocean.
