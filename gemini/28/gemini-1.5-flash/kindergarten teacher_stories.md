The scent of dried paint and slightly-too-sweet apple juice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the oversized windows of Sunny Meadows Kindergarten, danced in the golden light.  Crayon shavings littered the brightly coloured carpet, a testament to the day’s creative chaos.  Outside, the familiar cacophony of the playground – squeals, shouts, and the rhythmic thud of tiny feet on asphalt – gradually subsided as the last of the parents collected their offspring.  Eleanor, perched on a tiny, wobbly chair at her desk, meticulously cleaned a stubborn blob of glitter glue from a miniature firetruck, a sigh escaping her lips.  The day had been… eventful.  To put it mildly.
