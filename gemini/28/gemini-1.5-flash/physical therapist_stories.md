The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn kayak onto the rocky shore.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the pewter sky, cast long shadows across the jagged teeth of the Maine coastline.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the granite cliffs.  Eleanor, her usually pristine white scrubs now speckled with sand and seawater, hauled the kayak higher, its fiberglass hull groaning under the effort. This wasn't exactly the typical post-work routine for a physical therapist, but then again, Eleanor Vance wasn't your typical physical therapist.  Her patients weren't confined to sterile hospital rooms; her clinic was the rugged, unforgiving beauty of the Maine coast itself.
