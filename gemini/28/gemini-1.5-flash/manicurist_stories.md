The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather like a second skin.  Sera, owner and sole operator of "Nails of Serenity," adjusted the tiny, flickering fairy lights strung across the ceiling of her cramped but charming salon, nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  Rain hammered against the aged, windowpanes, a steady rhythm that punctuated the soft hum of the electric file.  Outside, the wrought-iron balconies of the antebellum houses dripped with water, their shadows lengthening in the rapidly darkening twilight.  Inside, the only illumination came from the fairy lights and the gentle glow of the lamp on her manicure table, casting long, dancing shadows across the rich mahogany and the meticulously organized collection of polishes lining the wall.  Tonight, however, the usual calm of her sanctuary felt… different.  A prickling unease, sharper than the sting of a rogue cuticle, settled in Sera's stomach.  Something was coming.
