The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Stone, owner of "The Snip & Stitch," could concoct.  Her tiny salon, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port town of Seabrook, was a chaotic symphony of textures and colours.  Sun-bleached wooden floors creaked underfoot, worn smooth by years of shuffling clients and the rhythmic sweep of Amelia's broom.  Rows of vintage hair dryers, their chrome gleaming despite years of faithful service, hummed a low, comforting drone.  Walls painted a vibrant teal, almost the colour of the stormy sea just beyond the window, were adorned with mismatched mirrors reflecting the kaleidoscope of hair colours currently under Amelia's expert care: fiery red, shimmering auburn, a shocking streak of electric blue.  Outside, the gulls cried, a constant, melancholic soundtrack to the intimate rhythm of scissors slicing through hair.
