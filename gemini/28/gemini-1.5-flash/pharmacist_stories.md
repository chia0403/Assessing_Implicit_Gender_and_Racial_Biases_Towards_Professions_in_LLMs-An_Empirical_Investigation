The bell above the door of "Apothecary's Haven" jingled a discordant welcome to Elara Vance, a sound as jarring to her meticulously ordered day as a dropped mortar and pestle.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of her shop, blurring the already fading twilight of a November evening in the quaint, cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Inside, the air hung thick with the comforting aroma of dried herbs and chamomile tea, a stark contrast to the damp chill seeping in from the storm.  Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, meticulously polished a glass vial, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Oakhaven, despite its sleepy charm, was anything but peaceful; a simmering unease had settled over the town, a quiet dread that mirrored the relentless drumming of the rain outside.
