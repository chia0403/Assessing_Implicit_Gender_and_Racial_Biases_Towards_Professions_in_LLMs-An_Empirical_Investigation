The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant stage door.  Rust groaned in protest with every heave, a sound almost as mournful as the empty theatre itself.  The Grand Majestic, once a beacon of glittering Broadway glamour, now stood shrouded in a melancholy twilight, its faded gilt lettering barely visible under a grime-laden sky.  Inside, the cavernous space echoed with the ghosts of a thousand performances – the thunderous applause, the hushed whispers of anticipation, the bittersweet silence of the curtain call. Tonight, however, only the rasping wind and the distant wail of a siren filled the vast auditorium.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool coat despite the indoor chill, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The premiere of her ambitious new production, "The Serpent's Kiss," was only a week away, and the Grand Majestic, with its crumbling grandeur and echoing emptiness, felt less like a stage and more like a mausoleum.
