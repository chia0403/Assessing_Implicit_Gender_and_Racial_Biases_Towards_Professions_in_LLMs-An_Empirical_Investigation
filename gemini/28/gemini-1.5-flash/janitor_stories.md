The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's nightly ritual.  Elias, a man whose shoulders slumped under the weight of forty-two years and countless mops, pushed his cleaning cart through the cavernous silence of the Blackwood Museum of Natural History.  Dust motes, disturbed by his passage, danced in the pale light, illuminating the towering skeletons of dinosaurs and the glassy eyes of taxidermied creatures.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged wood, formaldehyde, and a faint, almost imperceptible sweetness â€“ the lingering perfume of a forgotten visitor, perhaps, or something far more ancient. Tonight, however, a sharper, metallic tang cut through the familiar aromas, a smell Elias couldn't quite place, and it prickled at the back of his neck, making the hairs on his arms stand on end.
