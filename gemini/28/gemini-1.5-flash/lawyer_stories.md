The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering gaslight cast long, distorted shadows across the worn Persian rug, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, malevolent spirits.  Her office, perched precariously on the fifth floor of a crumbling Victorian building overlooking the perpetually fog-shrouded docks of Grimsborough, was usually a haven of calm, a sanctuary from the chaos of her legal battles.  Tonight, however, it felt like a cage.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, damp wool, and a lingering whiff of something decidedly unpleasant – something akin to brine and decay.  Amelia took a shaky breath, the scent momentarily overwhelming the faint aroma of the chamomile.  This case, the Blackwood Estate dispute, was unlike anything she’d ever encountered, and the unsettling premonition clinging to her like the Grimsborough fog was growing stronger with each passing second.
