The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of jasmine and lilies, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Willow Creek.  A thin, persistent drizzle slicked the windowpanes of "Petals & Promises," obscuring the already fading light of a late November afternoon.  Inside, amidst a riot of autumnal colours – fiery chrysanthemums, deep burgundy dahlias, and sprays of russet-hued leaves –  Amelia Grace Hawthorne carefully pruned the wilting petals of a particularly magnificent amaryllis.  Her fingers, stained a gentle ochre from the pollen, moved with a practiced grace, a silent conversation between florist and flower.  The bell above the door chimed a discordant counterpoint to the soft hum of the refrigerator, announcing the arrival of a customer – and potentially, Amelia thought, the disruption of her carefully curated peace.
