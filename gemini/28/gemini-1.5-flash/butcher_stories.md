The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood and iron, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, but tonight, it carried a sharper tang, something metallic andâ€¦off.  Barty, his apron stained crimson from a day spent wrestling sides of beef, leaned against the cool, damp stone of his butcher shop's back wall, the flickering gaslight painting long shadows that danced with the swaying carcasses hanging from the ceiling.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Butterfield's Best Cuts, a rhythmic drumming that competed with the unsettling squeak of the shop's ancient meat grinder.  Outside, the cobblestones of Grimsborough's Crooked Alley gleamed slickly under the downpour, reflecting the murky glow of the gas lamps in a distorted, unsettling way.  The alley, usually a cacophony of drunken shouts and the clatter of carts, was tonight unnervingly silent, save for the relentless rain and the unsettling prickle of Barty's unease.
