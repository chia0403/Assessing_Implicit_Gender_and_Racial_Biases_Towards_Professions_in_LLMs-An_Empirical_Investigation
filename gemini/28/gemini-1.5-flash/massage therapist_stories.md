The scent of sandalwood and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the persistent drizzle drumming against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Rain lashed against the quaint Victorian storefront, blurring the gaslight glow reflecting off the polished mahogany reception desk.  Inside, however, a comforting warmth radiated from the flickering fireplace, casting dancing shadows across the plush, embroidered throws draped over the waiting area’s antique settee.  Amelia Katherine Hawthorne, her name as elegant and calming as the ambiance she’d painstakingly cultivated, sighed contentedly.  Another slow Tuesday evening at the spa was shaping up to be exactly what she needed after a particularly demanding week.  The only sound, aside from the persistent rain, was the gentle hum of the aromatherapy diffuser, releasing its soothing blend into the already tranquil atmosphere.
