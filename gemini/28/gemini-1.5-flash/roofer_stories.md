The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian monstrosity.  Below, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, nestled in the shadow of the brooding Peak District, were slick with rain, reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Gargoyles, carved with grotesque detail, leered down at Elias from their perches, their stone faces mirroring the grim satisfaction he felt at nearing the end of a particularly grueling day. The air, thick with the smell of damp slate and woodsmoke, carried the distant, mournful toll of St. Jude's church bell, a sound Elias usually found comforting, but tonight it only served to amplify the gnawing loneliness that settled in his bones like the encroaching frost.
