Rain hammered a rhythm against the ancient, oak-framed building, a counterpoint to the quiet snip-snip-snip of her scissors, a sound as familiar and comforting as her own heartbeat.  This was her sanctuary, her kingdom; a tiny, cluttered haven on the cobbled backstreets of the perpetually damp, but undeniably charming, town of Oakhaven.
