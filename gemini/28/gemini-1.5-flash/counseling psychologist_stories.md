The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office door seemed to sigh under the weight of another Tuesday afternoon.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting rays of the late October sun, danced in the air, a silent ballet performed for an audience of only one – a wilting spider plant clinging precariously to a shelf overflowing with self-help books.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the grounds of the Ashwood Clinic, a fitting soundtrack to the melancholic atmosphere that often permeated the building.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old paper and something faintly floral, a perfume Eleanor suspected belonged to Mrs. Gable, the receptionist, whose floral arrangements were as vibrant and chaotic as her personality.  Eleanor, however, found solace in the quiet predictability of her own small, slightly cluttered sanctuary.  The worn leather armchair opposite her desk, the perpetually half-empty mug of chamomile tea, even the scratchy sound of the old analog clock ticking away the minutes – these were constants in a world where everything else seemed relentlessly fluid.
