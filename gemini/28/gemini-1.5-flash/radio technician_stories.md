The smell of ozone and burnt solder hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of his workshop, illuminating a chaotic landscape of disassembled radios, tangled wires, and half-empty tins of flux.  Outside, the relentless, humid breath of the Louisiana bayou swirled around the ramshackle building, its cypress siding warped and grey with age.  Elias, a man whose life was as intricately woven as the circuits he repaired, hunched over a battered Zenith Trans-Oceanic, his brow furrowed in concentration. The static crackle from the partially dismantled radio was a counterpoint to the rhythmic chirping of unseen crickets outside, a soundtrack to his solitary existence in the forgotten corner of Bayou Lafourche.
