The chipped paint of the "Guidance Counselor" sign on Ms. Eleanor Vance's door seemed to mirror the chipped edges of her own weary optimism.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday that felt like it had been marinated in lukewarm despair.

Rain lashed against the panoramic window overlooking the perpetually soggy football field, mirroring the stormy emotions that brewed within the walls of the otherwise unremarkable brick building.  The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous soundtrack to the quiet chaos of the day, a day that, even at 7:45 AM, already promised to be anything but ordinary.
