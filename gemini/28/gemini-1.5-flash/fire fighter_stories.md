The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Captain Elias Thorne's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like this.  Crimson and orange flames licked at the skeletal remains of what had once been a proud old oak, its branches now twisted pyres against the inky canvas of the Montana night sky.  Around him, the rhythmic hiss of water against burning timber formed a counterpoint to the crackle and roar of the inferno.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and burning earth, hung heavy and still, broken only by the frantic shouts of his crew and the mournful wail of the fire engines parked a respectful distance away, their lights painting the scene in a macabre strobe show.  The blaze, sparked by a carelessly discarded campfire, was already threatening several acres of the Blacktail Deer Mountain wilderness area â€“ a cherished sanctuary Elias had hiked countless times, its familiar trails now a maze of fiery destruction.
