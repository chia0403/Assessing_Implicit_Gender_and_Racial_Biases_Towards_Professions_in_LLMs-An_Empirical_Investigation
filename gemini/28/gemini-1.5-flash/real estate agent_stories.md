The salt spray stung Aurelia "Relia" Davenport's face as she wrestled the rogue strand of auburn hair from her eyes.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the windswept cliffs overlooking the craggy coastline of  Port Blossom, Maine.

The scent of brine and decaying seaweed hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the faint, almost imperceptible perfume of lilies that clung stubbornly to her despite the relentless wind.  This wasn't your average open house; this was a gamble, a desperate hope clinging to the ragged edges of a crumbling cliff face, just like the house itself.
