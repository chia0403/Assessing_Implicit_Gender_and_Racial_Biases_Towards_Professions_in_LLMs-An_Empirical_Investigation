The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, its icy fingers trying to pry the single-engine plane from the frozen expanse of Lake Iliamna.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and the almost imperceptible sweetness of thawing permafrost, a deceptive perfume masking the brutal reality of the Alaskan winter.  Evie, bundled in layers of fleece and Gore-Tex, shivered not from the cold, but from a nervous energy that buzzed beneath her thick parka.  The radio crackled to life, spitting static before a voice, strained and urgent, cut through the white noise.  It was a call for help, a desperate plea from a remote fishing camp, stranded miles from civilization by a sudden blizzard.  The coordinates were chillingly familiar â€“ a place Evie knew all too well, a place that held a painful memory buried deep beneath the layers of her own hardened exterior.
