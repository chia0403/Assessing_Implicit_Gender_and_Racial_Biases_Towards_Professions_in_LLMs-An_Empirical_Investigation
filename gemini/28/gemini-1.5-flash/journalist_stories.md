The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into her worn wool coat.  Rain, icy and relentless, plastered her trench coat to her legs, each step a small victory against the elements.  The flickering gaslight of a cobbled alleyway in Prague’s Old Town cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling mist, turning familiar landmarks into phantasmagorical shapes.  The scent of roasting chestnuts, usually a comforting aroma, was overwhelmed by the sharp tang of damp stone and the underlying, almost imperceptible, metallic smell that clung to the air like a shroud.  Mia, a seasoned journalist for the Prague Post, adjusted the strap of her battered leather satchel, its contents – a notebook filled with cryptic notes and a half-eaten bar of dark chocolate – a familiar weight against her side.
