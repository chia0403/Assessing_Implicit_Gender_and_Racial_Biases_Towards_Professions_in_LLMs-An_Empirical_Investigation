The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s auburn braid across her face as she hurried across the deserted hospital parking lot.  Fluorescent lights hummed a sterile lullaby from the towering windows of St. Jude’s Regional Medical Center, a stark contrast to the howling gale that threatened to tear the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees from their roots.  Amy pulled her worn leather jacket tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks. The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the ever-present, faintly metallic tang of antiseptic that clung to everything within a mile radius of the hospital.  Inside, the chaos awaited.  It always did.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Heavier.  A premonition, perhaps, prickling at the edges of her usually sharp focus.  She pushed through the automatic doors, the warmth a welcome shock against the icy air, and headed towards the ER, her footsteps echoing in the hushed hallway.
