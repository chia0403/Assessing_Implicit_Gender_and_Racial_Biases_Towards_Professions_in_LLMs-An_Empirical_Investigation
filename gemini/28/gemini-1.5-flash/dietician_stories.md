The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the "Salty Siren."  The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the churning grey-green waters of the Atlantic, cast long shadows across the deck, highlighting the chaotic tangle of ropes and the pungent smell of brine and diesel.  Eleanor, her sensible beige trousers already damp from the spray, gritted her teeth.  This wasn't exactly the picturesque seaside research she'd envisioned when she'd accepted the grant to study the dietary habits of the isolated fishing community on the Isle of Skye.
