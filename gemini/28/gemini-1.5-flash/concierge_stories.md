The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, halogen lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel’s lobby:  *Amelia “Mia” Hernandez, Concierge*.  Rain lashed against the vast arched windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Prague into a watercolour of greys and bruised purples.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of polished mahogany, expensive perfume, and a faint, underlying aroma of old books – a testament to the hotel's century-old history and its eclectic clientele. Mia, perched on her high stool behind the meticulously organised desk, adjusted her crisp, navy blue uniform.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain provided a muted soundtrack to the hushed murmurs of guests, the clink of ice in glasses, and the low hum of the hotel’s ancient, but impeccably maintained, heating system.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet elegance felt charged, pregnant with an unspoken tension that even the seasoned Mia couldn’t quite place.
