The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Hawthorne like a damp linen shroud as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest crackle of the newly-lit gas lamps, danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows of "The Flour Child," a quaint, if slightly dilapidated, shop nestled on the cobbled side street of Oakhaven. The air, even at this hour, hummed with the promise of sugary delights â€“ a symphony of yeast and warm butter, cinnamon and cardamom, a comforting counterpoint to the city's still-sleeping anxieties.  Outside, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the bruised purple sky, hinting at the approaching storm. But inside, Amelia Hawthorne, her flour-dusted apron already tied snug, felt a familiar warmth bloom in her chest.  Today was market day, and today, she would bake the most magnificent sourdough loaf Oakhaven had ever seen.
