The siren’s wail was a banshee scream tearing through the pre-dawn stillness of the Alaskan wilderness.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, clung to the windshield of the ambulance as Dr. Evelyn Reed, her breath misting in the frigid air, gripped the wheel.  The snow, undisturbed except for the churning tracks left by her vehicle, stretched out in an endless expanse of white under a sky bruised with the deep violet of approaching dawn.  The radio crackled with static, punctuated by the clipped, urgent voice of the dispatcher relaying the details:  a snowmobile accident, remote location, suspected multiple injuries.  Evelyn, already feeling the familiar knot of adrenaline tightening in her chest, knew this was going to be a long, brutal haul – a fight against the elements and the relentless ticking clock.  The unforgiving beauty of the Alaskan landscape, usually a source of quiet awe, felt tonight like a cold, indifferent judge.
