The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, clinging to the cobblestones like a persistent fog.  Rain, a fine, relentless drizzle, slicked the narrow alleyways of Oakhaven, mirroring the sheen on the oiled leather apron worn by Elias Thorne, master tailor.  Elias, his fingers stained a perpetual ochre from years spent coaxing colour from fabrics, hunched over a half-finished doublet, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across his cluttered workshop.  The only sound louder than the drumming rain was the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears, a counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the broken pane in his single window.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of his craft was punctuated by a nervous tapping at his door, a sound that promised anything but the quiet solitude Elias craved.
