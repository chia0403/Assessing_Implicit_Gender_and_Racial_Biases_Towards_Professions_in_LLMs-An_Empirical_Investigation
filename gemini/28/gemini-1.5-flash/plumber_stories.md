The biting November wind howled a mournful tune down the narrow, cobbled streets of Oakhaven, rattling the stained-glass windows of the ancient church and whistling through the gaps in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's worn leather work boots.  Barty, a plumber whose hands were more accustomed to wrestling with recalcitrant pipes than delicate stained glass, hunched deeper into his threadbare coat, the collar pulled high against the chill.  The flickering gaslight of the lamppost ahead cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like the very pipes he spent his days untangling. Oakhaven, a town steeped in history and clinging stubbornly to its Victorian charm, was beautiful, undeniably so, but tonight it felt bleak, even menacing.  The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and something elseâ€¦ something acrid and faintly metallic, a smell that prickled the back of Barty's neck with unease.
