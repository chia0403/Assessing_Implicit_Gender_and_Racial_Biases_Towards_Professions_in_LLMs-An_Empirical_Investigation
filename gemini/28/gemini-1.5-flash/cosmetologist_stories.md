Rain, a relentless Charleston downpour, hammered against the aged windowpanes, creating a soothing rhythm against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Amelia's shears.  Tonight, however, the usual calming ambiance was shattered by a frantic knock at the door, followed by a voice so strained it barely registered above the storm.
