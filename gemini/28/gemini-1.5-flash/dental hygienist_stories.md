The whirring of the suction tool was a constant, low hum in the background, a familiar lullaby to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather.  The scent of sterile antiseptic, faintly tinged with cinnamon from the mouthwash cups, clung to the air of Serenity Dental, a cozy practice nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a town so small its only claim to fame was the annual pumpkin festival.
