The scent of old paper and distant lands hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Amelia Jean Hawthorne's travel agency. Amelia, perched on a worn velvet stool behind her antique roll-top desk, sifted through a stack of brochures depicting sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains, the muted hum of the city outside a distant counterpoint to the quiet rustle of the pages. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of her shop, "Wanderlust & Co.", nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  The shop itself was a charming anachronism, a tiny oasis of faded maps, globe-trotting trinkets, and the reassuring weight of history â€“ a stark contrast to the sleek, modern travel agencies that dominated the city's main thoroughfares.  Outside, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingled with the modern blare of car horns, a fitting soundtrack to the unique blend of old-world charm and vibrant modernity that was Amelia's life, and her business.
