The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, weak bulb hanging above the worn leather barber chair, danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window.  Barty himself, a man whose age was etched as deeply into his face as the lines carved into his worn wooden countertop, sat perched on a wobbly stool, meticulously sharpening his straight razor. Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of tires, the blare of car horns, the distant wail of a siren – provided a constant, jarring counterpoint to the quiet hum of his electric clippers resting beside him. The shop itself, nestled on the edge of a rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood in Brooklyn, was a relic of a bygone era; a small, square room with peeling paint and mismatched furniture, clinging stubbornly to its old-world charm in a sea of trendy coffee shops and sleek boutiques.  This was Barty's kingdom, a sanctuary of sharp edges and quiet contemplation, where the only constant was the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears.
