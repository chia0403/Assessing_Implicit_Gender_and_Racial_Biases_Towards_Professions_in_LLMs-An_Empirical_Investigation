Professor Augustine Blackwood adjusted his spectacles, the thin wire digging into the bridge of his nose.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of his study, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of his own thoughts.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke clung to the air, a familiar perfume in his secluded cottage nestled deep within the whispering pines of Blackwood Forest.

The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows across the walls lined with ancient tomes, their leather-bound spines hinting at secrets older than the forest itself. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a mournful cry that seemed to seep into the very bones of the ancient house.  Augustine shivered, not entirely from the cold.
