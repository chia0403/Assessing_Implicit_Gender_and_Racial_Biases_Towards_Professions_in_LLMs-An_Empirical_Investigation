The biting wind, a relentless claw of ice, clawed at Silas Blackwood's weathered face.  He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the gnawing fear that clung to him like the frost clinging to the pines.  The towering, ancient redwoods of the Redwood National Park, normally a cathedral of emerald majesty, seemed today like sentinels guarding a secret, a secret he felt he was dangerously close to uncovering.  The year was 1928.  The scent of pine needles, normally invigorating, was thick with the metallic tang of something else, something unsettlingly familiar.  Silas, a logger of formidable strength and scarred hands, knew this land intimately.  This particular stretch of the Redwood Creek valley, a tangle of shadowed ravines and moss-draped boulders, was hallowed ground, where whispers of forgotten history echoed in the wind. He was alone, his small, creaking team of oxen the only living things around him other than the screech of unseen birds.  The day was almost over, the fading light painting the forest floor in an eerie twilight.  He strained his eyes, squinting through the thinning branches, trying to make out something he'd felt compelled to return to. A rusted, iron-banded container, half-buried beneath the roots of a fallen giant.
