The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of yeasty tang and toasted barley, hung thick in the air of the cobbled alleyway.  Rain slicked the stone, reflecting the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the archway above.  Inside the small, almost claustrophobic bakery,  Eloise Dubois, a baker with flour-dusted hands and eyes that held the spark of a thousand sunlit ovens, meticulously arranged a batch of pain au chocolat.  Each croissant, golden brown and glistening, seemed to hum with a silent energy, a promise of warmth and delight.  The tiny bakery, "Le Petit Four," a testament to Eloise's tireless dedication, was a sanctuary of quiet precision, a haven from the bustling, often cruel, heart of the Marais district.
