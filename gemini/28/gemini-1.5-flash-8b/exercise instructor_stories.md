The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the cardio equipment vibrated through Amelia Petrova's polished wooden floor, a counterpoint to the insistent beeping of the heart rate monitors strapped to the arms of her Zumba class.  Sweat beaded on her brow, mingling with the faint scent of coconut oil and jasmine that permeated the air.  Amelia, a petite woman with vibrant auburn hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail, expertly guided her class through a fiery sequence of salsa steps, her voice a powerful contralto that cut through the music.  This was her sanctuary, the "Rhythm & Rise" studio, a haven of vibrant colours and motivational posters, tucked away on a quiet side street of bustling, sun-drenched Miami.  Today, however, a particular note of unease hung in the air, a discordant note in the usually harmonious symphony of sweat and laughter.
