The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's flight suit, stinging her cheeks and rattling the viewport of the single-engine biplane.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Nepalese Himalayas clawed at a bruised, cerulean sky.  Amy, her knuckles white around the joystick, wrestled the antiquated aircraft into a tight turn, her gaze locked on the swirling clouds that clung to the mountain passes like restless spirits.  She was on her third reconnaissance flight of the season, tasked with charting the treacherous mountain routes for a possible new trekking path.  The previous two had yielded nothing but frustrating cloud cover and near-catastrophic turbulence.  This one, she feared, would be no different.  

The setting was the remote, high-altitude region of the Annapurna massif in the Himalayas, spring, but the air felt more like a harsh winter. The air, thin and crisp, hung heavy with the scent of pine and yak dung.  Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight, illuminating the stark beauty of the mountains, a beauty that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Amy's small, hand-built biplane, affectionately nicknamed "The Swallow," was a fragile testament to human ingenuity, its sleek lines barely visible against the backdrop of the monumental landscape.  The village of Thame, a collection of brightly coloured, stone houses nestled precariously in a valley far below, was a faint, distant smudge in the distance, offering only a whisper of civilization in this unforgiving wilderness.
