The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a constant, unwelcome companion in this forgotten corner of the city, dripped from the eaves of the dilapidated buildings, forming a mosaic of tiny, reflective puddles.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with a surprisingly cheerful demeanor despite the relentless dampness and the incessant clang of pipes and hammering.  Barty, his waterproof jacket clinging to his frame, meticulously surveyed the mangled pipes snaking beneath a crumbling brick wall.  The pungent smell of mildew and something akin to burnt sugar hung heavy in the air. This was just another Tuesday night in the underbelly of Harmony City.
