The fluorescent lights of the galley hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of trays and the hushed murmurs of passengers settling into their seats.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Boeing 787, blurring the already fading cityscape of Tokyo into a watercolour wash.  Amelia "Amy" Chen, a flight attendant with the shimmering silver livery of "Sunrise Airlines," adjusted the strap of her uniform satchel, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the pre-takeoff chaos.  Her lavender-scented lotion, a small indulgence in the controlled chaos of her profession, still clung to her hands.  She sighed, a silent acknowledgment of the routine, the predictable ebb and flow of each flight, and the subtle, persistent pressure to maintain a smile despite the endless stream of anxious travellers, lost luggage, and the ever-present possibility of turbulence.


Setting: The galley of a Sunrise Airlines Boeing 787, shortly before takeoff from Narita International Airport, Tokyo, Japan.  The cabin is still largely empty, bathed in the sterile glow of the pre-flight preparation phase. The external view through the large windows reflects the impending storm, the city blurring into shades of grey and silver against the darkening sky.
