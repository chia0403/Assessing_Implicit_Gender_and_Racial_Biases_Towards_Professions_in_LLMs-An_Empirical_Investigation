The biting wind, a relentless, icy serpent, whipped around Amelia Hawthorne, the flames licking at the periphery of the inferno almost a comforting warmth in contrast.  Black smoke, thick and acrid, choked the air, obscuring the already dim light of the early morning sky.  Amelia, a Firefighter Lieutenant with the Granite City Fire Department, felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another blaze.  This was personal.  The flickering light from the inferno cast long, dancing shadows across the street, playing tricks on her vision.  She could almost hear the screams, even though she was still several blocks away.

The scene was set in the heart of Granite City, a sprawling metropolis nestled in the foothills of the jagged, snow-capped mountains.  The city, while boasting gleaming skyscrapers and bustling business districts, also harbored a grim underbelly of forgotten alleyways and abandoned warehouses.  This particular blaze erupted in one such forgotten spaceâ€”an old, corrugated metal warehouse, once bustling with activity, now a hollow shell of its former self.  The wind, a relentless and unforgiving force in the high alpine valley, howled like a banshee, whipping snow into swirling maelstroms.  Snow clung to the tattered roofing of the warehouse, and the icy air felt sharp enough to cut through metal.  The smell of burning timber and something else, something metallic and sickeningly sweet, hung heavy in the air.
