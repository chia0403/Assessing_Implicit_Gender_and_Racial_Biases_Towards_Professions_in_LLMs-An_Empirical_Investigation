Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rainbow Valley" preschool, mimicking the frantic drumming in Amelia Eleanor Thistlewick's chest.  It was the first day of autumn, a day marked on the calendar with a big, bold "X" –  a reminder of the upcoming storm that always seemed to brew in her gut just before the school year's pivotal shift into its more subdued, chrysalis-like state.  The small, brightly painted building, nestled amongst the whispering pines of a sprawling, wooded valley, felt unusually quiet, the usual cacophony of chattering children muted by the relentless downpour.  Inside, Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, surveyed the classroom with a mixture of anxiety and a familiar, almost comforting, weariness.  Crayon shavings still clung to the tables like fallen autumn leaves, a testament to the exuberant energy of the previous school year. This year, however, smelled subtly different –  a blend of damp earth, impending change, and a faint, lingering scent of cinnamon that reminded her of her grandmother's kitchens.
