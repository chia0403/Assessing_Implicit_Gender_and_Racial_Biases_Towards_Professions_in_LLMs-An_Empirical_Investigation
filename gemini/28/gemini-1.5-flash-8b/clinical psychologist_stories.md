Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heart.  The fluorescent lights of the waiting room, usually a sterile white beacon, flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows on the chipped Formica tables.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the stale silence, punctuated only by the drip-drip-drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere deep within the building.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a practiced calm that rarely cracked, felt a knot tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another Tuesday. This was Tuesday, the day she'd been dreading. This was the day Mr. Arthur Blackwood would finally be here.
