The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floors of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, ethereal fireflies, swirled in the air.  Rain hammered against the enormous, ornately carved windows, a relentless percussion that echoed the pounding in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's chest.  He was a bell hop, a lowly cog in the intricate machinery of luxury, and tonight, the cog felt utterly and profoundly jammed.  The Grand Imperial, a monument to opulence and gilded decadence, was quieter than usual, the hushed whispers of hushed guests and the clinking of silverware seeming amplified in the oppressive stillness.  Tonight, Barty felt like the only sound was the ticking of his own fractured heart.  The year was 1898.
