The fluorescent lights of the truck stop diner hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Ace"  Rivera's heart.  Outside, the endless expanse of the Nebraska plains stretched to the horizon, a bruised purple under a bruised sky.  A biting wind, carrying the scent of dust and diesel, whipped across the cracked asphalt.  Ace, her face etched with the weariness of a thousand miles and a thousand sleepless nights, stared down at the greasy spoon's menu, a half-eaten burger and fries abandoned on the table.  The grease was almost as familiar as the worn leather of her steering wheel.  Her truck, the "Iron Horse," was parked just beyond the diner's parking lot, a monument to solitary journeys and silent confessions.  The smell of burnt coffee and stale donuts filled her nostrils; a subtle yet potent reminder of the rhythm of her life.  Inside, a group of boisterous men were playing cards and trading stories, their voices mingling with the clatter of dishes and the distant howl of a lone coyote.  Ace didn't join them. She felt an almost painful separation from the world outside her truck, an echo of the quiet, lonely life she'd chosen.
