Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small physiotherapy clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Kensingtonâ€™s thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and antiseptic, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a physical therapist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a determined jawline, stared at the worn, faded chart spread across her desk.  The name, "Arthur Penhaligon," was stark against the faded ink.  Arthur, a retired carpenter with hands gnarled like weathered oak, had been a patient for five months.  Each session, each painstaking exercise, each meticulously measured improvement, had felt like a slow climb up a treacherous mountain.  Today, however, the mountain seemed to have vanished.

The setting was a small, unassuming clinic nestled in the heart of a sprawling, yet oddly quiet, industrial estate on the outskirts of a town steeped in the history of shipbuilding.  Rusty scaffolding marred the landscape, a silent testament to the town's fading glory.  Scattered among the deserted docks, and the now-empty factories, sat the clinic, a humble refuge from the elements.  The front window was adorned with a handwritten sign, its slightly smudged paint reading "A. Kensington Physiotherapy."  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of linseed oil and hope.
