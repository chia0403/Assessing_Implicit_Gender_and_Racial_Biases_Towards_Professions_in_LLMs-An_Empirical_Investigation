The biting wind, a skeletal hand clawing at the decaying shingles of the Victorian mansion, whipped Amelia “Storm”  Fitzwilliam's hair across her face.  Rain, icy needles against her exposed skin, stung the already chapped lips she pressed into a thin line.  Above, the skeletal fingers of bare branches clawed at the bruised, leaden sky, mirroring the gnawing anxiety in her stomach.  She was high, perched precariously on the rooftop of Blackwood Manor, a place steeped in local legend and whispered curses.  Below, the sprawling, overgrown gardens, choked by ivy, were a silent, watchful stage.  Tonight, the silence was the loudest sound.

The setting was Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, decaying Victorian monstrosity perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the grey, perpetually damp town of Ashwood.  Moss, thick and emerald green, clawed its way up the stone walls. Broken windowpanes stared blankly out from the shadowed interiors, like hollow eyes.  Rain hammered a ceaseless tattoo against the rusted ironwork of the roof.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, hung heavy with a sense of foreboding.  A chill, older than the house itself, seeped into Amelia’s bones.  This wasn’t just another roof repair.  This was Blackwood Manor, and rumours, like restless spirits, clung to every crumbling brick.
