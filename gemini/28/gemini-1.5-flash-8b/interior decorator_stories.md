The muted grey of the November sky mirrored the subdued palette Amelia Nightingale had meticulously chosen for the living room.  Sunlight, a weak, hesitant intruder, barely pierced the dense canopy of London fog clinging to the cobbled streets outside.  Inside, the meticulously arranged furniture—a plush, navy velvet sofa, a pair of matching armchairs upholstered in a subtly patterned linen—exuded a quiet sophistication. Amelia, her signature auburn hair pulled back in a sleek bun, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  This, she knew, was the heart of the project, the culmination of weeks of research, colour swatches, and countless hours spent poring over architectural plans.  The house, a Georgian townhouse nestled on a discreet street in Mayfair, belonged to Lord Ashworth, a reclusive art collector with a reputation for demanding perfection.  Amelia was determined to deliver.  This wasn't just a job; it was a testament to her skill, a chance to create a masterpiece in a space waiting to be awakened.
