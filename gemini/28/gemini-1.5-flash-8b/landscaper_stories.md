The chipped paint of the "Green Thumbs & Gravel" truck, a faded emerald green now more a sickly mint, gleamed under the harsh morning sun.  Dust motes danced in the shaft of light slicing through the gaps in the corrugated metal siding of the dilapidated garage.  Inside, Elias Thorne, Green Thumbs & Gravel's sole proprietor, a man whose weathered hands spoke volumes of sun-baked earth and battling weeds, wrestled with a stubborn bolt on the rusty hydraulic lift.  He swore under his breath, a low growl swallowed by the clatter of the tools.  Today was supposed to be the day he delivered the prize-winning hydrangeas to the Blackwood Estate, a commission that could turn his struggling business around, but this damn lift was clearly on a strike of its own.

The Blackwood Estate, looming in the distance, was a symphony of shadowed stone and sculpted hedges, a fortress of opulence nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Surrey countryside.  The estate, or rather its grounds, seemed to swallow the surrounding landscape whole.  High walls, topped with razor wire, obscured most of the interior, leaving only hints of meticulously manicured lawns and towering trees.  Elias had only glimpsed the estate from the winding lane that snaked around its perimeter, a mere glimpse of a life utterly beyond his own.  And yet, this particular order felt like a key, a crack in the immense walls of privilege and secrecy that surrounded it.
