The biting November wind whipped across the cobblestones of the ancient, winding alleyways, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something acrid, something almost metallic.  Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered the narrow streets to a mirror-like sheen, reflecting the flickering gaslight lanterns that cast long, distorted shadows.  Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi, her breath clouding in the frigid air, squinted through the downpour.  The faintest whisper of sirens, swallowed by the storm, was the only sound audible over the relentless drumming of the rain.


The alley, known locally as "The Rat's Run," had a reputation as dangerous even by the city's notoriously violent standards.  Twisted, decaying buildings, their facades marred by generations of neglect and graffiti, huddled close together, their shadows deepening the already oppressive gloom.  A network of narrow, barely-lit passageways snaked between them, labyrinths ripe for hiding.  Izzy, a seasoned detective with five years on the force, knew this alley intimately, its secrets etched into her memory like a chilling tattoo.  The flickering light from the rain-streaked windows above cast an almost spectral glow on the damp, littered ground.
