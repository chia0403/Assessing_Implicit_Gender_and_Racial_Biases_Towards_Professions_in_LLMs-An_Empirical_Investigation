Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Claims Central" office, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia Stone's thoughts.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows over the rows of worn cubicles.  Amelia, a claims adjuster for the perpetually-beleaguered "Protector's Insurance" company, stared at the crumpled claim form.  Another flood. Another heartbreaking tale of a family displaced.  Another mountain of paperwork to wade through.  The relentless grey of the Chicago winter seemed to seep into her soul, mirroring the cold, impersonal tone of the forms she processed.  Her worn cardigan, inherited from her grandmother, felt heavier than usual, a familiar weight of responsibility settling on her shoulders. The sterile, beige walls of the office were beginning to feel like a mausoleum. Outside, the city roared, a constant symphony of sirens and the relentless, pounding rain.  This particular claim was different, though.  This one smelled of somethingâ€¦off.
