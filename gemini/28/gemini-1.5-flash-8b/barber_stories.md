The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull terracotta from years of lukewarm water and forgotten shaving cream, reflected the flickering gaslight above Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of illumination, illuminating the intricate network of cobwebs that draped like lace from the rafters of "The Clipper's Cut."  Barty, a man whose face was a roadmap of lines etched by laughter and weariness, leaned over his newest client, a stout gentleman with a bristling, ginger beard that seemed to defy any attempt at control.  The old barber shop, nestled in the shadowed alleyways of the burgeoning port city of Newhaven, hummed with a low, persistent thrummingâ€”the symphony of the city outside, a ceaseless chorus of cargo ships, hawkers' cries, and the occasional drunken brawl.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and stale ale, hung heavy, almost palpable, in the small space.  Barty's calloused hands, stained with a lifetime of dye and tonic, moved with practiced precision, snipping and shaping the ginger beard.
