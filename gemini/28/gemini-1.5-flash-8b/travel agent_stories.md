The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Kensington's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Outside, the rain hammered against the glass windows of "Wanderlust & Wonders," her tiny, but remarkably vibrant, travel agency tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of Edinburgh.  The city, draped in a muted grey cloak, mirrored the weary look settling on Amelia's face.  It was the end of a particularly dreadful week, a perfect storm of cancelled flights, misplaced itineraries, and a client demanding a *private* hot air balloon ride over the Himalayas (a request Amelia privately suspected was the work of a very bored and wealthy teenager).  

The rain continued its relentless drumming, a soundtrack to the swirling thoughts in Amelia's head.  She'd been a travel agent for ten years, and every day brought a new challenge, a new adventure, a new reason to wonder at the resilience of the human spirit.  But today, the resilience felt stretched thin.  A new, almost frantic, sense of urgency crackled under her calm exterior.  A silent, yet significant, shift had occurred in the bustling travel industry, and Amelia felt herself on the precipice of a change she was neither prepared for nor entirely sure she wanted.  The future, it seemed, was rapidly approaching, and Amelia was left holding the ticket stubs of the unknown.
