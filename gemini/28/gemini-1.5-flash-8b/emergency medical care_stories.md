Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the makeshift clinic, mimicking the frantic beat of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carter's heart.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the small, windowless room.  Outside, the jungle churned, a vibrant, chaotic green that seemed to swallow the fading light.  Amy, her face streaked with grime and sweat, knelt beside a young woman whose eyes were wide with terror, a shallow gasp escaping her lips.  The woman, barely twenty, lay on a crudely constructed cot, her left arm twisted at an unnatural angle.  A fractured tibia, almost certainly.

The setting:  Deep within the Amazon rainforest, a remote village nestled amongst towering trees, its inhabitants relying on this rudimentary medical outpost for life-saving care.  The clinic, barely more than a collection of salvaged corrugated metal sheets and scavenged timber, was a testament to the resourcefulness of the village healer, a woman named Nana. But Nana, with years of experience, was now facing the limits of her knowledge. This was Amy's third week here, and the relentless flow of injuries and illnesses meant there was little time for rest.  Each day brought a new challenge, a fresh narrative of pain and resilience.  Amy, a dedicated emergency medical care specialist from a bustling city hospital, found herself unexpectedly thrust into the heart of a hidden world, where the rhythm of life and death was dictated by the unpredictable jungle and its inhabitants.
