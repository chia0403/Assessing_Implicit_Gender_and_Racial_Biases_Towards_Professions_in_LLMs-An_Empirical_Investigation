The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Petrova, painting her apron in an ethereal, almost spectral light.  Rain lashed against the chipped awning, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest.  The small, greasy spoon diner, nestled in the forgotten corner of Oakhaven, reeked of stale coffee and simmering disappointment.  Every clinking fork, every muttered complaint, echoed in the cavernous emptiness Amelia felt within. Tonight, the usual lunchtime rush hadnâ€™t materialized.  Instead, the diner was a mausoleum of hushed whispers and lingering shadows, the only sounds the steady drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the back.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and the faintest hint of a smile that never quite reached her lips, surveyed the almost empty dining room.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug felt more like a tomb than a haven.
