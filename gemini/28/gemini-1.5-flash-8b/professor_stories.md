The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s hands, the steam a fragile veil against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the ancient stone walls of the Blackwood Manor Observatory.  Professor Amelia Hawthorne, a renowned astrophysicist and the resident expert on celestial anomalies, stared out at the inky expanse of the night sky.  Millions of pinpricks of light, seemingly indifferent to the turmoil within her, blazed across the vast canvas above.  Tonight, the usual celestial ballet felt... off.  Something felt... wrong.  

The observatory, a sprawling, gothic structure nestled high atop the Yorkshire moors, had been in her family for generations.  Each stone whispered tales of forgotten astronomers, of whispered theories and breakthroughs lost to time.  The air inside, thick with the scent of dust and old paper, held the ghosts of countless nights spent charting the stars.  The antique telescopes, their brass gleaming faintly in the lamplight, seemed to watch her with knowing eyes.  Moonlight, fractured by the jagged peaks of the moors, painted long, ethereal shadows across the dusty floor.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful symphony, a counterpoint to the silent, watchful universe.
