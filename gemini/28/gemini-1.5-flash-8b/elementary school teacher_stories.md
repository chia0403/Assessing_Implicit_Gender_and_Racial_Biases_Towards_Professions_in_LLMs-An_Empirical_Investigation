The fluorescent lights of Ms. Amelia Blackwood's third-grade classroom hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through the worn linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the rainbow-colored construction paper creations plastered haphazardly across the walls.  A faint smell of cinnamon and something indefinably sweet – perhaps leftover cookies, perhaps something more magical – hung in the air.  Today, however, the usual cacophony of chattering, squabbling, and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet on the floor was absent.  A heavy silence, thick with unspoken anticipation, settled over the room.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair, usually a riot of unruly curls, was today meticulously braided, sat at her desk, her gaze fixed on a small, intricately carved wooden bird perched atop a stack of meticulously organized lesson plans.  The bird, a gift from a former student, seemed to hold a secret, a promise of something extraordinary... or perhaps, simply, the quiet before a storm.
