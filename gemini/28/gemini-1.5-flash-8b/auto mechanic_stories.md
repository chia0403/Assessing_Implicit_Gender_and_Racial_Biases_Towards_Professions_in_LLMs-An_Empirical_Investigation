The rhythmic clang of hammers against metal, the acrid smell of burnt oil and gasoline, the low hum of a compressor â€“ these were the soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's life.  His greasy overalls, perpetually stained a deep, rich brown, were a testament to his profession.  Barty Finch, proprietor of Finch's Fix-It, a small, cluttered garage nestled between a bakery with perpetually overflowing trays and a used bookstore overflowing with forgotten tales, was a master of the wrench and a connoisseur of carburetors.  His hands, gnarled and calloused, knew the secrets whispered in the groaning chassis of vintage cars, the rhythmic thrum of a well-tuned engine a symphony only he could truly appreciate.  The grease stains that marred his weathered face and the faint smell of motor oil that clung to his clothes were a badge of honor, a sign of his dedication to the silent, intricate machines that held the stories of countless journeys.

The early morning light painted streaks of gold across the grimy windows of the garage, illuminating the heaps of salvaged parts and the labyrinthine tangle of wires. A lone sparrow chirped from a rusted metal pipe, its melody barely audible above the steady whir of the air compressor. Today was no different than any other day for Barty, except for the faint whisper of a rumour spreading through the small town of Oakhaven: an ancient, magnificent roadster, known locally as the "Ghostly Gleam", was rumoured to be returning after years of slumber, and with it, a mystery that had lain dormant for decades.
