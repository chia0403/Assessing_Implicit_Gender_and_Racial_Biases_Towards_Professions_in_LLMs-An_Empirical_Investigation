The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, low thrum, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's life.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, bled through the grimy windows of the city-center clinic, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  Rows of antiseptic-scented cubicles lined the walls, each a miniature world of vials, tubes, and sterile equipment.  Elara, a phlebotomist with a constellation of faint, almost invisible scars across her knuckles, adjusted the antiseptic wipe, her movements precise and practiced.  Today, the usual mix of anxious murmurs and the rhythmic *thump-thump* of a heart monitor against the fluorescent background seemedâ€¦ different.  A simmering unease hung in the air, a premonition of something brewing, something unseen, lurking just beyond the sterile walls of the clinic.
