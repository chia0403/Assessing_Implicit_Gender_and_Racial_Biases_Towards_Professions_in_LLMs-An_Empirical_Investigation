The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The small, ramshackle clinic, tucked into the valley between the jagged peaks of the Kestrel Mountains, seemed to shrink further into itself with each gust.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the already weary silence.  Amelia, her breath clouding in the frigid air, felt a familiar twinge of dread, a premonition that hung heavier than the damp air.  This wasn't just another typical evening call, this was something different.  Somethingâ€¦ dangerous.

The clinic, a weathered wooden structure barely clinging to the hillside, was a testament to Dr. Blackwood's tenacity.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and pine needles, a comforting counterpoint to the raw, untamed wilderness outside.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick fog, illuminating only flickering gas lamps and the worn, leather-bound books lining the walls.  A chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia's hands as she stirred a potent herbal tea. The rhythmic *drip* of the leaky faucet in the back room was her only companion.  The valley, usually alive with the bleating of sheep and the cries of the rare mountain falcons, was now shrouded in a silent, watchful stillness.  It pressed down on her, a palpable pressure that mirrored the growing unease in her chest.
