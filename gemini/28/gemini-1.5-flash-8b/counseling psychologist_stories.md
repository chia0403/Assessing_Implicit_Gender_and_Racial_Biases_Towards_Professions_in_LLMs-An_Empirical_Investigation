Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the turmoil in Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s heart.  The small, cluttered office, nestled in a quiet corner of a sprawling, industrial district, felt unusually cramped tonight.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating chipped paint and the faint scent of stale coffee.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and distant traffic, a soundtrack to the anxieties bubbling beneath the surface of the patients who sought solace within these walls.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with ten years of experience, knew the rain brought with it a unique kind of angst.  A kind she felt herself wrestling with tonight, too.
