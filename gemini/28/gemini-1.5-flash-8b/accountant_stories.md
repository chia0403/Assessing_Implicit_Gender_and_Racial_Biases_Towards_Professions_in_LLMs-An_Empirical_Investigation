The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Peabody's meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, meticulously arranged in neat stacks, glinted like tiny, metallic stars.  Amelia, a Certified Public Accountant with a penchant for precision and a hair perpetually escaping its perfectly pinned place, stared at the latest quarterly report.  Rows upon rows of figures, each one a potential minefield of errors, seemed to mock her with their impenetrable complexity.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven rumbled with the familiar symphony of traffic, a relentless counterpoint to the quiet, almost hushed, hum of the office.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint whisper of regret from late-night revisions, hung heavy.  Amelia, her face pale beneath the harsh fluorescent light, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  This quarter's numbers simply didn't add up.
