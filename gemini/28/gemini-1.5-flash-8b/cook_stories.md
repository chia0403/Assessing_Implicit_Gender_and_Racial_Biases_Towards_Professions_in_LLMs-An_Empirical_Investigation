The steam from the bubbling cauldron, thick with the scent of rosemary and thyme, curled around Elara Nightingale, the resident cook of the sprawling Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the kitchen, illuminating the intricate carvings on the ancient wooden table and highlighting the gleaming copper pots lining the walls.  A symphony of clanging, sizzling, and the rhythmic thump of Elara's own heart filled the air â€“ a soundtrack to the daily ritual of preparing feasts for the Blackwood family.  Today, however, the usual cacophony was muted, replaced by an unnerving quiet.  The manor, usually a hive of activity, felt strangely still, like a sleeping beast poised on the brink of awakening.  Elara, her apron meticulously clean, wiped a stray drop of gravy from her cheek.  The aroma of roasted pheasant was the only constant, a familiar comfort in the unsettling silence.
