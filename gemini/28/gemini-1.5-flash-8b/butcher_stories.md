The biting wind whipped Amelia Grimshaw's crimson apron around her legs, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of brine and the metallic tang of freshly cut blood, a familiar perfume in the shadowed alleyways of Blackwood.  Her worn leather boots crunched on the frost-coated cobblestones, each rhythmic thud a counterpoint to the mournful cries of gulls circling above the skeletal remains of a market stall, a testament to the brutal efficiency of the winter's grip.  Blackwood, a city perpetually draped in the gloom of its own shadowed history, held a particular chill that seeped into the very bones.  Amelia, a butcher of formidable reputation – known throughout the city as "Grimshaw's Cleaver" – felt it keenly.

The alley, a narrow chasm swallowed by the towering brick buildings, was her private domain.  Here, amongst the refuse and the whispered secrets of the past, lay the heart of her livelihood, and often, the fragile lifeline of those who lived in the city's poorest districts.  Tonight, the scent of roasting meats, a stark contrast to the bitter air, wafted through the air, a small flicker of defiance against the pervasive chill.  A faint melody, played on a small, battered fiddle, drifted from a nearby doorway, a bittersweet counterpoint to the clang of Amelia's cleaver as she surveyed her stall.  Within, a glistening array of cuts awaited, their crimson hues reflecting the flickering lantern light.  This was her sanctuary, her battleground, and the source of her quiet strength.
