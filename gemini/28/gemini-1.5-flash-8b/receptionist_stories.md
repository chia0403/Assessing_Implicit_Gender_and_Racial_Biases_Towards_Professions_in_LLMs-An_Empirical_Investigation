The chipped Formica countertop, stained a faded beige from years of spilled coffee and forgotten sticky notes, felt oddly cold beneath Amelia Blackwood's fingertips.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of "Acme Acquisitions," a firm whose sole claim to fame seemed to be a mysteriously unfulfilled potential.  Amelia, a receptionist with eyes the colour of warm honey and hair the shade of a faded autumn leaf, sighed.  Another Tuesday, another flurry of unanswered phones and even more unanswered questions.  The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated only by the rhythmic *clink* of the antique cash register, a relic from a time when Acme Acquisitions was—dare she admit it?—a little more… *acquisitive*.
