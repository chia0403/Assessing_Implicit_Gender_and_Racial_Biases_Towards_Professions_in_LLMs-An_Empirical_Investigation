The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the occupational therapy clinic, reflecting Amelia Blackwood’s weary face.  A stack of brightly coloured therapy putty lay beside a meticulously organised box of fabric scraps, each a testament to the countless hours she'd spent helping others navigate the complexities of daily life.  The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia’s keyboard, punctuated by the soft whimpers of a young patient struggling with a gripping exercise, was a familiar soundtrack to her day.  Today, however, the music held an undercurrent of unease.

The clinic, nestled in the shadow of the towering, grey apartment blocks that lined the industrial outskirts of Oakhaven, was a small haven of order amidst the urban chaos.  Dust motes danced in the scant sunlight that filtered through the grimy windows.  The scent of antiseptic mixed with the faint, persistent aroma of burnt coffee, a constant reminder of the late nights and rushed breakfasts Amelia had become accustomed to.  Oakhaven itself held a peculiar charm – a tapestry woven from stark industrial beauty and hidden pockets of resilience.  A community grappling with both extraordinary challenges and extraordinary strength.  It was in these challenges that Amelia, an occupational therapist with an unwavering belief in the power of human resilience, found her calling.
