The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the snow-dusted street of Port Blossom, the quaint coastal town clinging precariously to the rocky cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea.  The salty tang of the air, usually a comfort, did little to alleviate the icy dread that had settled in her stomach.  Her worn leather satchel, usually brimming with the tools of her trade, felt heavy, burdened not by medical supplies, but by a premonition as sharp and cold as the wind itself.  Port Blossom, usually a picture of tranquil beauty, tonight wore a mask of impending storm, mirroring the turmoil in Amy’s heart.  The flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows, making the already familiar cobblestone streets feel strangely alien and menacing.
