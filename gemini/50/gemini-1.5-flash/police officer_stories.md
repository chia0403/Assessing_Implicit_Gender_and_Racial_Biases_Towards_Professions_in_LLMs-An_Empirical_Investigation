The biting November wind whipped at Officer Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s coat, tugging at the collar and threatening to expose the thin sliver of skin between her scarf and jacket.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, obscuring the already limited visibility along the rain-slicked cobblestones of Blackwood Lane.  Blackwood Lane, a picturesque, if deceptively quiet, street normally overflowing with tourists snapping photos of its quaint gas lamps and half-timbered houses, was now eerily deserted.  The only sounds were the rhythmic slap of her boots against the wet stones and the mournful moan of the wind whistling through the narrow gaps between the tightly packed buildings.  Even the usually boisterous pub, "The Crooked Tankard," was dark, its windows reflecting the city’s muted streetlights like vacant eyes.  Tonight, Blackwood Lane felt less charming and more like a villain in a gothic novel.
