The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's hands, a small comfort against the icy November wind rattling the windows of Mr. Fitzwilliam's office.  Rain lashed against the gothic panes, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Birmingham.  Amelia, a secretary of impeccable efficiency and quietly simmering ambition, stared out at the deluge, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the raindrops a counterpoint to the frantic clatter of her own typewriter, still humming from the completion of a particularly brutal contract negotiation. The air in the office, a cramped space crammed with mahogany furniture and the smell of old paper and stronger still, stale cigarettes, felt thick and heavy, mirroring the oppressive atmosphere of Fitzwilliam & Sons, Solicitors.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of corporate tension felt sharper, more electric. Something was in the air, something besides the damp and the despair of another dreary Birmingham evening.
