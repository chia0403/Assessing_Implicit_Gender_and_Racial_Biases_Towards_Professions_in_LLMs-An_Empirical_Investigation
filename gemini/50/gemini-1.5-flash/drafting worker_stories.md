The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s keyboard.  Dust motes, illuminated in the harsh glare, danced in the stale air above her meticulously organized desk.  Architectural plans, sprawling across the vast expanse of her digitizer, depicted the skeletal framework of what would soon become the city’s newest skyscraper – a glass and steel behemoth that, in Mia’s opinion, lacked the soul of the charming brownstones it was slated to overshadow.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the grimy streets of lower Manhattan, a stark contrast to the pristine perfection of the digital world she inhabited.  The scent of stale coffee and aging blueprints permeated the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Mia like a second skin, a testament to years spent painstakingly translating dreams into concrete realities.
