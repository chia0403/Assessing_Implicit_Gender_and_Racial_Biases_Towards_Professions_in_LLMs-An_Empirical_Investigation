The chipped paint of the windowsill was cold against Elara Thistlewick’s cheek as she stared out at the relentless drizzle blanketing the cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Grey, the colour of a perpetually overcast sky, was the dominant hue of the town – reflected in the slate roofs, the sodden cobblestones, even the perpetually weary expressions of the townsfolk hurrying past her window.  Inside, Elara’s small office, tucked away above Mrs. Periwinkle’s Emporium of Curiosities and Teas, was a sanctuary of order amidst the chaos.  The air smelled faintly of lavender and old paper, a testament to her meticulous nature.  Rows upon rows of ledgers, meticulously labelled and bound in faded green cloth, lined the shelves, their spines a testament to years of meticulously recorded transactions.  Each entry, each carefully calculated sum, represented a tiny piece of Oakhaven's quiet, sometimes unsettling, history; a history Elara, the town's most trusted bookkeeper, knew better than almost anyone.
