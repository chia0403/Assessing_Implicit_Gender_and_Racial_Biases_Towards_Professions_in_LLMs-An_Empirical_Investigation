The fluorescent lights of Reception hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the incessant tapping of Penelope Featherstonehaughâ€™s perfectly manicured nails on the polished mahogany desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though few dared use it beyond her immediate family), adjusted the tiny, perfectly-placed orchid on her desk, its delicate bloom a stark contrast to the grey, Brutalist architecture of the Blackwood & Sons building looming outside her window. Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  It wasn't the weather, though; it was the silence.  The unnervingly, deafening silence of a usually bustling office.  Blackwood & Sons, purveyors of fine art and even finer secrets, was eerily deserted.  And Penny, the ever-reliable receptionist, had a growing suspicion that something was terribly, terribly wrong.
