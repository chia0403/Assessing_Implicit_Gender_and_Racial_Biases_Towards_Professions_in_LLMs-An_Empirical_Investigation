The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s third-grade classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of children chattering, pencils scratching, and the occasional wail of a scraped knee.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the sunbeams slicing through the grimy windows of Oakhaven Elementary.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that gave the school its name, its leaves a swirling carpet of burnt orange and russet.  Inside, however, the air hung thick with the scent of Crayola crayons, slightly stale apple juice, and the indefinable aroma of childhood – a mix of innocence and impending chaos that Eleanor Vance, after fifteen years of teaching, had come to both love and dread in equal measure.
