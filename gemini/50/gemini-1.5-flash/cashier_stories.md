The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's Tuesday afternoon.  Elara, a name that felt far too elegant for the sticky linoleum beneath her feet and the ever-present scent of stale coffee and desperation clinging to the air, meticulously scanned a bag of suspiciously lumpy potatoes.  The small convenience store, tucked precariously between a failing laundromat and a tire shop that perpetually smelled of burnt rubber, was her kingdom â€“ a tiny, brightly lit island in a sea of urban decay. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the city beyond.  Inside, the only other customer was a gaunt man in a threadbare coat, nervously picking at a chipped fingernail while eyeing a lottery ticket like it held the key to his salvation.  Elara, however, had learned long ago not to read too much into the silent stories of her customers; their hopes and anxieties were as fleeting as the scent of exhaust fumes drifting in from the street.
