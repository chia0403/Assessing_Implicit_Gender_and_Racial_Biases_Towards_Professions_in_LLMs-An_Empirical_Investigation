The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Eleanor Vance, its icy fingers probing the gaps in her thermal layers.  The air, a frigid -40Â° Celsius, tasted of ozone and the desolate, ancient ice that stretched to the horizon in a blinding, unforgiving white.  Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A tremor, subtle but persistent, ran through the ground beneath her feet, a discordant note in the wind's lament.  The research station, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to a rocky outcropping, seemed to shudder in sympathy. This was McMurdo Station, the gateway to Antarctica's vast, frozen heart, and tonight, it felt less like a scientific outpost and more like a lonely sentinel guarding a secret.  A secret Eleanor Vance was determined to uncover.
