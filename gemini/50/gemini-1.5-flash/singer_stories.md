The chipped porcelain of the teacup warmed Amelia Katherine Nightingale's fingers, a meager comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of the “Blue Moon” cafe.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass panes, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma for Amelia, who'd been nursing a lukewarm Americano and a broken heart for the past three hours. The Blue Moon, with its peeling wallpaper and melancholic piano melodies leaking from the worn-out upright in the corner, was her refuge, her songwriting sanctuary, and tonight, her prison.  The crumpled lyrics on the napkin in front of her – a desperate ballad about lost love and missed chances – mirrored the turmoil churning within her.  Amelia, a singer whose voice could melt glaciers and shatter glass with equal ease, felt strangely voiceless tonight.
