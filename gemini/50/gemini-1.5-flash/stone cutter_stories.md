The rasp of granite against steel was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, clung to his beard, a grey halo around a face weathered like the cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea.  Elias, a stone cutter of renowned skill, stood hunched over his latest commission – a gargantuan tombstone destined for the windswept graveyard of St. Jude’s, perched precariously on the edge of the craggy coastline of Cornwall. The salty air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, whipped at his worn leather apron, while the relentless Atlantic waves crashed against the rocks below, their rhythm a counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of his chisel.  The small, stone-built workshop, perched on the cliff edge itself, was barely more than a lean-to, its walls constantly threatened by the relentless sea spray.  Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of half-finished sculptures and discarded tools, Elias worked, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving beauty of the Cornish coast.
