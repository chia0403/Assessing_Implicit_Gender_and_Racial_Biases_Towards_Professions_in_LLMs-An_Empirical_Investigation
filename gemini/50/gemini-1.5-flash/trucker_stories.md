The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate expanse of the Nebraska plains, rattling the windows of Jedediah “Jed” Stone’s eighteen-wheeler like skeletal fingers tapping a frantic rhythm.  Jed, his face weathered like ancient leather and etched with the map of a thousand miles, gripped the steering wheel of his rig, a battered but trusty Kenworth named "Betsy."  The headlights cut twin swaths through the swirling snow, illuminating nothing but the endless white expanse and the occasional, forlorn silhouette of a wind-battered farm house.  The air inside Betsy was thick with the smell of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering scent of pine air freshener, a feeble attempt to combat the pervasive aroma of the open road.  His CB radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic drone of the engine, a constant hum that had become the soundtrack to Jed's life for the past twenty years. Tonight, though, the silence felt heavier, the solitude more profound than usual.  This wasn't just another haul; this felt…different.
