The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's already sun-kissed skin as she adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, but a smile played on her lips.  The air hung heavy and humid, thick with the scent of plumeria and salt, a familiar perfume that clung to the cobblestone streets of Puerto Vallarta like a second skin.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide known for her infectious enthusiasm and encyclopedic knowledge of the city's history and hidden gems, surveyed her small group of tourists.  They were a motley crew – a retired couple from Iowa, a boisterous family from Texas, and a lone, brooding backpacker from somewhere in Europe – all gathered expectantly before the weathered, turquoise-painted door of the Casa Kimberly, Elizabeth Taylor's legendary former residence.  Today's tour, "Secrets of Old Vallarta," promised to unveil more than just postcard-pretty scenery; it aimed to unearth the soul of this vibrant coastal city.
