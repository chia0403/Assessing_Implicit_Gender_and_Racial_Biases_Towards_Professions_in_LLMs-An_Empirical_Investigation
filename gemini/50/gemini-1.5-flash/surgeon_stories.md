The biting November wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne’s charcoal grey coat around him as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude’s Hospital.  Rain, a relentless, sideways drizzle, plastered his dark hair to his forehead, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon.  St. Jude’s, a gothic behemoth of a building perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a place of both breathtaking beauty and chilling isolation.  Its stained-glass windows, depicting scenes of saints enduring unimaginable pain, seemed to reflect the very nature of the work done within its walls. Tonight, however, the beauty was lost in the stormy gloom, the isolation a suffocating blanket wrapped around Elias and the hospital’s weary occupants. The salt spray carried the mournful cry of gulls, a soundtrack to the anxieties that gnawed at him as he fought against the wind, his hurried footsteps echoing the frantic rhythm of his own heartbeat.
