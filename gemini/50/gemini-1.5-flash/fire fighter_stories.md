The scent of burning pine needles mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a grim reminder of the frantic rescue operation that had just concluded. This wasn't just another wildfire; the whispers of arson hung heavier than the smoke itself, clinging to the anxious silence that settled over the ravaged landscape.
