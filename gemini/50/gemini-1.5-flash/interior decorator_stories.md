The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded rose blush against the grime-coated glass, was the first thing Seraphina "Sera" Evangeline Beaumont noticed.  It wasn't the crumbling plasterwork, nor the moth-eaten velvet drapes clinging limply to the ornate, but dusty, rod – those were to be expected in a house this old, this… neglected. No, it was the specific, almost wistful shade of rose on that tiny windowsill that spoke to Sera, whispering a story of faded glamour and forgotten joys.  She stood in the echoing hallway of Blackwood Manor, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly sweet and melancholic, like dried lavender and lost memories.  The grand house, a gothic behemoth perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey Atlantic, seemed to sigh under the weight of its own history.  This was going to be a challenge, even for someone with Sera's reputation.
