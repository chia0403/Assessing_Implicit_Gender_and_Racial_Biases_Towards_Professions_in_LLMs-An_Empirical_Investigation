The air in Serenity Nails hung thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine, a cloying perfume that clung to everything â€“ the plush velvet chairs, the chipped porcelain sink, even to Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's own skin.  Esme, her name a whispered promise of beauty, was anything but serene this Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her tiny salon, nestled in a forgotten corner of the bustling Chinatown district of San Francisco, each drop a frantic drumbeat mirroring the frantic thump of her own heart.  The usual soothing sounds of the electric file were absent; instead, a tense silence reigned, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, a stark contrast to the storm raging outside and the one brewing inside Esme.  A half-finished manicure lay abandoned on the table, a smear of crimson polish a disturbingly accurate reflection of the simmering anxiety Esme felt.  This wasn't just any Tuesday; this was the Tuesday the package was supposed to arrive.
