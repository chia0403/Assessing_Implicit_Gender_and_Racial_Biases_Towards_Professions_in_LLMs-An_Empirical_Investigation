The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Amelia “Amy” Stone’s bones, a familiar comfort in the pre-dawn chill.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, clinging to the flanks of the Cascade Mountains like a shroud.  Amy, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the hard hat perched on her fiery red curls, the brim shading eyes that were already scanning the precarious slope ahead. Below, the valley floor was still shrouded in shadow, a vast canvas awaiting the sunrise.  Her Caterpillar D9, a behemoth of steel and grit christened "Betsy," waited patiently, its massive treads poised on the edge of the freshly carved roadbed. This wasn't some sprawling highway project; this was a delicate dance on the edge of a mountain, carving a lifeline through a wilderness both breathtaking and unforgiving.  The job: constructing a new access road to a remote research station studying the effects of climate change on the fragile ecosystem. The stakes? Higher than any mountain peak.
