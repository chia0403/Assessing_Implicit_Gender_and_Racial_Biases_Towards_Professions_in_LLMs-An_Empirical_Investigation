The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, its faded lettering barely proclaiming "Armand's A-1 Barbershop."  Inside, the scent of Bay Rum aftershave battled a stubborn aroma of stale coffee and something vaguely floral â€“ probably the wilting lilies Mrs. Dubois had left as a peace offering after her last less-than-stellar haircut.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the swirling patterns in the polished wood of the barber chair where Armand Dubois, Jr., sat, meticulously sharpening his shears.  His hands, strong and calloused, moved with a practiced grace that belied the weariness etched into his lined face. The rhythmic *snip-snip-snip* of the honing steel was the only sound besides the insistent chirping of cicadas outside, a relentless soundtrack to the simmering heat of a July afternoon in the sleepy town of Evangeline, Louisiana.
