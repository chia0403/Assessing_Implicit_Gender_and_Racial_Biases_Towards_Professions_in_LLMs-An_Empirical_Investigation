The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Jean Dubois like a second skin.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost hypnotic soundtrack to the sweltering afternoon.

She surveyed her surroundings: the ramshackle, paint-peeled houses of Bayou Lafourche, each one a potential sale, each one a potential headache.  Her battered Ford pickup truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Swamp Queen," sat baking in the sun a few yards away, its dusty chrome gleaming faintly.  Today's target: convincing the notoriously stubborn Madame Evangeline Broussard to upgrade her ancient, leak-prone cistern to A.J.'s revolutionary, solar-powered water system.
