The aroma of stale crayons and slightly burnt toast hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the childish drawings taped to the windowpanes, dappled the brightly coloured carpet of Room 2B at Sunny Meadows Elementary.  It was 7:15 AM, a time usually filled with the joyous chaos of tiny humans bursting through the door, eager to begin their day.  But this morning, an unnerving silence settled over the room, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the oversized classroom clock, each second feeling like a hammer blow against the quiet. Eleanor Vance, with her unruly auburn braid escaping its clip and a faint smudge of glitter on her cheek from yesterday's art project, felt a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with a missing nap mat or a spilled juice box. This was different. This wasâ€¦ unsettlingly still.
