The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song across the frozen tundra, whipping snow into a frenzied dance around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185.  The skeletal branches of the spruce trees clawed at the twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple of the fading sun.  Below, the vast, snow-covered expanse of the Yukon Territory stretched out like a crumpled white sheet, broken only by the occasional dark line of a frozen river and the ghostly shimmer of ice crystals catching the last light.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and something else… something metallic and faintly acrid, a whisper of trouble on the wind.  Evie shivered, pulling her fur-lined hood tighter around her face, her breath misting in the frigid air.  This wasn't just another cargo run; she felt it in the icy grip of the wind, in the unsettling silence broken only by the drone of the Cessna's engine.  This was… different.
