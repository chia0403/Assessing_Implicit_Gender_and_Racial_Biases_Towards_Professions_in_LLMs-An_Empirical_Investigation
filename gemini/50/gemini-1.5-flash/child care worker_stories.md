The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the collar of her bright yellow raincoat pulled high.  Fallen leaves, a swirling tapestry of crimson and gold, crunched under her worn boots.  The air smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke, a scent both comforting and melancholic, fitting for the grey, brooding sky that hung low over the quaint Victorian houses of Ashwood.  Amelia, a childcare worker at Sunny Days Nursery, tucked a stray lock behind her ear, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  She was already late, a fact that wouldn't sit well with Mrs. Periwinkle, the notoriously punctual owner, and even less so with the gaggle of boisterous toddlers awaiting her care.  Inside her worn satchel, the faint scent of peanut butter and crayons mingled with the musty aroma of her well-loved copy of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."  Another day, another adventure in the chaotic, rewarding world of early childhood education awaited.
