The first frost of autumn had kissed the emerald lawns of Blackwood Manor, transforming them into a tapestry of russet, gold, and jade.  A thin layer of ice clung to the ornate ironwork of the fountain, its sculpted nymphs now frozen in perpetual mid-dance.  Arthur Penhaligon, his breath misting in the pre-dawn chill, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth that clawed at the sky with its gargoyle-studded turrets, loomed behind him, a silent, watchful giant.  The crisp air carried the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Arthur, a comforting aroma that spoke of the end of one season and the promise of another, even if that promise, for Arthur, was always the same: more work.
