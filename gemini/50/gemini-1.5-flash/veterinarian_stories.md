The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Reed’s weathered cabin, rattling the frost-laden windows and threatening to tear the flimsy porch awning from its moorings.  Snow, a relentless, swirling blizzard of white, obscured everything beyond the immediate reach of the porch lamp, transforming the usually picturesque vista of the Chugach Mountains into a chaotic, ethereal landscape.  Inside, the warmth of a crackling wood stove battled valiantly against the encroaching cold, casting flickering shadows across Evelyn’s worn leather armchair and the overflowing stack of veterinary journals perched precariously on the coffee table.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hall, a constant reminder of the relentless march of time in this isolated corner of the world.  Tonight, however, time felt particularly heavy, burdened by the silent emergency waiting in the makeshift animal clinic just beyond the kitchen door.
