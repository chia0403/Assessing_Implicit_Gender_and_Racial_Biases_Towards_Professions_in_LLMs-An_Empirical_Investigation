Her easel, perched precariously on a wind-battered outcrop, faced the tumultuous expanse of water, a churning maelstrom of grey and white under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  The abandoned fisherman's hut, its roof half-collapsed and windows gaping like empty eye sockets, provided a stark, almost sinister, backdrop to her ambitious masterpiece – a testament to the raw, untamed beauty that both captivated and terrified her.
