The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  His shop, tucked away on a cobbled lane barely wide enough for a cart, was a haven of hushed industry.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of the single window, illuminated motes dancing in the air, catching on the rich, deep hues of the fabrics draped across the walls: emerald velvets, sapphire silks, and the burnished gold of a hand-woven tapestry depicting a mythical stag, its antlers impossibly large, its eyes glittering with an unnatural luminescence.  Outside, the relentless drumming of rain against the slate roof provided a steady, rhythmic counterpoint to the snip-snip-snip of Elias's shears, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.
