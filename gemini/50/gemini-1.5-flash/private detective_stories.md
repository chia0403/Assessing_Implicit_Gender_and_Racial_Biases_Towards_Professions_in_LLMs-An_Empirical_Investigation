The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a rhythm that mirrored the relentless pounding in his head.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral – lilies, probably, from some grieving widow he’d disappointed.  His office, a cramped space above a laundromat on the rain-slicked streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin district, offered little respite from the grim realities of the city below.  Jack, a man whose weary eyes held the weight of too many unsolved cases and even more broken promises,  sipped lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a familiar companion to the bitter truth that another case had just gone south.  The flickering neon sign of the "Suds & Suds" laundromat cast an anemic glow on the peeling paint of his walls, illuminating the overflowing ashtray and the chaotic jumble of case files scattered across his desk.  The city outside was a symphony of sirens and shouting, a soundtrack to his solitary existence.
