The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whistling a song only Silas Blackwood understood.  Silas, his breath misting in the frigid November air, gripped the worn handle of his axe, the steel cold against his calloused palm.

The towering trees, some older than the nation itself, were cloaked in a thin layer of early snow, their needles shimmering like a million tiny, frozen stars under the pale dawn.  The air smelled of damp earth, pine sap, and the sharp, clean tang of approaching winter.  This was Silas's kingdom, his life's work, and today, he would fell a giant.
