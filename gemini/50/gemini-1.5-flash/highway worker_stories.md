This stretch, between Ely and Austin, was notorious; a desolate ribbon of road slicing through an unforgiving landscape of scrub brush, jagged mountains, and the endless, whispering expanse of the desert.  Elias, a man hardened by years of battling the elements and the unforgiving nature of his job, knew every pothole, every crack, every treacherous curve of this unforgiving highway like the lines on his own calloused hands.
