The flickering neon sign of "Benny's Burgers" cast a lurid, greasy glow across the rain-slicked alley.  The scent of stale grease and desperation hung heavy in the air, a fitting perfume for the city's underbelly.  Twenty-seven-year-old Amelia Hernandez, paralegal extraordinaire (at least, that's what she told herself on particularly rough days), hunched deeper into her threadbare trench coat, her breath misting in the frigid November air.  The crumpled file in her hands, its cover adorned with a lurid photograph of a blood-stained mahogany desk, felt almost as cold as the rain plastering her hair to her scalp.  Amelia wasn't supposed to be here, in this grimy back alley, meeting a confidential informant at two a.m. But then again,  Amelia Hernandez rarely did things by the book.  This particular case, however, threatened to rewrite the very definition of "off-the-books."
