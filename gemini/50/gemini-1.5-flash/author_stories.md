The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a fishing trawler repurposed as a research vessel.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Below, the churning grey waters of the North Atlantic swallowed the fading light, a mirror to the churning anxieties in Amelia's own heart.  Her latest novel, a sprawling historical fiction about a 17th-century sea captain, had flopped spectacularly, leaving her with a mountain of debt and a gnawing self-doubt that felt as vast and unforgiving as the ocean surrounding her.  This research trip to the Faroe Islands, funded by a grudging advance from her publisher for a non-fiction book about seafaring folklore, was her last chance to salvage her career â€“ and maybe, just maybe, her sanity.
