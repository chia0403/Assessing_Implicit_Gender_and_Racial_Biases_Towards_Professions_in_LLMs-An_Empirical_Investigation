The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grand River Public Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life seemed as meticulously ordered as the Dewey Decimal System itself, adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose, her gaze sweeping across the silent rows of towering bookshelves.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient panes of glass, but within the library's hallowed halls, a profound quiet reigned, broken only by the gentle tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the foyer and the occasional rustle of turning pages.  Eleanor, however, felt a tremor of unease, a subtle discordance in the usually harmonious symphony of the library, a feeling that somethingâ€¦ was amiss.
