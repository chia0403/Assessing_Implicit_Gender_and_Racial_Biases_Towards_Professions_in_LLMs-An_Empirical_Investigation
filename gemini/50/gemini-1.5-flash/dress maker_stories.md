The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the velvet curtains and the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the arched window of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier.  Evangeline, herself, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the secrets stitched into her exquisite gowns, hummed a low, lilting tune as she meticulously pleated a length of shimmering emerald taffeta.  Her nimble fingers, adorned with rings bearing tiny, glittering emeralds that mirrored the fabric, moved with a practiced grace honed over decades spent transforming simple cloth into breathtaking works of art.  The atelier, nestled in a quiet cobbled alleyway just off the bustling Place des Vosges in Paris, was a sanctuary, a world away from the clamor of the city, a place where dreams were draped, pinned, and finally, sewn to life.
