The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, doing little to thaw the icy chill that had settled deep in her bones.  Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of her office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless ache in her head.  It was the kind of November day that sucked the colour from the world, leaving behind only greys and the muted browns of the late-autumn landscape visible through the rain-streaked glass. Amelia, a claims adjuster for "Aegis Insurance," stared out at the bleak vista of the coastal town of Port Blossom, its charmingly dilapidated waterfront buildings now obscured by a thick veil of mist and spray.  The air smelled of salt, seaweed, and something faintly… acrid.  Something that smelled suspiciously like burnt sugar and regret.  It was a smell that Amelia, unfortunately, knew well.
