## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and something vaguely burnt clung to the air in Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, a testament to her haphazard attempts at aromatherapy and, more recently, a regrettable microwave incident involving a forgotten cup of Earl Grey. Sunlight, filtered through the sheer curtains, painted stripes across the worn Persian rug, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the quiet room. Eleanor, a woman whose own life was considerably more chaotic than the carefully curated calm she projected to her patients, took a deep breath, smoothed down the perpetually unruly waves of her chestnut hair, and adjusted the small, framed watercolor of a robin perched on a snowy branch. It was a gift from a particularly grateful client, a gentle reminder that even in the bleakest winters, spring eventually found its way. Today, however, spring felt very far away. The silence stretched, thick and expectant, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway. Her next patient, a teenager named Liam, was notoriously late, but Eleanor knew he would arrive eventually, burdened by unspoken anxieties and a teenage angst that crackled in the air like static electricity. She just wished she knew what was causing it this time. The waiting was its own special form of torture.

## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's Counseling Office:** Located on the second floor of a creaky Victorian house in the historic district of the small, charming town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The house, painted a faded lavender, had been converted into a multi-practitioner space, housing a massage therapist, a chiropractor, and Eleanor's counseling practice. Her office itself is cozy and intentionally designed to feel welcoming and safe. 

*   **Furniture:** A comfortable, overstuffed armchair for patients, a smaller, equally comfortable chair for Eleanor, a low coffee table cluttered with tissues, journals, and art supplies, a small desk piled high with files and research papers.
*   **Decor:** Calming colors (pale blues, greens, and soft grays), natural light, plants (mostly succulents, since Eleanor's green thumb was questionable), framed artwork (a mix of landscapes, abstract pieces, and the aforementioned robin watercolor), and various fidget toys scattered around for anxious hands.
*   **Atmosphere:** Intentionally peaceful and inviting, but also slightly cluttered and lived-in, reflecting Eleanor's own personality. The air is often scented with essential oils, though the strength and accuracy of the scents vary wildly depending on Eleanor's latest aromatherapy experiment. A grandfather clock ticks steadily in the hallway outside, a constant reminder of the passage of time.
