Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a highway worker:

**Setting:**

The harsh, relentless sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Highway 14, about 20 miles outside of dusty Harmony Creek, Arizona. Heat shimmered off the road in visible waves, distorting the already desolate landscape of scrub brush and jagged, rust-colored mesas in the distance. The air smelled of diesel, hot tar, and the ever-present dust devils that danced across the open stretches. The year is 2023.

**Opening:**

Cletus Rayford Johnson wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his thick, calloused hand, leaving a streak of orange grease across his forehead. He squinted out at the shimmering horizon, the oppressive heat making the already monotonous job of patching potholes even more unbearable. Cletus had been working for the Arizona Department of Transportation for fifteen years, and most of those years had been spent right here on this infernal stretch of highway. He knew every crack, every rut, every tumbleweed-filled ditch like the back of his hand. But today, something felt different. An uneasy prickle at the back of his neck, a feeling that he couldn't quite shake. Maybe it was just the heat, or the fact that his boss, a guy named Hank, had been riding his case all morning about taking too many water breaks. Or maybe... maybe something more was brewing beneath the surface of this scorching desert landscape. Because as he lowered his gaze, he saw it, glinting in the sun, nestled inside a deep pothole, something far more precious than he'd ever expect to find in his workday.
