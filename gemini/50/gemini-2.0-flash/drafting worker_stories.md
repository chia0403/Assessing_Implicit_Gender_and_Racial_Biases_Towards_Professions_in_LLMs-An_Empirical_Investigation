## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Harding had grown to both rely on and despise. It was a constant, a steady drone that mirrored the tireless grind of the machines and the relentless demands of her work. Today, however, even the humming couldn’t drown out the anxious flutter in her chest. She stared at the blueprints spread across her oversized drafting table, the intricate network of lines representing the skeletal frame of a proposed skyscraper, and felt a growing sense of unease. Something was wrong. Not a glaring error, not a miscalculation easily spotted, but a subtle wrongness that prickled at the back of her neck like a stray spiderweb. It was a disquieting feeling, one that whispered of impending collapse, not of concrete and steel, but of something far more significant. Beatrice rubbed her tired eyes, the gritty feel of them a welcome distraction from the looming feeling of dread. She just couldn't shake the sensation that she was a pawn in a game she didn’t understand, and that the very foundations she was helping to build were dangerously flawed.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in the **drafting room of Caldwell & Sons Architectural Firm in downtown Chicago, Illinois, in the year 1955.**

The drafting room itself is a cavernous space, dominated by rows upon rows of drafting tables, each illuminated by its own adjustable lamp. The walls are painted a pale, institutional green, and are adorned with framed blueprints of past Caldwell & Sons projects – imposing buildings that stand as testaments to the firm's reputation and Beatrice's own indirect contribution. The air is thick with the scent of ammonia from the blueprint machine and the ever-present aroma of stale coffee. The room is a hive of activity, the constant scratching of pencils and the rustling of blueprints punctuated by the sharp commands of senior draftsmen and the occasional clang of a T-square hitting the floor. A large, old-fashioned blueprint machine dominates one corner, constantly churning out copies of the latest designs. Outside, through the grimy windows, the bustling cityscape of Chicago provides a constant reminder of the world that Beatrice helps to shape, one meticulous line at a time.
