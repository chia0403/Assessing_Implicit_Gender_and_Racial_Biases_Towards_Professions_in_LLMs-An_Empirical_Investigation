Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a plumber:

**Setting:**

The air in the small, seaside town of Port Blossom was thick with salt and the promise of a coming storm. Grey, bruised clouds gathered over the choppy waves, and the rhythmic clang of the buoy off the harbor entrance seemed to echo a growing unease. Most of the shops along Seabreeze Promenade had already pulled down their awnings, battening down the hatches against the inevitable downpour. The scent of fried fish and chips, usually a comforting staple, hung heavy and stale in the damp air.

**Story Opening:**

"Blast and barnacles!" yelled Barnaby "Barney" Fitzwilliam, wrench slipping from the corroded nut with a frustrating *ping*. Saltwater, gritty and foul, sprayed into his face, stinging his already irritated eyes. He swore again, a string of nautical-themed curses he'd learned from his grandfather, a grizzled old fisherman. Barney, a plumber by trade, was crammed awkwardly under the sink of the "Salty Siren" fish and chip shop, his usually jovial face contorted in a grimace of concentration. The ancient pipes, victims of decades of salty air and neglect, had finally given way, leaving Mrs. Higgins, the shop owner, in a state of near hysteria about the lunchtime rush. He wiped his face with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of grease across his forehead. "This is just what I needed on a Tuesday," he muttered, feeling the first fat raindrops begin to splat against the window above him. Today was shaping up to be a real barnacle-encrusted disaster.
