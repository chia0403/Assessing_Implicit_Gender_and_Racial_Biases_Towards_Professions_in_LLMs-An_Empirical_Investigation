The humid Georgia air hung heavy and thick, a tangible blanket that stuck to everything. Sweat already beaded on Benjamin Alistair Sterling's brow before he even lifted the gas-powered hedge trimmer from the bed of his beat-up Ford Ranger. The sun, a relentless spotlight, glared off the manicured lawns of the River Oaks subdivision, a community where every blade of grass was expected to stand at attention.

River Oaks was a green purgatory, a testament to the tireless efforts of landscapers like Ben. He grimaced. He much preferred the wilder beauty of the North Georgia mountains, the untamed forests where rhododendrons bloomed in defiant bursts of color. Here, everything was measured, controlled, and meticulously maintained, a constant battle against the creeping chaos of nature.

He adjusted his worn baseball cap, pulling it lower over his eyes. Today's project was Mrs. Eleanor Van Derlyn's prize-winning rose garden. A sprawling, multi-tiered affair bursting with hybrid teas and floribundas, it was a showcase of horticultural perfection, and Mrs. Van Derlyn was a demanding curator. Ben braced himself. This was going to be a long, hot, and undoubtedly scrutinizing day.
