The scent of jasmine and old money hung heavy in the air of the Grand Alexandria Hotel, a landmark on Paris's Champs-Élysées. Polished brass fixtures gleamed under the soft glow of crystal chandeliers, reflecting back the hushed whispers of arriving guests. It was precisely the kind of atmosphere Jean-Pierre Dubois thrived in, a finely woven tapestry of elegance and discreet service.

Jean-Pierre, impeccably dressed in his bespoke, navy blue uniform, stood behind the concierge desk, his posture ramrod straight. He was a man of quiet observation, a master of anticipation. His dark eyes, framed by meticulously groomed eyebrows, scanned the lobby, registering the details: the harried businessman clutching a briefcase, the giggling couple hand-in-hand, the solitary woman with the faraway look, nursing a cup of coffee at the nearby salon. He knew, or could deduce with astonishing accuracy, their needs and desires, a skill honed over twenty years of dedicated service. This morning, however, a faint unease prickled at the back of his neck, a dissonance in the usual harmonious symphony of the Grand Alexandria. He couldn't quite place it, but something felt… different. And Jean-Pierre Dubois trusted his instincts implicitly.
