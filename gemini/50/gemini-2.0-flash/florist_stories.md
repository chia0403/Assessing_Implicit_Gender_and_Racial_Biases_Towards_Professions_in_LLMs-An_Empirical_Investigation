## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A narrow, cobblestone street in the historic Montmartre district of Paris, early spring. The air, still carrying a faint chill from the recent winter, is thick with the scent of damp stone, freshly baked bread from the patisserie across the way, and the burgeoning life of the season. Sunlight, fractured by the wrought-iron balconies and leaning buildings, dances in patches on the uneven pavement.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door to "Les Fleurs Oubliées" tinkled merrily as Elodie Marguerite Dubois hurried inside, a flurry of emerald silk scarf and muttered apologies. She was late. Again. Madame Renault, owner of the bakery, had already begun stacking baguettes in her display window, and the gruff butcher next door was hosing down his sidewalk. Elodie knew she'd be met with a symphony of Gallic sighs and disappointed shakes of the head.

"Bonjour, bonjour!" she called out, peeling off her scarf and tossing it onto the back of the velvet-upholstered armchair in the corner. "Traffic was…unimaginable!" A blatant lie, she knew, but one delivered with a disarming smile that usually softened even the most hardened Parisian heart.

Her shop, "Les Fleurs Oubliées" – The Forgotten Flowers – was a riot of colour and fragrant chaos. Blooms overflowed from antique ceramic pitchers, trailing vines climbed the exposed brick walls, and the earthy scent of potting soil mingled with the sweet perfume of lilies. It was a sanctuary, a refuge from the frenetic energy of the city outside. A refuge that desperately needed her attention, lest the bouquets wilt and the clientele disappear. But first, café. And perhaps a quick rummage through the new shipment of tulips – a vibrant, rebellious splash of spring amidst the lingering melancholy of winter.
