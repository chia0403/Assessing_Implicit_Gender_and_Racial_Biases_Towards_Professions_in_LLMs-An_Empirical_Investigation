The biting wind whipped around Reginald "Reggie" Featherstone's face, stinging his cheeks a rosy pink that clashed miserably with the grime already clinging to his skin. He spat, the globule of moisture disappearing almost instantly into the swirling, gray air. He hated days like this. Days that threatened snow, or worse, sleet, and turned what was normally a challenging but manageable job into a potentially lethal dance with gravity on a slanted stage.

Reggie surveyed the dilapidated Victorian house before him, its once-grand facade now peeling paint and crumbling gingerbread trim. It stood on a knoll overlooking the small, perpetually-foggy town of Hollow Creek, Maine. The house, nicknamed "The Widow's Weep" by the locals, had been vacant for twenty years, ever since old Mrs. Abernathy had passed away. Whispers of hauntings and tragic love affairs clung to it like the ivy that choked its walls. Reggie, of course, didn't believe in ghosts. He believed in faulty shingles, rotten joists, and the cold, hard reality of a dwindling bank account.

He tugged his woolen hat further down, shielding his eyes from the pale, anemic sun trying desperately to break through the oppressive clouds. He shifted the coil of roofing felt slung over his shoulder, its rough texture digging into his calloused skin. This was it. The Widow's Weep, and the potential for a much-needed payday. Time to face the music, and maybe, just maybe, appease whatever restless spirits (or structural deficiencies) resided beneath those decaying eaves.
