## The Story Opening:

The stale air hung thick with the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams. Sunlight, choked by dust-laden windows, struggled to illuminate the faded wallpaper and peeling paint of the living room. Abigail Eloise Featherstone, a seasoned real estate agent with a name as long and elaborate as her listings were often…not, shivered despite the July heat. She smoothed down the lapel of her navy blazer, a practiced motion designed to project an image of confidence that felt increasingly hollow.

"Charming, isn't it?" she chirped, her voice echoing unnaturally in the cavernous space. "Full of…potential."

Potential for demolition, she thought grimly, surveying the cracked plaster and stained carpets. This place looked like a forgotten Victorian nightmare had coughed up a lung here on Oak Street. 

Across from her, Mrs. Higgins, a prospective buyer with a face like a prune and eyes that seemed to judge everything from Abigail's sensible shoes to the lifespan of the dust bunnies clinging to the baseboards, remained unimpressed.

"Potential for what, exactly, Miss Featherstone?" Mrs. Higgins' voice was a dry rasp, like sandpaper on bone. "A breeding ground for ghosts?"

Abigail forced a smile. "Well, certainly a rich history!"

## The Setting:

**Location:** The story is set in the small, somewhat economically depressed town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Havenwood was once a thriving hub of textile mills but has since fallen on hard times, leaving behind a mix of dilapidated Victorian houses and struggling businesses.

**Specific Setting:** The opening takes place inside a dilapidated Victorian house at **312 Oak Street, Havenwood, MA**. This house is one of Abigail's latest listings and is notoriously difficult to sell due to its state of disrepair and rumored history. The house is known locally as the "Old Hawthorne Place," named after the family that originally owned it a century ago.

**Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of decay, neglect, and a lingering sense of melancholy. The house feels cold and lifeless, despite the summer heat, and there's an undeniable sense of unease pervading the air. The faded grandeur of the Victorian architecture only serves to highlight the stark reality of its current state, contributing to a feeling of forgotten elegance and lost prosperity. The setting reinforces the themes of the story, which could involve confronting the past, finding value in unexpected places, or even dealing with the supernatural.
