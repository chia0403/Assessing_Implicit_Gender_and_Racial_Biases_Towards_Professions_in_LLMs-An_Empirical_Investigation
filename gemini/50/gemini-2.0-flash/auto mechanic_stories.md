The grease under Marco Antonio Ramirez' fingernails was almost as permanent as the engine block tattoos etched onto his forearms. He wiped his hands, leaving streaks on his already-stained coveralls, and squinted up at the late afternoon sun slanting through the open bay doors of Ramirez & Sons Auto Repair. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating a chaotic symphony of tools, spare parts, and the disassembled innards of a 1972 Mustang that had seen better decades.

Ramirez & Sons was nestled on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Montana, a town that valued its peace and quiet above all else. The creek itself, a shimmering thread of glacier-fed water, snaked through the valley, its gentle murmur usually drowned out by the roar of Marco’s impact wrench. The shop, a weathered, single-story building painted a faded shade of blue that had long surrendered to the harsh Montana sun, sat just off the main road, a constant reminder to the town of its existence, a comforting, if sometimes noisy, presence. The air, usually thick with the aroma of motor oil and exhaust, was today punctuated by the sweet, floral scent of the honeysuckle climbing the rusty chain-link fence separating the shop from Mrs. Henderson’s prize-winning rose garden next door. Marco usually enjoyed the smell, a reminder of the fleeting beauty of summer, but today it just made him antsy. He had a feeling that honeysuckle wasn't the only unusual scent in the air. Something was coming.
