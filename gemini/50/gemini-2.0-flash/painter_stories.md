Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a painter named Evangeline Iris Dubois:

**Setting:**

The air in the studio was thick with the scent of turpentine and linseed oil, a smell that Evangeline Iris Dubois found more comforting than the finest perfume. The studio itself was a converted attic space in a creaking Victorian house overlooking the San Francisco Bay. The slanted ceilings and dormer windows lent it a quirky charm, while the panoramic view of the city and the shimmering water provided endless inspiration. Sunlight, filtered through the fog that perpetually clung to the city, cast an ethereal glow across the room, illuminating canvases stacked against the walls, brushes crammed into chipped ceramic mugs, and tubes of paint squeezed almost dry. Everything was covered in a fine layer of pigment dust – a testament to Evangeline's tireless pursuit of capturing the world on canvas. Outside, the rhythmic clang of the cable car climbing the steep hill was a constant, soothing background noise, a symphony of urban life accompanying Evangeline's solitary art.

**Opening:**

Evangeline Iris Dubois stared at the canvas, a blank expanse of pristine white mocking her with its potential. She’d been at it for weeks, this particular portrait of a woman she’d seen only once, a fleeting glimpse caught on a rainy street corner near North Beach. The woman’s face – sharp, angular, etched with a weariness that hinted at a life lived on the fringes – had haunted Evangeline ever since. But every attempt to capture her essence, to transfer that ephemeral image from her memory onto the canvas, fell flat. The brush felt clumsy in her hand, the colors muted and lifeless. Frustration simmered within her, a familiar companion in her creative process, but today it felt particularly potent, almost corrosive. She threw her brush down onto the palette with a clatter, splattering a blob of crimson onto a pool of ultramarine. "Damn it," she muttered, her voice barely audible above the distant foghorn's mournful cry. "Damn it all to hell."
