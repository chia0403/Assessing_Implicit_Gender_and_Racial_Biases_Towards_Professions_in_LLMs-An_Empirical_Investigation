## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a physical blow. He coughed, pulling his tie a little looser at his throat. Not sewage, not precisely. More like…wet dog mixed with burnt toast and a hint of desperation. This was definitely the right place. Bart checked the address on his phone again, just to be sure. 13 Mistletoe Lane. The address of Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle and, judging by the aroma assaulting his nostrils, the location of a potential claim nightmare. He plastered on his best customer service smile, the one that said, "I'm here to help, even if your house smells like a dumpster fire," and raised his hand to knock.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the quaint, slightly eccentric town of Hollybrook, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It's December, and a thick blanket of snow covers everything, muffling the sounds of the town and giving it a picture-postcard charm that Bart, currently standing on a decaying porch, was finding increasingly ironic. Hollybrook is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, gossip travels faster than the speed of light, and unusual occurrences are considered quaint local lore rather than genuine cause for concern. The town's economy relies heavily on tourism, particularly during the Christmas season, when its residents wholeheartedly embrace all things festive and cheesy. Think inflatable snowmen, synchronized Christmas light displays that could blind a reindeer, and enough gingerbread to build a small village. Bart Higgins, having been transferred to the Hollybrook branch of "SecureLife Insurance" six months ago, is still adjusting to the slower pace and the decidedly…unique…clients.
