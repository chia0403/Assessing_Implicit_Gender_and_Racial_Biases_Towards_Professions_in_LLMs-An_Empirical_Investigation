The sickly sweet smell of bubblegum fluoride hung heavy in the air, a smell Deirdre Anne McTavish had grown to both loathe and, strangely, find comforting. It was the scent of her livelihood, the scent of sparkling, cavity-free futures. At least, that’s what she told herself every morning as she clipped on her nametag and plastered a professional, yet empathetic, smile on her face.

The setting was Sunshine Smiles Dental, a small but brightly decorated practice nestled in the heart of Havenwood, Oregon, a town known for its breathtaking mountain views and surprisingly high sugar consumption. Dr. Kenji Tanaka, the perpetually jovial owner, had tried to foster a "beach vacation" vibe, hence the coral-painted walls, the seascape prints, and the gentle sound of simulated waves that piped through the ceiling speakers. Deirdre, however, found it more reminiscent of a dentist’s office that desperately needed a vacation itself.

Outside, the late October wind rattled the bare branches of the maple trees lining Main Street, scattering crimson and gold leaves across the sidewalks. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed, a constant, low-level hum that underscored the quiet dread in the waiting room. Mrs. Higgins, a regular who claimed her gums were allergic to toothpaste, was already perched on the edge of her seat, clutching a tattered copy of "Cat Fancy" like a shield. Deirdre sighed. Another day, another battle against plaque and questionable dental hygiene choices.
