## Story Opening:

The scent of beeswax and pressed linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma for Theodore Augustine Finch, a tailor of some renown in the city of Elderwood. It clung to his meticulously-trimmed beard, permeated the very fibers of his tweed waistcoat, and settled, like a gentle film, on the spools of thread that lined the shelves of his shop, "Finch's Finest Fittings." Today, however, the familiar scent offered little solace. Theodore, a man normally as placid and precise as the stitches he laid, was agitated.

He paced the length of his small workshop, his worn leather slippers whispering across the polished oak floor. The morning light, usually so welcome as it streamed through the large, arched window, now felt like a relentless spotlight, highlighting the unfinished commission laid out on his cutting table: a magnificent coat of deep indigo velvet, destined for none other than Lord Ashworth, the city's wealthiest and most demanding patron. The velvet, normally a source of pride, now seemed to mock him, its rich sheen a constant reminder of the intricate embroidery, a swirling pattern of silver and moonstones depicting the constellation Ursa Major, that was *due yesterday*.

He paused before the coat, his hand hovering over the meticulously crafted neckline. He knew, with a certainty that burrowed deep in his gut, that he couldn't finish it. Not on his own, not in time. He had tried to refuse the commission, of course. He was, after all, a solitary craftsman. But Lord Ashworth, with his oily charm and veiled threats, had been insistent. Now, Theodore was paying the price for his momentary lapse in judgment, a price that could cost him more than just his reputation.

## Setting:

**Elderwood:** A bustling city nestled in the heart of the Silverwood Forest, Elderwood was a place of contrasts. Gleaming towers of polished white stone, the homes of the city's wealthy elite, stood in stark contrast to the tightly packed, winding streets of the lower wards, where artisans and merchants plied their trades. The Silverwood River, a silvery ribbon snaking through the city, powered the watermills that ground the grain and powered the looms, lending the air a constant, gentle hum.

Finch's Finest Fittings was located on a quiet, cobblestone lane in the artisan district, a respectable but not overly prestigious location. The shop itself was small but meticulously maintained. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched window, illuminating bolts of colorful fabric stacked neatly on shelves, spools of thread arranged in perfect color gradients, and an assortment of tailor's tools, each gleaming with careful cleaning. The walls were adorned with sketches of Theodore's previous creations, testament to his skill and artistry. The atmosphere was one of quiet craftsmanship and understated elegance. Outside, the sounds of the city - the clang of the blacksmith's hammer, the calls of street vendors, the rumble of carriages - faded into a gentle background hum, a reminder that even in this sanctuary of fabric and thread, Theodore Augustine Finch could not escape the pressures of the world outside.
