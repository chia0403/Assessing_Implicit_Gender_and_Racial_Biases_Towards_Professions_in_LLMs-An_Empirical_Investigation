**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the slow death of Reginald Bartholomew Finch's hope. He stared at the spreadsheet on his monitor, the numbers mocking him with their stubborn refusal to climb. Another week, another dismal performance. Reginald, a man who considered himself a wordsmith, a persuader of the highest caliber, was being thoroughly, utterly, and humiliatingly outsold by Brenda from accounting, a woman whose personal style could best be described as "comfortably crocheted."

**Setting:**

The story begins in the open-plan office of "Surefire Solutions," a mid-sized company specializing in cloud-based data management software for small to medium-sized businesses. The office is located on the fifth floor of a nondescript office building in the outer suburbs of Chicago. Beige is the dominant color, a theme carried through from the carpeting to the cubicle walls. A motivational poster featuring a picture of a majestic eagle soaring over a mountain range hangs askew near the water cooler, its message of "Reach for the Sky!" feeling particularly hollow to Reginald. The air is thick with the smell of lukewarm coffee and stale printer ink. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howls, a constant reminder of the harsh reality beyond the beige.
