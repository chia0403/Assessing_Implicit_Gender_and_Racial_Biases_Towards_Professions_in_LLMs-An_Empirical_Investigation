The buzzing of the fluorescent lights in "Glamorous You!" was a discordant symphony Amelia Isabella Rossi had long learned to tune out. Still, on mornings like this, gray and drizzly, each hum and flicker grated on her nerves like a poorly sharpened cuticle pusher. The salon, nestled on a busy corner of Maple Avenue in the sleepy town of Willow Creek, smelled of a potent mix of hairspray, perm solution, and lingering disappointment.

Amelia surveyed her domain. Rows of swivel chairs, perpetually stained with rogue hair dye, faced large, mirrored vanities. Magazines, dog-eared and showcasing increasingly outdated trends, lay scattered across the reception area. Beyond, in a smaller, more private room, sat the facial chair, draped in a slightly faded lilac towel, waiting for its first victim... or rather, client.

Willow Creek wasn't exactly a mecca of high fashion. Most of Amelia's clientele consisted of women wanting a "trim and style" that hadn't evolved since the Reagan era, or teenagers requesting streaks of neon pink they'd inevitably regret by Monday morning. Amelia, however, held onto a stubborn spark of hope, a belief that even in Willow Creek, beauty could blossom. She was determined to bring a touch of glamour, a sprinkle of confidence, to this town, one head of hair, one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, at a time. But today, the gray skies and the buzzing lights seemed to be conspiring against her. Today feltâ€¦ slow.
