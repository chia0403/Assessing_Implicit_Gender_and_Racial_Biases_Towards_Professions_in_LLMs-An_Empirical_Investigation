Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an editor:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The rain was a vindictive percussionist, drumming a frantic rhythm against the leaded-glass windows of Amelia Rose Cartwright's office. Inside, the scent of old paper and over-brewed Earl Grey hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the stormy London evening.  Amelia, hunched over her desk, the dim glow of a gooseneck lamp painting her cheekbones with a soft light, scrubbed furiously at a coffee stain blossoming on the title page of a manuscript. This was it: "The Serpent and the Scholar," the debut novel from a promising (and infuriatingly elusive) young author named Elias Thorne.  It was due to the printers by morning, and she was still wrestling with a particularly stubborn passage about a talking raven and a misplaced comma.

Amelia Rose Cartwright, Senior Editor at Bartholomew & Sons Publishing, had seen her share of eccentric authors and fantastical plots, but Elias Thorne was pushing her limits.  His talent was undeniable, a raw, untamed thing that glittered like fool's gold. But his deadlinesâ€¦ his deadlines were legendary.  He'd promised this manuscript weeks ago, delivered it only this afternoon in a crumpled brown paper package, and now here she was, battling grammar gremlins and the impending doom of missing the print run. The phone, a Bakelite monster she secretly loathed, gave a shrill ring, cutting through the storm's noise. Amelia sighed, pushing the manuscript aside.  It was probably Elias, with another "minor" tweak that would require a complete rewrite of chapter seven.
