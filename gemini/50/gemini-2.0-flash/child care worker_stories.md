The stale smell of disinfectant and spilled apple juice hung heavy in the air, clinging to the brightly colored plastic toys and worn, alphabet-covered rug. It was 5:47 PM on a Thursday, and the late-afternoon sun was casting long, melancholic shadows across the "Tiny Tykes" daycare in the heart of suburban Maple Creek. The sounds of giggling children and the insistent drone of Raffi singing "Baby Beluga" from the CD player had finally, blessedly, subsided.

Flora Nightingale, a 24-year-old child care worker with perpetually tired eyes and a scattering of freckles across her nose, leaned against the counter, massaging the dull ache in her lower back. Five minutes until official closing, and only little Timmy Henderson remained, his nose practically glued to the window, waiting for his mom, who was, as usual, running late. Flora knew the feeling. She lived a thirty-minute bus ride away, and the thought of facing the overflowing sink of dirty dishes waiting for her in her tiny apartment almost made her wish she could stay at Tiny Tykes forever, surrounded by the manufactured joy and predictable chaos she had, against all odds, grown to love.
