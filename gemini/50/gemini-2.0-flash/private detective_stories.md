## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless percussion against the corrugated iron roof of my office, a fitting soundtrack to the misery oozing from the man slumped in the visitor's chair. He smelled vaguely of desperation and cheap whiskey, a cocktail I knew all too well. He wrung his hands, the knuckles white and strained, and avoided my gaze. I sighed, the sound lost in the drumming of the rain. Another lost soul looking for a lifeline.

"So," I said, leaning back in my creaky swivel chair, the springs groaning a protest. "Mrâ€¦?"

He flinched, finally meeting my eyes. "Clements. Arthur Clements. And you're...?"

"Valentine Moreau," I supplied, offering a tight-lipped smile. "Private Detective. What can I do for you, Mr. Clements?"

## Setting:

Valentine Moreau's office, located above a failing fishmonger's shop in the less-than-glamorous district of Bayou Breaux, Louisiana, wasn't much to look at. The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its once-grand facade now chipped and peeling, the faded paint hinting at a history that had long since dried up. Inside, the office was a chaotic reflection of its occupant: a jumbled mess of overflowing ashtrays, half-empty coffee cups stained with rings of neglect, and stacks of case files threatening to topple from precarious heights. A battered fedora lay discarded on a stained armchair, its brim drooping like a wilting flower. The only concessions to modernity were a rotary phone that seemed to predate the invention of electricity and a perpetually humming electric fan that did little to alleviate the oppressive humidity of the Louisiana bayou. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, damp wood, and the lingering aroma of yesterday's boiled crawfish, courtesy of the establishment downstairs. Sunlight rarely penetrated the grime-coated windows, leaving the room in a perpetual twilight, illuminated only by the harsh glare of a single, buzzing fluorescent light.
