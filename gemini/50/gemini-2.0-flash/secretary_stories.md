## Story Opening:

The clatter of the manual typewriter was a familiar, comforting rhythm in the suffocating silence of 3:17 PM. Rain lashed against the grime-streaked window of the 17th floor, turning the city skyline into a blurry watercolor of grey and yellow. **Priscilla Mae Abernathy**, perpetually perched on the edge of her worn-out office chair, stabbed at the keys with the practiced speed of a seasoned secretary, trying to ignore the persistent gnawing in her stomach and the ache in her lower back.

Sheâ€™d been wrestling with this blasted inventory report for the past hour, deciphering Mr. Henderson's spidery handwriting and translating it into something resembling coherent English. He was a man of brilliant ideas, no doubt, but penmanship clearly hadn't been on the curriculum at Harvard. With a sigh that puffed a stray wisp of brown hair from her neat bun, Priscilla ripped out the page and started again. This time, maybe, she'd get it right. This time, maybe she could finally leave before seven o'clock.

## Setting:

The year is 1957. Priscilla Abernathy works as a secretary at "Henderson & Sons, Importers of Fine Goods," a middling-sized company located in a towering, yet unremarkable, office building in downtown Chicago. The office itself is a cramped and cluttered space, a testament to the company's frugal nature and its reliance on paper-based systems.

Priscilla's workspace, nestled between Mr. Henderson's mahogany-paneled office and the communal coffee pot (a source of both life and despair), is a warren of stacked files, overflowing in-trays, and half-finished documents. The air is thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke, cheap coffee, and the faint, metallic tang of typewriter ink. A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzes overhead, casting a sickly pall over the already drab surroundings. On her desk, a framed photograph of her late mother, a woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile, offers a silent reminder of simpler, sunnier days.
