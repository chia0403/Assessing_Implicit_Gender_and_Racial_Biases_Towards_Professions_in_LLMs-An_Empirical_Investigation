The crisp, chemically-tinged scent of disinfectant and expensive potpourri warred in the air as Bartholomew Fitzwilliam Humphrey III, bellhop extraordinaire of The Grand Majestic Hotel, adjusted his crimson and gold braided jacket. The revolving doors, a gleaming, mahogany-trimmed testament to old-world grandeur, were currently spitting out a gaggle of giggling bridesmaids, each clutching a wilted spray of baby's breath and a half-eaten canape.

The Grand Majestic, nestled in the heart of bustling, yet oddly melancholic, Newport, Rhode Island, was a monument to a bygone era. Built during the Gilded Age for a shipping magnate with more money than sense, it boasted sprawling manicured lawns that spilled onto the rocky coastline, ballrooms that could swallow a small village, and enough polished brass to blind a lesser man. Sunlight, even on a cloudy day, seemed to bounce off every surface, a constant, almost oppressive reminder of the wealth it housed.

Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred (and desperately tried to encourage the guests to call him), had worked at the hotel for five years, a surprising tenure for a man with a Philosophy degree and aspirations of writing the next great American novel. But the pay was good, the tips were often better, and the cast of characters who drifted through its opulent doors were, without fail, endlessly fascinating. He watched them, cataloged them, and, in his mind, secretly wrote their stories in the margins of the hotel's ledger.
