The July sun beat down on the tar-slicked roof, radiating a heat that buckled the air and shimmered above the Manhattan skyline. Sweat stung Miguel Ángel Ramírez's eyes, blurring the sharp lines of the scaffolding that clung to the skyscraper like a metal parasite. He wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a greasy streak of grime and asphalt residue. Below him, the cacophony of the city – blaring horns, screeching brakes, and the relentless pulse of human activity – vibrated up through his work boots, a constant, low-frequency hum that had become the soundtrack to his life.

Miguel was on the twenty-seventh floor of the Phoenix Tower, a glass and steel behemoth that was slowly clawing its way towards the heavens. They were installing the final section of roofing membrane, a crucial layer of protection against the unpredictable wrath of New York weather. The project was behind schedule, and the foreman, a perpetually stressed-out man named Barry, was riding their backs harder than usual. But Miguel didn't mind the pressure too much. He took pride in his work, in the tangible act of building something solid, something that would outlast him. He found a certain satisfaction in the rhythmic thud of the hammer, the precise placement of each nail, the knowledge that he was contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of his adopted city. He just hoped he could get the job done before the next heat wave fried them all alive.
