Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the main character as a veterinarian:

**Opening:**

The wail sliced through the still Alaskan air, a raw, guttural sound that made Dr. Evelyn Reed's blood run cold even after years of hearing it. It wasn't the howl of a sled dog, excited for the morning run. It was a sound of pure, abject terror. Evelyn yanked her Carhartt jacket tighter against the biting wind, the fur-lined hood scratching against her cheek, and grabbed her well-worn medical bag. Please, God, not another one. Not this close to Christmas.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Hope's End, Alaska**, a small, isolated town nestled deep within the Kenai Peninsula. The surrounding landscape is a dramatic tapestry of snow-capped mountains, dense spruce forests, and frozen lakes that stretch as far as the eye can see. Hope's End is accessible only by plane (weather permitting) or a long, treacherous drive on the Sterling Highway, a reality that adds to the town's unique, hardy character.

The clinic, **"North Star Animal Care"**, which Evelyn owns and runs, is a single-story log cabin, its warm, amber windows a beacon against the stark white of the winter landscape. Inside, the air is thick with the comforting smells of disinfectant, dog biscuits, and wood smoke from the pot-bellied stove that struggles valiantly against the sub-zero temperatures. The walls are adorned with a chaotic mix of hand-drawn posters about pet care, faded photographs of past patients, and hand-stitched Alaskan quilts that add a touch of homey warmth to the otherwise clinical space.
