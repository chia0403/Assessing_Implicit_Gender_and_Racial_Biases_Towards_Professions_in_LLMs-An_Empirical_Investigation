The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color bleeding into the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal trees lining the edge of the salt marsh. A biting wind, smelling of brine and decay, rattled the windows of the small, shingled cottage that perched precariously close to the crumbling cliff face. Inside, huddled over a scarred wooden table strewn with tubes of paint and half-finished canvases, sat Penelope Beatrice Thorne, a whirlwind of vibrant chaos in a world of muted grays and browns. Her hair, a thick tangle of copper curls usually escaping her haphazardly tied scarf, was currently plastered to her forehead with sweat. She chewed furiously on the end of a paintbrush, her brow furrowed in fierce concentration.

The setting was Port Lament, a village clinging to the ragged edge of the English coastline, a place where legends clung tighter than the seaweed to the rocks. It was a place of whispers and secrets, a place where the sea held more sway than the land. Penelope had come to Port Lament hoping to find a different kind of muse than the manicured gardens and polite portraits that had populated her previous life in London. She wanted the raw, untamed beauty of the sea, the stark reality of a community shaped by its power, and the haunting solitude that clung to the air like the salty mist. She had found it all in Port Lament, along with a creeping unease that she couldn't quite shake, a feeling that the village held more secrets than she could ever hope to uncover, and that perhaps, some secrets were best left buried beneath the shifting sands.
