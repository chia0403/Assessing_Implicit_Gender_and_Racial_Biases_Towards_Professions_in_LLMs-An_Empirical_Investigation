## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The cramped, galley kitchen of a Boeing 777 hurtling through the night sky somewhere over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The harsh fluorescent lights hum a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the low thrum of the engines and the distant murmur of sleeping passengers. Tiny, perfectly formed condensation beads cling to the stainless steel countertop, reflecting the flickering emergency exit lights.

**Story Opening:**

"Coffee, tea, or a stiff drink to forget I exist?" Genevieve Eleanor Beaumont muttered under her breath, pulling open the overhead compartment with a grunt. The plastic tubs containing the drink options rattled precariously, threatening to avalanche onto her perfectly coiffed blonde hair. Genevieve steadied the container with a sigh, the pungent aroma of instant coffee granules filling the air. She hated the late-night shift on the Sydney to Los Angeles route. Everyone was either asleep, cranky, or pretending not to see you unless they desperately needed something. Tonight, it felt like all three. The flight was only halfway done, and Genevieve already felt like she'd aged a decade. She poured a cup of the revolting brown liquid for herself, adding a generous splash of Bailey's she'd liberated from the first-class stash earlier in the flight. "Necessary," she justified, taking a long, fortifying sip. As she leaned back against the galley wall, the sudden, violent turbulence jolted the plane, sending the lukewarm coffee sloshing over the rim of the cup and onto her pristine navy uniform. Genevieve groaned. Another stain. Another night. Just another reason to consider finally quitting this glamorous, yet soul-crushing, job.
