The flickering fluorescent lights of the K-STAR radio station buzzed a discordant hum, almost mirroring the frantic buzzing in Amelia “Amy” Corvus’s brain. Outside, a relentless rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, turning the already desolate industrial park in rural Willow Creek, Montana, into a watery purgatory. It was 3:17 AM, and the only sound competing with the storm was the distorted crackle emanating from the aging transmitter housed in the back room. 

Amy, a wiry woman with perpetually grease-stained fingers and a tangle of fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed nervously on the end of her pen, the tip leaving a faint blue stain on her lower lip. Her name tag, still clinging stubbornly to the breast pocket of her faded K-STAR t-shirt, read: "Amelia Corvus - Radio Technician." She’d been at K-STAR for five years, practically since its inception, and she'd grown to love the ramshackle station like it was her own unruly child. But lately, that child had been acting up, threatening to throw a tantrum that could silence them all.

The station itself was a relic, a testament to a bygone era of local radio. Located in a converted warehouse on the outskirts of town, it boasted two cramped studios filled with dusty vinyl records and outdated equipment, a small office littered with half-eaten bags of chips and lukewarm coffee, and the crucial, temperamental transmitter room where Amy spent most of her waking (and increasingly, sleeping) hours. 

Tonight, though, the transmitter wasn’t just being temperamental; it was teetering on the brink of complete catastrophic failure. And with the big annual Willow Creek Founders Day parade only two days away, the pressure to get it back online was immense. The town relied on K-STAR for everything: parade announcements, lost dog reports, bake sale fundraisers, and, most importantly, the reassuring voice of DJ Dale in the mornings. If K-STAR went dark, Willow Creek went quiet. And quiet, in a place like Willow Creek, was never a good sign.
