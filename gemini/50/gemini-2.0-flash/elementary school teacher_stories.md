The stale scent of disinfectant and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air of Room 204, amplified by the oppressive humidity that only late August in Richmond, Virginia could produce. Miss Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her sensible brown flats squeaking softly against the linoleum, surveyed her domain. Thirty desks, arranged in neat, hopeful rows, awaited their occupants. A bulletin board screamed for attention, currently adorned with nothing but a faded calendar displaying a picture of smiling sunflowers. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds, painted stripes across the worn rug.

Amelia sighed, a tiny puff of air that ruffled the stray wisps of auburn hair escaping her carefully arranged bun. This was it. Her sixth year teaching third grade at Crestwood Elementary, and already the weight of expectations - her own, the parents', the principal's - felt like a lead apron draped across her shoulders. She adjusted her floral-print dress, a nervous habit, and whispered, “Alright, Amelia. Deep breath. Time to make some magic.”
