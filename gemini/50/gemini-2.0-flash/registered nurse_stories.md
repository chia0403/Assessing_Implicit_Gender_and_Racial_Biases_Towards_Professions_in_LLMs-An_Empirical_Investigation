Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a registered nurse named Eleanor Margaret Hayes:

**Setting:** The soft, incessant beeping of machines was the soundtrack to Eleanor’s life, a constant, low thrum that both irritated and reassured her. It was 3:17 AM in the Intensive Care Unit of St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital, a sprawling brick complex on the outskirts of Providence, Rhode Island. The dim fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the pristine white linoleum floor. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the old windows and promising a bitter February storm. Inside, the air was thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic and fear.

**Opening:** Eleanor Margaret Hayes, RN, meticulously adjusted the drip rate on Mrs. Henderson’s IV. Each drop was a tiny victory, a defiant tick against the relentless march of time. Mrs. Henderson, a wisp of a woman whose lungs had finally surrendered to years of chain-smoking, lay frail and still in the bed. Her face, illuminated by the pale glow of the monitor, was a roadmap of worry lines etched deep by life. Eleanor gently smoothed a stray strand of silver hair from Mrs. Henderson’s forehead. “Just resting now, sweetheart,” she whispered, more for herself than her patient. Sleep was a luxury Eleanor hadn't indulged in much lately. Her own exhaustion mirrored the fatigue in the room, a weariness that clung to the sterile air like a persistent cough. Tonight, though, something felt different. An unsettling unease prickled at the back of her neck, a premonition that whispered on the wind and danced in the shadows. It wasn’t just the usual ICU jitters. This was something more… something was coming.
