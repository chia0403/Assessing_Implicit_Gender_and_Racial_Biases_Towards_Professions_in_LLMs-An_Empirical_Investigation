## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt sugar and peroxide hung heavy in the air, a familiar and strangely comforting aroma to Seraphina Mae Lancaster. Steam, perpetually rising from the industrial-sized hair steamer in the corner, painted the window of "Seraphina's Snippery" with a hazy film. Outside, the relentless drizzle of a typical November afternoon in Port Blossom, Oregon, hammered against the glass, reflecting the neon glow of the open sign back into the small salon. Seraphina, perched on a creaky swivel chair, surveyed her domain. It wasn’t much – just three mismatched styling stations, a cramped waiting area overflowing with tattered magazines, and a chipped ceramic sink that occasionally spouted rusty water. But it was hers. Every stain, every stray hair clinging to the linoleum floor, was a testament to her hard work and a reminder of the vibrant, sometimes chaotic, lives that passed through its doors. 

## Setting:

**Port Blossom, Oregon** is a small, coastal town nestled between towering pine forests and the turbulent Pacific Ocean. The economy is heavily reliant on fishing and tourism, creating a unique blend of rugged, blue-collar workers and wealthy vacationers. The town's charm lies in its weathered buildings, quirky shops, and the salty tang of the sea air. Main Street is a hodgepodge of vintage boutiques, seafood restaurants, and dive bars, all clinging to the edge of a dramatic cliff overlooking the harbor. The weather is notoriously unpredictable, with long stretches of rain, fog, and wind, punctuated by fleeting moments of breathtaking sunshine. "Seraphina's Snippery" is located on a quieter side street, slightly removed from the hustle and bustle, in a building that has seen better days. Despite its slightly rundown appearance, the salon is a beloved fixture in the community, known for its friendly atmosphere and Seraphina's uncanny ability to transform even the most unruly hair into a work of art.
