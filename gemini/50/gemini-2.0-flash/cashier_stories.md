## Story Opening:

The incessant beeping of the scanner was the soundtrack to Amelia Pearl Cartwrightâ€™s Tuesday. Each *beep* a tiny, shrill exclamation point punctuating the monotonous drone of her existence. She scanned a bag of gummy bears, the sickly sweet scent momentarily cutting through the general aroma of processed food and cleaning products that permeated the fluorescent-lit air of SuperSaver Mart. Amelia plastered a perfunctory smile on her face, ready with the practiced "Did you find everything okay today?" even before the customer had properly unloaded their cart. Today, however, the woman barely made eye contact, muttering a gruff "Yep" before shoving a crumpled twenty dollar bill across the counter.

Amelia sighed internally. Tuesday was always like this - a purgatory between the manic energy of Monday and the hopeful promise of Wednesday, closer to the weekend. At least she only had three more hours until her shift ended. Three more hours of beeping, bagging, and battling the creeping existential dread that gnawed at the edges of her mind, whispering questions about unfulfilled dreams and the crushing weight of a minimum wage life.

## Setting:

Amelia works at **SuperSaver Mart**, a discount grocery store located in the small, rust-belt town of Havenwood, Ohio. The store itself is a sprawling, one-story building, its faded blue paint peeling in places and the parking lot cracked and riddled with potholes. Inside, the lighting is harsh and unforgiving, illuminating aisles packed with generic brand cereals, dented cans of soup, and oversized bags of potato chips. The air is thick with a mix of artificial scents - the floral overload of the cleaning aisle, the cloying sweetness of the bakery section, and the faint, lingering smell of old fish from the seafood counter.

Amelia's checkout lane, number 4, is located near the front of the store, offering a view of the perpetually revolving door and the constant stream of customers shuffling in and out. It's a small, cramped space, barely enough room for her to turn around in, and the plastic bagging carousel often jams, adding another layer of frustration to her day. The walls around her are plastered with faded posters advertising discounts and special offers, a constant reminder of the cheapness and desperation that defines life in Havenwood. Outside the large windows, she can occasionally glimpse the grey, overcast skies and the skeletal remains of the once-thriving steel mill that used to be the town's lifeblood, now a rusting monument to a forgotten past.
