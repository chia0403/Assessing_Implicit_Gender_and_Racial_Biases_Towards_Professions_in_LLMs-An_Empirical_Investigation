## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** Northwood High, a brick behemoth built in the 1970s on the outskirts of Harmony, Ohio. Harmony, as the name suggested, thrived on a carefully cultivated image of small-town perfection. But behind the neatly trimmed lawns and friendly waves, a subtle, unspoken tension simmered, like a forgotten kettle on the stove. Northwood High reflected this duality: gleaming trophy cases showcasing state championships lined hallways where flickering fluorescent lights buzzed out of sync, reflecting in the weary eyes of its staff and students alike.

**Opening:**

The aroma of burnt popcorn assaulted Ms. Penelope Adelaide Plum's nostrils as she unlocked the door to her office, Room 207. It clung to the air like a persistent regret, a reminder of the sophomore who'd tried to microwave a bag for fifteen minutes straight last week, convinced it would "make it extra fluffy." Penelope sighed. Sheâ€™d almost managed to forget the incident in the blissful, if brief, silence of her drive home. 

She flipped on the desk lamp, its warm glow doing little to dispel the institutional chill that permeated the room. Piles of college applications teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to avalanche at the slightest tremor. A poster of a kitten clinging precariously to a branch with the caption "Hang in there!" drooped slightly, a testament to its own long and arduous journey. Penelope smoothed down her sensible cardigan, the one with the embroidered pencils, and surveyed the scene. Another day at Northwood High. Another day of navigating the anxieties, the aspirations, and the sometimes-explosive realities of teenage life. And, hopefully, preventing any further culinary experimentation with microwaved popcorn.
