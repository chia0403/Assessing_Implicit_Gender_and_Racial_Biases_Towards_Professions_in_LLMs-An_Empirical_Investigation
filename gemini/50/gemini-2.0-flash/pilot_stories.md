## Story Opening:

The biting wind howled through the fractured canopy glass of the downed Stinson Reliant, a mournful song that mirrored Amelia Rose Thorne's own. Snow, fine and relentless as ground glass, swirled around her, blurring the already indistinct horizon. Each gust buffeted the crumpled fuselage, a disquieting reminder of the bone-jarring landing only hours before. The engine, once a throbbing symphony of power, now lay silent and cold, a mangled testament to the treacherous mountain pass that had dared to challenge her. Amelia shivered, the thin fleece lining of her flight jacket offering little solace against the arctic grip of the Alaskan wilderness. She pulled her scarf tighter around her face, her breath misting in the frigid air, and scanned the desolate landscape. Just endless white, broken only by the skeletal fingers of snow-laden pines.

## Setting:

The story opens in the unforgiving, early winter Alaskan wilderness, specifically in the foothills of the Alaska Range, roughly fifty miles north of the Denali National Park border. The area is characterized by jagged, snow-covered peaks, dense coniferous forests stubbornly clinging to the lower slopes, and a vast, seemingly endless expanse of frozen tundra. The landscape is inherently dangerous, prone to unpredictable weather patterns, including sudden blizzards and whiteout conditions. The terrain is unforgiving, making traversal on foot treacherous and demanding exceptional navigation skills. The nearest human settlement is a remote Athabascan village, approximately seventy miles southeast, a lifeline that feels impossibly distant in Amelia's current predicament. The time period is 1937.
