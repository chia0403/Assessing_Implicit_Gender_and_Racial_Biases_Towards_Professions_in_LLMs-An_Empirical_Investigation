Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a trucker named Jebediah Ulysses “Jeb” McKinley:

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The rain hammered against the chrome grill of Jebediah Ulysses “Jeb” McKinley’s Peterbilt, a relentless, drumming rhythm that vibrated through the cab and into his bones.  Visibility was maybe fifty feet, the taillights of the semi ahead dissolving into a hazy, crimson blur.  He squinted, his calloused hand tightening on the wheel, the leather worn smooth by years of constant grip. "Just great," he muttered, the words lost in the roar of the engine and the wind.  "Gotta love a Georgia squall in the middle of a chili cook-off weekend."

Jeb was hauling a load of Georgia peaches – ironically, intended for a chili cook-off in Austin, Texas – and he was running late.  He’d been on the road for sixteen hours straight, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the burning desire to see his daughter, Lily, before she started kindergarten next week. Every mile added to his fatigue, the familiar aches and pains of a life on the road intensifying with the downpour.

**Setting:**

The setting is a rain-lashed stretch of Interstate 20, somewhere just west of Atlanta, Georgia.  The highway is mostly deserted, save for a few other brave (or foolish) truckers and the occasional passenger vehicle hugging the shoulder.  The surrounding landscape is a blur of dark green pines and dripping kudzu, barely visible through the sheets of rain. The neon signs of truck stops and dilapidated motels flicker and fade in the distance, promising warmth and temporary respite, but Jeb's intent on pressing forward. He can't afford to lose any more time. The radio crackles with static and the occasional weather report, painting an increasingly grim picture of the storm’s intensity.  The air inside the cab is thick with the scent of diesel and old leather, a smell that is both comforting and suffocating to Jeb, a constant reminder of his chosen profession and the sacrifices it demands.
