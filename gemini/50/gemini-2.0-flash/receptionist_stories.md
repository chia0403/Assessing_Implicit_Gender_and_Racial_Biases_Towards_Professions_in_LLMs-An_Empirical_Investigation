**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne had grown so accustomed to, it registered more as a constant pressure behind her eyes than an actual noise. Beatrice tapped a lacquered fingernail against the glossy surface of the reception desk, the sound a sharp contrast to the muted beige of the walls. She watched, with a kind of detached amusement, as a particularly tenacious dust bunny wrestled its way across the expanse of the polished floor, propelled by the draft from the constantly revolving doors. It was 2:17 PM, a time that stretched like warm taffy, sweet but ultimately unsatisfying. Another hour and forty-three minutes until she could trade this polite, sterile purgatory for the noisy, vibrant chaos of her tiny apartment.

**Setting:**

Beatrice Hawthorne worked as the receptionist for "Global Synergy Solutions," a mid-level consulting firm located on the 27th floor of the sleek, modern Zenith Tower in downtown Chicago. The lobby, while undeniably impressive, lacked any real personality. Gleaming chrome accents and abstract art adorned the walls, attempting to convey an air of forward-thinking innovation. However, the overall effect was more corporate than creative, more "we want your business" than "we're glad you're here." The air was always meticulously climate-controlled, smelling faintly of lemon-scented cleaner and quiet ambition. From her desk, Beatrice had a panoramic view of Lake Michigan, a shimmering expanse of blue that offered a momentary escape from the relentless churn of city life, though even the lake seemed subdued under the overcast Chicago sky. The desk itself was a fortress of organization, meticulously arranged with a landline phone that chirped with relentless efficiency, a sleek computer monitor displaying a rotating screensaver of inspirational quotes, and a small, carefully curated collection of personal items: a framed photo of her rambunctious tabby cat, Marmalade, and a small, polished stone sheâ€™d picked up during a rare vacation to the Oregon coast. These little touches were her attempt to inject a sliver of humanity into the otherwise impersonal landscape.
