Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a logger character:

**Story Opening:**

The chainsaw screamed, a high-pitched, ear-splitting whine that vibrated through Jedediah "Jed" Booneâ€™s bones. He braced his legs against the rain-slicked slope, the old-growth Douglas Fir looming before him like a moss-covered giant. The smell of sawdust, pine needles, and damp earth filled his lungs, a familiar perfume that had clung to him since he was a boy clinging to his father's pant leg in this very forest. Jed tightened his grip on the saw, his calloused hands, roughened from years of wrestling timber, barely registering the sting of the cold rain. Today, the tree felt different. Not wrong, exactly, but...hesitant. Jed shook his head, dismissing the thought as superstition. Trees were trees. He had quotas to meet, a family to feed, and a legacy to uphold. He raised the roaring blade again, ready to bite into the ancient wood.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the densely forested region of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, circa 1998. Specifically, the opening takes place deep within a privately owned tract of land that borders the Olympic National Forest. The terrain is steep and rugged, characterized by towering conifers like Douglas Fir, Western Hemlock, and Sitka Spruce. The undergrowth is thick with ferns, salal, and huckleberry bushes. The weather is perpetually damp, with frequent rain and fog rolling in off the Pacific Ocean.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Jedediah "Jed" Boone
