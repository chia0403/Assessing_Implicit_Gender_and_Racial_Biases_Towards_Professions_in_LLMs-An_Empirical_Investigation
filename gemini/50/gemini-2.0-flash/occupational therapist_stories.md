The midday sun beat down on the sprawling, pastel-colored houses of Meadowbrook Retirement Village, turning the air thick and heavy with the scent of blooming honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Eleanor Grace Albright, a bead of sweat trickling down her temple beneath her sensible brown bob, adjusted the strap of her over-the-shoulder therapy bag and sighed. Another afternoon, another round of bingo-induced wrist strains and shuffleboard-related backaches.

Eleanor loved her job at Meadowbrook, even with the predictability of its aches and pains. She found genuine satisfaction in helping her residents regain a sliver of independence, a moment of joy amidst the encroaching shadows of age. But today, a feeling of unease prickled at the back of her neck. Perhaps it was the oppressive heat, or maybe the way Mrs. Higgins had looked at her this morning during their shoulder stretches, her eyes filled with a knowing, almost unsettling, glint. Whatever it was, Meadowbrook felt different today, like a stage set for something other than the usual gentle rhythm of geriatric life.
