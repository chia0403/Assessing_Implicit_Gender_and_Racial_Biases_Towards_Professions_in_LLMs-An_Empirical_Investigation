The aroma of simmering cardamom and toasted coconut clung to the air, a thick, comforting blanket against the biting November wind that rattled the windows of The Spice Merchant. Amelia Rose Dubois, head chef and owner of the tiny but fiercely popular Indian restaurant in the heart of Cedar Creek, Vermont, breathed deeply, savoring the moment of relative calm.

Cedar Creek itself was a postcard-perfect New England town, all snow-dusted rooftops, twinkling fairy lights strung across Main Street, and a palpable sense of small-town charm that Amelia usually adored. Tonight, however, the charm felt cloying, the sweetness suffocating. She stirred the simmering daal, the creamy lentils a vibrant yellow against the tarnished copper of the pot, her movements sharp and efficient, a stark contrast to the languid pace of life outside.

The Spice Merchant was tucked away on a side street, a converted Victorian house with mismatched furniture and walls painted a vibrant peacock blue. The mismatched charm was intentional, a reflection of Amelia's own eclectic spirit, and a deliberate attempt to transport diners from the crisp Vermont air to the vibrant, bustling spice markets of India. Tonight, though, the peacock blue seemed to amplify the shadows in the corners of the room, making the flickering candlelight dance with a nervous energy.

Tonight was the night of the Cedar Creek Holiday Bazaar, an event Amelia normally relished. But this year, the festive air felt less like celebration and more like a countdown clock. A countdown to what, she wasn't entirely sure, but the gnawing unease in her stomach felt as heavy as the mortar she used to grind her spices.
