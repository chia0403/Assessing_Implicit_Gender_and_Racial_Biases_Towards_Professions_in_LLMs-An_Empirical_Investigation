## The Setting:

The air hung thick and humid in the waiting room of "Revive & Thrive Physical Therapy," a small, independent clinic nestled in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. Sunlight, filtered through the Spanish moss-draped oaks outside, cast dappled patterns on the aged hardwood floors. The walls, painted a soothing coastal blue, were adorned with prints of local wildlife: egrets wading in the marsh, dolphins arcing over the waves. The rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock in the corner competed with the soft murmur of a water fountain trickling over smooth river stones. The scent of eucalyptus and lemongrass essential oils, meant to promote relaxation, mingled with the faint aroma of disinfectant, a constant reminder of the clinic's purpose.
## The Opening:

**Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Maeve Harrington** adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, the cool metal a momentary relief against the late-July heat radiating from her skin. She leaned back in her worn leather office chair, its springs groaning a gentle protest, and sighed. The clock chimed eleven, announcing the arrival of her next patient, and with it, the renewed need for unwavering optimism and gentle encouragement. Today's challenge? Mrs. Gable, a woman who had, just last week, declared her hip replacement a "divine punishment for enjoying life too much." Ellie steeled herself. Time to unravel the knot of pain, fear, and stubbornness that had taken root in Mrs. Gable's hipâ€¦ and, hopefully, in her spirit.
