The humid air hung heavy in the doorway of "Salvatore's Shear Excellence," clinging to anyone foolish enough to linger there for even a moment. Salvatore "Sal" Antonio Esposito, his brow perpetually furrowed, wiped the condensation from his thick, calloused hands on the well-worn apron tied around his generous belly. The bell above the door, a tinny thing salvaged from a defunct ice cream cart, jingled weakly as a lone mosquito buzzed in, drawn by the sweet scent of bay rum and memories of better days.

Salvatore’s shop sat stubbornly on the corner of Bleecker and Carmine in the heart of Greenwich Village, a relic from a time when the neighborhood was less polished, less curated, and more…real. The year was 1978. Disco thumped from open windows further down the street, a soundtrack to a city on the brink. Inside, however, Sal’s world was frozen somewhere closer to 1958. The walls were lined with faded black and white photos of legendary ballplayers and Italian tenors, their faces etched with the same hard-won dignity Sal saw reflected back at him in the tarnished mirror above his two antique barber chairs. The chairs, relics from his grandfather's shop in Sicily, were heavy, gleaming with chrome and worn leather, monuments to generations of perfectly executed fades and close shaves. Even the air in Salvatore’s Shear Excellence smelled different, a blend of old-world barber tonics, pipe tobacco (long since outlawed by the city health department), and the faint, lingering aroma of his nonna’s Sunday sauce, which he still swore by as the best damn hair tonic this side of the Atlantic. Today, however, even the familiar comfort of his shop felt different. A disquiet lingered, a knot in Sal’s stomach that had nothing to do with too much espresso and everything to do with the changing city just beyond his doorway.
