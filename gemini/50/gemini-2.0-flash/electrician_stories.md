The buzzing of the fluorescent lights above mirrored the frantic energy swirling within Michael Thomas Riley. He hadn't slept properly in forty-eight hours, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the simmering pressure of a deadline that loomed like a thunderstorm on the horizon. He ran a gloved hand through his already dishevelled brown hair, leaving a faint smear of grease across his forehead.

The setting was the bowels of the abandoned St. Jude's Hospital, a behemoth of crumbling brick and echoing corridors. Decades ago, it had been a beacon of hope and healing, now it was a husk, a forgotten relic slated for demolition. Dust motes danced in the weak beams of his headlamp, illuminating peeling paint, rusted medical equipment left behind in the hasty evacuation, and the skeletal remains of wiring systems that were older than he was. Michael was here, under contract with a shadowy development company, to assess the electrical infrastructure – the bones and sinews of the building – before the wrecking ball arrived.

The air was thick with the musty scent of decay and the faint, metallic tang of blood - a phantom smell clinging to the very walls. Above, the wind howled through shattered windows, a mournful symphony accompanying his work. He was currently in what he believed was the old surgical wing, a section particularly ravaged by time and neglect. The silence, broken only by the creaks and groans of the building settling, was oppressive, heavy with untold stories and the lingering ghosts of a life that had once pulsed within these very walls. He swallowed hard, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach. He'd worked in some dodgy places before, but St. Jude's… St. Jude's felt different. It felt *wrong*.
