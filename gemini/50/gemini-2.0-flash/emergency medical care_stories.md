Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and a main character who is a emergency medical care provider:

**Setting:** The stifling, humid air hung thick over New Orleans, Louisiana, clinging to the wrought-iron balconies and seeping into the ancient brickwork of the French Quarter. It was mid-July, deep into hurricane season, and the oppressive weather served as a constant, simmering threat. The city, normally vibrant and overflowing with tourists, felt subdued, watchful. A low, persistent buzz of cicadas filled the air, a sound that always seemed to precede trouble.

**Story Opening:**

The blare of the dispatch radio cut through the oppressive silence of the ambulance like a shard of glass. Isabelle Marie Dubois gripped the steering wheel a little tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Rain was starting to fall, fat, lazy drops that splattered on the windshield, blurring the already chaotic view of Bourbon Street.

"Medic One, Medic One, respond to a possible assault. 718 Burgundy Street. Suspect at large. Proceed with caution."

Isabelle exhaled slowly, trying to quell the familiar surge of adrenaline. Assaults in the Quarter were a dime a dozen, especially on a Friday night. But every call was a potential life or death situation, and she had learned, over the course of her ten years as a paramedic, never to underestimate the unpredictable nature of her city.

"Copy that, Dispatch," she replied, her voice steady and professional, masking the knot of apprehension twisting in her gut. "Medic One en route."

Beside her, her partner, a young, fresh-faced EMT named Marcus Jones, adjusted his headset. "Burgundy Street? That's practically on the edge of Treme. Things get dicey over there, Isabelle."

"Tell me something I don't know, Marcus," Isabelle muttered, flicking on the siren. The piercing wail echoed through the narrow streets, momentarily silencing the cicadas and adding another layer of urgency to the humid night. Isabelle Marie Dubois, a veteran paramedic in the heart of New Orleans, prepared to face whatever waited for her in the darkness.
