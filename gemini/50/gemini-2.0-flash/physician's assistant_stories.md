Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a physician's assistant named Evelyn Rose Hayes:

**Setting:** The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of brine and exhaust fumes. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late July in Beaufort, South Carolina, a coastal town where the antebellum mansions still whispered stories of generations past, and the air vibrated with the rhythm of cicadas. The setting sun cast long shadows across the water, painting the shrimp boats docked at the marina in hues of fiery orange and deep violet. The lowcountry sun was a cruel beast, however, particularly in a non-air conditioned mobile medical clinic like the one Evelyn Rose Hayes found herself in. 

**Opening:**

The metal door creaked open, letting in a blast of humid air and a harried-looking woman clutching a small child. Evelyn Rose Hayes, her dark hair escaping its messy bun in rebellious tendrils, plastered on her most reassuring smile. "Come on in," she said, her voice raspy from talking to a dozen patients already today. "And welcome to our little slice of paradise… or, at least, the closest thing to it with working AC these days." She gestured towards one of the two chairs available to patients, already sweating through her scrub top. "What can I do for you and…?"

The woman, her face etched with worry, shifted the child in her arms. "This is little Maya. I think she's got something nasty. A fever, and she’s been complaining about her ears for days. I usually go to the ER, but...well..." She trailed off, glancing around the cramped clinic. "My insurance lapsed. I saw the sign for this clinic on the way to work."

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly. She understood "well" all too well. Beaufort was postcard-perfect on the surface, but underneath lay a struggling community with limited access to healthcare. "Alright, Maya," Evelyn said, focusing her attention on the child. "Let's take a look, shall we? You're safe here, okay?"

The woman nodded, her eyes filled with a mixture of relief and apprehension. As Evelyn reached for her stethoscope, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be one of *those* days. The kind where the humidity wasn't the only thing making her feel suffocated.
