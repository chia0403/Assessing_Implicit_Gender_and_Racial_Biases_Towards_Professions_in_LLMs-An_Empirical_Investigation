Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Beatrice Emilia Rossi:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Regional Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune that Beatrice Emilia Rossi had grown intimately familiar with over the past five years. It was a sterile, almost antiseptic melody, underscored by the beeping of heart monitors and the muffled announcements crackling over the intercom. The phlebotomy lab, tucked away on the second floor between Oncology and Radiology, felt like a temporary stopover in the grand, chaotic symphony of the hospital. It was small, meticulously organized with rows of multicolored vacutainers arranged by draw order, tourniquets hanging neatly on hooks, and stacks of patient requisition forms vying for space on the counter. A faded poster of the circulatory system, once vibrant, now dulled with time, hung crookedly above the blood-draw chairs. The air, despite the overworked air purifier, always carried a faint whiff of alcohol wipes and lingering anxiety.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Emilia Rossi, or Bea as almost everyone at St. Jude's called her, stared intently at the vein bulging invitingly on the inside of Mr. Henderson’s elbow. He was a regular, a sweet, elderly man with thinning silver hair and a perpetual air of nervous anticipation. He’d arrived precisely at 7:00 AM for his weekly blood work, as punctual as the hospital clock tower.

"Good morning, Mr. Henderson," Bea said, her voice warm and reassuring. "Ready for your royal flush?" She always used the same tired joke, a feeble attempt to lighten the mood, and he always chuckled politely, his wrinkled face softening.

But today, his usual chuckle was absent. His hand, normally steady, trembled slightly in hers. Bea paused, her trained eyes instantly picking up the subtle shift in his demeanor. He’d lost a little weight, and his color was ashen. Something wasn’t right. “Are you feeling alright this morning, Mr. Henderson?” she asked, her brow furrowed with concern.

He hesitated, then cleared his throat. "Well, Beatrice, I, uh... I got some news yesterday." He looked away, his gaze drifting towards the faded circulatory system poster. "Not exactly the best news, I'm afraid."
