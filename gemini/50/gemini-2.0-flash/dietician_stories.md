**Opening:**

The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights in the waiting room seemed to vibrate directly into Dr. Eleanor Vance's skull. She pinched the bridge of her nose, a familiar ache building behind her eyes. Outside, the Seattle rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Westlake Wellness Clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing in her stomach. Another cancellation. Mrs. Abernathy, who was finally making progress with portion control, had called this morning claiming her poodle had eaten her scale. Eleanor stifled a sigh. Sometimes, being a registered dietitian felt less like helping people and more like wading through a swamp of excuses, bad habits, and bewildered desperation.

**Setting:**

The Westlake Wellness Clinic occupied the entire 17th floor of a modern glass tower overlooking Puget Sound. From Eleanor's small, meticulously organized office, you could glimpse the Space Needle on a clear day, a futuristic beacon amidst the grey cityscape. The clinic itself was designed with an understated, calming aesthetic. Pale wood paneling, muted earth tones, and strategically placed succulents created an atmosphere of serene professionalism. The waiting room was dominated by comfortable, overstuffed chairs upholstered in a calming shade of sage green. Instead of dog-eared magazines filled with celebrity gossip, patients could browse carefully curated books on mindfulness, healthy recipes, and the benefits of aromatherapy. Everything, down to the subtle scent of lavender diffused in the air, was designed to promote a sense of well-being. However, Eleanor knew that behind the polished facade, the struggles of her patients were anything but serene. They were messy, complicated, and deeply personal.
