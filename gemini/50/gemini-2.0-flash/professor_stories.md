The sharp tang of ozone hung in the air, a by-product of the malfunctioning Tesla coil hummed into existence again, momentarily drowning out the gentle tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. Professor Alistair Humphrey Caldwell, Doctor of Theoretical Physics and part-time champion of lost causes, adjusted his spectacles, peering through the flickering light at the device. He’d spent the last three weeks coaxing the antiquated contraption back to life, fueled by copious amounts of Earl Grey tea and a nagging hunch that it held the key to something… important.

The setting was his cluttered study in Caldwell Manor, a sprawling, gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, England. Bookshelves, overflowing with leather-bound tomes and precarious stacks of scientific journals, lined the walls. Half-finished experiments sat scattered across mahogany desks – a dismantled chronometer, a collection of strangely humming crystals, a blueprint for a machine that looked suspiciously like a miniature anti-gravity device. The room was a chaotic testament to a brilliant, and often eccentric, mind, a space where the past and the potential future collided in a glorious, dusty mess. Outside, the relentless roar of the Atlantic Ocean served as a constant reminder of the power and mystery that lay just beyond the manor's ancient stone walls.
