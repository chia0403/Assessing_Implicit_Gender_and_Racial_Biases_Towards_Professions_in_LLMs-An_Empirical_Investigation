The biting wind whipped at Constable Alistair Reginald Finch's face, stinging his cheeks redder than the late-setting sun struggling to pierce the perpetual twilight that clung to the Iron Mountains. He pulled his thick, woolen greatcoat tighter, the familiar weight offering little comfort against the oppressive chill. He stamped his numb feet against the frosted stone of the North Gate, a pointless exercise that did little to restore feeling. The air, thick with the scent of pine and the distant, metallic tang of iron ore, held the promise of another long, miserable night on watch.

The setting was Oakhaven, a walled city nestled precariously at the foot of the Iron Mountains. It was a city built on iron, its very foundations carved from the grey stone, its wealth forged in the fiery depths of the mines that honeycombed the mountainside. The North Gate, Alistair’s post for this rotation, was a formidable structure, a testament to Oakhaven’s centuries of independence and its constant vigilance against the dangers lurking in the wild, unforgiving lands beyond. Two massive, iron-banded oak doors, each thick as a man was tall, stood between the city and the unknown terrors that roamed the whispering forests and shadowed peaks. Tonight, the unknown felt particularly close, the silence broken only by the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional, unsettling creak of the ancient gate itself.
