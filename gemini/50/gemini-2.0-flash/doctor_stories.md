Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a doctor character:

**Setting:**

The year is 2242. Neo-Tokyo glitters and hums with a frenetic energy that never sleeps. Towering chrome skyscrapers pierce the perpetually overcast sky, interconnected by shimmering skywalks buzzing with automated transport pods and the occasional daredevil hoverbike. Below, the neon-drenched streets teem with a chaotic mix of humanity, augmented cyborgs, and genetically modified pets. The air smells of synthetic ramen, ozone, and a faint, metallic tang from the omnipresent surveillance drones. Rain is a constant companion, sometimes a gentle mist, sometimes a torrential downpour acid enough to strip the paint off poorly maintained buildings. Below the gleaming surface, however, lies a network of dilapidated undercities, clinging to life in the shadows of progress. These warrens are home to the poor, the forgotten, and the victims of Neo-Tokyo’s ruthless technological advancement.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Aris Thorne woke to the insistent chirp of his med-console, a sound that always sliced through his sleep-deprived brain like a scalpel. The flickering holographic display cast a sickly green glow across his cramped apartment, illuminating the sterile white walls and the scattered datapads piled high on his rickety table. He groaned, scrubbing a hand across his tired eyes. It was always something. In the lower levels of Neo-Tokyo, where Aris ran his ramshackle clinic, medical emergencies didn't adhere to a polite schedule.

"Thorne here," he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.

"Doctor, we need you. Fast," the voice crackled back, distorted by static. It was Kai, one of his few reliable volunteers. "Down at the Sprawl. Possible Neural Rot outbreak. Kids are going down hard."

Aris’s stomach clenched. Neural Rot. A terrifying, rapidly progressing neurological disease that had been tearing through the undercities for months. The mega-corporations dismissed it as a byproduct of poverty and dismissed the poor who suffered from it. Aris knew better. It was a deliberate weapon, he was sure of it.

He swung his legs off the narrow cot and reached for his worn leather jacket, the familiar weight comforting in the pre-dawn darkness. "I'm on my way," he said, already formulating a plan, a desperate prayer for the strength to fight another losing battle. In the neon-drenched abyss of Neo-Tokyo's underbelly, Dr. Aris Thorne was all that stood between his patients and oblivion.
