## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The rambling, gothic-revival estate of Blackwood Manor sat perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Sea. Salt-laced wind perpetually whipped around its gargoyle-laden battlements, carrying with it the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls. The sprawling gardens, though meticulously maintained, held a certain wildness to them, a testament to the unforgiving coastal climate and the ancient history that seemed to seep from the very stones of the place. Towering hedges formed labyrinthine pathways, leading to hidden grottos overgrown with moss and lichen. Roses, their petals bruised by the wind, clung fiercely to trellises that groaned under the weight of their blooms. Blackwood Manor was a place of stark beauty and lingering shadows, a place where whispers of the past seemed to ride on the wind.

**Opening:**

The morning mist clung to the ground like a shroud as Bartholomew Finch, his gnarled hands already stained with earth, surveyed the rose garden. A sigh, thick with the damp air, escaped his lips. The recent storm had been particularly brutal, tearing through the carefully pruned bushes and scattering petals like crimson confetti. Bartholomew Finch, Head Groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past twenty-seven years, felt a pang of something akin to grief. These roses, descendants of the original cuttings planted by the eccentric Lady Blackwood herself, were more than just flowers; they were living history, silent witnesses to the generations of joy and sorrow that had played out within the manorâ€™s walls. He adjusted the worn tweed cap on his head and stooped to examine a broken stem. It would be a long day, but Bartholomew was nothing if not patient. He would coax these damaged beauties back to health, one petal, one thorn at a time. The garden, and indeed the whole of Blackwood Manor, was his responsibility, his burden, and perhaps, even his salvation. He just hoped that the growing unease he felt, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the damp air, was just the wind playing tricks on him. Because Blackwood Manor, Bartholomew knew, had secrets. And some secrets, once unearthed, were best left buried.
