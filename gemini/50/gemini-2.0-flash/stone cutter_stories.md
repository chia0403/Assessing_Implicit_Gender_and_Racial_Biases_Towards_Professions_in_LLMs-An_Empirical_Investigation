The biting wind, sharp as chipped flint, clawed at Elias Thorne's calloused hands as he squinted up at the craggy face of Mount Cinder. Smoke, thick and black, billowed from its perpetually smoldering peak, casting a perpetual twilight over the desolate landscape. Elias, a man carved from the same granite as his trade, stood braced against the gale, his thick, woolen tunic offering little comfort against the relentless chill. His beard, a tangled mass of gray and brown, danced wildly in the wind, mirroring the frantic movements of the blackbirds that wheeled overhead, their cries harsh and lonely echoes in the vast emptiness.

This was the Craglands, a unforgiving territory of barren rock and volcanic ash, a place where only the toughest souls survived. And Elias Thorne, stone cutter extraordinaire, was one of the toughest. For generations, his family had carved their livelihood from this unforgiving landscape, chiseling gravestones, building foundations, and shaping monuments that honored the dead and defied the elements. He knew every vein and fault line in the mountain's face, every whisper of its shifting moods. And today, the mountain was angry.

The village of Ash Hollow, huddled at the foot of Mount Cinder, was a scattering of low, squat buildings built from the same dark volcanic stone Elias mined. Its inhabitants, hardened by hardship and bound by a shared dependence on the mountain, lived a life of quiet desperation. The only color in the village came from the stubborn wildflowers that dared to sprout between the cracks in the stone, defiant splashes of beauty in a land of gray. Elias, his workshop located on the outskirts of the village, overlooking the treacherous valley that led to the Smolder River, was their primary, if not only, link to the outside world. He traded his crafted goods for supplies, for tools, for the rare luxuries that made life in Ash Hollow just a little more bearable. But lately, the mountain had been giving him little to trade. The stone was brittle, cracked, almost unusable. And a sense of unease, thicker than the volcanic smoke, hung heavy in the air. He knew something was coming. He could feel it in the mountain's restless tremors, in the desperate cries of the blackbirds, and in the aching joints of his own weathered bones. He just didn't know what.
