The scent of old cedar and dust motes dancing in the morning light filled Eleanor Vance's nostrils as she unlocked the door to her firm, Vance & Adler Architects. Outside, Boston was just beginning to stir, the rumble of the Green Line trolley echoing through the narrow cobblestone street. But inside, the office was her sanctuary, a refuge from the relentless clamor of the city and the even more relentless demands of her clients. The room, a converted loft above a century-old bakery, still held the faint sweetness of sourdough in its bones. High ceilings, exposed brick, and a wall of windows overlooking the Public Garden gave the space an airy, almost ethereal quality. Eleanor loved this place. It was a visual representation of her design philosophy: respecting the past while embracing the future.
