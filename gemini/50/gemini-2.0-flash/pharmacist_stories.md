## Story Opening:

The scent of crushed chamomile and rubbing alcohol hung in the air, a familiar, comforting miasma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. Elias, leaning heavily on the worn oak counter of Thorne's Apothecary, sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. It was nearing closing time on a blustery Tuesday in late October, and the last customer, Mrs. Gable with her perennial sniffles, had finally shuffled out, clutching a bottle of his special elderflower cough syrup.

He watched her hunched figure disappear down the cobbled street, the gas lamps sputtering and casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the quiet desperation gnawing at him. His gaze drifted to the shelf behind the counter, lined with meticulously labeled glass bottles filled with powders and tinctures, each a promise of healing, a silent testament to his dedication. Yet, tonight, the rows of remedies offered him no solace. Tonight, the feeling of unease, a dark, creeping tendril, coiled tighter around his heart.

## Setting:

The story takes place in **Oakhaven, a secluded village nestled in the heart of the Blackwood Forest, in the year 1888.** Oakhaven is a place steeped in tradition and superstition, where the old ways still hold sway. The village consists of a tight-knit community, largely reliant on farming and crafting.

**Thorne's Apothecary** is the heart of the village, a two-story building with a gabled roof and leaded-glass windows. The ground floor houses the pharmacy, filled with the aforementioned shelves of remedies, a large mortar and pestle, and various antique instruments used for preparing medicines. The air is thick with the aroma of herbs, spices, and chemicals. The upper floor serves as Elias's living quarters, a spartan space filled with overflowing bookshelves and half-finished experiments. A small garden out back provides many of the herbs he needs for his preparations.

The Blackwood Forest itself is a character, a looming presence that surrounds Oakhaven on all sides. It is a place of ancient trees, whispering secrets, and half-forgotten legends. The villagers both revere and fear it, relying on its bounty while simultaneously dreading its hidden dangers.
