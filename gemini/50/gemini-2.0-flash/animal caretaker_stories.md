## Story Opening:

The first whimper tore through the pre-dawn stillness like a ragged fingernail scraping across a chalkboard. Genevieve "Ginnie" Albright, her sleep-tangled hair clinging to her cheek, jolted upright in her narrow cot. She'd learned to distinguish every sound emanating from the Arkham City Animal Rehabilitation Center, a cacophony that ranged from the contented purrs of recovering kittens to the frustrated howls of wolves missing the wild. This, though, was different. This was pure, unadulterated terror.

Ginnie scrambled out of bed, her bare feet hitting the cold concrete floor. She tugged on her worn jeans and a faded t-shirt emblazoned with a picture of a three-legged terrier and the words "Arkham City Animal Allies." The whimpering intensified, laced now with a choked sob. It was coming from the Quarantine Wing. Dread, a familiar guest, settled in her stomach. Quarantine was never good.

## Setting:

The Arkham City Animal Rehabilitation Center stood on the edge of town, a sprawling complex of mismatched buildings surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with razor wire. Once a sprawling agricultural research facility, it had fallen into disrepair and was eventually repurposed as a haven for abandoned, injured, and abused animals. The main building, a two-story brick structure that once housed the research labs, now held administrative offices, the operating room, and the adoption center. A cluster of corrugated metal sheds served as kennels for the larger animals – dogs, wolves, coyotes, and the occasional unexpected visitor like the time they found a discarded pot-bellied pig. The Quarantine Wing, a small, isolated building separated from the rest by a patch of overgrown weeds, was reserved for animals with contagious diseases or unknown origins. The whole place smelled of disinfectant, wet fur, and a persistent undercurrent of…hope, a fragile and sometimes elusive scent that Ginnie found more potent than any cleaner.

The Arkham City skyline, dominated by the gothic spires of the university and the looming silhouette of Arkham Asylum, was just visible in the distance, a constant reminder of the city's dark underbelly. Even out here, on the fringes of civilization, the shadow of Arkham touched everything.
