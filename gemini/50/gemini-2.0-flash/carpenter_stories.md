## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of cedar and regret hung thick in the air, clinging to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun. Elias Thorne sighed, running a calloused hand over the smooth, unvarnished surface of the coffin. He hadn’t wanted to build this. Hell, he never wanted to build these. But commissions were drying up faster than varnish in July, and a carpenter’s gotta eat. Still, it felt…wrong. Especially since he knew who it was for.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the small, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood was a place where time seemed to move slower, where the ancient trees whispered secrets to the wind, and where the line between the living and the dead felt thinner than anywhere else. Elias Thorne's workshop, a ramshackle structure built on the edge of town, reflected the town's rustic charm and subtle decay. Sawdust coated every surface, mingling with the scent of pine and oak. Tools, some antique and others more modern, hung from the walls, each with a story etched into its weathered surface. A half-finished rocking chair sat in the corner, a testament to Elias's more whimsical, and increasingly rare, commissions. Outside, the looming mountains provided a constant backdrop, their silent presence both comforting and oppressive. The town's graveyard, overgrown and forgotten, lay a stone's throw from his workshop, a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the permanence of death – a fact Elias was becoming increasingly aware of.
