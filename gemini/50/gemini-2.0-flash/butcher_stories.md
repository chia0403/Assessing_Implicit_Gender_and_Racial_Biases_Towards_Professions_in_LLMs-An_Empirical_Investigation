## Story Opening:

The first sliver of dawn, a bruised plum colour, was just beginning to stain the sky above Billingsgate Market when Arthur Reginald Bartholomew slammed the heavy oak door of "Bartholomew & Son, Fine Meats" with enough force to rattle the sausages hanging from the rafters. He ignored the protesting squeak of the hinges, his breath already coming in short, sharp bursts from the cold. It was a ritual, this early morning arrival, a daily act of defiance against the encroaching sleep and the persistent ache in his knuckles. Today, however, the ritual felt less like a duty and more like a penance. He wasn't just dreading the day; he was actively terrified of it.

## Setting:

**Bartholomew & Son, Fine Meats** sat at the edge of the bustling Billingsgate Market, tucked between a fishmonger overflowing with silvery scales and a greengrocer whose overflowing crates of cabbage always smelled faintly of damp earth. The shop was a symphony of sensory overload. The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of sawdust, hung heavy in Arthur's nostrils. The cold, despite the roaring fire in the hearth, gnawed at his exposed skin. Butchered carcasses, plump and pale, swung from gleaming hooks, illuminated by the harsh glare of gas lamps. Sunlight, struggling to pierce the gloom, cast long, dancing shadows across the sawdust-strewn floor, making the already formidable array of knives, cleavers, and bone saws look even more menacing. The counter, a thick slab of polished oak, gleamed with a patina built up over generations of careful use. Behind it, rows of neatly arranged sausages, black puddings, and cuts of prime beef stood testament to the Bartholomew family's dedication to the craft. It was a place of honest toil, of blood and sweat, and for Arthur Reginald Bartholomew, today, it felt like a gilded cage.
