## Story Opening:

The silence of the Grandhaven Public Library was a living thing, a soft, breathing entity that both comforted and unnerved Penelope Willowbrook. Outside, the mid-October wind whipped through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak trees that lined Elm Street, their leaves swirling in frantic dances of red and gold. Inside, however, a hushed reverence reigned. The scent of aged paper, beeswax polish on the mahogany shelves, and a faint, lingering whiff of chamomile tea clung to the air.

Penelope Willowbrook, Head Librarian and Keeper of Quiet (a title she'd jokingly bestowed upon herself), straightened the spine of a particularly battered copy of "Moby Dick" and sighed. It was nearly closing time, and the usual pre-bedtime rush of students seeking refuge from their cramped dorm rooms had dwindled to nothing. The only sound besides the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the reading room was the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.

But tonight, the silence felt different. Thicker. Moreâ€¦ expectant. As if the library itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
