## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of "Align & Thrive Chiropractic" buzzed with a low, persistent hum that matched the nervous energy vibrating through the waiting room. Sunlight, usually a welcome visitor, was aggressively screened by the slightly grimy vertical blinds, casting striated shadows across the tired, floral-patterned chairs. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of antiseptic wipes, aging linoleum, and the faint, lingering aroma of Dr. McMillan's perpetually brewing herbal tea, a concoction he swore by for both focus and digestion.

**Opening:** Dr. Elias Theodore McMillan adjusted the angle of the anatomical spine model on his desk for the tenth time that morning. He wasn't expecting a new patient for another twenty minutes, and the lull was starting to fray his usually calm demeanor. He tapped a rhythmic tattoo against the laminated surface of the desk, a habit he’d picked up in grad school and hadn’t managed to shake since. Today, the rhythm felt particularly urgent, like a frantic plea to the universe for something – anything – to break the monotony. He glanced at the overflowing inbox on his computer screen, filled with insurance claim rejections and appointment confirmations. He knew he should be tackling the pile, but the prospect felt about as appealing as root canal without anesthesia. A sudden, sharp pain shot through his lower back, a cruel reminder of the years he'd spent hunched over adjusting tables. He groaned softly, massaging the ache with his knuckles. Maybe he needed an adjustment himself. Maybe he needed a whole new career. Just then, the waiting room door chimed, announcing the arrival of his first patient of the day, and Elias forced a smile onto his face, hoping it looked more authentic than it felt.
