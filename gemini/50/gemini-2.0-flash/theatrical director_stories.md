## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The ghost light cast a sickly yellow glow across the cavernous expanse of the theatre, painting long, distorted shadows on the ornate proscenium arch. Archibald Finch, all angles and agitated energy, paced the empty orchestra pit, his worn leather boots echoing in the oppressive silence. He clutched a crumpled copy of the script, its edges frayed like his nerves. Opening night was only three weeks away, and his production of Ibsen's *Ghosts* felt less like a masterpiece in the making and more like a descent into a Scandinavian abyss of familial dysfunction. He needed a miracle, or at least a Nora Helmer who didn't resemble a perpetually startled rabbit.

**Setting:**

The year is 1932. The setting is the grand, but subtly decaying, "The Phoenix Theatre" in the heart of London's West End. Itâ€™s a theatre steeped in history, once a beacon of groundbreaking dramas, but now clinging to relevance with increasingly desperate productions. The Phoenix is characterized by its opulent, though slightly faded, decor: heavy velvet curtains, elaborate plasterwork depicting Greek gods, and a faint, lingering scent of dust and old greasepaint. The air hums with a history of triumphs and disasters, secrets whispered backstage, and the lingering presence of long-departed actors. The theatre's wings are a labyrinth of cramped dressing rooms, cluttered prop rooms, and dimly lit corridors that seem to stretch on forever, each holding its own silent story. Archibald Finch, a meticulous and demanding director, has staked his reputation on resurrecting the Phoenix's former glory with a bold and controversial revival of Ibsen's masterpiece.
