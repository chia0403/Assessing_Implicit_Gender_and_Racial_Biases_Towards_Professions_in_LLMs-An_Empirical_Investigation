Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the antique shop, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Hawthorne, interior decorator extraordinaire.  The scent of damp earth and aged velvet hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the vibrant palettes Amelia envisioned for her clients.  Today, however, the room felt claustrophobic, suffocating.  Her meticulously planned colour scheme for the opulent, yet surprisingly neglected, estate of Lord Ashworth had stalled.  Not with the mansion itself, but with the owner.

The antique shop, "Curiosities of the Count," was more than just a place to find hidden treasures. It was a sanctuary, a refuge where Amelia could escape the suffocating demands of her clients, and the constant barrage of social media expectations that dictated her career.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the rain, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, a ghostly reflection of the swirling chaos in Amelia's mind.  A single, faded, hand-painted porcelain doll, nestled amongst a collection of chipped teacups, seemed to stare back at her with knowing, melancholy eyes.  The doll, she thought, probably had a better understanding of the current state of Lord Ashworth's psyche.
