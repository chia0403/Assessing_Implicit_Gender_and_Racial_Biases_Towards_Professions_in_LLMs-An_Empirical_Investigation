The scent of lavender and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge," a barbershop tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of Old Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the small, single-paned windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Bartholomew "Barty" Featherstonehaugh, the shop's proprietor.  Barty, a man whose neatly trimmed beard spoke volumes about his meticulous nature, stared at the reflection of his own furrowed brow in the antique barber's mirror.  He'd been tending to a particularly unruly customer, a portly gentleman whose booming laughter had now subsided into a series of wheezes and complaints about the state of his health.  Barty, despite his quiet nature, found the elderly man's anxieties more than a little contagious.  The clock on the wall, a delicate affair of polished brass, ticked with the relentless patience of a seasoned judge.  Outside, the city of Old Oakhaven, renowned for its opulent mansions and hidden alleyways, seemed to hold its breath, bracing itself for the storm's fury.  Barty knew this storm extended far beyond the rain, a storm brewing in his own quiet life.
