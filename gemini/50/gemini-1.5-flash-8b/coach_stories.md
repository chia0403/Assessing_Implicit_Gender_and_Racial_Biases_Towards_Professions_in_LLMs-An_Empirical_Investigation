Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Dusty Diamond" baseball field, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and disappointment, hung heavy over the worn-out dugouts.  It was the final game of the season, a crucial championship clash between the Crimson Tide and the rival Blue Devils.  Amy, head coach of the Tide, paced the outfield, her worn leather baseball cap pulled low over her brow.  The pre-game pep talk had been nothing more than a hollow echo in the oppressive atmosphere.  Her team, usually a force to be reckoned with, looked listless, their faces reflecting the same anxiety that clawed at her own throat.  She gripped the worn wooden railing, her knuckles white.

**Setting:** The Dusty Diamond, a forgotten baseball field nestled in the heart of a forgotten town.  Years of neglect had left the stands weathered and worn, the outfield littered with patches of overgrown weeds.  The only bright spot was the faded crimson and white paint that marked the home team's dugout.  The oppressive humidity of the small town, barely clinging to the edge of the great plains, seemed to amplify the tension.  The rain, relentless in its fury, provided the only soundtrack to the anxious silence.
