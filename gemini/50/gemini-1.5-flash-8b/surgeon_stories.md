Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Aris Thorne's heart.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear.  He crouched beside the gurney, his gloved hands trembling as he checked the patient's vitals.  The young woman, barely seventeen, lay still, pale beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.  Her name was Elara, and her breath, shallow and ragged, was the only sound breaking the oppressive silence.  Aris knew, with a sickening certainty, that every second counted.

The setting was a small, rural clinic in the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating a room crammed with chipped furniture and outdated medical equipment.  The air, usually crisp and clean with the scent of pine, was heavy with the humid air of a late summer storm.  Outside, the world was a canvas of swirling grey, the wind whistling a mournful tune through the bare branches of the ancient oak trees that bordered the clinic's yard.  Aris, though a surgeon with a reputation forged in urban hospitals, felt adrift in this isolated outpost. This wasn't the sterile, high-tech operating room he was accustomed to; this was a desperate, quiet struggle against the elements and the inevitable.
