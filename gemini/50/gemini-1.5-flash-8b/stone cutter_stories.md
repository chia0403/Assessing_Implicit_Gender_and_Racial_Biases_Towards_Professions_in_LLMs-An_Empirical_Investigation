The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Silvan Mountains, stinging Elara Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust, kicked up by the swirling snow, stung her eyes as she hammered against the stubborn granite.  Sunlight, a fragile thread, pierced the swirling cloud cover only long enough to illuminate the colossal, sculpted face of the mountain, a silent guardian overlooking the valley.  Elara, her name echoing the whispers of the wind, was a stone cutter, her livelihood and her life intertwined with the granite heart of the Silvan range.  Her small workshop, a cavern carved into the mountainside, was her sanctuary, a cold, hard space warmed only by the flickering lamplight and the faint, rhythmic clang of her tools.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, held the echoes of centuries of stone whispering stories into the mountain's soul.  Today, though, the mountain seemed to hold its breath, waiting.  Elara, her knuckles white against the cold stone, felt a tremorâ€”not of the earth, but within herself.  Something within the rock itself was stirring.
