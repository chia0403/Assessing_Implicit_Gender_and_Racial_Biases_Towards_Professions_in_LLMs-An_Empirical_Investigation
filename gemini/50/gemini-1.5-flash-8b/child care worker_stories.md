The chipped paint on the playroom walls, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to hum with a low, insistent thrum.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the grimy window, illuminating a kaleidoscope of colours â€“ crayon smudges, glitter glue, and the faint scent of Play-Doh.  This was the kingdom of Amelia "Amy" Carter, and for the next few hours, it was her responsibility to keep it from descending into chaos. Amy, a child care worker at the Sunnyside Community Centre, adjusted the strap of her worn canvas tote bag, the familiar weight of her supplies settling against her shoulder.  The air was thick with the energy of five small humans, a whirlwind of squabbles and giggles, a symphony of tiny voices.  Today's group included Leo, a fiery redhead with a perpetual frown,  Maya, a freckled artist with a paintbrush perpetually tucked behind her ear, and the surprisingly boisterous twins, Finn and Rosie, each a miniature tornado of chaotic energy.  Amy took a deep breath, her heart a comforting rhythm against her ribs. Another day, another kingdom to rule, one that hopefully, for once, wouldn't end with a mountain of misplaced blocks and a crying jag from Leo.
