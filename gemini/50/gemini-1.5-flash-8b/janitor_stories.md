The fluorescent lights of the Grand Library hummed, a low, persistent drone that echoed the rhythmic scrape of Silas Blackwood's mop across the polished oak floor. Dust motes, tiny specks of forgotten knowledge, danced in the pale light, swirling around his worn, leather-patched boots.  Silas, a man whose face held the quiet wisdom of a thousand books he'd cleaned, but never read,  worked a double shift, the night's quiet solitude a welcome respite from the relentless clamor of the city outside.  The Grand Library, a towering structure of sandstone and glass, was, to him, more than just a workplace. It was a silent cathedral, echoing with the whispers of ages past.  Tonight, though, a different sound slithered through the hushed halls: a faint, metallic *clink*.

**Setting:** The Grand Library, a magnificent, sprawling building of sandstone and glass that dominated the heart of the city.  Its interior, though imposing, was strangely intimate.  High ceilings, lined with intricate carvings, allowed the light to filter through the many windows and cast an ethereal glow over the vast collection of books.  From the grand reading room to the secluded archives, dust motes danced in the ever-present, low hum of the fluorescent lights. The late-night air, filled with the scent of old paper and leather, hung heavy and still, amplified the subtle noises of the building. This particular night was unusually quiet, offering a stark contrast to the vibrant city outside.
