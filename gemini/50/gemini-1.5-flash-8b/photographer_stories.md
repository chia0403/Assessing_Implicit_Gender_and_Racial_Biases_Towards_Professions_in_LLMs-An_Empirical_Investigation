The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's camera bag against her ribs, the icy rain slicking the cobblestones of the Rue de la Mort.  The name, ironically, didn't deter her.  It was precisely the unsettling atmosphere, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and impending tragedy, that drew her to the Parisian alleyway.  Amelia, a photographer specializing in the unsettling beauty of decay, considered herself a chronicler of forgotten stories, the photographer of the forgotten.  This particular alleyway, tucked between towering, crumbling tenements in the Marais district, whispered tales of illicit affairs and whispered secrets, its very stones seemed to breathe history.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the buildings, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the relentless rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Her breath fogged in the cold air, clinging to the damp air like ghosts.  A single, flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the rain-streaked reflections on the dark, reflecting pools of water on the street.  The alley seemed to swallow the light, swallowing the world into its hidden depths.  The scent of mildew and old paper hung heavy in the air, adding to the suffocating atmosphere.
