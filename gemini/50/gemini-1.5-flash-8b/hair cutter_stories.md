Today was the day she had to finally tell her client, a woman whose name echoed with the grandeur of a forgotten era, that she couldn't handle her elaborate, impossible requests any longer.  The salon, "Scissors & Serenity," was nestled in the back alley of the bustling Covent Garden market, a cramped haven of quiet desperation amidst the vibrant chaos of the city.  Dusty books on hairstyling, stacked precariously on a wobbly shelf, and the scent of cheap, artificial lavender hung heavy in the air.  A single, unwavering ray of sunlight pierced the gloom, illuminating a single, perfect curl on the mannequin head perched rigidly in a corner.  It was a cruel mockery of the perfection Amelia desperately craved in her own life.
