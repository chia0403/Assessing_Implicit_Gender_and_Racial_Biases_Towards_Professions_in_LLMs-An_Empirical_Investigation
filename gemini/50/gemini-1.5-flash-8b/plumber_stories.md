The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water dripped, a relentless percussion, from the rusted gutters onto the grimy cobblestones.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with grease-stained hands and a perpetually weary expression, knelt before a particularly stubborn clog.  The stench of mildew and something vaguely floral hung heavy in the air, a peculiar combination that Barty had learned to associate with Mrs. Higgins's prize-winning hydrangeas.  He'd been working on her overflowing sink for the better part of the morning, and the faint, yet persistent, scent of lilac mingled with the metallic tang of pipe repair.  He sighed, a sound like gravel grinding against gravel.  Barty was determined to fix the sink, but a growing sense of dread, as thick as the grime under the sink, settled in his stomach.  He'd never experienced a clog so stubborn, soâ€¦ *sentient*.
