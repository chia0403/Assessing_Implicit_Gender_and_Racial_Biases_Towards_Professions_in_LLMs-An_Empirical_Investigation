The aroma of cinnamon and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket draped over the cobbled streets of Old St. Jude.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows of the cathedral across the square, painted the bakery, "The Golden Crust," in shifting hues of gold and crimson.

The rhythmic click-clack of her wooden spoon against the enamel of the mixing bowl was a soundtrack to her life, a life as predictable and comforting as the buttery taste of her signature éclairs.  But today, a single, errant note broke the melody.  A chill, a tremor in the air, sharper than the biting autumn wind.  And nestled within the heart of the croissant, Amelia saw it—a tiny, intricately carved wooden bird, no bigger than her thumb.
