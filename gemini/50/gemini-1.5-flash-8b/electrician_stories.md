The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Wrench" garage cast an oily, sickly yellow glow over Elias Thorne, Electrician Extraordinaire.  He crouched beneath a battered Ford pickup, its engine a wheezing beast.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the haze of exhaust fumes that clung to the air like a second skin.  The smell of burnt rubber and gasoline hung heavy, mingling with the faint, almost comforting aroma of old copper and ozone that Elias knew so well.  This was his domain, the greasy heart of Willow Creek, a town that thrived on the whispers of forgotten dreams and the roar of sputtering engines.  Willow Creek wasn't known for its elegance, or even its cleanliness.  But it held a peculiar charm for Elias, a charm that resided in the intricate, almost magical, dance of electricity within its worn-out infrastructure.
