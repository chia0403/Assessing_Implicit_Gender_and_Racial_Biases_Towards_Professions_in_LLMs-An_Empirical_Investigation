The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten teacups, reflected Elias Thornewood's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of his tiny, cobbled-street workshop.  Elias, a tailor of impeccable skill and renowned, if somewhat eccentric, taste, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic thump of his needle against the fabric.  His workshop, tucked away on a narrow lane in the heart of  Old Blackwood, was a testament to both his meticulous craft and his frugal nature.  Shelves groaned under the weight of bolts of exquisite silk and sturdy wool, mingled with stacks of vintage patterns and worn leather-bound books filled with forgotten styles and forgotten dreams.  A single, dusty mannequin, sporting a magnificent, but slightly moth-eaten, velvet waistcoat, stood sentinel in a corner, its wooden arms crossed as if contemplating the ceaseless flow of time.  Outside, the cacophony of Blackwood – the clanging of blacksmith's hammers, the cries of street vendors, the ceaseless chatter of the market crowd – offered a jarring counterpoint to the quiet hush of his creative sanctuary.
