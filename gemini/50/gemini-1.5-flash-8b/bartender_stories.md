The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "May" Blackwood, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of her heart.  The Rusty Mug, a dive bar nestled in the shadow of the crumbling factory district, was her sanctuary and her cage. Tonight, it was overflowing with both.

The setting:  Rain-slicked cobblestone streets.  Gas lamps, sputtering weakly, cast long, dancing shadows.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely sweet, perhaps escaping from a nearby bakery, mingling with the familiar bar smells of stale beer and burnt sugar.  The factory district, a sprawling labyrinth of rusting machinery and forgotten dreams, whispered tales of lost fortunes and forgotten promises.  Behind the Rusty Mug, the rhythmic clang of a distant crane echoed in the oppressive stillness, punctuating the rhythmic clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversations.  May, with her smudged lipstick and perpetually tired eyes, was the silent observer, the quiet heart of the place.
