The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes and tugging at the frayed edges of his wool scarf.  Below, the cobbled streets of Old St. Ives, a town nestled amongst the jagged peaks of the Welsh mountains, huddled beneath a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Grey clouds, thick and heavy, threatened rain at any moment, mirroring the leaden weight in Elias's chest. He adjusted the worn leather straps of his toolbelt, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the otherwise relentless chill.  He was perched precariously on the slate roof of the ancient Abbey, a landmark as weathered as he was, its grey stone stained with the passage of centuries.  This wasn't just any roof; it was the roof of the Abbey's oldest tower, rumored to hold secrets older than the town itself.  Elias, a roofer by trade and a seeker of forgotten stories by nature, felt a strange pull towards this particular job.  He'd been sent to repair the damage from last week's storm, but a different kind of storm raged within him, one that hinted at something more than just missing slates and leaky gutters.
