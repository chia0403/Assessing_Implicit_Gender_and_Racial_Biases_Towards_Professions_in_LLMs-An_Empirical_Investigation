The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Alistair Finch's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the constant, low thrum of the city outside.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the second-floor practice, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour painting of grey and muted greens.  Alistair, a man whose meticulously combed grey hair seemed to defy the oppressive humidity, hunched over a patient's chart.  He traced the name, "Eleanor Vance," with a practiced, almost absentminded touch.  The faded ink felt strangely unfamiliar on the worn paper.  Eleanor Vance.  A name that somehow, despite its ordinariness, resonated with a peculiar weight.  Tonight, as the city outside seemed to sigh with the dampness of a late autumn evening, something felt different.  His usual meticulous, clinical approach was momentarily shadowed by an unsettling sense of unease.


The cramped office, tucked away on a side street in the bustling, yet somehow decaying, heart of Manchester, felt suffocating.  Dust motes danced in the scant rays of light filtering through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the chipped paint of the walls and the chipped porcelain of the reception desk.  Dental tools, gleaming instruments in their sterile packaging, lined the shelves.  The air, usually thick with the antiseptic smell of bleach and ozone, now held a subtly metallic tang, almost imperceptible but persistently present.
