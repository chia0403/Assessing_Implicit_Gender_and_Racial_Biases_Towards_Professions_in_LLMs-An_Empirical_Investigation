The fluorescent hum of the lab thrummed a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Blood, a crimson river, flowed through the veins of the patients, their anxieties, their hopes, their fears, all seemingly condensed into the small vials she meticulously filled.  Amelia, a phlebotomist at the sprawling, imposing St. Jude's Hospital, felt a familiar pressure building in her chest, a knot of apprehension that mirrored the tightness in the veins she was preparing to access. Today, however, the air hung thick with a different kind of tension.  It wasn't the usual pre-surgery jitters or the quiet fear of a patient with a known history of complications. Today, it was the unnerving stillness before the storm.  Outside, the city, usually a cacophonous symphony of honking taxis and chattering voices, had fallen silent, replaced by a palpable hush that seemed to seep into the sterile white walls of the lab. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, casting long, distorted shadows across the antiseptic floors.
