The fluorescent lights of the truck stop diner hummed, a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia “Ace”  Montgomery’s heart.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the relentless beat of her own anxieties. Outside, the endless, grey expanse of the Iowa plains stretched to the horizon, a canvas painted in the muted tones of a November storm.  Ace, her hands gnarled and calloused from years of gripping steering wheels and wrenching bolts, stared at the steaming mug of coffee before her.  The aroma, usually a comfort, now felt thin, a ghostly echo of the warmth she craved.


The year was 2024.  The sprawling, faded neon sign of the “Dusty Road Diner” cast long, distorted shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  The air smelled of stale coffee, greasy fries, and the faint, metallic tang of diesel exhaust, a familiar aroma to Ace, but one that felt different today.  Empty tables stood like silent sentinels, the only evidence of other travelers the half-eaten plates and discarded napkins. This particular stop in the heart of nowhere, Iowa, felt especially desolate, almost sinister. Ace was in the midst of the worst stretch of the road so far.  Her rig, a vintage Kenworth, bearing the name “Crimson Comet” emblazoned across its gleaming side, was her only companion in this endless expanse of nothing.
