Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's heartbeat.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile, but noticeably worn, examination room.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the faint, cloying scent of antiseptic.  Izzy, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, meticulously checked the vitals of a young man slumped over a table, his face pale and clammy.  The persistent drumming of rain against the metal roof seemed to amplify the quiet gasp escaping his lips.  This was no ordinary Tuesday.  The remote mountain village of El Rancho, nestled in the rugged foothills of the Sierra Madre, was usually a tapestry of quiet mornings, but today it had been ripped apart by a tremor of earth and a rush of water. The clinic, usually buzzing with the low hum of everyday ailments, was now the epicenter of a disaster.
