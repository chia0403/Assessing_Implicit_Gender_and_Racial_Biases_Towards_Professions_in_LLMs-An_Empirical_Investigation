Entitled "Whispers from the Obsidian Shard," it was a sprawling fantasy epic, dense with prose and brimming with what Amelia suspected were well-meaning but ultimately tedious descriptions of magical flora.

Stacks of manuscripts, each meticulously labeled with a brightly colored sticky note, lined the walls.  Empty coffee cups, each holding the ghost of a bitter brew, sat clustered on the overflowing desk.  A single, perfectly placed bonsai tree, stubbornly clinging to life in a corner, seemed the only living thing in the room, silently judging the endless stream of words Amelia had to sift through.  Outside, the rhythmic drip of rain against the windowpane mirrored the steady, almost hypnotic, clicking of Amelia's keyboard.
