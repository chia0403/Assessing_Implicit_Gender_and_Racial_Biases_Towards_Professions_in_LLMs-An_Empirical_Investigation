The flickering neon sign of the "Cosmic Cones" diner cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street outside Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam's workshop.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder and ozone.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom from a bare bulb hanging precariously above her workbench.  Sparky, her name a testament to the crackling energy that seemed to hum around her,  adjusted the delicate antenna of a vintage shortwave radio, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the relentless downpour had started again, mirroring the endless stream of static crackling in the radio's speaker.  The year was 1948.  Her workshop, a cramped, cluttered space tucked away in a forgotten alleyway of the burgeoning city of Zenith, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her whole world.  It was here, amidst the whirring of old motors and the faint hum of transformers, that the whispers of a forgotten world came alive through the ether.
