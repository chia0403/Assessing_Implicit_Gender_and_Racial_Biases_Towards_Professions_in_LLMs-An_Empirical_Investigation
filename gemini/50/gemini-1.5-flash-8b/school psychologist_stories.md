Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the psychologist's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The sterile white walls, usually a comforting balm to her frayed nerves, felt oppressive now, reflecting the muted grey light filtering through the storm-tossed glass.  Outside, the ancient oak tree, a familiar landmark from her childhood, swayed like a frantic dancer, its gnarled branches clawing at the bruised sky.  Eleanor, her usual brisk efficiency replaced by a gnawing anxiety, stared at the swirling colours in the mug of lukewarm chamomile tea.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain was a soundtrack to her mounting despair, a persistent, insistent percussion echoing the silent scream building within her.  The small, meticulously organized office, a haven sheâ€™d built for herself over the years, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage.  The city of Oakhaven, usually a picturesque blend of quaint cobblestone streets and sprawling green parks, was shrouded in an oppressive blanket of grey. It was a day that mirrored the turmoil in Eleanor's heart.
