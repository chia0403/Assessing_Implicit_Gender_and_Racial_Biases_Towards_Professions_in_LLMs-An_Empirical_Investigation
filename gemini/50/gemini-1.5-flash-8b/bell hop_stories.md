The brass bell, a tiny, insistent hammer against the chipped enamel of the hotel's entrance, jangled a discordant tune as Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bell hop extraordinaire (though "extraordinaire" was a generous descriptor, given the mostly mundane nature of his duties), snatched it up.  The air, thick with the humid scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, hung heavy over the grand, if somewhat faded, Excelsior Hotel.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass windows of the lobby, illuminating a scene of languid afternoons and whispered secrets.  Palm trees, their fronds drooping in the oppressive heat, offered scant respite from the sweltering atmosphere.  A faint, almost imperceptible, hum, reminiscent of a thousand conversations and half-forgotten anxieties, vibrated through the ornate wooden floors.  Barty, his starched uniform a stark contrast to the dishevelled elegance of the hotel, surveyed the scene with a sigh.  Another slow Tuesday.  Another room to be prepared for another nameless guest, another weary traveler hoping to find refuge in the hallowed halls of the Excelsior.
