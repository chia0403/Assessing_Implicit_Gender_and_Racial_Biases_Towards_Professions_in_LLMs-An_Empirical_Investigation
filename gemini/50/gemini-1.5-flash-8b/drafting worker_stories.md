The air in the drafting room hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the almost-sweet tang of India ink.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of 107 Elm Street, illuminating the meticulously crafted blueprints scattered across the drawing tables.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker at the sprawling, century-old architectural firm of Hemlock & Hawthorne, felt a familiar knot tightening in his chest.  Another deadline loomed, another project demanding the precision of his hands and the focus of his mind.  It was a Tuesday, the most common day for the relentless pressure to build.  

The room itself was a testament to the passage of time.  The mahogany tables, once polished to a gleam, were now scarred with the marks of countless pencils and erasers.  Rows of towering filing cabinets, filled with decades of blueprints and architectural sketches, stretched into the gloom.  A muted hum emanated from the ancient, whirring ventilation system, a constant, almost imperceptible soundtrack to the silent symphony of drafting work.  Eliasâ€™s worn leather chair creaked with each movement, a companion to the rhythmic scratch of his mechanical pencil.
