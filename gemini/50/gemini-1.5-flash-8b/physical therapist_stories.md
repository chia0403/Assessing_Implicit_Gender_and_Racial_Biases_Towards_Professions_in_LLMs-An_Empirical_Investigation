Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the insistent throbbing in Amelia Hayes’s temples.  The small, windowless physiotherapy practice, tucked away on the outskirts of Oakhaven, felt more like a damp mausoleum than a place of healing.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation.  Amelia, a woman whose carefully structured life was usually meticulously choreographed, felt utterly adrift.  Her beige linen trousers and crisp white shirt, usually impeccable, were damp and clinging to her skin.  The hum of the antiquated air conditioner, the rhythmic squeak of the worn examination table, and the faint sobs of a patient somewhere in the backroom seemed to amplify the quiet chaos building within her. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful dirge that perfectly mirrored the deep anxiety settling in her chest.  Oakhaven, a town that had once seemed quaint and welcoming, felt claustrophobic now, as if it were holding its breath, waiting for something – or someone – to break.
