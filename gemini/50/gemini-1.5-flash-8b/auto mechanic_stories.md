The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty's Wrench & Wheel," the aroma of burnt motor oil mingling with the sweet tang of exhaust fumes.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workshop.  Tools – sockets, wrenches, screwdrivers – lay scattered like fallen leaves in a forgotten forest, their metallic glint dulled by a film of grime.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, a seasoned auto mechanic with hands as calloused as the leather of his worn leather apron.  Barty, a man perpetually shadowed by a faint smile and an aura of quiet competence, was meticulously dismantling a sputtering vintage roadster, its engine a symphony of metallic groans.  He'd been at it since dawn, his focus a laser beam on the intricate mechanics beneath the hood. Outside, the relentless clang of city life faded into the background hum of the engine.  This quiet sanctuary, within the bustling urban sprawl, was Barty's refuge, his place of purpose.
