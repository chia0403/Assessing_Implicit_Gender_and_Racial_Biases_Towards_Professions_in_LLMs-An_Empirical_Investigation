The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky beige from years of lukewarm water and forgotten rinses, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the salon.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a single strand of auburn hair clinging stubbornly to the sill.  This was where Elara Vance, a stylist with hands as practiced as they were delicate, began her day.  The salon, "Scissors & Sighs,"  resembled a forgotten relic of a bygone eraâ€”velvet curtains faded to a bruised plum, plush armchairs upholstered in a worn floral print, and the faint scent of stale coffee and old-fashioned hairspray clinging to the air.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps.  Inside, a quiet hum of whispered conversations and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of scissors punctuated the urban symphony. Elara, perched on a stool in the back, idly tugged a stray strand of hair from her own head.  Her brow, usually smooth as polished granite, was furrowed in a faint frown, as if wrestling with an unspoken problem.  Today, she was cutting more than hair.
