The humid air hung thick and heavy, a palpable shroud clinging to the cobblestone streets of São Paulo.  Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, her name a whispered echo in the bustling marketplace, wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her hand.  The scent of roasting meats, exotic spices, and something vaguely floral battled with the metallic tang of disinfectant that clung to her crisp white uniform.  São Paulo pulsed with a relentless rhythm, a symphony of horns, shouts, and the rhythmic clatter of countless tiny vendors.  Izzy, her medical bag slung over one shoulder, navigated the throngs, her focus laser-sharp on the urgency in the rhythmic beating of a child's chest she felt through her thin cotton shirt.  A tiny, feverish hand clutched at her tunic, the desperate gaze of a two-year-old fixed on her face.  The toddler, known only as "Manuela," was suffering from a severe respiratory infection, a malady common in the crowded favelas that sprawled behind the market's vibrant facade.  The clinic she'd been dispatched to, a cramped space in a converted storefront, felt miles away, and Izzy knew that time, as always, was of the essence.
