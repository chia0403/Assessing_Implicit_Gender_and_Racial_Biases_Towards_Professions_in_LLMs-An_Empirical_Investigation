The chipped paint of Miss Amelia Hawthorne's classroom walls, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, danced like tiny, ethereal gnats.  Clock hands on the ancient, pendulum-laden clock in the corner ticked with a metronomic solemnity, each second a tiny hammer blow against the quiet hum of the pre-summer air.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair was now streaked with silver threads that mirrored the shimmering dust motes, adjusted her glasses.  Inside the classroom, the only sound was the faint scuffling of paper and the occasional whisper.  Fourth grade.  A room full of burgeoning minds, each unique, each a mystery she had yet to fully unravel. Today, that mystery had intensified, and it was centred on one particular student: Leo.
