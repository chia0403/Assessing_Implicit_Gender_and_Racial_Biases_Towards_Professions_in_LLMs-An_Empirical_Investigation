The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a constant, sterile drone that was almost comforting to Elara Vance.  Elara, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of countless patient anxieties, adjusted the tray of instruments.  Today, the usual pre-treatment symphony of chattering teeth and anxious breaths was absent.  Instead, a profound stillness hung in the air, thick and heavy like the cotton wool she held ready.

Setting: The meticulously organized, almost clinical, waiting room of Dr. Sharma's dental practice in the quiet, leafy suburb of Oakhaven.  Sunlight, filtered through the leaves of the towering oaks outside, cast dappled shadows on the polished wood floors.  A single, ornate grandfather clock ticked rhythmically in the corner, its pendulum a metronome counting down the moments.  The air smelled subtly of antiseptic and freshly-ground coffee, a familiar aroma that often masked the faint, lingering fear.  Today, though, the air held something more - a palpable sense of foreboding, lurking just beneath the surface of the usual sterile calm.
