The chill of the November air snaked through the gaps in the warped, wooden planks of the butcher shop, a familiar companion to Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw.  The aroma of aged cheddar, drying herbs, and the ever-present, subtly metallic tang of freshly-cut meat hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting wind howling outside.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering gaslight, danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, highlighting the intricate patterns etched into the worn wooden counter.  Barty, a man whose weathered hands spoke volumes of a life spent wrestling with bone and sinew, leaned over a slab of prime brisket, his sharp, hawk-like eyes scrutinizing the glistening surface.  He was a master craftsman, a poet of the cleave and the slice,  a butcher in the heart of the old Southwark district of London, 1888.
