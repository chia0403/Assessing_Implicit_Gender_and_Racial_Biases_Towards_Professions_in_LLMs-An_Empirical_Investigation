The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, threatening to snatch it altogether.  Grey clouds, thick and ominous, hung low over the sprawling, yet somehow desolate, Victorian estate on Elmwood Avenue.  The air, already crisp, carried the faint scent of pine needles and decay.  Amelia, a seasoned real estate agent with a reputation for turning lemons into lemonade, found herself contemplating the house's potential â€“ or, more accurately, the potential absence of potential.  This wasn't your typical fixer-upper; this was a crumbling monument to a bygone era, a whisper of grandeur now struggling to hold itself upright.

Elmwood Avenue itself was a study in contradictions.  Opulent mansions, their facades scarred by time, lined the street, jostling with newer, sleek homes that seemed to mock the faded elegance of their neighbours.  The avenue was a timeline of architectural styles, each house a chapter in the city's history.  Yet, a sense of melancholy clung to the air, palpable even amidst the vibrant hues of autumn leaves scattered across the pavement.  Amelia knew this area inside and out, its secrets and its sorrows.  And this house, the Blackwood Manor, was arguably the most melancholy of them all.
