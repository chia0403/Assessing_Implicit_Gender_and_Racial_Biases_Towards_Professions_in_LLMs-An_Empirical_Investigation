The biting wind whipped Amelia Graystone's hair across her face as she peered out from the scaffolding, the city a blur of grey and steel below.  The skeletal frame of the Zenith Tower, her magnum opus, rose against the bruised, overcast sky like a defiant monument.  Construction had been painstakingly slow, plagued by unexpected delays and budgetary crises, but Amelia, despite the anxieties gnawing at her, felt a surge of quiet triumph.  From this vantage point, the tower, with its spiralling glass facade that would eventually shimmer with the captured light of the setting sun, seemed almost tangible.  She was almost, but not quite, home.

Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the city's ubiquitous glass towers, illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air above her meticulously arranged design portfolios.  The faint hum of the city, a constant soundtrack to her life, was both a soothing backdrop and a relentless reminder of the demands and expectations that pressed in on her.  She was a master of structural form, but her personal life remained a chaotic, uncharted territory.
