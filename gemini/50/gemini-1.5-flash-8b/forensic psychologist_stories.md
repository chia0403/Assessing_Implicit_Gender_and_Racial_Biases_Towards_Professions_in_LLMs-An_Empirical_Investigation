Rain hammered against the arched windows of the Coroner's Office, a relentless percussion mirroring the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's head.  The stale scent of disinfectant and decaying floral arrangements hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the grim business conducted within.  The city of Oakhaven, nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Appalachian foothills, had been unusually quiet lately, a deceptive calm before the inevitable storm.  But this storm wasn't meteorological.  It was a storm of fractured minds and shattered lives, and Dr. Vance, forensic psychologist for the Oakhaven County Coroner's Office, was on the front lines, trying to piece them together.

The room was dimly lit, the sterile white walls punctuated by the stark black and white photographs of victims.  Each one told a story, a story Dr. Vance was desperately trying to decipher, not just from the wounds, but from the fractured fragments of memory scattered amongst the victim's belongings.  Her worn leather chair, a testament to countless hours hunched over case files, had become her refuge and her battlefield.  Today, another case had arrived, another shattered puzzle to solve in this quaint, yet deeply troubled town.  The victim, a young woman named Sarah Miller, lay sprawled on the autopsy table, her pale face a mask of unimaginable horror.
