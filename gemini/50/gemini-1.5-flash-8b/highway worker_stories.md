The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Milly" Hawthorne's denim jacket, stinging her cheeks and rattling the loose rivets on her worn work boots.  Dust, kicked up by the passing semi-trucks, coated everything – her face, the faded orange safety vest, the cracked asphalt stretching to the horizon.  She shivered, not just from the cold but from the endless, monotonous drone of the highway.  I-84, a ribbon of concrete snakes through the desolate, sun-baked landscape of the Wyoming plains.  A relentless ribbon of metal and asphalt, seemingly indifferent to the small figures toiling along its path.  This stretch, between the ghost town of Broken Ridge and the barely-there hamlet of Dusty Draw, was Milly's domain.  Her days, week after week, blurred into a grey, repetitive rhythm: patching potholes, replacing guardrails, marking lane lines,  battling the unforgiving elements and the occasional, distracted semi-truck driver.  Today, however, felt different.  The air, usually thick with the scent of tar and diesel, carried a faint, sweet smell of something blooming in the distance – a promise of something more than the dusty, monotonous highway.
