The chipped paint of the windowsill, a sickly yellow that mirrored the gloom of the attic room, was the only colour Amelia "Em" Blackwood truly felt was hers.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, barely penetrated the grime-coated panes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light.  Em Blackwood, a painter with a soul sculpted from charcoal smudges and the hushed whispers of forgotten canvases, sat hunched over her easel.  The air, thick with the scent of linseed oil and stale attic dust, clung to her like a second skin.  Her easel, a weathered, antique affair, was balanced precariously on a rickety stool, the entire setup a testament to the makeshift nature of her studio.

The setting: The attic of a crumbling Victorian townhouse on the edge of Blackwood's Hollow, a forgotten district of the city, once a hub of bustling commerce but now overshadowed by neglect and whispered rumours.  Grey skies, perpetually overcast, hung heavy over the rooftops, mirroring the dampness that seeped into the very bones of the house.  The only sound was the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water somewhere unseen, a constant, melancholy accompaniment to Em's solitary work.  Within the confined space, time seemed to stretch and twist, blurring the line between the past and present.  The house itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting, as if anticipating a revelation from the hands of the young painter, whose canvas, a blank expanse of white, reflected her own inner turmoil.
