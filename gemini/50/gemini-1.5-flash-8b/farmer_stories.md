The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of the Blackwood Valley, stinging Elara Blackwood’s cheeks and rattling the corrugated iron of her barn.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the withered stalks of barley into swirling, menacing patterns.  This was the worst drought in living memory.  Even the usually robust oak trees in the valley’s ancient copse stood skeletal and forlorn, their leaves long since succumbed to the relentless sun.  It was August, and the air hung thick and heavy with the cloying scent of burnt earth and desperation.  Elara Blackwood, a woman whose weathered hands spoke volumes of a lifetime spent coaxing sustenance from unforgiving soil, stared at the skeletal remains of her wheat crop.  The once vibrant golden fields were now a desolate expanse of straw-colored ruin.  A single, lone raven perched atop the highest remaining stalk, its obsidian eye fixed on her with an unnerving intensity.  Elara knew in her gut that this was not just a drought; this was a harbinger of something worse.
