The biting wind whipped dust devils across the cracked earth of the Arizona desert, stinging Amelia Rodriguez-Garcia's cheeks.  The sun, already a molten orb sinking towards the jagged, purple-hued mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast expanse of the open pit mine.  Amelia, her name a whispered testament to both the harshness and beauty of the land, crouched low in the operator's seat of her massive Caterpillar 990H.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the hydraulics vibrated through her reinforced seat, a counterpoint to the eerie silence broken only by the screech of the wind and the distant, metallic groan of the machinery.  Around her, the remnants of a day's work lay sprawled like discarded giants: mountains of rock and earth, blasted and scarred by the relentless advance of industrial progress.  This was her kingdom, her domain, this desolate landscape where the earth yielded its treasures with a reluctant sigh.  She was the architect of these canyons, the sculptor of this desolate beauty. Tonight, she was the silent guardian of it all, the heavy equipment operator of the Coronado Mine.
