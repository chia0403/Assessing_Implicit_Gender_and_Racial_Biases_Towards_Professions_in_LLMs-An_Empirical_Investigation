The flickering neon sign of "Serenity's Touch" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked alleyway.  Beside the small, almost invisible storefront, Amelia "Amy" Nightingale huddled, clutching a damp, worn leather satchel.  The scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes mingled with the faint, floral aroma that always seemed to emanate from within the little shop. Tonight, however, the usually tranquil scent was tinged with a metallic tang.  The city, a concrete jungle humming with unseen anxieties, pressed in around her, the rhythmic thump-thump of the relentless rain mirroring the frantic beat of her own heart.

Amy, 32 years old, a massage therapist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the wisdom of a seasoned traveler, knew the night was about to bring a new client—a new challenge—to her small, quiet practice.  Serenity's Touch, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling metropolis, was a haven of sorts, a place where the stresses of the city were left behind, at least for a while. But tonight, the haven felt strangely charged.  A tremor of apprehension, a chill in the air, signaled that this session wouldn't be like others.
