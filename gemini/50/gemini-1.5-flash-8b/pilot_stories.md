The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face as she fought the controls of the Zephyr.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the cracked, ochre plains of Xylos.  Below, the city of Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis built into the face of a crumbling canyon, shimmered in the harsh, desert sun.  Amelia, pilot extraordinaire of the Zephyr, a sleek, crimson-painted airship, felt the familiar hum of its engines thrumming against her bones.  This was her patrol, the 17th of the Dusk Patrol, her third above Aethelgard this week, and already, the tension coiled tight within her like a sand viper.  Xylos was a world of shifting sands and hidden dangers, a place where the whispers of the ancient, forgotten gods still echoed through the canyons.  And Amelia, a pilot with eyes like polished jade and a heart as hard as tempered steel, knew that the whispers werenâ€™t always just stories.  The Zephyr, her faithful steed of the skies, was her only friend in this harsh landscape.
