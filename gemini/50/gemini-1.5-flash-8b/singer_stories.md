The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Spoon" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones, barely illuminating the huddled figures beneath its awning.  Amelia Nightingale, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of stormy seas, adjusted the worn leather strap of her battered guitar case.  Tonight, the Spoon was a symphony of muted sighs and clinking glasses, a far cry from the vibrant, echoing roar of the city that pulsed just beyond the tavern's shadowed entrance.

Amelia, whose real name was Amelia Nightingale, was known only as "Nightingale" in the hushed corners of this forgotten district of Old Haven.  She was a singer, a ballad weaver who coaxed tales of longing and loss from the frayed strings of her guitar, stories whispered in the dead of night. Tonight's story, however, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, mirroring the tension humming in the air.  A hush fell over the room, a silence that felt heavier than the encroaching rain.  Outside, the city seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the storm that was brewing, not just outside, but within the very walls of The Rusty Spoon.
