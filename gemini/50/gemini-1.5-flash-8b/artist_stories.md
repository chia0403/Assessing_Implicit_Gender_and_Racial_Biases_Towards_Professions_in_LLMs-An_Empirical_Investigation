The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  Cobwebs, thick as spider silk, draped from the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the path leading to Blackwood Manor.  A perpetual twilight clung to the valley, swallowing the last vestiges of the dying sun, painting the stone walls of the manor in shades of bruised purple and charcoal grey.  Ash, her charcoal sketchbook clutched tightly in her gloved hand, hurried through the deserted, leaf-strewn lane.  The manor itself, looming ominously in the gloom, seemed to exhale a palpable sense of foreboding.  Its many windows, like vacant eyes, stared out at the world, and the silence, punctuated only by the rustling of the wind, was unnerving.  Ash's breath frosted the air around her as she approached the heavy oak doors, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs.  This was no ordinary commission.  Blackwood Manor, with its whispers of centuries-old secrets and troubled past, had called upon her unique gift to capture the essence of the house itself.  She, Amelia Ashworth, artist of the unseen, had been summoned to etch its very soul onto canvas.
