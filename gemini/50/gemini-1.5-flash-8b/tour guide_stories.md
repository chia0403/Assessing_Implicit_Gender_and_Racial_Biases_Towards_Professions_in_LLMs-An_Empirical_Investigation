The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague, normally a symphony of clanging trams and the murmur of tourists, were eerily silent.  An unnatural hush, like the breath held before a storm, settled over the ancient city, a stark contrast to the usual vibrant energy.  Amelia, a passionate tour guide known for her encyclopedic knowledge and dramatic flair, clutched her worn leather guidebook tighter.  Her usual boisterous "Welcome to Prague!" was replaced by a nervous tremor in her voice.  Today, the tour wasn't just about the Astronomical Clock and the Charles Bridge; it was about something far more sinister, something that had the city on edge.

Amelia stood at the edge of the Old Jewish Cemetery, the ancient stones frosted and obscured by a thick layer of snow.  The towering gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, normally a beacon of light against the twilight sky, seemed to cast long, ominous shadows.  A chill deeper than the winter air snaked its way through her, a cold fear that mirrored the unsettling emptiness she sensed. This wasn't just an ordinary tour. This was a tour of shadows.
