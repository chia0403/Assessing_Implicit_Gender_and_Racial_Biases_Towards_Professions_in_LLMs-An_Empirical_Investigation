The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected Elara Nightingale’s face.  Dust motes, like tiny, ethereal dancers, swirled in the pale morning light filtering through the tall, arched windows of the Blackwood Manor.  Rain hammered against the leaded glass, a relentless percussion against the otherwise hushed grandeur of the house.  Elara, a housekeeper of twenty years' standing, knew this sound.  She knew the creaks of the ancient timbers, the sigh of the wind through the overgrown ivy clinging to the walls, and the subtle, almost imperceptible scent of lilies that clung to the air, a permanent, faint perfume marking the manor as something both beautiful and melancholic.

Elara Nightingale, her hands, weathered and knotted like the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the estate, carefully rinsed a silver teacup.  Each morning, this ritual was the same, a quiet prelude to the day’s work.  Blackwood Manor, with its labyrinthine corridors and secret passages, held a thousand stories, many of which Elara knew better than those who lived within its walls.  This particular morning, however, felt different.  A new, sharp, almost metallic scent mingled with the usual lilies – a scent that hung heavy in the air, like an unspoken threat.  Something felt…wrong.
