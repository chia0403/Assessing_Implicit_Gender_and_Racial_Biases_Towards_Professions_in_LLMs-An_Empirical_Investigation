The biting wind, a relentless, icy fist, whipped across the desolate expanse of the High Moors.  Patches of snow, clinging stubbornly to the skeletal branches of ancient oaks, crunched under the boots of  Alistair Finch-Hartley, a landscaper whose meticulous nature clashed spectacularly with the harsh, unforgiving terrain.  Alistair, a man whose meticulously manicured lawns and carefully sculpted flowerbeds usually reflected a calm and contained spirit, felt a tremor of something akin to panic. The moorland, today, was a snarling beast, and he, the tamer of unruly nature, felt utterly outmatched.

**Setting:** The High Moors, a vast, windswept plateau in the northern reaches of the fictional county of Ashdown.  The landscape is characterised by stark beauty:  ancient, gnarled trees clawing for purchase against the relentless wind, desolate bogs, and expanses of heather that pulsed with a purple fire.  Scattered amongst this untamed grandeur are isolated farmsteads, their inhabitants clinging to a hard-won existence.  A network of winding, treacherous paths – only truly navigable by those who know the moor – cuts through the landscape.
