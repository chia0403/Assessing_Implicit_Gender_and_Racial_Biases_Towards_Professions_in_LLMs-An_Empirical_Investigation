The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to amplify the silence.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the windowless room.  History textbooks, dog-eared and filled with highlighted passages, lay scattered across desks like fallen soldiers.  On the teacher's desk, a half-eaten apple sat beside a stack of graded papers, each one bearing a single, scrawled grade.  Eleanor, a woman whose perpetual weariness was etched into her face like a map of tired journeys, stared blankly at the swirling patterns on the linoleum floor.  The scent of old paper and something vaguely sweet, maybe burnt sugar, hung heavy in the air.  October 27th, 2024.  A Tuesday.  Another Tuesday.  Another day that felt as though it would never end.
