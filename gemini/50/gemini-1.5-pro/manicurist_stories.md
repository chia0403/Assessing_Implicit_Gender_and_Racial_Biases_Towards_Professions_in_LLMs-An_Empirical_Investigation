The bell above the door of "Nailed It!" tinkled merrily, announcing the arrival of yet another desperate soul in need of a little pampering.  Rain lashed against the large picture window, turning the already grey streets of Portland, Oregon into a blurry impressionist painting.  Inside, the salon was a vibrant contrast: turquoise walls adorned with framed vintage nail polish ads,  hot pink pedicure thrones lined up like candy, and the aroma of lavender and acetone hung heavy in the air.  Elara Rose Valencia, her fiery red hair pulled back in a neat bun, looked up from the intricate floral design she was painting on Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s thumb and offered a warm, professional smile. "Welcome to Nailed It!  Have a seat, I'll be with you in just a moment."
