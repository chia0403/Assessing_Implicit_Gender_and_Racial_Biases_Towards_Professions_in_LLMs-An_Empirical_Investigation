The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  The perpetual twilight of early spring cast long, distorted shadows across the jagged ice fields surrounding the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  Inside the geodesic dome, a beacon of warmth and light against the desolate landscape, Aris felt a familiar thrill of isolation. This was his fourth winterover, and the stark, unforgiving beauty of the South Pole still held him captive.  He exhaled, a puff of condensation crystallizing instantly in the frigid air, and turned his gaze towards the array of radio telescopes that dominated the plateau. Tonight, he hoped, would be the night they finally heard something. Something beyond the cosmic background radiation, somethingâ€¦ different. Something that would justify the years he'd poured into Project Whisper, the top-secret initiative to detect extraterrestrial intelligence.
