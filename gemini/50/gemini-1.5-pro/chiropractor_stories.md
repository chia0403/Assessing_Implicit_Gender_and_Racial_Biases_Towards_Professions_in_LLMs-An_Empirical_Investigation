The biting wind whipped down Elm Street, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne’s chiropractic clinic.  Snow, fine and sharp as powdered glass, stung his cheeks as he crossed the street from the bakery, a warm brown paper bag clutched in his gloved hand.  Above him, the faded gold lettering of “Thorne Chiropractic - Est. 1948” creaked faintly against the brickwork. The aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked rye bread mingled with the underlying scent of wintergreen oil that perpetually hung in the air around his practice.  Oakhaven, Illinois, a town nestled deep in the heart of the corn belt, wasn't known for its bustling metropolis vibe. It was a place where everybody knew your name, your grandmother's name, and probably the name of the dog you had in second grade.  This Wednesday morning, however, felt different. A strange stillness hung in the air, a quiet that went beyond the usual pre-Christmas lull. It was the kind of quiet that made the hairs on the back of Elias's neck prickle, the kind that whispered of secrets held tight and truths waiting to be unearthed.
