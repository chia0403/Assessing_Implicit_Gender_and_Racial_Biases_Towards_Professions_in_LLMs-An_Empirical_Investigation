Rain lashed against the grimy window of Silas Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head. Neon light from the pawn shop across the street painted the water-streaked glass in alternating bands of lurid green and sickly yellow.  Silas, full name Silas Rayfield Finch, tapped a cigarette out of a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes, the match flaring briefly to illuminate the cramped space. His office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the less salubrious end of San Francisco's Chinatown, wasn't much to look at.  Peeling wallpaper, a threadbare rug that had seen better decades, and files piled haphazardly on every available surface spoke of a man whose focus lay elsewhere – namely, the bottom line. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume for Silas.  It was a Tuesday night, or rather, the very early hours of Wednesday morning, and the only sound besides the rain was the rhythmic clicking of the ancient ceiling fan, struggling to circulate the humid air.  A new case hadn’t walked through his door in days, and the gnawing emptiness in his stomach was less about hunger and more about the growing hole in his pocket.
