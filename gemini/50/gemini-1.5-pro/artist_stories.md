The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, sketchbook balanced on her knees. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea gnawed at the base of the volcanic cliffs of Santorini, a breathtaking panorama of whitewashed villages clinging to the slopes.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows that stretched across the caldera, painting the stark white buildings in hues of apricot and rose. Elara, her dark hair whipping in the wind, squinted, trying to capture the fleeting light with a quick charcoal sketch. The scent of wild thyme and oregano mingled with the salty air, a heady perfume that spoke of the untamed beauty of the Greek islands.  Her fingers, smudged with charcoal and paint, tightened around her pencil. This was it.  The inspiration sheâ€™d travelled across Europe to find. The scene that would finally break her through the stifling artist's block that had plagued her for months.
