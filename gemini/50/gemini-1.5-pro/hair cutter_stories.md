The rusty whir of the ceiling fan stirred the thick, humid air in Agnes Periwinkle's barbershop, doing little to alleviate the oppressive Louisiana heat.  Agnes, small but formidable with biceps hardened by years of wielding scissors and clippers, watched the fat raindrops slide down the grime-streaked window of "Periwinkle's Precision Cuts." It was July in Ascension Parish, and the afternoon thunderstorms had become as predictable as the drawl of the regulars who filled her worn barber chairs.  The shop, nestled between a dilapidated bait shop and a perpetually closed voodoo supply store, wasn't much to look at from the outside.  Peeling paint clung to the clapboard siding like a stubborn hangover, and the neon "Open" sign flickered erratically.  Inside, however, was a different story. The air, thick with the scent of Barbasol and bay rum, buzzed with a quiet energy.  Agnesâ€™s collection of vintage clippers lined the shelves, gleaming like surgical instruments, a testament to her dedication to her craft.  Today, though, the only sound was the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the low hum of the refrigerator showcasing a lonely six-pack of root beer. Agnes sighed, wiping down her already spotless counter with a practiced hand.  This weather usually brought a rush of last-minute trims before the weekend, but today, even the regulars seemed to be keeping indoors.
