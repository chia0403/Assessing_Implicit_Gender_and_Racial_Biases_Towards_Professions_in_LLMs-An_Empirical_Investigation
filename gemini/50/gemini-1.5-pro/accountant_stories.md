The rhythmic drumming of water against glass was almost hypnotic, a stark counterpoint to the crisp rustle of the papers she shifted beneath her lamp. Amelia, a chartered accountant with a meticulous nature bordering on obsessive, tapped her pen against her teeth, a faint frown line etching itself between her perfectly sculpted eyebrows.  Her office, nestled on the third floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in Bloomsbury, was a sanctuary of order amidst the chaotic sprawl of the city.  Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined two walls, brimming with leather-bound ledgers and volumes on financial law.  A mahogany desk, polished to a gleam, dominated the room, its surface impeccably organized save for the single file Amelia was currently scrutinizing.  The air smelled faintly of old books and Earl Grey tea, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Ameliaâ€™s nerves.  But tonight, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. Something about the figures in front of her simply didn't add up.
