The sky, a bruised purple, bled into the jagged peaks of the Montana Rockies, casting long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted plains.  November had arrived in the Bitterroot Valley with a vengeance, promising an early, brutal winter.  Jed, his calloused hands tucked deep in the pockets of his shearling coat, surveyed his land, a mixture of pride and apprehension swirling within him.  Three generations of Chisholms had bled and toiled on this land, and Jed, the last of his line, felt the weight of that legacy pressing down on him like the heavy, pregnant clouds overhead. The ranch house, a sturdy log structure built by his grandfather, stood nestled against a copse of wind-battered pines, a solitary beacon of warmth and light in the encroaching darkness.  Smoke curled lazily from its chimney, a promise of the hot coffee and crackling fire that awaited him. But something felt amiss tonight. The usual comforting lowing of the cattle was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence that prickled the hairs on the back of Jed's neck.
