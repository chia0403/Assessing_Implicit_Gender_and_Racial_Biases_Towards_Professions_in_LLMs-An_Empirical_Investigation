The neon "EAT" sign of the Desert Rose Diner buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly-sweet glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Amaranth "Amy" Rodriguez, her knuckles white against the worn leather of her Peterbilt's steering wheel, squinted through the downpour.  Mesquite, Nevada, population 1,497 (or so the faded sign at the edge of town claimed), wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, but after twelve hours hauling a double-decker load of frozen pizzas from Reno, even its meager lights felt like a beacon.  The wind howled a mournful tune, whipping tumbleweeds across the highway like skeletal dancers, and the only other sound was the rhythmic thrum of the wipers fighting a losing battle against the deluge.  Amy pulled her rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," into the near-empty lot, the gravel crunching beneath its massive tires. Inside the diner, a lone figure sat hunched over a steaming mug, their face obscured by shadows.  A shiver, unrelated to the cold, ran down Amy's spine.  Something about this place, this night, feltâ€¦off.
