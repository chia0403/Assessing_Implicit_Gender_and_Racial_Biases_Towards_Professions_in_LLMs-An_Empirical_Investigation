The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill outside her classroom, roused Amelia Rose Hawthorne from her grading stupor.  Golden sunlight, thick with the promise of a warm spring day, streamed through the paned glass, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Her kindergarten classroom at Maplewood Elementary, usually a vibrant explosion of finger paint masterpieces and glitter-bombed construction paper creations, was still and quiet. The tiny chairs, each adorned with a child's name painstakingly printed on a colorful name tag, were neatly tucked under their matching tables.  The air, normally buzzing with the chaotic energy of five-year-olds, hummed with a peaceful emptiness.  It was Saturday, and Amelia Rose, despite the beckoning sunshine and chirping robin,  had a mountain of crayon-scribbled assessments to conquer before she could enjoy her weekend.
