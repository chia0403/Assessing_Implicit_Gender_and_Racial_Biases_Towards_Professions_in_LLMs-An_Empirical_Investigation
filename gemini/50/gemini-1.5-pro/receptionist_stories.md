The insistent chirping of the ancient, wall-mounted intercom sliced through the stagnant air of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight that managed to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, illuminating Amelia Grace Holloway perched behind her mahogany reception desk.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the seaside town of Port Blossom, now clung precariously to its faded grandeur.  Salt air, neglect, and the relentless march of time had eroded its gilded edges, leaving behind a melancholy charm appreciated only by those with a penchant for the forgotten.  Amelia, with her perpetually neat bun and a nametag slightly askew, was one such person.  She had a fondness for the chipped porcelain teacups in the deserted tea room, the creaking floorboards that whispered stories of bygone eras, and the stubborn refusal of the wisteria outside to surrender to the encroaching decay.  The intercom chirped again, more insistently this time, dragging Amelia back to the present and the less romantic reality of a Tuesday morning.
