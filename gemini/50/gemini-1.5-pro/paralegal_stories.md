Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Holbrook Building, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  It was 7:18 pm on a Friday, and Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious, albeit notoriously demanding, law firm of Albright, Sterling & Lloyd, was still tethered to her desk, the glow of her monitor reflecting in the deepening puddles on Delaware Avenue below. Philadelphia in November was a city of stark contrasts: the warm, inviting glow of cozy pubs battling the biting wind that whipped off the Delaware River, the historical grandeur of Independence Hall juxtaposed against the sleek, modern skyscrapers clawing at the sky.  Tonight, the city felt less like a historical tapestry and more like a concrete cage. The blinking cursor on her screen mocked her, a relentless reminder of the seemingly endless revisions she needed to make to the Miller vs. Peterson brief, a monstrous document detailing a particularly nasty patent dispute involving robotic milking machines.  The senior partner on the case, Mr. Sterling himself, was expected to fly to Geneva first thing Monday morning to present the finalized brief, and Amelia had a sinking suspicion that "finalized" was a relative term in his lexicon.
