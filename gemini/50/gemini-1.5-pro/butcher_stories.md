It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week at Thorne's Fine Meats, nestled between Mrs. O'Malley's perpetually dusty antique shop and a laundromat that hummed a relentless, off-key tune.

Elias, his hands chapped and raw despite the heavy gloves, stared out at the desolate high street, a single magpie perched on the butcher shop's crooked signpost, its obsidian eye gleaming like a polished jet bead.  The bell above the door chimed, a fragile, almost apologetic sound, breaking the silence and ushering in a chill that had nothing to do with the December air.
