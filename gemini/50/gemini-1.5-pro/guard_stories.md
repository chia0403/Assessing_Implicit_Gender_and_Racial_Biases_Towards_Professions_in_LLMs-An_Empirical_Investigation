The biting wind whipped across the obsidian plains of Xylos, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He pulled his thick, wolf-fur lined hood tighter around his face, the frost clinging to the coarse hairs.  Above him, the twin moons, Aethel and Umbra, cast a stark, ethereal glow upon the jagged peaks of the Shadowfang Mountains, which formed a natural barrier around the Citadel of Whispers.  Elias, a veteran guard of fifteen years, stood at his post atop the western watchtower, the biting cold a familiar companion.  The Citadel itself, a colossal structure of polished black stone, seemed to absorb the moonlight, making it appear more like a void carved into the landscape than a fortress.  Tonight, however, Elias felt a prickling unease he couldn't quite place. The usual symphony of wind whistling through the canyons and the distant howls of ice wolves was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence. It was as if Xylos itself was holding its breath.
