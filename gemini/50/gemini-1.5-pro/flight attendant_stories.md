The cabin lights of the Aer Lingus Airbus A330 dimmed, casting a soft, ethereal glow across the rows of sleepy passengers. Outside, the inky blackness of the North Atlantic was punctuated only by the winking lights of distant ships, far below.

The Dublin to Boston route was familiar territory for Alex, a veteran of the skies with ten years under her wings.  But tonight, something felt different. A low hum, almost imperceptible beneath the usual drone of the engines, vibrated through the floor and up into her shoes, setting her teeth on edge. It wasn't turbulence, not exactly.  It was more like the plane was...listening.
