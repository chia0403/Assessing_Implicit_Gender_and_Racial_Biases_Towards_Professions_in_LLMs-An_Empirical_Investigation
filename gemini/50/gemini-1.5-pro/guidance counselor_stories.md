The fluorescent lights of Ms. Evelyn Reed's office hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack she’d grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as guidance counselor at Ashwood High.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window overlooking the student parking lot, turning the asphalt into a shimmering, oil-slicked mirror.  The aroma of stale coffee and teenage desperation clung to the air – a peculiar perfume Evelyn found both comforting and vaguely unsettling.  It was a Monday in late October, the kind that clung to the cusp of autumn and winter, refusing to commit to either.  The radiators clanked erratically, battling the chill seeping in from the outside, much like Evelyn battled the apathy that threatened to consume her students, one college application and existential crisis at a time.  This particular Monday, however, felt different.  A strange tension crackled in the air, a premonition of something…unsettling.  And it wasn't just the weather.
