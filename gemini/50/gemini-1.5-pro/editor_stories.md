Rain lashed against the arched window of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's attic apartment, mimicking the relentless drumming of her own frustration.  Her tiny apartment, tucked under the eaves of a crumbling brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, usually felt cozy, a writer's haven. Tonight, however, it felt like a cage.

Outside, the East River churned, a restless grey beast mirroring the turmoil in Amy's mind.  She was on deadline for the third anthology of the year, and the lead story, penned by a notoriously temperamental author, was proving to be more trouble than it was worth.  The story, titled "The Obsidian Heart," was a gothic horror piece, dripping with atmosphere but lacking any semblance of a coherent plot.
