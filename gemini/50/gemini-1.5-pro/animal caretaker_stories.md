The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the sprawling, snow-dusted grounds of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains of New York. The frigid air, crisp and clean, stung Amy's lungs, but she welcomed the familiar bite.  It was a scent and sensation synonymous with her life's work – caring for the rescued and rehabilitated animals that called Oakhaven home.  Today, however, a nervous energy buzzed beneath her usual calm.  A new arrival was expected – a young orangutan orphaned by poachers, and Amy, Oakhaven's primate specialist, was both anxious and thrilled to welcome him. The enclosure loomed before her, a multi-tiered structure of wood and mesh designed to mimic the orangutans' natural arboreal habitat, now frosted with a delicate layer of ice.  Inside, the faint glow of heat lamps cast long, dancing shadows, hinting at the sleeping forms within.
