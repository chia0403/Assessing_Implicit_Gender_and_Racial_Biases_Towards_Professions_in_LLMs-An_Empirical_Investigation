The biting wind whipped down Bleecker Street, rattling the frosted panes of Figaro's Barbershop and tugging at the striped awning that proclaimed, in faded gold lettering, "A Cut Above the Rest." Inside, the air was thick with the steamy aroma of sandalwood shaving cream and the low hum of a Billie Holiday record.  Anthony "Tony"  Rossi, Jr., ran a hand over his impeccably slicked-back hair and surveyed his domain.  The checkered tile floor gleamed under the warm glow of the overhead lights, reflecting in the pristine chrome of the barber chairs. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late November, the kind of grey, blustery day that usually kept customers away. Tony, however, had a feeling this particular Tuesday was going to be different.
