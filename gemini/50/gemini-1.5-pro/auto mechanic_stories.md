The biting November wind whipped through the gaping maw of Harold "Harry" Kowalski's garage, sending a flurry of dead leaves dancing across the oil-stained concrete floor.  The garage, "Kowalski's Kustom Kar Kare," was a squat, cinderblock building nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bingo hall on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the clutter of tools, tires, and half-disassembled engines.  Harry, a bear of a man with grease permanently etched into his fingernails and a perpetually worried frown creasing his forehead, was elbow-deep in the guts of a '67 Mustang, its cherry-red paint gleaming in stark contrast to the surrounding grime.  Outside, the sky was the bruised purple of an impending snowstorm, and the only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic clang of Harry's wrench against metal.  He hadn't had a paying customer all day, and the gnawing worry about making next month's rent was beginning to feel like a physical ache in his chest.
