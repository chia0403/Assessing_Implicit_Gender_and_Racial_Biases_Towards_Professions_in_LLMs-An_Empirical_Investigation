The bell above the door to Elderberry Apothecary chimed a melancholic two-note tune as the late afternoon sun, filtered through dusty amber bottles, cast long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Elias Thorne, Ph.D., R.Ph., adjusted his spectacles, the faint scent of lavender and chamomile clinging to his tweed waistcoat.  Elderberry Apothecary was more than just a pharmacy; it was a sanctuary nestled in the heart of Hollow Creek, a small, forgotten town tucked between the misty peaks of the Appalachian Mountains and the whispering secrets of the old-growth forest. Here, time seemed to move at a slower pace, governed by the rhythm of the seasons and the hushed murmur of the creek that gave the town its name.  Elias, with his gentle hands and encyclopedic knowledge of herbal remedies, was more than just a pharmacist; he was the town's confidant, its healer, and the keeper of its many secrets.  And he knew, with a growing unease, that something was about to disrupt the delicate balance of Hollow Creek.
