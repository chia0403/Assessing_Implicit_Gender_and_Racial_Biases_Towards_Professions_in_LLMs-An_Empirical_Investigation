The saw's teeth, dulled by weeks of relentless pine, whined in protest as Elias Thorne wrestled with the thick plank.  The air in his workshop, nestled between the towering redwoods and the churning Pacific, hung thick with the scent of sawdust and sea salt.  Nestled in the heart of Redwood National Park, just outside the tiny, unincorporated town of Orick, California, the workshop was Elias's sanctuary.  A symphony of tools hung neatly on the pegboard wall: chisels gleaming like silver fish, hammers worn smooth with use, and planes whispering promises of smooth surfaces. Outside, the fog, a constant companion in these parts, draped over the redwood canopy, muting the usual cacophony of the forest. This morning, however, a different kind of silence held sway, a stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of Elias’s neck and spoke of something… unsettling.
