The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he perched precariously on the top rung of his ladder, the rusted fire escape groaning beneath his weight.  Above him, a flickering neon sign advertising "Stella's Diner" sputtered intermittently, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Chinatown, Manhattan, was a hive of activity even at this late hour, the air thick with the scent of exhaust fumes, frying dumplings, and something vaguely floral Elias couldn't quite place. He tightened his grip on his toolbox, the cold metal a stark contrast to the buzzing anxiety that crackled beneath his worn leather gloves. This wasn't just a faulty transformer; Stella, the diner's owner and the woman who made the meanest black coffee this side of the Hudson, had sworn she'd seen the sign *blink* in Morse code.  And Elias, despite his practical nature, had a nagging feeling that something more than faulty wiring was at play.
