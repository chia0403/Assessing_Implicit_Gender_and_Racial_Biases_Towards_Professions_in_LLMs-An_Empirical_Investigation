The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her rented cottage, the Isle of Skye's dramatic landscape spread before her like a rumpled velvet cloak.  Jagged peaks clawed at the bruised sky, while the slate-grey sea churned relentlessly against the rocky shore far below.  The cottage, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the Sound of Sleat, was a far cry from the bustling London streets Amelia usually called home. She'd come seeking solitude, a place where the whispers of her next novel might finally find a voice louder than the city's roar.  The wind, a constant, keening presence on the island, whipped through her auburn hair, carrying the scent of brine and peat. Inside, a half-written manuscript lay open on the worn wooden table, the words blurring in the fading light, a mirror of the uncertainty swirling in Amelia's mind.
