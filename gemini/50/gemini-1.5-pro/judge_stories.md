This wasn't the familiar anxiety that preceded a difficult sentencing or a complex case. This was a visceral dread, a premonition of something far more personal and far more dangerous, lurking just beyond the flickering gaslight.  The anonymous letter, crisp and white against the dark wood, lay before her, its typed words burning into her memory: *“Justice is blind, they say.
