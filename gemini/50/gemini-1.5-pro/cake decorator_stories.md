The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually saccharine atmosphere of Buttercream Dreams.  Rain lashed against the bakery's large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy pink smear.  Inside, Eloise Clementine Beauregard, her apron smeared with buttercream roses and a streak of emerald green food coloring across her cheek, stared in horrified fascination at the blackened remains of what was supposed to be a three-tiered masterpiece for the mayor's inauguration gala.  The kitchen, usually a symphony of whirring mixers and the gentle clinking of spatulas, was eerily silent. Even the normally boisterous radio, perched precariously on a stack of cookbooks, seemed to have lost its voice. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within Eloise. This was not how she envisioned her week beginning, not at all.  Buttercream Dreams, nestled in the heart of the quaint seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, was her sanctuary, her haven, her everything. And now, just hours before the biggest event of the year, her sanctuary was on fire, metaphorically speaking, of course.  The actual fire had been extinguished promptly, thanks to the overly enthusiastic, if somewhat clumsy, efforts of volunteer fireman, and Eloise's secret crush, Finnigan O'Malley.
