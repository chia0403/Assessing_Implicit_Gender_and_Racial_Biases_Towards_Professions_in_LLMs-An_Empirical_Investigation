The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of stale popcorn and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, bundled in a wool coat that had seen better decades, hurried along Michigan Avenue, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  The neon glow of the Magnificent Mile, usually a source of festive cheer, tonight felt cold and indifferent.  Eleanor clutched her worn leather handbag tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  It was December 23rd, and inside that handbag was the equivalent of three weeks' rent – cash she desperately needed to keep the heat on in her tiny apartment above Mrs. O’Malley’s bakery.  It was also the exact amount she’d just spent bailing her ne'er-do-well brother, Leo, out of jail. Again.  The gargoyle perched atop the gothic Revival architecture of the Chicago Cultural Center seemed to sneer at her predicament.  Eleanor stopped beneath it, the wind tearing at the loose strands of her dark hair, and stared up at the grotesque stone face. "Well, Leo," she muttered to the unjudging gargoyle, "Christmas just got a whole lot less merry."
