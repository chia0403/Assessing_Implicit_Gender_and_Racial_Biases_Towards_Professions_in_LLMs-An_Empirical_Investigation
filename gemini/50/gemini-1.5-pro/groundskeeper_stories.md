The biting November wind whistled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive, tearing at Elias Thorne's thick tweed jacket as he made his rounds.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots, the sound oddly satisfying against the otherwise hushed quiet of the sprawling Averell Estate. Elias, his weathered face framed by a salt-and-pepper beard, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye.  The formal gardens, once a riot of colour, now lay dormant beneath a thin blanket of frost, their intricate patterns barely visible. Beyond them, the vast, rolling lawns stretched towards the imposing grey stone mansion, its many windows glinting like dark eyes in the pale morning light.  A thick fog, the breath of the nearby river Avon, clung to the ground, giving the estate an ethereal, almost otherworldly feel.  This morning, however, the stillness of Averell was deceptive. Elias could feel it in the icy air, in the unsettling rustle of the dried leaves â€“ something was different.
