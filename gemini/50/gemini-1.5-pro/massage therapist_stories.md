The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the relentless Seattle drizzle drumming against the large bay window.  Eliza Jane Cartwright adjusted the thermostat a fraction of a degree warmer, her fingers lingering on the dial.  Her clinic, "Knot Another Day," nestled between a bustling Vietnamese pho restaurant and a perpetually empty storefront that promised the imminent arrival of a bespoke dog bakery, was her sanctuary.  This Thursday morning, however, the usual tranquility felt strained, a tight knot mirroring those she so expertly unraveled in her clients.  Eliza Jane glanced at the appointment book, the pristine white page marred only by a single entry: 10:00 AM â€“  "Mr. Silas Blackwood - Deep Tissue."  A new client. And something about his name, the stark contrast of Silas and Blackwood, sent a shiver down her spine, a premonition as persistent as the damp chill clinging to the city.
