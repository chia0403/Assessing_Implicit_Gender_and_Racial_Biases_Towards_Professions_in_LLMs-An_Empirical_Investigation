The stifling Roman sun beat down on Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's straw hat, the brim casting a welcome shadow across her freckled nose.  A cicada buzzed insistently from a nearby cypress tree, its song a relentless soundtrack to the midday heat. The Piazza della Rotonda, usually bustling with tourists, was momentarily quiet. Izzy, her hands resting on the cool, smooth marble of the Fontana dei Tartaruche, watched as the last stragglers from her morning tour disappeared into a nearby gelateria, seeking refuge from the August scorcher. The Pantheon, a majestic temple to all gods, loomed behind her, its immense dome a testament to Roman ingenuity.  The air, thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and frying artichokes, hung heavy. This was Izzy's Rome, a city of ancient wonders and modern chaos, a place she knew like the back of her hand, a place that held both the familiar comfort of home and the constant allure of discovery.
