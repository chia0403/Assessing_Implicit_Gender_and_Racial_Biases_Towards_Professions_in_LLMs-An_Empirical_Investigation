The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's Hospital parking lot.  Fluorescent lights buzzed behind the grimy windows of the Emergency Department, casting a sickly yellow glow onto the swirling snow.  Elias tugged his threadbare scarf tighter, the icy air burning his exposed skin.  Tonight, his shift started at 7pm, just as the first real blizzard of the season decided to unleash its fury upon the small, perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Maine. He knew it was going to be a long one. The overflowing waiting room, the constant ringing of phones, the hushed urgency permeating every corner of the ER â€“ it was a familiar symphony of chaos that Elias, a seasoned Physician's Assistant, had come to both dread and respect.  He pushed through the heavy double doors, the blast of warm, antiseptic-laced air a stark contrast to the frozen world outside. The controlled chaos of the ER immediately enveloped him, and with a deep sigh, Elias braced himself for the night ahead.
