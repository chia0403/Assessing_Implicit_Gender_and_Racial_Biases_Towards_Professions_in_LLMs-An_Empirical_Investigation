The salt spray stung Elsie Aurelia Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the black volcanic rocks, her tripod wobbling in the wind.  The sky above the churning Atlantic was a bruised purple, the last vestiges of sunset clinging to the horizon.  A storm was brewing off the coast of Heimaey, the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, and Elsie intended to capture its raw, untamed beauty.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something faintly volcanic, vibrated with an almost palpable energy.  Heimaey, scarred but not broken by the 1973 eruption of Eldfell, held a stark, otherworldly beauty that Elsie, in her decade-long career, had rarely encountered.  This was a landscape that demanded to be documented, a story whispering to be told through the lens.
