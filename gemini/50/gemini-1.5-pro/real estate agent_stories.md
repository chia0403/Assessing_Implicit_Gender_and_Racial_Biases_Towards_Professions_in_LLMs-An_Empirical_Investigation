The biting November wind whipped Ophelia Iris Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she fumbled with the lockbox on the wrought-iron gate.  Frost crunched under her sensible heels, the sound swallowed by the rustle of dead leaves skittering across the overgrown flagstone path.  Number 13 Blackwood Lane hunched before her, a Victorian mansion choked by ivy and shadowed by gnarled oak trees.  It had been vacant for over a decade, a gothic behemoth looming over the otherwise pristine, manicured lawns of the exclusive Oakhaven Estates. Ophelia, ever the optimist, even in the face of the property's morbid grandeur, saw not decay, but potential.  This house, she believed, could be her biggest sale yet, the one that finally cemented her place among the real estate elite of Ashton.  The key clicked, the lockbox sprang open, and Ophelia pushed through the groaning gate, the scent of damp earth and something indefinably… colder… clinging to the air.
