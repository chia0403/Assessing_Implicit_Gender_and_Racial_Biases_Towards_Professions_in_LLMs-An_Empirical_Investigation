The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Reyes's dark braid across her face, momentarily obscuring the view of the half-finished lighthouse mural she was painting on the side of O'Malley's Pub.  The tiny, fog-shrouded island of Aisling, nestled off the coast of Maine, was her haven, her escape, and the only place where the vibrant colours in her head finally found their way onto canvas â€“ or, in this case, weather-beaten clapboard.  October had arrived, painting the distant, rolling hills in shades of rusty orange and deep crimson, a stark contrast to the ever-present grey of the sea and sky. The air held a chill that promised the coming winter, the kind that burrowed deep into your bones and stayed there, just like the secrets held by the island's close-knit community. Amelia dipped her brush into a pot of vibrant turquoise, the colour of the sea on a rare, clear summer's day, a memory she clung to as the days grew shorter and darker.
