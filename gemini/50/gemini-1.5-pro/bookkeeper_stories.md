Bartholomew Ernest Quill, meticulously dressed in a tweed suit and bow tie despite the late hour, sat hunched over a ledger, the green-shaded banker's lamp casting a sickly yellow glow over the columns of figures. His office, tucked away in a dusty corner of the Grimshaw and Sons textile mill, was a testament to his ordered life:  perfectly sharpened pencils lined up in a brass holder, ink bottles gleaming like jewels, and stacks of ledgers bound in leather, each labeled with precise calligraphy. Outside, the mill itself was silent, the clatter of looms and the hiss of steam having ceased hours ago.  The only other signs of life were the flickering gas lamps in the cobbled courtyard below, barely visible through the rain-streaked glass, and the rhythmic thud of the night watchman's boots on the wooden walkway.  Tonight, however, something was amiss.  A single figure remained in the courtyard, a figure Bartholomew couldn't quite make out through the downpour, a figure that seemed to beâ€¦ waiting.
