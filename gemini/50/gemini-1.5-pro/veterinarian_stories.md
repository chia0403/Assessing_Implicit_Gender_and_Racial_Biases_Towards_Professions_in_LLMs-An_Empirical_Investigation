The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's veterinary clinic. Snow, driven sideways, piled against the weathered clapboard walls, obscuring the hand-painted sign that proclaimed "Vance Veterinary Care – All Creatures Great and Small." Inside, the clinic was a comforting haven of warm lamplight and the faint scent of antiseptic. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, knelt beside a shivering Labrador puppy, a stethoscope pressed to its tiny chest. The radio, tuned to a crackling country station, was the only other sound in the otherwise silent Sunday evening.  Beyond the clinic’s windows, the vast emptiness of the high plains stretched towards the horizon, a stark and unforgiving landscape that tested the resilience of both animals and the people who cared for them.  This evening, however, the impending blizzard promised a test unlike any Eleanor had faced before.
