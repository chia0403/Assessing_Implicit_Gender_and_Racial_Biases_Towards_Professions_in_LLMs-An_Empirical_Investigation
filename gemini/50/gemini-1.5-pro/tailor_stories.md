His small shop, nestled above a bustling bakery in the heart of Port Blossom, a city perpetually draped in a sea-salty mist, was rarely this cluttered.  But the upcoming Seafarer's Festival demanded extravagance, and Elias, the most sought-after tailor in Port Blossom, was drowning in commissions.  A half-finished admiral's coat lay draped over a dress form, its intricate gold braid gleaming in the light, while a pile of vibrant silks destined for a dancer's skirt overflowed from a wicker basket. The air, thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint sweetness of the bakery below, hummed with the quiet industry of Eliasâ€™s nimble fingers and the rhythmic whir of his treadle sewing machine.
