Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings building, blurring the already fading cityscape of Chicago into a hazy watercolour. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of servers, a constant counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst with a penchant for cardigan sweaters and a talent for untangling digital knots, tapped a precise rhythm on her keyboard, her brow furrowed in concentration. The clock on her monitor blinked 3:17 AM, a cruel reminder of the hours bleeding into one another.  Zephyrâ€™s internal network, the backbone of their multi-million dollar trading platform, had been behaving erratically for days, spitting out cryptic error messages like a malfunctioning oracle.  Tonight, Eleanor was determined to decipher its cryptic pronouncements, even if it meant sacrificing sleep, sanity, and any semblance of a social life. The flickering fluorescent lights above cast long, distorted shadows across the deserted office, giving the sprawling space a distinctly unsettling vibe.  Just beyond the pool of light cast by her monitor, a shadow seemed to shift, deeper and more solid than the rest.  Eleanor paused, holding her breath, the rhythmic tapping of the keyboard replaced by the insistent drumming of the rain.
