The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford. Gargoyles leered down from the medieval stonework, their grimaces seemingly amplified by the swirling mist that clung to the ancient buildings.  Frost crunched under his worn leather shoes, the sound swallowed by the looming silence of the early morning.  Alistair clutched a battered briefcase containing the manuscript he'd been labouring over for the past five years – a radical reinterpretation of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales – and a knot of anxiety tightened in his stomach. Today was the day he was to present his findings to the notoriously critical faculty board, a prospect that even after twenty years at St. Jude's, still filled him with a profound sense of unease. The looming clock tower of the Bodleian Library chimed six times, each clang echoing the relentless march of time, and Alistair quickened his pace.  He had a feeling this day would change everything.
