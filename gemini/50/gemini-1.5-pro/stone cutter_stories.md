The wind, sharp as a freshly honed chisel, whipped across the Treacherous Peaks, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his thick woolen coat, the flakes of an early winter snow clinging to the coarse fabric. Below him, nestled in the craggy embrace of the mountains, lay the village of Hollowstone, its slate-roofed houses huddled together like a flock of sheep seeking shelter from the coming storm. Smoke, the color of woodsmoke and memory, curled lazily from their chimneys, a stark contrast to the jagged, unforgiving landscape that surrounded them.  Elias, his calloused hands tucked deep in his pockets, adjusted the leather strap that held his tools – hammers, chisels, and a measuring rod worn smooth with years of use – across his back.  He’d been working on the Laird's new mausoleum, high on the windswept plateau, and the descending sun signaled the end of another day spent shaping the cold, unyielding stone into something… more. Something that would speak of the Laird’s life, long after the man himself was dust.  He began his descent, each step a careful negotiation with the treacherous, ice-slicked path, his gaze fixed on the warm, inviting glow emanating from the Widow O’Malley’s tavern, a beacon promising refuge from the encroaching night.
