Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Golden Dragon Chinese takeaway, blurring the neon script into a shimmering, illegible mess. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale grease and day-old noodles.  Eleanor Vance Cartwright, star saleswoman for "Premium Plastics of Peterborough,"  tapped a perfectly manicured nail against her chipped Formica tabletop, impatiently waiting.  Her crisp, navy suit felt starkly out of place amidst the peeling wallpaper and sticky residue of countless spilled sweet-and-sour sauces.  Eleanor had driven for two hours, braving the treacherous November downpour and navigating the labyrinthine backstreets of Grimsby, all for this meeting.  Mr. Zhao, the takeaway's owner, represented a potential goldmine â€“ a massive contract for disposable cutlery, and Eleanor wasn't about to let a little rain, or a lot of grease, stand in her way.
