Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia "Milly" Cartwright's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight cityscape of Chicago.  The wind howled, a mournful symphony echoing the turmoil churning inside her.  Milly, the newly appointed Chief Operating Officer of Winslow-Davies Pharmaceuticals, tapped a manicured nail against the mahogany desk, a rhythmic counterpoint to the storm.  Scattered across the polished surface lay the remnants of a twelve-hour workday:  cold, congealed coffee in a Winslow-Davies branded mug, a half-eaten protein bar, and a stack of reports thicker than a Chicago phone book.  The city lights, usually a vibrant tapestry woven against the inky sky, were obscured by the downpour, leaving Milly with the unsettling feeling of being suspended in a dark, watery void.  Tonight, the storm mirrored her own inner tempest;  she had just uncovered something rotten at the heart of Winslow-Davies, and the implications were staggering.
