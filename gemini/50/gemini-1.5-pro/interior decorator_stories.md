The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Millie" Rose Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant sample case out of the back of her vintage cream-colored Vespa.  Flakes of snow, the first of the season, began to dust the cobbled streets of Georgetown, clinging to the wrought-iron railings of the elegant townhouses that lined the block. Millie, clad in a stylish but practical tweed coat and knee-high leather boots, adjusted her oversized spectacles and surveyed the scene.  Number 14, her destination, was a stately Federal-style building, its brick façade the color of burnt caramel.  A brass plaque beside the imposing mahogany door proclaimed it the residence of Senator Theodore Cartwright.  Millie, a rising star in the D.C. interior design scene, had landed the coveted contract to revamp the Senator's drawing-room, a project that could make or break her fledgling career.  The pressure was immense, but Millie thrived on it.  This wasn’t just about picking fabrics and choosing paint colors; it was about creating a space that exuded power, sophistication, and a subtle hint of Southern charm, a nod to the Senator's Virginia roots.  This room would be her masterpiece.
