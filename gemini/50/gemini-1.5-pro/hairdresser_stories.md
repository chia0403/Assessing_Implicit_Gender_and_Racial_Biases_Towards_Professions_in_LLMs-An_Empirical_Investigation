The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Radiance" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue rinse was so potent it could likely strip paint.  Elara Juniper Finch, the salon's owner and sole stylist, sighed inwardly.  Mrs. Henderson and her exacting demands about the precise shade of "periwinkle" were the bane of Elara's otherwise peaceful existence in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Outside, the fog hung thick and heavy, clinging to the brightly painted clapboard houses that lined Main Street, muffling the usual sounds of the fishing boats returning to harbour.  Inside, the salon was warm and inviting, smelling of coconut shampoo and Elara's signature blend of essential oils, a fragrance designed to evoke calm and serenity - a stark contrast to the storm brewing in Mrs. Henderson's piercing blue eyes.
