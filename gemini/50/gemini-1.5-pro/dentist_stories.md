The insistent Rhode Island drizzle seemed determined to seep through even Dr. Elias Thorne's meticulously waxed Barbour jacket as he hurried across Benefit Street.  Gas lamps flickered, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cobbled stones, reflecting in the puddles like molten gold. Providence, usually so charming with its colonial architecture and air of academic quiet, felt oppressive tonight. A thick fog, clinging to the narrow streets, swallowed the sounds of the city, leaving only the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eliasâ€™s polished brogues and the distant, mournful clang of a buoy in the harbor. He tugged his collar higher, the damp chill seeping into his bones despite the brisk October air.  The ornate wrought-iron gate of the John Brown House Museum loomed ahead, its shadowed bulk more menacing than majestic in the gloom. Elias, his briefcase clutched tight, hesitated. He wasn't sure why Mrs. Cavendish had insisted on meeting him here, at this hour, and on this particularly dreary evening.  His expertise lay in root canals and dental implants, not the mysteries of 18th-century Providence.
