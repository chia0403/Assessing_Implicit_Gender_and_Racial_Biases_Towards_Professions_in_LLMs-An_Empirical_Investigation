The scent of aging paper and lemon polish clung to the air in the hushed sanctuary of the Abernathy Library, a two-story Victorian building tucked away on a leafy street in Hollow Creek, Vermont.  Rain hammered against the tall, arched windows, blurring the view of the already fading autumnal landscape. Inside, amidst towering oak shelves laden with books, Eleanor Ainsworth Peabody, the head librarian, meticulously straightened a slightly askew copy of "A History of Beekeeping in the Green Mountains."  Her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, magnifying the slight frown line etched between her brows. The library was almost empty at this late hour, only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the persistent drumming of the rain disturbing the silence.  Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ five minutes to closing.  She sighed, a puff of air ruffling the wisps of grey hair that had escaped her tight bun.  Tonight, like most nights, she dreaded locking the doors and leaving the comforting embrace of her literary domain.  Little did she know, this night would be different. Very different.
