The pre-dawn sky over Portland, Oregon, bled from inky black to a bruised purple, the same color as the veins Eliza Jane Holloway expertly sought each morning. Rain, a Portland staple, lashed against the windows of the Good Samaritan Hospital phlebotomy lab, a rhythmic percussion against the otherwise silent room.  Eliza, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white coat, hummed softly to herself as she organized her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, alcohol swabs, butterfly needles, all laid out with a precision born from years of practice. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, clinical glow on the stainless steel surfaces. Outside, the city was slowly waking, oblivious to the small, vital role Eliza played in the intricate dance of life and death unfolding within the hospital walls. Today, however, the routine was about to be broken. A faint tremor, barely perceptible, ran through the building, causing the vials on Eliza's tray to clink together.  She paused, a prickle of unease rising in her chest.  It wasn't the earthquake-prone Pacific Northwest that worried her. It was the strange, metallic scent that suddenly filled the air, like pennies and ozone.
