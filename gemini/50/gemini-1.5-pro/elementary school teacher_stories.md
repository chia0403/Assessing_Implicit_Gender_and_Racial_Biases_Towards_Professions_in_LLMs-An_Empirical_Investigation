The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she hurried across the playground of Maplewood Elementary.  A flock of chattering fourth-graders, bundled in brightly colored jackets, swirled around her like autumn leaves caught in a gust of wind.  Maplewood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy Vermont town of Havenwood, was a picture of quintessential New England charm.  The two-story brick building, its ivy-covered walls ablaze with crimson and gold, sat back from the road, surrounded by towering maple trees that lived up to the town's name.  Beyond the playground, a patchwork quilt of fields and forests stretched towards the hazy outline of the Green Mountains in the distance.  This morning, however, Ameliaâ€™s usual appreciation for the idyllic setting was overshadowed by a knot of unease in her stomach. A new student was arriving today, a transfer from a school in the city, and Amelia, ever the worrier, fretted over whether the child would settle in okay.
