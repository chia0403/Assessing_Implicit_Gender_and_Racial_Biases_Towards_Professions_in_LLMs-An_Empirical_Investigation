The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the restless shuffling of students packing up their belongings. Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the already fading October light into a grey soup.  Westbrook High, a gothic behemoth perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Port Blossom, Maine, seemed to sigh with the wind, its ancient pipes groaning in protest against the encroaching cold. Elias, a tall man with kind eyes and a perpetually rumpled tweed jacket, watched the exodus with a weary smile.  He loved these kids, even the ones who carved their initials into the antique desks he'd painstakingly refinished over the summer.  He loved the crisp autumn air, the smell of salt and pine that permeated even this landlocked town, and the way the fog rolled in off the sea, shrouding everything in a mysterious beauty. But today, a deep unease settled in his bones, a feeling as cold and persistent as the rain itself.
