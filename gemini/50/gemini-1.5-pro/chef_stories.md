Inside, the warm glow of Edison bulbs spilled onto mismatched vintage chairs and tables handcrafted from reclaimed wood, promising a cozy haven from the blustery evening. But tonight, the usual pre-service tranquility was replaced with a simmering tension, a palpable unease that hung heavier than the scent of woodsmoke drifting in from the nearby food carts.
