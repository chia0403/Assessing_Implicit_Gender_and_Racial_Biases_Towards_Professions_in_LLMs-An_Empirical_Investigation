The biting wind whipped across the vast expanse of the Knik Glacier, stinging Rosalind "Roz" Murphy's cheeks even through the layers of thermal fleece she wore beneath her hard hat. The Alaskan sky, usually a brilliant, crystalline blue, was choked with a bruised purple, promising another early winter snowfall.  Roz, perched high in the cab of her D11 dozer, squinted at the survey markers staked out across the glacial moraine.  Her breath fogged the glass, momentarily obscuring the treacherous landscape of ice and scree she was tasked with leveling. This wasn't highway construction; this was carving a path through the raw, unforgiving heart of Alaska for the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline expansion, and a wrong move could mean a tumble into a crevasse deeper than any plumb line could measure.  The radio crackled to life, a disembodied voice cutting through the roar of the dozer's engine. "Murphy, you read me? We've got a shift in the ice flow.  Need you to reposition marker seven. Over."  Roz gripped the controls, a shiver of unease running down her spine.  A shift in the ice flow could mean anything from a minor inconvenience to a catastrophic disaster. This was Alaska, after all, where nature held the trump card.
