The air in "Shear Perfection," Genevieve Beaumont's salon, hung thick with the scent of hairspray, coconut oil, and ambition.  Located on a sun-drenched corner in the Art Deco district of Miami Beach, the salon buzzed with the low hum of dryers and the rhythmic snip of Genevieve's shears.  Palm trees swayed outside the large, arched windows, their shadows dancing across the gleaming white tile floor.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically slow, but today a nervous energy vibrated in the air. Genevieve, a woman whose sculpted cheekbones and perfectly winged eyeliner could cut as sharply as her shears, felt it too. This wasn't just another Tuesday. Today, a renowned fashion photographer was due to arrive for a consultation, a consultation that could catapult Genevieve and her tiny salon into the stratosphere of Miami's elite beauty scene.
