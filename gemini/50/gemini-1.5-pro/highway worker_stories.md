The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, stinging Elias Vance's cheeks even through the layers of thermal underwear and fleece.  The pre-dawn sky, a bruised purple bleeding into charcoal grey, offered no warmth.  Around him, the Nevada desert unfolded in a panorama of scrub brush and rust-colored rock formations, silent and still save for the occasional mournful whistle of the wind.  Elias, perched precariously on the edge of the asphalt, tightened his grip on the jackhammer, the vibrations a dull thrumming against his gloved hands. The flashing orange lights of his work truck cast long, dancing shadows that exaggerated the cracks and crevices in the road surface he was about to demolish.  This stretch of highway, notorious for developing potholes the size of small craters, was Elias's domain. He knew every dip, every fissure, every treacherous patch of crumbling asphalt. Today, he was tasked with a particularly nasty section, one that had claimed more than its fair share of tires and hubcaps. The air smelled of creosote and cold dust, the familiar scent of his trade.  He flipped the visor of his hardhat down, the beam of his headlamp cutting a small, bright swathe through the gloom, and braced himself.  It was going to be a long day.
