The wind, sharp and smelling of coming snow, whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Abernathy Farm.  Crimson and gold leaves clung desperately to the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that marked the propertyâ€™s western border.  Beneath it, Elias Thatcher, his weathered face lined like a forgotten map, surveyed his domain.  The pumpkins, fat and orange, lay scattered like forgotten jewels amongst the withered corn stalks, their season of glory waning.  Abernathy Farm, nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, had been in the Thatcher family for five generations, passed down from father to son like a cherished heirloom.  This year, however, the harvest had been meager, and the first touch of winter in the air felt less like a promise of rest and more like a looming threat.
