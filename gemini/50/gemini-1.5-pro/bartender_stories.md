The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez knew by heart.  It was a lullaby in this forgotten corner of Port Blossom, Oregon, a town where the fog clung to the salt-laced air like a forgotten dream. Inside, the only light came from the flickering neon sign above the bar and the warm glow of the Edison bulbs strung haphazardly across the low, wood-beamed ceiling. Mia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped the already spotless mahogany bartop with a practiced hand, the faint scent of lemon and pine cleaner mixing with the ever-present aroma of stale beer and regret. Tonight, like most nights, The Rusty Mug was a haven for the town's lost souls – fishermen with stories etched onto their weather-beaten faces, truckers hauling their burdens across endless highways, and the occasional tourist who’d taken a wrong turn and ended up in this melancholic pocket of the Pacific Northwest.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful cry that seemed to echo the unspoken secrets held within the dimly lit confines of the bar.
