The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones filtered through the dusty attic window, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whir of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's treadle sewing machine.  Her workshop, tucked away beneath the eaves of a grand, if slightly dilapidated, building on Rue de l'Aiguille in 1888 Paris, was a haven of colour and texture.  Rolls of silk and satin, cascades of lace and velvet, spilled from overflowing baskets, vying for space with half-finished gowns draped on dressmaker's dummies.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax and lavender, held the faintest whisper of coal smoke from the chimneys that crowded the Parisian skyline visible through the dormer window.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping her bun, hummed along to a forgotten melody as she meticulously stitched a row of pearl buttons onto a bodice the colour of a summer sky.  This was her world, a world of shimmering fabrics, intricate designs, and the quiet satisfaction of transforming ordinary cloth into breathtaking works of art.
