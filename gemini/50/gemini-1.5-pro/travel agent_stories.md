The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere within the overflowing hibiscus bush outside her window, was the soundtrack to Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's Tuesday morning.  The humid air, thick and sweet with the scent of frangipani, drifted through the open shutters of her tiny office, clinging to the brightly coloured brochures that plastered every available surface.  Her office, squeezed between a laundromat and a shop selling knock-off designer handbags, was located on Calle del Sol, the vibrant, bustling heart of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mia, dressed in a crisp linen shirt despite the heat, tapped a manicured nail against her keyboard, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the gecko's song. She was desperately trying to book a last-minute honeymoon to Bora Bora for a bridezilla whose demands included a private beach, a personal chef specializing in vegan sushi, and a shaman to bless their union under a double rainbow.  Outside, the cacophony of San Juan life swirled - the rumble of ancient buses, the hawkers' calls, and the rhythmic pulse of salsa music leaking from a nearby bar. It was a world away from the tranquil turquoise waters and overwater bungalows Mia was currently conjuring on her screen.
