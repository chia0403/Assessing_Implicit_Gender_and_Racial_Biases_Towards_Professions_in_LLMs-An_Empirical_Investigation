The chipped porcelain mermaid on Beatrice Agatha Grimshaw's desk stared blankly at the swirling snow outside.  February in Omaha, Nebraska was a cruel mistress, painting the world in shades of grey and white, and promising nothing but frozen pipes and fender benders. Beatrice, bundled in a moth-eaten cardigan despite the blast of heat wheezing from the vent beneath her desk, tapped a chipped crimson nail against a stack of claim forms.  Her office, tucked between a laundromat that perpetually smelled of scorched fabric and a pawn shop displaying a disconcerting array of electric guitars, wasn't glamorous. But it was hers. Grimshaw Insurance had been in her family for three generations, a legacy built on the unlikely bedrock of Midwestern practicality and the occasional tornado. This morning, however, Beatrice felt the weight of that legacy pressing down on her like the heavy, snow-laden sky above. The scent of stale coffee hung in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of fear. Something told her this wasn't going to be a typical Tuesday.
