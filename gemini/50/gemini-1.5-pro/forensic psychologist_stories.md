Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's Victorian home, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The rhythmic drumming on the glass usually soothed him, a familiar lullaby in the isolated, windswept town of Port Blossom, Maine. Tonight, however, it only amplified the gnawing unease in his gut. The salt-laced air, usually a welcome balm, felt thick and oppressive, heavy with the unspoken secrets of the small coastal community.  Elias, a forensic psychologist renowned for his ability to decipher the darkest corners of the human mind, found his own thoughts swirling in a disquieting fog. A phone call, barely an hour ago, had shattered the fragile peace he’d meticulously constructed around himself.  Sheriff Brody, his voice strained with a mixture of fear and bewilderment, had spoken of a ritualistic murder unlike anything Port Blossom, or perhaps even Maine, had ever seen.  The victim, a prominent local fisherman, had been found posed beneath the ominous shadow of Widow’s Point lighthouse, his body a macabre canvas of symbols Elias knew instinctively spoke of something far older, and far more sinister, than a simple homicide.
