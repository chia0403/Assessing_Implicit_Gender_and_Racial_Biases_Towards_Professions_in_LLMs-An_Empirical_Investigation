The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Carter's life.  It was a Tuesday in late November, and the Cleveland sky outside was a bruised purple, mirroring the shadows under Amelia's eyes.  Rain lashed against the large windows of the drafting room, blurring the city lights into hazy orbs.  Amelia, hunched over her light table, traced the intricate lines of a proposed condominium complex with a steady hand.  The scent of stale coffee and blueprint ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this space where she spent more hours than in her own tiny apartment. The room was a hive of quiet industry, each draftsperson illuminated by the cool glow of their lamps, a constellation of focused concentration in the vast, echoing office.  The only other sound besides the rain and the humming lights was the rhythmic scratch of pencils on vellum, a sound Amelia found strangely soothing.  This was her world, a world of precise lines, exacting measurements, and the quiet satisfaction of bringing imagined structures to life on paper. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease, a sense of waiting, hung in the air like the lingering scent of the storm.
