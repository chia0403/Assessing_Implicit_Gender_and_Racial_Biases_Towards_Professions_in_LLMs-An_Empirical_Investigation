The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Sterling law offices buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a paralegal.  It was 7:17 pm on a Tuesday, the kind of late November evening in Chicago that smelled of wet concrete and the ghostly remnants of someone's discarded hotdog.  Outside, a sleety rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the Chicago River, turning the city lights into blurry halos.  Amelia, hunched over a mountain of discovery documents related to a particularly nasty patent infringement case, rubbed the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to her fingertips.  The office, usually a hive of activity, was eerily silent, save for the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her keyboard and the low hum of the refrigerator in the break room.  She was alone, or so she thought.
