The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, a symphony of polished marble, cascading crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of affluent guests.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside  Genevieve "Gen" Dubois.

Tonight, the air crackled with a tension Gen couldn't quite place, a prickle beneath her impeccably tailored jacket.  She adjusted the pearl earrings, a gift from her grandmother, and forced a welcoming smile, ready to navigate the whims of the wealthy and the weary.  Little did she know, this particular Tuesday would usher in a mystery that would test her resourcefulness, her loyalty, and her very sanity.
