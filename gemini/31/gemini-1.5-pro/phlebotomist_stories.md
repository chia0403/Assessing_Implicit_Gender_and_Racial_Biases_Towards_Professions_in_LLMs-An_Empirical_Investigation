The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist.  The pre-dawn chill still clung to the air in the outpatient lab, despite the weak November sun attempting to pierce through the smog-stained windows overlooking downtown Los Angeles. Amelia, bundled in her burgundy cardigan over her crisp white uniform, adjusted the lavender nitrile gloves snugly over her hands. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the low murmur of anxious patients shuffling in the waiting area. Today, like every other Tuesday, started with the early bird appointments, mostly elderly folks needing routine blood work. Amelia prepared her tray – tourniquets, needles, vials, alcohol swabs – a ritual she performed with practiced efficiency, her mind already anticipating the delicate dance of finding the perfect vein.  But this Tuesday, the quiet hum of the lab held a different tension, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that pricked at the back of Amelia’s neck.
