The flickering neon sign of "Shear Serenity," a haven tucked between a laundromat and a twenty-four-hour donut shop in downtown Portland, buzzed intermittently, casting an eerie green glow on the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside,  Eliza Jane Dubois, cosmetologist and proprietor, wiped down her station with a lavender-scented disinfectant, the pungent aroma a stark contrast to the metallic tang of the impending storm.  It was a Tuesday night, normally slow, but Eliza had a feeling in her gut, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the approaching weather. The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, a regular whose weekly perm was processing under a crackling dryer, her face hidden behind a copy of "Modern Romance."  Rain hammered against the large front window, and a sudden gust of wind rattled the glass, making Eliza jump.  Something was definitely off.
