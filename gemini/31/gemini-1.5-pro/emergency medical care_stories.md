The siren screamed, a banshee wail slicing through the humid Charleston night. Rain slicked the cobblestone streets of the historic French Quarter, reflecting the flashing blue and red lights of the ambulance like shattered jewels.  Inside, Amelia Grace “Amy” Rousseau braced herself against the lurching vehicle as it navigated a hairpin turn, her stomach churning with a familiar blend of adrenaline and apprehension.  The dispatcher’s clipped voice echoed in her ears: “Possible GSW, victim unconscious, location: Waterfront Park, near the Pineapple Fountain.”  Amy adjusted the strap of her bag, the weight of her medical kit a comforting presence against her hip. The air in the ambulance crackled with unspoken tension, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor beside her. Tonight, the beauty of Charleston was a backdrop to another unfolding tragedy, and Amy, as always, was racing towards it.
