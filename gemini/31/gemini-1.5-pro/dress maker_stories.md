The biting November wind whipped around Genevieve "Vivi" Dupres, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the hem of her charcoal grey wool coat.  She hurried along Rue de l'Aiguille, the cobblestones slick with a mixture of rain and sleet, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts thick in the air.  Above her, gas lamps flickered, casting a warm, wavering glow on the elegant storefronts of Vieux Lyon, the oldest district of the city. Vivi clutched her leather satchel tighter, its contents – a bolt of emerald green silk and a sketchbook brimming with designs – precious cargo against the encroaching darkness. Her destination, nestled between a boulangerie and an antique shop, was a small, brightly lit atelier with the words "Dupres Designs" painted in elegant gold script above the door. This was her sanctuary, her legacy, the place where thread and fabric transformed into dreams.
