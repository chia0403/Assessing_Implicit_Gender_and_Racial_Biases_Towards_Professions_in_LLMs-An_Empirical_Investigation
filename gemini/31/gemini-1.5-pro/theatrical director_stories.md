The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare scarf tighter, the worn wool offering minimal protection against the icy gusts that howled down the narrow cobblestone streets of Prague. Above, a bruised twilight sky bled into the deepening shadows cast by the gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral. Esme paused at the arched gateway to the Divadlo U Kapličky, a tiny, almost forgotten theatre tucked away in the heart of Malá Strana. Its faded paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and the single flickering gas lamp above the entrance cast a sickly yellow glow that did little to dispel the gloom. This dilapidated gem, steeped in centuries of forgotten performances and whispered legends, was to be the setting for Esme's most ambitious, and perhaps most reckless, production yet: a reimagining of  Shakespeare's Macbeth, set not in a Scottish castle, but amidst the shadowy intrigues of Prague's alchemical past.
