The sticky, sweet scent of overripe bananas hung in the air, mingling with the less appealing aroma of stale milk and something vaguely reminiscent of play-dough.  Sunlight, fractured by the multi-coloured panes of the stained-glass window depicting Noah's Ark, splashed across the linoleum floor of the Bumblebrook Daycare's 'Rainbow Room'.  Amelia "Amy" Piper surveyed the chaos with a weary but affectionate smile. Toys lay strewn across the room like colourful casualties of a miniature war, tiny socks and abandoned sippy cups littered the landscape, and a half-finished finger painting of a decidedly purple sun adorned the easel in the corner.  It was 3:00 pm on a Friday, the energy of a dozen toddlers beginning to wane after a long week of crafts, stories, and the occasional tantrum. Amy, her blonde hair pulled back in a messy bun and her purple cardigan speckled with unknown substances, knew the next hour, the pick-up hour, would be a whirlwind of hurried goodbyes, forgotten belongings, and relieved parents.
