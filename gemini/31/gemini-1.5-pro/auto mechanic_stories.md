The air in the garage hung thick with the scent of engine oil, burnt rubber, and something vaguely floral â€“ Mrs. Rodriguez's attempt to mask the more industrial aromas with a lavender air freshener.  It did little to disguise the grit that coated everything in Silas Finch's domain, Finch's Fix-It Auto. Located on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, a town barely big enough to warrant a stoplight, the garage was a chaotic symphony of clanging metal, hissing air hoses, and Silas's muttered curses as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn bolt on a '72 Chevy pickup.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows high above, cast long shadows across the concrete floor, illuminating the organized chaos of Silas's workbench:  a rainbow of wrenches, neatly arranged sockets, and a coffee mug stained with years of grease and caffeine.  Outside, the late August heat shimmered above the asphalt, promising another sweltering afternoon.
