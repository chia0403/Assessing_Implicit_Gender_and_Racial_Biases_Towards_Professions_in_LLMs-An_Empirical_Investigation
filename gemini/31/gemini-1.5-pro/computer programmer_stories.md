The flickering neon sign of the "Binary Bean" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia Grace Chen's tired face. Rain lashed against the cafe's panoramic windows, blurring the already distorted view of Seattle's skyline.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and desperation. Amelia, hunched over her laptop in a secluded booth, barely registered either.  Her fingers danced across the keyboard, a blur of motion as lines of code scrolled across the screen. Lines of code that held the key, she hoped, to finally escaping this digital purgatory. It was 3:17 am, the witching hour for coders, and Amelia, fuelled by lukewarm instant ramen and a potent blend of anxiety and caffeine, was hunting a bug that had been plaguing her for days.  Outside, the city slept. Inside the Binary Bean, Amelia Chen wrestled with the demons of her own creation.
