The fluorescent lights of Aspen Dental hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the pristine white tiles and stainless steel instruments.  Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen aspen leaves into swirling dervishes against the panoramic windows, showcasing the snow-dusted peaks of the Colorado Rockies. Inside, however, the air was warm and smelled faintly of mint and antiseptic. Eleanor Vance, RDH, adjusted her teal scrubs and tapped a gloved finger against the patient chart resting on the counter.  This was her last patient of the day, a new one, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, and Eleanor hoped he wouldn't be a "gagger."  She'd had three gaggers already that day, and her patience, usually as sturdy as the mountains visible outside, was wearing thin.  The thought of a steaming mug of chai and the crackling fire in her mountain cabin was far more appealing than scraping plaque and dodging uvulas.  Just then, the door swung open, admitting a gust of icy air and a man who looked anything but a dental patient.
