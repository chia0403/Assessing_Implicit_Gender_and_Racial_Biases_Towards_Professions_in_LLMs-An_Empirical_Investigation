Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the grey Dublin street outside. Inside, the salon was a haven of warmth and the comforting scent of acetone and almond oil.  Eliza Jane O'Malley, her fiery red hair pulled back in a practical braid, glanced up from the intricate floral design she was painting on a client's nail.  Elizaâ€™s small salon, nestled between a bustling fishmonger and a perpetually empty travel agency, was her pride and joy.  Every chipped countertop and hand-painted sign reflected her dedication, and even on a dreary Tuesday afternoon like this, the vibrant energy she exuded kept the atmosphere buzzing.
