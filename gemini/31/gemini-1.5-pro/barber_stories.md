The biting wind whipped down Elm Street, rattling the striped barber pole outside "Finnian's Fine Cuts & Shaves." Inside, the air was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting contrast to the November chill gnawing at the brick walls of the small shop. Finnian Oâ€™Malley, his name etched in elegant script on the frosted glass of the door, leaned against his worn leather barber chair, watching the swirling leaves dance like dervishes across the rain-slicked pavement.  The town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was usually bustling on a Saturday morning, but the impending storm had kept everyone but the bravest souls indoors. Finnian, however, wasn't complaining.  The quiet solitude gave him time to sharpen his straight razors, the rhythmic scrape of steel against leather a familiar and calming sound. He preferred the hushed expectancy before a storm to the usual cheerful chatter of his customers. It gave him time to think, to prepare, for whatever the brewing weather might bring.
