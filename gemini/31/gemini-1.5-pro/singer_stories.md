The crimson velvet curtains of the Orpheum Theatre felt heavy, almost suffocating, as Isabella “Izzy” Thorne traced their scalloped edges with a trembling finger.  The air backstage was thick with the commingled scents of dust, sweat, and cheap hairspray, a familiar cocktail that usually fueled her adrenaline.  Tonight, however, it sat in her stomach like a lead weight.  Built in 1926, the Orpheum was a grand dame of a theatre, all gilded balconies and ornate plasterwork, but beneath the glamour, a chilling draft snaked through the crumbling hallways.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, mirroring the turmoil in Izzy's heart.  This was it.  Her biggest audition yet.  One song stood between her and a life-altering opportunity, a chance to finally escape the smoky bars and dingy clubs that had been her proving ground for the last five years. Tonight, she sang for her future.
