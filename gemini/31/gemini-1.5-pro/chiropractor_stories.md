The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C.,  sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner of his sparsely decorated waiting room.  The only other sound was the persistent drip, drip, drip of a leak in the ceiling, directly above a framed anatomical chart of the human spine.  Maple Creek, Oregon, population dwindling, wasn't exactly a chiropractic hotspot. Elias had imagined a thriving practice, a bustling waiting room filled with patients eager for relief. Instead, six months after opening Thorne Chiropractic, he was staring down another Tuesday evening with exactly zero appointments and a distinct feeling of impending doom. The rain hammered against the large front window, mirroring the persistent ache in his own lower back.  He really shouldn't have carried that box of promotional stress balls up the stairs by himself.
