The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's parka as she prepped the de Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  The sky, a bruised purple streaked with angry orange, hinted at the approaching dawn.  Pine trees, heavy with snow, stood sentinel around the frozen lake that served as her runway, their branches clicking like skeletal fingers.  Lake Clark National Park, a vast wilderness of snow-capped peaks, turquoise glaciers, and sprawling tundra, stretched out before her, untouched and unforgiving.  Ace tightened her gloves, the leather creaking in the subzero temperatures. Today's flight was a risky one â€“ a supply drop to a remote geological survey camp nestled deep within the Chigmit Mountains.  The weather forecast called for blizzards, and the terrain was treacherous, even for a seasoned bush pilot like herself.  But the researchers were running low on essential supplies, and Ace, ever loyal to her clients and the call of the wild, wouldn't let them down.  She climbed into the cockpit, the familiar scent of aviation fuel and worn leather enveloping her.  This was her domain, her kingdom. Up here, among the clouds and the peaks, Ace Reyes was truly free.
