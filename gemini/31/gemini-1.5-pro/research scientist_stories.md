The fluorescent hum of the hydroponics lab vibrated through Dr. Aris Thorne's bones, a familiar lullaby after fourteen-hour workdays.  Outside, the Alaskan winter howled against the reinforced glass of the Kachemak Bay Research Station, a lone outpost clinging to the edge of the Kenai Peninsula.  Snow, driven sideways by the relentless wind, blurred the view of the churning, slate-grey waters of the bay. Inside, however, it was a balmy 72 degrees, the air thick with the scent of nascent kelp and the faintly metallic tang of the experimental nutrient solution Aris had meticulously crafted. He adjusted his bioluminescent goggles, their green glow illuminating the swirling emerald currents within the cultivation tanks.  His fingers, stained faintly blue from prolonged exposure to the algae's bioluminescent proteins, hovered over the control panel, ready to log the latest growth cycle data. Tonight, he was on the precipice of a breakthrough, a discovery that could revolutionize biofuel production and, perhaps, change the world.  But something feltâ€¦ off.  A subtle shift in the rhythm of the lab, a tremor in the usual symphony of bubbling water and whirring fans.
