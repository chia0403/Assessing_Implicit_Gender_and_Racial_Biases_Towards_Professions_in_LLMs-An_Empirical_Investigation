The frosted glass panes of the Aerilon Public Library rattled in their frames as a gust of wind, sharp with the scent of approaching snow, whipped down Main Street.  Inside, nestled amidst the towering mahogany shelves and the hushed whispers of turning pages, Eleanor Vance, the head librarian, meticulously rearranged the display dedicated to forgotten authors of the Edwardian era.  Aerilon, a small town nestled in the valley of the Vermont Green Mountains, was a place where time seemed to move slower, a haven for quiet contemplation and the rustling secrets held within aging books. The year was 1986, a time of big hair and synthesized melodies, but within the hallowed halls of the library, a different era reigned, an era of ink-stained fingers and the soft crinkle of well-loved paper. Eleanor, with her spectacles perched on her nose and a cardigan draped over her shoulders, was its steadfast guardian. The flickering gas lamps cast long shadows that danced across the shelves, lending an air of mystery to the already hushed atmosphere. Outside, the first snowflakes began to fall, promising a long, quiet night in Aerilon, and within the library walls, a secret waited to be unearthed.
