The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance's face, a familiar kiss from the capricious Irish Sea.  Perched precariously on the slick, black rocks of the DÃºn Aonghasa cliffs, she braced herself against the wind, her thick Aran sweater offering little resistance.  Seven hundred feet below, the churning Atlantic gnawed at the base of Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands.  Eleanor adjusted the focus on her vintage Hasselblad, its weight comforting in her gloved hands.  The setting sun bled across the western sky, painting the dramatic landscape in fiery hues of orange and violet.  It was the kind of light photographers dream of, the kind that whispered ancient stories and promised breathtaking images.  But Eleanor wasn't there to capture the postcard-perfect sunset. She was waiting for something else, something far more elusive.  Something that lurked in the shadows of the crumbling, prehistoric fort behind her.
