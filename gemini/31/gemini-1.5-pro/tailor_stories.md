The clatter of trams and the hawkers' cries faded as Elias Thorne pushed open the heavy oak door of his shop, number 17 Thistle Lane.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the perpetually gloomy Edinburgh alleyway and illuminated the sign above: *Thorne & Son, Fine Tailoring - Est. 1888*. Though the "Son" had been gone these last ten years, Elias hadn't the heart to remove it. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of aged wool, beeswax, and the faint ghost of pipe tobacco. Rolls of tweed and tartan lined the walls, their muted colours a stark contrast to the vibrant life teeming just beyond the shopâ€™s threshold. Elias, his shoulders stooped from years hunched over his workbench, moved with a quiet grace, a practiced economy of movement that belied the tremor in his aged hands. He lit the gas lamp, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floor, and the familiar world of his shop settled around him like a comfortable, if slightly threadbare, coat.  The morning was crisp, the promise of an early frost clinging to the air, a typical November day in Auld Reekie. It was the kind of day that demanded a thick tweed jacket, and Elias had just the one in mind for a particular client... a client who always brought a chill with him, no matter the season.
