The wind, a constant companion in the high plains of Montana, whipped at Amelia Grace Holloway's weathered denim jacket as she surveyed the sprawling landscape of the Rocking H Ranch.  The sky, a vast expanse of sapphire blue, stretched unbroken to the snow-capped peaks of the Beartooth Mountains in the distance.  Below, the land rolled in waves of ochre and green, dotted with the dark shapes of her Hereford cattle grazing peacefully.  Early October had kissed the grasslands with frost, painting the tips of the buffalo grass a silvery hue. The crisp air held the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar and comforting aroma that spoke of changing seasons and the relentless cycle of life on the ranch. Amelia, her calloused hands shoved deep in her pockets, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach despite the serene beauty surrounding her.  Something wasn't right.  The usually boisterous calls of the meadowlarks were absent, and an unnatural stillness hung over the land, a silence that whispered of an impending storm, both literal and metaphorical.
