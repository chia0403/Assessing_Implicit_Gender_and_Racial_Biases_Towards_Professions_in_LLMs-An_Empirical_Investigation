The wind, sharp and insistent as a chisel, whipped across the desolate plains of Eldoria, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Thorne.  He squinted, his grey eyes, the colour of the granite he worked, narrowed against the swirling dust devils that danced across the parched earth.  Above him, the twin suns of Aerilon and Solara bled into the late afternoon sky, casting long, distorted shadows from the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Elias, calloused hands shoved deep into the pockets of his worn leather jerkin, stood before the gaping maw of the Whisperstone Quarry, its entrance a jagged scar in the earth's surface.  The air within the quarry was cool and damp, a welcome reprieve from the relentless heat of the plains, and tinged with the ever-present scent of stone dust and something older, something almostâ€¦ sentient.  This was Elias's domain, his livelihood, and, some might say, his prison.  For generations, the Thornes had been the quarry masters of Whisperstone, coaxing beauty and function from the heart of the mountain.  And Elias, the last of his line, was bound to it by a legacy as unyielding as the rock itself.
