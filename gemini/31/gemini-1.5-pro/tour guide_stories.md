The midday sun beat down on the cracked terracotta tiles of Piazza Navona, baking the air with the scent of roasted chestnuts and exhaust fumes.  A gaggle of tourists, sweat-slicked and cranky, huddled under the meager shade offered by Bernini's Fountain of Four Rivers, their complaints about the heat barely audible over the roar of the traffic circling the piazza.  Isabella Maria Rosselli, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped her microphone twice, a practiced smile fixed on her face.  "Buongiorno, everyone! Welcome to the heart of Rome, Piazza Navona.  Now, if you'll all gather a little closer, I'll tell you about the fascinating history of this magnificent public spaceâ€¦"  Her voice, amplified by the small speaker clipped to her belt, cut through the din, capturing their attention.  Despite the oppressive heat and the challenges of managing a group of thirty sunburnt Americans, Isabella felt a familiar thrill.  She was in her element, weaving tales of emperors and artists, gladiators and popes, against the backdrop of this ancient city she called home.
