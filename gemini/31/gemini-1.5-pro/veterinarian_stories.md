The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Mongolian steppe, whistling a mournful tune through the gaps in Dr. Altanbayar Nergui's ger.  Snow, fine and relentless,  swirled around the small, round dwelling, obscuring the already fading light of a late November afternoon. Inside, the single oil lamp cast long, flickering shadows that danced across the worn rugs and simple furnishings. Altanbayar, his weathered face illuminated by the warm glow, knelt beside a struggling newborn goat kid, its tiny breaths shallow and ragged. The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke, lanolin, and the faint metallic tang of blood. Outside, the bleating of the mother goat, anxious and distressed, mingled with the howl of the wind, a symphony of worry that echoed Altanbayar's own growing concern.  This far out, miles from the nearest village, with the first blizzard of the season bearing down, the odds were stacked against the little creature.
