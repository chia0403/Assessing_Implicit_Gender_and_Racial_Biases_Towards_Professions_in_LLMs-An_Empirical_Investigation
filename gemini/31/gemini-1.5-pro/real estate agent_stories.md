The crisp November air nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she stood on the wraparound porch of the Blackwood Manor.  Decaying leaves, the color of burnt umber and rust, swirled around her ankles.  The grand, three-story Victorian house loomed over her, its gingerbread trim crumbling like stale biscuits, and paint peeling off the clapboard siding like sunburnt skin. Situated on a five-acre plot overlooking the windswept cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine, Blackwood Manor had been abandoned for the better part of a decade, ever since its last inhabitant, a reclusive artist rumored to have dabbled in the occult, disappeared without a trace.  Amelia, usually unflappable in her tailored blazer and sensible heels, felt a shiver crawl down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.  This listing, handed to her by a nervous junior partner at Hawthorne & Hayes Realty, her family's firm, was unlike any other she'd encountered.  It smelled of secrets, of forgotten things best left undisturbed. And yet, the ocean view... it was breathtaking, a hypnotic expanse of steel-grey water merging seamlessly with the iron-grey sky.  This house, Amelia knew, held a story. And she, armed with her lockbox and a hefty commission in mind, was determined to uncover it.
