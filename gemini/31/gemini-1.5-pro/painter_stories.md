The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Zephyr Thorne's auburn hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she squinted at the churning grey-green expanse of the Irish Sea.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the tiny fishing village of Portreeve, she gripped her easel tighter, its legs digging into the soft, peaty soil.  A half-finished canvas, depicting the dramatic cliffs and turbulent waves, fluttered against the wooden frame.

This raw, untamed landscape was Amelia's muse, the very reason she'd abandoned the sterile perfection of her London studio and sought refuge in this remote corner of Ireland.  The dilapidated stone cottage she'd rented, perched just above the high tide line, was spartan, offering little more than shelter from the elements and a magnificent, uninterrupted view that stretched for miles across the restless Atlantic.
