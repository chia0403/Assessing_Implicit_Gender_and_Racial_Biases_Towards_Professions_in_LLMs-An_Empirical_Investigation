The biting November wind whipped off Lake Superior, clawing at the flimsy siding of the Keweenaw Bay Clinic and rattling the frosted panes. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Eleanor Vance, PA-C, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, its chill a stark contrast to the heat radiating from the anxious patient before her. Outside, the skeletal branches of birch trees scraped against the clinic's single window, mimicking the frantic scratching in Eleanor's stomach. This was her first solo night shift in Copper Harbor, Michigan, population 400 and dwindling, and the isolation felt less like peaceful solitude and more like being stranded on a desolate, frozen rock in the middle of a vast, indifferent lake.  The radio crackled with static, the only other sound in the echoing quiet. A storm was brewing, both outside and, Eleanor suspected, within the walls of the small clinic.
