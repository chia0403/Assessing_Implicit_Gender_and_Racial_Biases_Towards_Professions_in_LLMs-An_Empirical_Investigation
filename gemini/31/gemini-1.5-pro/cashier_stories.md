The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B-flat over the rhythmic beeping of the scanner. Amelia Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, sighed and shifted her weight from one foot to the other. It was a Tuesday night in Harmony Creek, Oregon, a town so small that the arrival of the new Dairy Queen two years prior was still the main topic of gossip. Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the view of Main Street, where the only other signs of life were the blinking neon sign of the bowling alley across the street and the distant headlights of a logging truck rumbling towards the highway.  Amelia chewed on the inside of her cheek, the taste of stale coffee lingering. Another slow night. Another night where the highlight was likely to be Mrs. Henderson complaining about the price of her cat food.
