The biting November wind whistled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, rattling the ancient windows of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian mansion.  Frost glittered on the overgrown lawn, crunching under the worn work boots of Bartholomew "Barty" Flanagan as he trudged towards the front door. His toolbox, a dented metal behemoth overflowing with wrenches, pipe cutters, and an assortment of other plumbing paraphernalia, clanked with each step.  Barty pulled his threadbare knitted cap further down over his ears, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into his very bones.  Mrs. Periwinkle's house, a looming three-story structure with peeling paint and an air of faded grandeur, was notorious in the small town of Oakhaven for its labyrinthine plumbing system – a Gordian knot of copper and cast iron that had baffled less experienced plumbers for decades.  But Barty, with his forty years of experience and an uncanny ability to diagnose a leaky pipe from twenty paces, wasn't easily intimidated. This, however, was the third call he'd received from the old woman in as many weeks, and a creeping unease, colder than the November air, began to settle in his gut.  The previous problems had been straightforward enough – a dripping faucet here, a clogged drain there – but something about this one felt... different.
