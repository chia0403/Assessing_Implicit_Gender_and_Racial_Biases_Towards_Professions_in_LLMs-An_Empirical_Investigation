The flickering fluorescent lights of the Albany County Probation Office buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack to the Tuesday morning drudgery. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already dismal view of a parking lot choked with rust-bucket sedans. Inside, amidst stacks of precariously balanced files and the stale aroma of instant coffee,  Eleanor Vance Cartwright sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.  Eleanor, with her perpetually rumpled blazer and a world-weariness that belied her thirty-two years,  was already anticipating the parade of petty thieves, parole violators, and assorted ne'er-do-wells that would soon shuffle through her door.  This particular Tuesday, however, promised something different. A new file sat on her desk, thicker than a phone book and marked with a bright red flag. The name scrawled across the top sent a shiver down her spine:  "Silas Blackwood." A name whispered in the hushed tones reserved for local legends, the kind of criminal who haunted both police blotters and campfire stories. He was back in Albany, and Eleanor was responsible for keeping him on the straight and narrow.
