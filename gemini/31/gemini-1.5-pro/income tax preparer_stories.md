Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Holloway's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Tax season was a beast, and this particular April 14th felt more like the apocalypse.  Amelia, her normally neat brown bun threatening to unravel like a dropped ball of yarn, surveyed the chaos.  Discarded coffee cups littered her desk amongst precarious stacks of 1040s, W-2s, and schedules enough to make a lesser mortal weep. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume this time of year in her small office tucked above a laundromat in the perpetually overcast town of Dullsville, Oregon. A flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, adding its own irritating hum to the symphony of stress.  Outside, the neon sign of the "Suds & Duds" laundromat cast an eerie green glow on the rain-slicked pavement, offering little comfort to the bedraggled clients huddled beneath its awning, waiting for their turn with Amelia, the only tax preparer for miles.
