Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting emblem for The Rusty Mug.  The air inside was thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar with a practiced hand, the rag squeaking a mournful tune against the damp wood.  Outside, the neon sign flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the deserted street in the dilapidated port town of Port Blossom, Maine. It was a Tuesday night, always slow, but tonight, even the regulars seemed to have been swallowed by the storm.  The only sound besides the rain and Eleanor's rhythmic wiping was the low hum of the ancient refrigerator struggling to keep the beer cold.
