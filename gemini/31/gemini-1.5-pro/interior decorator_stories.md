Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's atelier, blurring the already fading Parisian twilight into a hazy grey.  Gen, perched precariously on a velvet-covered stool, meticulously pinned swatches of silk damask to a mood board. Her space, tucked away on a cobbled side street just off the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, was a riot of controlled chaos. Rolls of wallpaper balanced precariously against antique furniture, paint pots overflowed from wicker baskets, and a half-finished tapestry depicting a whimsical pastoral scene hung askew on one wall.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax polish and Earl Grey tea, hummed with the quiet energy of impending creation.  Tonight, however, Gen's usual creative buzz was replaced with a simmering unease. The commission she was working on – a complete overhaul of a notoriously reclusive Countess's Belle Époque apartment – was proving more challenging than she had anticipated. Not because of the daunting scale of the project, but because of the Countess herself, who communicated solely through cryptic notes delivered by a stoic, uniformed chauffeur.  And the latest note, lying open on Gen's cluttered workbench, contained a single, chilling instruction: "Embrace the darkness."
