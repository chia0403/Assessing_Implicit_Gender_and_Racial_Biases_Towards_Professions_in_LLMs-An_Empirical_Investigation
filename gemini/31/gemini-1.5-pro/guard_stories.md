The biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the dead oaks, clawing at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he patrolled the perimeter wall of Blackhaven Penitentiary, the jagged obsidian stones radiating a preternatural chill that seeped into his very bones.

Blackhaven, perched atop Mount Corvus, was a place of shadows and whispers, a prison built to hold the worst of the worst: mages, sorcerers, and creatures whose very existence threatened the fragile peace of the realm. Tonight, the silence was particularly unnerving. Elias tightened his grip on the hilt of his enchanted blade, the cold steel a familiar comfort against the growing unease in his gut.  Something was amiss.
