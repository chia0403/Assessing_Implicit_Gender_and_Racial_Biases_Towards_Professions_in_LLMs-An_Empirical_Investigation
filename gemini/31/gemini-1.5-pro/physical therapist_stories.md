Elias, a man of science and pragmatism, usually dismissed the local whispers of hauntings and strange occurrences.  However, as the heavy oak door slammed shut behind him, echoing through the cavernous entry hall, a shiver ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold. He had a feeling this particular Monday morning was going to be anything but ordinary.
