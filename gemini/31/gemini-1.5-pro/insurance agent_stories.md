Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, and Amelia Grace Hawthorne shivered despite the crackling fire in her hearth. Outside, the November wind howled through the narrow streets of Arkham, Massachusetts, a sound like a banshee keening.  Her office, nestled above the dusty Arkham Antiquarian Bookshop, usually felt cozy, a haven of mahogany and leather-bound volumes. Tonight, however, the familiar scent of old paper and pipe tobacco did little to dispel the creeping unease that had settled in her bones.  Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, tapped a manicured nail against a particularly perplexing claim file. The insured, a Mr. Silas Oakes, had listed the cause of loss as "spontaneous combustion," which, in Amelia's ten years as an insurance agent, had never proved to be anything other than highly improbable.  And Mr. Oakes, according to the missing persons report filed just that morning, had vanished without a trace.
