The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the turquoise paint until it radiated heat like a furnace.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called “Loneliest Road in America,” living up to its name this scorching July afternoon. Inside, with the AC struggling against the desert inferno, Dale "Grizzly" Grierson wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the lines on his face deepening like canyons carved by time and weather.  His calloused hand, adorned with a silver turquoise ring, gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel as he navigated the seemingly endless stretch of road, the only sound the low rumble of the engine and the mournful wail of Hank Williams drifting from the radio.  Grizzly, hauling a load of pre-fab housing units destined for a new mining operation near Ely, was three days into his run from Reno, and the solitude was starting to wear on him, even for a seasoned loner like himself. The shimmering heat haze on the horizon played tricks on his eyes, morphing distant Joshua trees into beckoning figures, and he knew from experience it was time to pull over and find some semblance of shade before the desert claimed another victim to its relentless sun.
