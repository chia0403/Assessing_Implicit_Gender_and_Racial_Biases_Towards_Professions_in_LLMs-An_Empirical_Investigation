It was a familiar comfort, a constant companion in the small, cluttered workshop nestled behind his clapboard house on the outskirts of Aisling, Vermont.  October had painted the surrounding Green Mountains in fiery hues of red and gold, and the wind whistled a mournful tune through the gaps in the aging windowpanes.  Inside, a pot-bellied stove glowed a cheerful orange, casting flickering shadows that danced across Elijah's weathered hands as he meticulously planed a length of cherry wood.  Aisling was a town built on whispers and maple syrup, a place where secrets settled like the first snow of winter, and Elijah, with his calloused hands and quiet demeanor, held more than a few of them close.  He knew the grain of every tree on Mount Ascutney as intimately as the lines on his own palm, and he understood the unspoken language of the forest, a language that spoke of patience, resilience, and the enduring power of nature. Today, however, a different kind of silence hung in the air, a silence pregnant with anticipation.
