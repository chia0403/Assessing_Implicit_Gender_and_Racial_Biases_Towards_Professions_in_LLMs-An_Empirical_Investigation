The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Magnolia "Maggie" Dupree like a damp towel.  Spanish moss dripped from the live oaks lining Rainbow Row, their pastel facades shimmering in the relentless July sun. Inside the "Cut & Curl," Maggie's salon tucked between a praline shop and an antique store, the whir of the ceiling fan battled the oppressive heat with little success.  The scent of hairspray mingled with the sweet aroma of jasmine wafting in from the courtyard garden, creating a unique, almost intoxicating perfume. Maggie, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical French twist, wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead as she surveyed the empty salon.  Tuesday mornings were always slow, a lull before the rush of tourists and Charleston socialites clamoring for appointments. But this particular Tuesday felt different, almost ominously quiet.  A single magpie perched on the wrought-iron balcony outside, its incessant chatter seeming to mock the stillness within.
