The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's High School parking lot, sending brittle leaves skittering across Eleanor Vance's path.  Coach Eleanor Vance, to be precise.  She clutched her battered thermos of lukewarm coffee, her breath puffing out white clouds in the pre-dawn gloom. The floodlights illuminating the football field cast long, skeletal shadows, giving the empty bleachers the appearance of a ghostly amphitheater. St. Jude's, a small Catholic school nestled in the heart of rust-belt Ohio, wasn't exactly a football powerhouse.  In fact, they hadn’t won a game in two seasons. But for Eleanor, each morning brought a sliver of hope, a renewed belief that this year, this team, could be different. The distant clang of a weight dropping in the school gym echoed through the crisp air, a reminder of the dedication – or perhaps the desperation –  of at least one of her players. Eleanor took a swig of her coffee, a grim smile playing on her lips. This season was going to be a fight, but Eleanor Vance was no stranger to a good fight.
