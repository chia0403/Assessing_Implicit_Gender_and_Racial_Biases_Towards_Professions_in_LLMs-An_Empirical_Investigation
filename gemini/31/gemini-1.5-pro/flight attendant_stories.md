The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice against plastic as Amelia Rose Hawthorne navigated the narrow aisle of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Outside, the sun dipped below a blanket of clouds, painting the sky in bruised hues of purple and orange.  Below, the sprawl of the Pacific stretched endlessly, a vast, shimmering tapestry broken only by the occasional crest of a rogue wave. Flight AZ672 from Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles LAX was halfway through its journey, and for Amelia, it was just another Tuesday night, or rather, Wednesday morning, considering they were rapidly chasing the International Date Line.  The cabin lights were dimmed, lulling most of the passengers into a restless sleep.  The air, thick with the scent of airplane coffee and something vaguely floral, felt heavy, pregnant with the unspoken anxieties of international travel.  Amelia, however, was immune.  Eleven years in the air had inoculated her against most in-flight disturbances, from turbulence to crying babies to the occasional passenger convinced they were being abducted by aliens.  Tonight, however, a different kind of unease prickled at the edges of her awareness, a subtle discord in the usual symphony of droning engines and muffled snores.
