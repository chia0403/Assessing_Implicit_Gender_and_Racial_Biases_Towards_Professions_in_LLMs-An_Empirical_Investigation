The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am. Dew clung to the palm trees lining Ocean Drive, shimmering in the first rays of sunrise.  A kaleidoscope of neon signs, still buzzing from the night before, cast a surreal glow on the empty street.  Inside "Body By Beatriz," a brightly lit fitness studio with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the beach,  Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez bounced on the balls of her feet, a wireless microphone clipped to her vibrant pink tank top.  Her dark curls were pulled back into a high ponytail, revealing a determined glint in her eye.  Today was the launch of her new high-intensity interval training class, "Sunrise Burn," and Bea was ready to set Miami ablaze.
