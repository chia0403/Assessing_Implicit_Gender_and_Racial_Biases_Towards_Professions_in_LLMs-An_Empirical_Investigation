The biting November wind whipped off the slate-grey Atlantic, plastering Amelia “Amy” Reyes-Fitzwilliam’s auburn curls to her chapped lips.  She tugged her wool coat tighter, the damp chill seeping through even its thick layers.  Below, the craggy coastline of Cape Ann, Massachusetts, stretched out like a jagged claw, the small, weathered houses of Rockport huddled against the impending storm. Amy surveyed the scene, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This picturesque, if somewhat bleak, landscape was to be the backdrop for the climax of her latest film, "The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter," a gothic thriller steeped in New England folklore.  The salt spray stung her eyes, mirroring the stinging pressure she felt behind them.  This scene, the final confrontation between the heroine and the vengeful spirit, had to be perfect.  It had to be the cathartic release the entire film had been building towards, and right now, looking at the churning ocean under the bruised, twilight sky, she wasn't sure it was.
