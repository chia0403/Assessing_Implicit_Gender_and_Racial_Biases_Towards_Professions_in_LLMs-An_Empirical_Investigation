The damp chill of a London November seeped through the ill-fitting window of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, prickling her skin beneath her sensible cardigan.  Outside, the skeletal branches of a plane tree clawed at the bruised sky, mirroring the tangle of anxiety twisting in Amelia's stomach. Her office, a cramped box room above a fishmonger's on Portobello Road, usually offered a quirky charm with its mismatched furniture and the faint, ever-present aroma of brine.  But today, the charm felt more like a cage.  Rain hammered against the glass, blurring the vibrant colours of the vintage clothes stalls below into a melancholy watercolour.  Amelia, a chartered accountant by trade and a creature of habit by nature, tapped a chipped porcelain mug containing lukewarm tea.  The annual audit for "Curiosities and Curios," the antique shop directly beneath her, loomed large, and Mrs. Pettigrew, the shop’s owner, was notoriously… particular.  This year, rumour had it, a particularly valuable collection of Victorian mourning jewellery had arrived, adding another layer of pressure to Amelia's already frayed nerves.
