Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head. Neon light from the pawn shop across the street painted the water-streaked glass a sickly green, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air.  Silas Corvus Finch, Private Investigator, sat hunched over his battered oak desk in the cramped space above O’Malley’s Irish Pub on Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, New York City.  A half-eaten pastrami sandwich lay forlornly on a paper plate beside a chipped mug stained with the ghosts of a thousand coffees. The year was 1948, and the city, still recovering from the war, wore its scars like a second skin.  The air, thick with the mingled scents of rain, exhaust fumes, and stale beer, clung to Silas like a shroud.  He rubbed his temples, the faint aroma of bay rum barely masking the underlying scent of desperation. The phone, a black Bakelite behemoth, suddenly shrieked, tearing through the silence like a banshee's wail.
