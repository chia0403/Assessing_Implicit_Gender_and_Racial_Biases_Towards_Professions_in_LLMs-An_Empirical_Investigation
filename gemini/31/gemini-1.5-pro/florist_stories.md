The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder’s shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, a shimmering veil draping over the pastel-painted buildings of Rainbow Row. Inside, the small shop was a cool oasis bursting with the vibrant hues and intoxicating fragrances of a thousand blooms.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses, and lilies.  Eliza, a slender woman with a cascade of auburn braids woven with sprigs of baby’s breath, hummed a tuneless melody as she assembled a bridal bouquet, her nimble fingers working with the practiced ease of a seasoned artist. This Tuesday morning seemed like any other, filled with the promise of deliveries, consultations, and the quiet joy of coaxing beauty from the earth.  Little did Eliza know, it was about to be uprooted.
