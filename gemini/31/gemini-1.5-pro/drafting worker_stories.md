The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Amelia Reyes's drawing board.  It was a Friday afternoon in late July, the air thick with the promise of a weekend heatwave hanging over Charleston, South Carolina. The scent of stale coffee and blueprint ink mingled in the air, a familiar aroma that Amelia, a junior drafting worker, found oddly comforting. Outside, the humid air vibrated with the sounds of the city – the distant clang of the trolley, the rhythmic thrum of ship horns from the harbor, and the faint, melodic cries of street vendors hawking their wares.  Amelia, hunched over a complex rendering of a proposed waterfront condominium, meticulously applied cross-hatching to denote a concrete section. The faint whir of the office's central air conditioning unit struggled to combat the oppressive heat seeping in through the large, sun-baked windows.  A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, threatening to smudge the fine lines she’d just drawn.  This was Amelia’s second year at D&M, and while she dreamt of designing soaring skyscrapers and innovative public spaces, for now, she was content (mostly) perfecting the art of drawing sewage systems and load-bearing walls. This particular Friday, however, held a different kind of tension, a subtle electric hum that had nothing to do with faulty wiring.  Mr. Davenport, the firm's notoriously demanding senior partner, had called an impromptu meeting for 4:00 PM, and rumors of a major new project – a potentially career-making project – swirled through the office like the dust motes dancing in the artificial light.
