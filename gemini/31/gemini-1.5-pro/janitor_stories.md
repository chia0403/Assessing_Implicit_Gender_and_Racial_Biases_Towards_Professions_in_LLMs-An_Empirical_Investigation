The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows from the overflowing laundry bins.  The air, thick with the cloying scent of disinfectant and something vaguely metallic, clung to Elijah Vance like a damp shroud.  Elijah, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the cracked linoleum, the squeaking wheels a lonely counterpoint to the distant, muffled beeping of machines from the floors above.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the hospital, the hour when the living dreamt and the dying sometimes slipped away unnoticed.  Tonight, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a stillness that pricked at the hairs on the back of Elijahâ€™s neck.  It wasn't the stillness of peace, but the stillness before a storm.
