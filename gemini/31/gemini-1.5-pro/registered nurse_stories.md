The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital. The skeletal trees lining the perimeter clawed at the iron-grey sky, their branches bare and rattling like dry bones.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from the Emergency Room entrance, casting a sickly yellow glow that barely penetrated the encroaching darkness.  Eleanor tugged her worn woolen scarf tighter around her neck, the icy air stinging her cheeks.  Tonight marked her third double shift in a row, and the exhaustion was a palpable weight settling in her bones.  St. Judeâ€™s, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains in rural West Virginia, was perpetually understaffed, and flu season had hit the small community hard.  Eleanor knew the brightly lit chaos waiting for her inside those automatic doors, and for a fleeting moment, she considered turning around and driving back to her small cabin, deep in the hollers.  But the thought of the patients inside, relying on her, spurred her forward.  She pushed through the doors, the familiar antiseptic smell washing over her, a stark contrast to the crisp mountain air.
