The whir of the stand mixer was a comforting lullaby to Seraphina Beauregard.  Vanilla buttercream, the pale yellow of a duckling's fluff, billowed in the bowl, its sweet scent pervading the tiny kitchen.  Outside, the neon glow of "Sugarplum Dreams Cakery" cast a pink and blue halo on the rain-slicked streets of New Orleans.  It was almost midnight, the French Quarter humming with a distant, mellow buzz, but Seraphina was lost in her world of flour, sugar, and edible glitter.  Tonight, she was crafting a masterpiece â€“ a five-tiered wedding cake, an intricate confection of sugar paste peonies and cascading royal icing, destined for the grand ballroom of the St. Regis Hotel.  Each petal, each swirl, each delicate pearl bead, was a testament to her meticulous artistry. The quiet solitude of her bakery, tucked away on a side street just off Bourbon, was her sanctuary.  Here, amidst the copper molds and pastry bags, Seraphina could forget the anxieties that nipped at the edges of her otherwise sweet life. Tonight, however, a different kind of anxiety prickled at her.  The wedding was tomorrow, and a crucial ingredient was missing.
