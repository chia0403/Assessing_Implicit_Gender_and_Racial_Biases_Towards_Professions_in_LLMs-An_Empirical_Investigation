The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne's braid across her face as she surveyed her domain.  Wysteria Hall, a gothic monstrosity perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, seemed to hunker down against the coming storm.  Gargoyles leered from the rain-slicked parapets, and the ivy, usually a vibrant green cloak, clung to the stone walls like skeletal fingers.  Millie, clad in her worn oilskins and sturdy boots, tugged her woolen cap lower.  Winter's grip had come early to the Yorkshire coast this year, and it held Wysteria Hall, and its lonely groundskeeper, firmly in its icy embrace.  The air smelled of brine, damp earth, and the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow.  The only sound was the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead, a soundtrack to the solitude that had become Millie's constant companion.
