Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, and ironically, lawyers.  Amelia Grace Holloway, Esq., shivered, pulling her threadbare cashmere shawl tighter around her shoulders. The damp chill of St. Jude’s Episcopal Church seeped into her bones, a stark contrast to the sweltering humidity that had plagued Charleston, South Carolina, just hours before.  The funeral service for Judge Elias Beaufort had concluded, leaving a palpable void in the cavernous space.  Amelia lingered, the scent of lilies heavy in the air, watching the last of the mourners file out into the relentless downpour.  This wasn’t just the loss of a respected judge; it was the loss of a mentor, a friend, and a man who, she suspected, held the key to a secret that could unravel the very fabric of Charleston society.
