Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne's Edinburgh flat, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Loose papers, casualties of a deadline-induced frenzy, danced across the worn wooden floorboards like frantic ghosts.  Elias, his full name Elias Alistair Thorne, ran a hand through his already dishevelled brown hair, the faint scent of printer ink clinging to his fingertips.  He was an editor, a meticulous craftsman of words, yet his own apartment looked like a vandalized library.  Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every available surface, interspersed with overflowing ashtrays and half-empty mugs of lukewarm tea.  The glow of his desk lamp, a lone beacon in the encroaching darkness, illuminated the single object of order in the chaos: a pristine, unopened manuscript titled "The Raven's Prophecy," its cover a deep, unsettling black.  It was due for its first edit tomorrow, and a knot of apprehension tightened in Eliasâ€™s stomach. This wasn't just any manuscript; this was the comeback novel of the reclusive, enigmatic author, Moira Blackwood, a woman whispered to be as brilliant as she was unstable.
