The relentless London drizzle seemed to seep into Beatrice Amelia Thorne's bones, mirroring the damp chill that had settled in her creative spirit. Her flat, a converted Victorian attic space in Notting Hill, usually vibrated with the hum of her iMac and the riotous colours splashed across her Wacom tablet. But tonight, the only illumination came from the flickering gas lamp on her desk, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swirling doubts in her mind.  Deadlines loomed, inspiration had vanished, and the half-eaten pot of lukewarm noodles on her desk offered little comfort. Outside, the rhythmic swoosh of windscreen wipers on Portobello Road provided a melancholic soundtrack to her creative block.  Beatrice, normally a whirlwind of vibrant energy and bold design choices, felt as grey and uninspired as the London sky.
