The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Holloway's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the churning Irish Sea.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped strands of her auburn hair across her canvas, momentarily obscuring the half-finished landscape taking shape beneath her nimble fingers.  Her easel, battered and paint-splattered, clung to the uneven surface, its legs wedged between crevices in the grey stone.  The Isle of Skellig Michael, a jagged tooth thrusting from the turbulent waters six miles off the coast of County Kerry, rose before her like a slumbering giant, its slopes a patchwork of emerald green and brooding grey.  The ruins of a sixth-century monastery clung to its peak, a testament to human resilience against the unforgiving elements, a theme that resonated deeply with Elara and fuelled her artistic passion. This isolated, windswept island, accessible only by boat during calmer seas, was her sanctuary, her muse, and for the next two weeks, her only companion.
