The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, yet fiercely ambitious, French bistro nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village.  Amelie Dubois, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, swore under her breath, the sharp French words a stark contrast to the delicate pastries cooling on a nearby rack.  It was 3:00 am, the pre-dawn hush of New York City broken only by the rumble of the occasional garbage truck.  Amelie, head chef and sole owner of Le Papillon Bleu, was already elbow-deep in flour, preparing for the day's onslaught.  Outside, the first faint streaks of lavender and rose were bleeding into the inky sky, painting the narrow, cobblestone street in hues of a bruised plum.  But inside, the stainless steel gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, a testament to Amelie's unwavering dedication to her craft and the dream she held precariously close â€“ to make Le Papillon Bleu the best damn French restaurant in the city.
