The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Silas Finch's bookkeeping office, a relentless tattoo against the otherwise quiet Tuesday afternoon.  Silas, whose full name was Silas Peregrine Finch, a moniker as elaborate and precise as his double-entry ledgers, tapped a freshly sharpened pencil against the worn oak of his desk.  His office, nestled above Mrs. Higgins’ Haberdashery on the cobbled high street of Little Puddleton, was a sanctuary of order in a world that increasingly seemed determined to embrace chaos.  Dusty ledgers lined the walls, each meticulously labeled and dated, a testament to Silas’s unwavering dedication to accuracy.  The air, thick with the scent of damp wool from the shop below and the faint, sweet aroma of the plum brandy Silas occasionally indulged in after particularly taxing audits, hung heavy and still.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the windowpanes and mirroring the unease that had begun to creep into Silas's otherwise meticulously balanced life.  A single, unopened letter lay on his blotter, the stark white of the envelope a jarring contrast to the sepia tones of his surroundings.  It bore no return address, only his name, written in an unfamiliar hand.
