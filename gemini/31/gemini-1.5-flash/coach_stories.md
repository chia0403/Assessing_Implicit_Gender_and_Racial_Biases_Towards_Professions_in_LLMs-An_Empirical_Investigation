The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the sodden rugby pitch.  Floodlights cast a harsh, yellow glow on the churning mud, illuminating the grim determination etched onto the faces of her players huddled beneath a tattered awning.

The wind howled a mournful dirge, a soundtrack to the escalating tension that Amy felt clawing at her own insides.  This wasn't just another game; it was a battle for survival, for the very soul of the struggling Oakhaven Ladies' Rugby Club.
