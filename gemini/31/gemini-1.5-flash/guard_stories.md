The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the skeletal remains of the old city, whistling through the gaps in the crumbling obsidian walls of Porthaven.  Flakes of snow, as black as charcoal dust, swirled in the gloom, clinging to the worn leather jerkin of Sergeant Valerius Thorne.  Valerius, his breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather collar of his greatcoat, the fur lining threadbare and offering little respite from the penetrating cold.  The only light came from the flickering oil lamps lining the patrol route, their feeble flames struggling against the encroaching darkness, mirroring the dwindling hope in the hearts of Porthaven’s dwindling population.  He gripped the haft of his halberd tighter, the cold steel a stark contrast to the numbness spreading through his fingers.  Beyond the walls, the whispers persisted – whispers of the Shadow Blight, a creeping darkness that consumed all in its path, leaving behind only silence and decay.  Tonight, Valerius’s patrol was longer than usual, and the silence was far more unsettling than the usual creaks and groans of a dying city.
