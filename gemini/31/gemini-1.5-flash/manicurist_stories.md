The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Bellini.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the gloom of "Nail Nirvana," her tiny, tucked-away salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic quarter of Prague.  Outside, the clatter of trams and the murmur of Czech voices drifted in, a muted soundtrack to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her nail clippers.  Sera, with her nimble fingers stained a kaleidoscope of colours from a week's worth of manicures, peered intently at the intricate floral design she was painstakingly crafting on Mrs. Petrova's perfectly oval nails.  The chipped paint on the salon's windowsill, a testament to years of weathering Prague's unpredictable seasons, seemed to mirror the subtle cracks beginning to appear in Sera's own carefully constructed life.
