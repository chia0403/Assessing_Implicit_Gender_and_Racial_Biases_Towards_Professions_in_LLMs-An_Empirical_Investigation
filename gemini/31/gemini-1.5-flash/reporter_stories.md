The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she hunched deeper into her worn trench coat.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that seemed to seep into the very bones, plastered the flyers advertising the upcoming St. Jude’s Harvest Festival to the grimy brick walls of Charleston’s French Quarter.  The air, thick with the aroma of decaying magnolia blossoms and something faintly… metallic, hung heavy above the cobblestone streets.  Mia, a reporter for the Charleston Chronicle, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The metallic scent – a strange, persistent undercurrent to the usual dampness – gnawed at the edge of her senses, a discordant note in the otherwise familiar symphony of the city she’d called home her entire life.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Tonight, the familiar felt… wrong.
