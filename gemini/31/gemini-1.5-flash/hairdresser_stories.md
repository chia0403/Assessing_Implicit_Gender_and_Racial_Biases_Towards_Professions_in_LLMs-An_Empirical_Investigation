The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Rel” Nightingale.  Rel, a woman whose auburn hair cascaded past her waist like a fiery river, leaned back against the worn velvet chair in her salon, "Nightingale's Nest," a haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Prague.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the gaslights into hazy halos.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single, flickering candle on a small table beside a worn copy of  *One Thousand and One Nights*, its pages dog-eared and stained with the remnants of countless spilled cups of strong, black coffee.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos of her salon was absent.  The only sound was the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the frantic beating of Rel's own heart.  Because tonight, a client wasn’t just late; they were vanished.  And this client was someone Rel knew intimately, someone whose disappearance felt like a personal betrayal.
