The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song around Ezekiel “Zeke” Stone’s rig, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of his eighteen-wheeler’s engine.  Snow, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, plastered itself against the windshield of his battered Kenworth, obscuring the already fading light.  He wrestled the steering wheel, fighting the icy slicks that threatened to send his rig into a deadly skid.  The only visible landmark for miles was the skeletal silhouette of a wind-battered juniper tree clinging precariously to the side of the desolate highway, its branches clawing at the stormy sky.  Zeke, his face etched with the weariness of a thousand lonely miles and countless harsh winters, gripped the wheel tighter, the knuckles white against his leathery skin.  He was hauling a load of frozen beef across the desolate expanse of I-80, a journey that felt more like a pilgrimage through a frozen wasteland than a simple delivery.  The radio crackled with static, offering no solace, only the ghostly whisper of a dying signal.  Tonight, the vast, unforgiving landscape felt more menacing than ever.
