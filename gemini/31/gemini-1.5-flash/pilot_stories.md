The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song, whipping snow into frenzied spirals around Captain Evelyn Grace "Evie" Mallory's battered Cessna 185.  Below, the Chugach Mountains hunched like slumbering giants, their snow-laden peaks disappearing into a swirling grey sky.  Visibility was down to near zero, the kind of weather that chewed up even the most experienced pilots and spat them out, broken.  Evie, however, wasn't feeling broken. She felt… focused.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine, a lonely sound in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.  Her mission: a desperate medical evacuation from a remote logging camp, a lifeline strung precariously against the teeth of a blizzard.  The fate of a man’s life hung, quite literally, in the balance, suspended between the icy grip of the mountains and the skill of her weathered hands on the controls.
