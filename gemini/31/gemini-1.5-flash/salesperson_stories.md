The chipped paint of the “For Sale” sign flaked onto Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s sensible beige pumps as she wrestled the heavy oak door open.  The air inside the Victorian mansion hung thick and still, smelling faintly of mothballs and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the gloom filtering through the stained-glass windows, illuminating a grand, if somewhat decaying, staircase that spiralled upwards like a petrified vine. Amy adjusted her crisp, if slightly rumpled, blazer, the faint scent of lavender and ambition clinging to its fabric. This was it – her biggest client yet, the culmination of months of relentless networking and persuasive phone calls.  The sale of Blackwood Manor, a property steeped in local legend and shrouded in an unsettling quiet, rested squarely on her shoulders.  And Amy Hernandez, seasoned real estate salesperson, was ready to close the deal.
