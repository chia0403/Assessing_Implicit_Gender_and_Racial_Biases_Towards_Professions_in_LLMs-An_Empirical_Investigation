The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Croft hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails against the polished mahogany of her desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though rarely anyone dared to use it), adjusted the perfectly placed silk orchid in its minimalist vase.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the tall windows of the opulent law firm's reception area, illuminating the swirling patterns in the cream-colored carpet.  Outside, the relentless London drizzle painted the city in shades of grey, a stark contrast to the meticulously curated, almost aggressively beige, interior of Sterling & Croft.  Today, however, the usual calm of Penny's world was about to be shattered, not by a disgruntled client or a missed deadline, but by something far stranger.
