The scent of old paper and distant lands hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Amelia Hernandez truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows of "Wanderlust Voyages," danced in the quiet stillness of her office.  Amelia, a woman whose smile lines spoke of countless journeys both taken and meticulously planned for others, sat at her antique roll-top desk, the faint ticking of a grandfather clock the only soundtrack to her solitude. Outside, the relentless rhythm of New York City throbbed, a stark contrast to the tranquil oasis she'd painstakingly crafted within her small, but perfectly formed, travel agency tucked away on a cobbled side street in Greenwich Village.  The walls, adorned with vintage travel posters showcasing exotic locales – from the shimmering Taj Mahal to the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas – whispered tales of adventure yet to unfold.  Today, however, Amelia felt a sense of unease, a prickle of something akin to dread, that had nothing to do with flight cancellations or lost luggage.  This felt… different.
