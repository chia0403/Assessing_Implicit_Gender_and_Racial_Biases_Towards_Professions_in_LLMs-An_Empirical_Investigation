The scent of almond extract and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to the floral wallpaper and the worn velvet cushions of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s tiny bakery.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of "The Sugarplum," blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, however, a warm, almost feverish energy crackled.  Amelia, her fingers stained a vibrant, impossible shade of maraschino cherry red, meticulously piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the ivory frosting reflecting the flickering candlelight.  The cake itself, a majestic creation of spun sugar arches and cascading fondant ribbons, seemed to shimmer with an almost ethereal beauty, a stark contrast to the storm raging outside and the tempest brewing within Amelia’s own heart.
