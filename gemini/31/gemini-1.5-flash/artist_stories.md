The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  Her easel, perched precariously on the wind-battered cliffs of Cornwall, groaned a sympathetic sigh under the weight of her half-finished canvas.

The air hung thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, a pungent perfume she’d come to associate with both inspiration and the relentless ache in her bones from hours spent battling the elements. This secluded cove, known only to a handful of locals and the gulls that wheeled overhead, was her sanctuary, her studio, her escape.
