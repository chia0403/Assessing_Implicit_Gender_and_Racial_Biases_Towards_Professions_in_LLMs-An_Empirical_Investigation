The rusty barber's pole outside creaked a mournful tune in the relentless wind, its faded red and white stripes mirroring the bloodshot eyes of Elias Thorne, owner and sole operator of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Elias, a man whose life seemed as neatly trimmed as the sideburns he expertly sculpted, found himself staring out at the bleak, windswept plains of the Saskatchewan prairie.  The endless expanse of wheat fields, usually a source of quiet contemplation, today felt suffocating, mirroring the oppressive weight of a secret that gnawed at him.  The only sounds louder than the wind were the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional mournful wail of a distant train whistle â€“ a lonely soundtrack to a life lived in the shadow of a past he desperately tried to bury.  The air, thick with the scent of dust and stale pomade, held the promise of another long, quiet day, a day Elias Thorne prayed wouldn't bring the storm he knew was brewing.
