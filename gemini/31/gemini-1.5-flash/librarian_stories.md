The scent of aged paper and dust motes dancing in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight – a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Silas Weathersby Memorial Library – was doing little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient stained-glass windows depicting scenes from a long-forgotten Arthurian legend.  Inside, the grand, oak-paneled reading room of the Weathersby – a gothic masterpiece clinging precariously to the edge of the windswept Cornish cliffs – was eerily silent, the usual gentle rustle of turning pages replaced by an unnerving stillness.  Eleanor adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose, her gaze sweeping over the towering shelves that stretched towards the vaulted ceiling, their shadows lengthening with the fading light.  Tonight, however, the comforting familiarity of her beloved library felt less like sanctuary and more like a cage.  Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and Eleanor, with her worn leather-bound copy of "Malleus Maleficarum" clutched tightly in her hand, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.
