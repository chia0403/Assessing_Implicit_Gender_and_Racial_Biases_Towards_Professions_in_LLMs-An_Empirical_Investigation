The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a nametag that read simply "Amelia," stared blankly at the conveyor belt, the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of the scanner the only punctuation to the silence.  Outside, the Nevada desert baked under a relentless moon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the tumbleweeds that skittered across the empty parking lot. The air inside, however, was thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener battling the faint, greasy odor of stale hot dogs from the roller grill tucked away in a corner. This wasn't glamorous, but it was Amelia's life â€“ at least for now.
