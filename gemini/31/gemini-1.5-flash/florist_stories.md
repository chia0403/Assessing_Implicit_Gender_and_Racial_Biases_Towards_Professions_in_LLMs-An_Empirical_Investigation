The scent of rain-soaked petrichor hung heavy in the air, mingling with the intoxicating perfume of jasmine and lilies that spilled from the open doorway of "Petals & Promises."  Inside, amidst the riot of colour and fragrance, Amelia Katherine Willowbrook meticulously arranged a cascade of blush roses, her nimble fingers moving with practiced grace.  Rain lashed against the large, arched windows of her shop, blurring the already-dim twilight of a late October evening in the quaint, cobbled streets of Ashworth, a town steeped in history and whispering secrets from its half-timbered houses.  The only sounds louder than the drumming rain were the gentle hum of the refrigerator preserving the fragile blooms, and the rhythmic snip-snip of Ameliaâ€™s shears, a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.
