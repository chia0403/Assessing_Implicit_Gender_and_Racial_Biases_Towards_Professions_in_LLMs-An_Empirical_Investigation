The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, if slightly sticky, floor of Room 104.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty windowpanes, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, each one a miniature sun in its own right.  Crayon shavings, scattered like fallen confetti, littered the edges of the brightly coloured carpet, testament to a morning of enthusiastic artistic expression.  The scent of peanut butter and slightly damp playdough hung heavy in the air, a perfume uniquely and undeniably kindergarten.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent navigating the chaotic beauty of five-year-olds, surveyed her domain with a mixture of weary affection and quiet amusement.  Today, however, the usual sweet chaos feltâ€¦different.  A palpable tension, almost imperceptible to the untrained eye, vibrated beneath the surface of the cheerful cacophony.
