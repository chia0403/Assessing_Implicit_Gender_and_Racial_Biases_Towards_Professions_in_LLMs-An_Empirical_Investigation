The pre-dawn chill clung to Elias Thorne's worn denim jacket as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary.  Mist, thick as a shroud, clung to the ancient redwood trees that ringed the sanctuary, their gnarled branches scratching against the pale sky like skeletal fingers.  The air, usually vibrant with the chirping of unseen birds, was hushed, heavy with the damp scent of pine needles and the earthy tang of decaying leaves. Elias, his breath puffing out in small white clouds, carried a bucket brimming with a mixture of finely chopped vegetables and specially formulated nutrient paste â€“ breakfast for the sanctuary's most temperamental resident, a grumpy old Eurasian lynx named Boris.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, felt a million miles from the nearest town, a secluded haven for creatures injured, orphaned, or simply unable to survive in the wild.  And Elias, with his calloused hands and quiet dedication, was their guardian.
