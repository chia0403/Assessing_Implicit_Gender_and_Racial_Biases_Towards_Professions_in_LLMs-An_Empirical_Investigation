The chipped paint of the Rialto Theatre’s backstage door flaked onto the worn velvet of Isabella “Izzy” Moreau’s coat.  A biting November wind whipped around her, carrying the scent of rain and stale popcorn – a familiar perfume of her life.  The neon sign above the theatre, usually a vibrant, if slightly faded, promise of spectacle, flickered intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the deserted alleyway.  Empty pizza boxes and crumpled playbills lay scattered like fallen leaves across the grimy pavement, testament to the last, disastrous production of “King Lear” – a tragedy that had mirrored Izzy's own plummeting fortunes.  This wasn't the grand Broadway stage she'd envisioned, not by a long shot, but the Rialto, with its peeling plaster and echoing emptiness, was all she had left.  And tonight, Izzy Moreau, theatrical director extraordinaire (or at least, she used to be), was facing her ultimate challenge:  a desperately low-budget, high-stakes production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" that could either resurrect her career or send it into oblivion.
