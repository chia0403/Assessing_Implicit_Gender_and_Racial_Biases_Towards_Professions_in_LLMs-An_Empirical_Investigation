The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant antenna into place.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee, threatened to rip the whole contraption – his pride and joy, the experimental long-range radio transmitter – from the craggy peak of Mount Cragmore. Below, the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic gnawed at the cliffs, a relentless, hungry beast.  Elias, his thick wool sweater clinging damply to his frame, tightened a bolt, his fingers numb with cold.  The air smelled of brine and something else…something subtly metallic, a scent that pricked at the edges of his awareness, a scent that hinted at something far more unsettling than the usual capriciousness of the wild Atlantic.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic crackle of static from his headset, a lonely heartbeat in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.
