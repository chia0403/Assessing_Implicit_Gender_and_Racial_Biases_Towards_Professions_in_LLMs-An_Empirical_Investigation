The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton’s office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  Jack, or “Jackhammer” Stratton as some less-than-fond clients called him, squinted at the blurry cityscape visible through the grime-coated window of his cramped office on the third floor of a dilapidated building overlooking the perpetually rain-slicked streets of Seattle.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely fishy – a permanent aroma that had become as much a part of the office's character as the peeling paint and the perpetually flickering fluorescent lights.  Outside, the neon signs of the Pike Place Market bled a hazy, melancholic glow into the downpour, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed like restless spirits.  Tonight, however, the spirits seemed particularly restless.  The phone, a battered rotary model, sat silent, a stark contrast to the storm raging both inside and out, and Jack knew this quiet wasn't the calm before the storm; it was the eye of the hurricane, and the real tempest was about to break.
