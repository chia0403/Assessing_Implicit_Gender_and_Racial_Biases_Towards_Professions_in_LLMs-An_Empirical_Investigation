The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves clinging to the air.  Her red scarf, a vibrant splash against the greyness of the overcast sky, barely kept the chill at bay.  The towering Victorian houses of Oakhaven, each with their own unique architectural quirks and slightly spooky history, loomed over her like watchful giants.  Amelia, all of twenty-two years old, clutched a battered, oversized thermos of chamomile tea â€“ a crucial weapon against the impending onslaught of sugared cereals and boisterous toddlers at the Sunnyside Day Care.  The chipped paint on the old wooden fence surrounding the daycare, a faded yellow that hinted at brighter days, reflected the overall feeling of the place: well-loved, slightly chaotic, and perpetually in need of a good scrub.
