The sterile scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above her, reflecting harshly off the gleaming stainless steel instruments arrayed on her tray.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling streets of Charleston, South Carolina, a vibrant contrast to the clinical calm of Dr. Albright’s meticulously maintained dental practice.  Sera, however, was oblivious to the picturesque scene.  Her focus was entirely on the gaping maw before her – a cavernous expanse of neglected teeth, a landscape of plaque and decay that threatened to swallow her whole.  The patient, a nervous Mr. Fitzwilliam, mumbled something about a particularly aggressive piece of pecan pie, his eyes squeezed shut in anticipation.  This, Sera thought, was going to be a long afternoon.
