The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Blackwood's cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the frosted glass already shimmering with the promise of the rising sun.  The air, thick with the sweet scent of overnight-proofed sourdough and the faint, earthy aroma of freshly-ground cardamom, clung to her like a comforting shawl.  Inside, "The Flour Child," her family bakery, was a haven of warm, golden light spilling from the gas ovens, contrasting sharply with the grey, still-slumbering streets of Oakhaven, a town nestled deep within a valley perpetually shrouded in mist.  Rows of gleaming copper pans reflected the flickering gas flames, casting dancing shadows across shelves laden with jars of colorful sprinkles, crystallized ginger, and plump, sun-dried cranberries.  Elara inhaled deeply, the familiar scents a balm to her soul, a silent promise of another day spent kneading, shaping, and baking the magic that was her life.
