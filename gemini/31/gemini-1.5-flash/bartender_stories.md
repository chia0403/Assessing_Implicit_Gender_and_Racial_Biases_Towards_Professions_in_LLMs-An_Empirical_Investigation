The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he meticulously polished a snifter.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley into a hazy, orange smear.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the faint, underlying scent of desperation that seemed to cling permanently to the worn velvet booths. Elias, a man whose face held the etched map of too many late nights and too many secrets, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  The only other occupant of the bar was a stray cat, curled up asleep in a dusty corner, its tail twitching faintly with every rumble of thunder.  It was Tuesday, and Tuesday at the Rusty Mug meant slow, very slow.
