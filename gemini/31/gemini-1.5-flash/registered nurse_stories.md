The salt-laced wind whipped at Elara Vance's navy scrubs as she braced herself against the railing of the ferry, the spray stinging her cheeks.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum colour sinking towards the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, cast long shadows across the deck.  Around her, the other passengers, a mix of weary commuters and tourists clutching their oversized backpacks, huddled against the chill, their faces etched with the exhaustion of a long day.  But Elara, registered nurse at the small, perpetually understaffed St. Jude's Hospital on Salt Spring Island, felt a different kind of weariness â€“ the bone-deep fatigue that clung to her like the sea mist.  Tonight, however, wasn't about the usual frantic pace of the hospital; tonight, she was returning home, to a cottage perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the very strait she now traversed, a home that held both solace and a simmering, unsettling secret.
