The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade!" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the gradual disintegration of Eleanor Vance's carefully constructed composure.  It was the last day of school, a day usually celebrated with sugary treats and exuberant farewells, but this year feltâ€¦ different.  A thick, humid Louisiana air hung heavy in the classroom of Oakhaven Elementary, clinging to the scent of stale crayons and impending summer storms.  The air conditioner, a wheezing, ancient beast, fought a losing battle against the oppressive heat, its strained hum a counterpoint to the low thrum of nervous energy emanating from her twenty-three students.  Outside, the cicadas shrieked their relentless summer song, a soundtrack to Eleanor's mounting anxiety.  Today, she wasn't just saying goodbye to her students; she was saying goodbye to Oakhaven Elementary, and perhaps, to a part of herself.
