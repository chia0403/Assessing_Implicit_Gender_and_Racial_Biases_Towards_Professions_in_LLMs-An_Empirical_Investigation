The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the Blackwood Building.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had persisted for three days, slicked the uneven cobblestones of the alleyway, reflecting the city’s sickly yellow streetlights in distorted streaks.  The Blackwood, once a jewel of 1920s Art Deco, now stood as a testament to neglect, its ornate facade scarred by time and vandalism, its empty windows like vacant eyes staring out at the unforgiving Glasgow sky.  Amelia, a celebrated architect known for her revitalization projects, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This wasn't just another dilapidated building; it held a personal weight, a familial shadow that cast a long, chilling influence on her ambitions.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp stone and a faint, metallic tang that hinted at something more sinister hidden within the Blackwood’s crumbling heart.
