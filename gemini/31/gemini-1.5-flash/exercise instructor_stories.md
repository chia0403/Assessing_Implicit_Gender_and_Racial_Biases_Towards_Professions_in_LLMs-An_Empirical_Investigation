The fluorescent lights of the "Body & Soul Fitness Center" hummed a monotonous tune, their glare reflecting off the glistening tiles of the aerobics studio.  Amy, a whirlwind of controlled energy in her vibrant teal athletic wear, adjusted the microphone clipped to her shirt, its tiny red light blinking like a determined heartbeat.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the parking lot, hinting at the approaching Los Angeles rush hour, but inside, the only rush was the one Amy was about to ignite. Tonight was Zumba Gold night, and her class was already buzzing with anticipation â€“ a diverse mix of ages and abilities, all ready to lose themselves in the rhythm.
