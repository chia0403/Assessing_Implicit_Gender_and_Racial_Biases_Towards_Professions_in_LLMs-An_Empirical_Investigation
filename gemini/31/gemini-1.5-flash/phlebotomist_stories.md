The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own pulse.  Amelia, a woman whose patience was as finely honed as her needle technique, suppressed a sigh.  It was 7:17 AM, seventeen minutes past her scheduled start time, and already the waiting room was overflowing with a symphony of coughs, sniffles, and the low murmur of anxious conversations.  The pre-dawn chill still clung to the air, despite the artificial warmth of the clinic, a stark contrast to the humid Louisiana morning waiting just beyond the glass doors.  The scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral – probably the desperate attempt of the cleaning staff to mask the ever-present smell of fear – hung heavy in the air.  Amelia adjusted her crisp, starched white coat, the familiar weight a small comfort in the chaotic start to her day.
