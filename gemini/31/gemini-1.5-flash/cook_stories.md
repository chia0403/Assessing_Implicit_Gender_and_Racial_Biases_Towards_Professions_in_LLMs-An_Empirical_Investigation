The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as she hauled the last of the day's catch – a glistening, silver-scaled snapper – onto the deck of the *Serendipity*.  The late afternoon sun dipped below the turquoise horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple, a breathtaking spectacle Amelia barely registered. Her attention was fixed on the fish, its scales catching the dying light like scattered jewels.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and woodsmoke, carried the faint, sweeter perfume of hibiscus from the shore.  Amelia, her apron stained with the telltale marks of a thousand culinary battles – turmeric, paprika, a rogue splash of cilantro – wiped her brow with the back of her hand.  The small, ramshackle kitchen of the *Serendipity*, a floating restaurant moored just off the coast of Isla Paradiso, was waiting.  Tonight's menu, a testament to the island's bounty, was already dancing in her head.
