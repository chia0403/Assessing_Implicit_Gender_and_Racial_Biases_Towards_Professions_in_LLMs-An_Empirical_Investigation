The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn oak plank onto the small, pitching deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum hanging low on the horizon, cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop built onto the stern of the fishing trawler.  The air, thick with the scent of brine, sawdust, and the faintly sweet aroma of resin, was further complicated by the metallic tang of blood â€“ Elias's blood, a thin trickle tracing a path down his forearm from a sliver of wood.  He ignored it, his focus fixed on the recalcitrant timber.  The North Sea roared its displeasure around them, a restless beast eager to claim its due, but Elias, a man hardened by years battling both wood and waves, was unfazed.  His weathered hands, gnarled and strong as the ship's rigging, continued their work, the rhythmic thud of his hammer a steady counterpoint to the ocean's relentless symphony.  He was building a coffin. Not just any coffin, but one worthy of the legendary Captain Silas Blackwood, and that, Elias knew, was a task that required even more precision and respect than crafting a ship's mast.
