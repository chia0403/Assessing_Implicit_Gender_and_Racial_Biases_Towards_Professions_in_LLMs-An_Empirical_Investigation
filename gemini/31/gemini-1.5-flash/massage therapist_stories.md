The scent of sandalwood and bergamot hung heavy in the air, a deliberate counterpoint to the damp, chill seeping in from the November rain lashing against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Rain, Amelia Grace Hawthorne thought, was the perfect accompaniment to a deep tissue massage.  The rhythmic drumming on the panes, a constant, soothing percussion, almost mirrored the kneading and stroking of her practiced hands.  Amelia, her fingers still stained faintly orange from the turmeric paste she'd used earlier on a client with stiff shoulders,  leaned back in her worn leather chair, the weight of the day settling onto her bones like the dampness settling into the ancient brickwork of her building.  This wasn't some sterile, brightly lit spa; Serenity Now was tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of historic Charleston, South Carolina, its charm a blend of comforting antiquity and quiet elegance.
