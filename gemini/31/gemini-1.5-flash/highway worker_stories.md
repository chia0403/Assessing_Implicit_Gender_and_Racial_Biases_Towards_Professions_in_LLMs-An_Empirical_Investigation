The relentless Texas sun beat down on Darius "Dee" Beaumont's neck, baking the sweat already clinging to his brow into a salty crust.  He squinted, the glare reflecting off the shimmering asphalt of Interstate 10, a ribbon of black stretching endlessly towards the hazy horizon.

The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of diesel fumes and hot tar, a familiar, almost comforting aroma that spoke of long days and even longer nights under the unforgiving Texan sky. Today, the work was particularly grueling: a massive pothole repair on a stretch of highway notorious for its aggressive drivers and unpredictable wildlife.
