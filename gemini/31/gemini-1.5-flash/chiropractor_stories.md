The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted town square.  Fallen leaves, the color of dried blood and rust, skittered before her worn leather boots.  Above, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the fading light.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard image of Havenwood, Vermont, that tourists flocked to see in summer.  Winter was coming, and with it, a chill that seeped deeper than the bone-deep frost that already clung to the cobblestones.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of Eleanor's own footsteps, each one echoing the insistent drumbeat of a worry that had settled in her stomach like a lead weight.  Havenwood, usually so quaint and quiet, felt…wrong.  And tonight, the wrongness felt particularly sharp.
