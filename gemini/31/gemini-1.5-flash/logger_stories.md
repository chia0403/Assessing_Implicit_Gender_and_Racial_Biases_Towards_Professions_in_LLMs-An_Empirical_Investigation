The air hung thick and heavy, a damp wool blanket woven with the scent of pine needles and decaying leaves.  Mist clung to the towering Douglas firs, their gargantuan trunks barely visible through the swirling grey.

Eli, a man carved from the same granite as the mountains themselves, shivered not from the cold, but from the unsettling stillness that preceded the storm.  The usual chorus of birdsong was absent, replaced by an unnerving quiet broken only by the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the frost-covered ground.  His axe, affectionately nicknamed "Faithful," rested on his shoulder, its polished head gleaming faintly in the dim light – a silent promise of the day's hard work, and perhaps, a confrontation with something far more ominous than a stubborn redwood.
