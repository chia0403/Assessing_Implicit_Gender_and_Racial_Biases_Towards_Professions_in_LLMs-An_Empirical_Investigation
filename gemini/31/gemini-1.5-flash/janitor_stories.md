The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Hernandez's mop against the polished terrazzo floor of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, dancing stars, swirled in the vast, echoing space.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, navigated the cavernous room with the practiced ease of someone who knew every crack in the floor, every stubborn stain on the bleachers. The scent of sweat and stale popcorn still clung to the air, a ghostly reminder of the basketball game that had ended hours ago, leaving behind only the detritus of victory and defeat: crumpled scorecards, discarded water bottles, and the lingering hum of a crowd long dispersed.  Outside, the late summer night pressed against the tall, arched windows, promising the cool relief of a storm.  But Amelia, Amelia Hernandez, the night janitor of Blackwood Academy, was a long way from relief.  Tonight felt different.  Heavier.
