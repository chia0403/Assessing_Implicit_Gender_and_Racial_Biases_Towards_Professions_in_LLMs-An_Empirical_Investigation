The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the recalcitrant fishing net from the grasp of a disgruntled seagull.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the pewter sky, cast long shadows across the weathered docks of Port Blossom, a tiny fishing village clinging precariously to the rugged Maine coast.  The air, thick with the smell of brine, seaweed, and something vaguely fishy that Eleanor couldn't quite place, vibrated with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic slap of waves against the pilings.  This wasn't exactly the idyllic veterinary practice she'd envisioned when she'd traded the sterile gleam of a city clinic for the unpredictable charm of coastal Maine, but then again, Eleanor Vance had never encountered a patient quite like the one currently flapping indignantly in her arms â€“ a very large, very irate puffin with a fishing hook embedded firmly in its wing.
