The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's Tax & Accounting hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the pre-April 15th chaos.  Mildred McMillan herself, a woman whose sensible cardigan suggested a lifetime spent wrestling with Schedule C's rather than cocktail dresses, sighed, the sound barely audible above the whirring of the office computer and the frantic tap-tap-tap of her aging keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of her cramped office in the back of a strip mall, illuminating the overflowing files stacked haphazardly on every available surface.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hinted at the long hours and mounting stress that the looming tax deadline brought.  Outside, the relentless Wisconsin wind howled a mournful ballad, mirroring the anxieties of her clients â€“ anxieties Mildred was about to help alleviate, one W-2 at a time.
