The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already littered asphalt like a premature snowfall.  A biting November wind whipped Ms. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the parking lot, the scent of damp leaves and exhaust fumes clinging to her wool coat.  Northwood High, nestled in the perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon, wasn't exactly known for its beauty, or its particularly cheerful student body.  It was, however, Eleanor's battlefield, her classroom a daily trench war fought against apathy, teenage angst, and the ever-present threat of a rogue stapler.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of impending doom was amplified by a tremor of something far more unsettling.  A whisper had snaked its way through the faculty lounge, a hushed, fearful rumour that had settled in Eleanor's stomach like a cold stone.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
