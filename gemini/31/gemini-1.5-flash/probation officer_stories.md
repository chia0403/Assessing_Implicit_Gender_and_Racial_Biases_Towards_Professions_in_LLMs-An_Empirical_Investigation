The air hung thick with the smell of exhaust fumes, cheap coffee, and a lingering hint of something acrid – something that Amelia couldn't quite place, but which spoke volumes about the underbelly of Oakhaven, a city she both served and secretly despised.  Tonight, however, the usual grime felt heavier, the dampness colder, the despair more palpable.  It was the kind of night that promised trouble, a night that whispered of broken promises and shattered lives.  And tonight, Amelia knew, trouble was coming for her.
