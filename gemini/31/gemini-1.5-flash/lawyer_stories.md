The salt spray stung Amelia Stoneâ€™s face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed on these blustery November evenings.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved the grey cliffs of Cornwall into grotesque, fantastical shapes, their silhouettes jagged against the bruised purple sky.  Below, the Atlantic roared its displeasure, a churning beast that threatened to swallow the tiny, precarious fishing village of Porthcurno whole.  Amelia, wrapped in a thick wool coat despite the biting wind, stood at the edge of the cliff path, the harsh scent of brine and seaweed filling her lungs.  She wasn't here to admire the scenery, though its raw beauty held a certain grim appeal.  She was here for a body.  Or rather, the *potential* for one.  A missing person, specifically, and a case that was already proving more tangled and treacherous than the treacherous cliffs themselves.
