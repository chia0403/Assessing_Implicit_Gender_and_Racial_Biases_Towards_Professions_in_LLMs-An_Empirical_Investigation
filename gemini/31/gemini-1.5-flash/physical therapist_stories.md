The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from its tangle around the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the rugged Maine coastline, painting the churning grey Atlantic in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead. Eleanor, her sensible sneakers already soaked through, shifted her weight, the damp wood slick beneath her worn work boots.  This wasn't exactly the kind of physiotherapy she'd envisioned when she'd left the bustling city for the quiet solitude – and questionable Wi-Fi – of Little Cranberry Island.  But then again, fixing a broken fishing net was a far cry from the usual sprained ankles and aching backs she treated in her small, sea-shingled clinic.  This was a different kind of mending, a different kind of healing.
