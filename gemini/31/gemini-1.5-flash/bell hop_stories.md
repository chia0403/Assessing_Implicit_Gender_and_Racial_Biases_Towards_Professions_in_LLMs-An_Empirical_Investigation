The brass spittoon gleamed under the single, flickering gaslight, reflecting the weary lines etched into the face of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a bellhop at the Grand Majestic Hotel, a crumbling behemoth of Victorian gothic architecture perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, sighed. The salty air, usually invigorating, felt heavy tonight, laden with the scent of brine and impending storm.  Rain lashed against the arched windows of the hotel lobby, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the relentless throbbing in his temples.  The only other sound was the mournful creak of the ancient oak doors as they swung shut, sealing out the tempest and, it seemed, any hope of a quiet night.  The Grand Majestic, once a jewel of the coastal town of Seabrook, was now a fading echo of its former glory, its grand chandeliers dimmed, its plush carpets worn thin, a testament to the townâ€™s dwindling prosperity and Barty's own fading dreams.
