The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down the snow-dusted cobblestone street of Port Blossom, Maine.  The salt-laced air stung her cheeks, a familiar counterpoint to the sterile scent of antiseptic still clinging to her coat from a long shift at the town's only clinic, Coastal Care.  Port Blossom, nestled between the unforgiving Atlantic and a range of granite cliffs that clawed at the sky, was a place of stark beauty and equally stark realities.  Its charm was undeniable – the quaint, brightly painted clapboard houses, the perpetually fog-shrouded harbor, the scent of pine and brine that permeated everything – but beneath the picturesque veneer lay a community struggling with poverty, isolation, and a stubborn reliance on old ways, often to its detriment.  Tonight, Amelia felt the weight of all that, pressing down on her like the relentless, icy wind. The faint glow of the streetlights barely pierced the gathering dusk, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling snow.  Ahead, the silhouette of Coastal Care loomed, a beacon of warmth and, for Amelia, a sanctuary from the chilling realities of the town she both loved and increasingly questioned.
