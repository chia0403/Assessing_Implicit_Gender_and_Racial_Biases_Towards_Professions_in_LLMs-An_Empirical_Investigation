The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's ears, whistling through the gaps in the ancient, crooked timbers of the Old Vicarage.  Barty, his breath puffing out in frosty clouds, wrestled a recalcitrant length of pipe, its stubborn metal resisting his efforts with the icy determination of a disgruntled badger.  He was knee-deep in the vicarage's sub-basement â€“ a damp, claustrophobic space smelling strongly of mildew, forgotten potatoes, and the faint, unsettling aroma of something vaguely ecclesiastical that had likely been brewing in the darkness for decades.  Overhead, the floorboards groaned under the weight of centuries and whatever unseen creatures chose to inhabit them.  A single bare bulb, swinging precariously from a frayed wire, cast flickering shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the stagnant air. This was, Barty thought with a sigh, not exactly the glamorous life he'd envisioned when he'd first started his plumbing business, "Butterfield's Bottom Line."
