The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Blackwood Lane, rattling the windows of the dilapidated Victorian house where Dr. Eleanor Vance, MD, sat hunched over a flickering laptop.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, antiseptic aroma she was accustomed to in the ER.  Blackwood, population 3,000 (give or take a stray dog and a grumpy badger), was a far cry from the bustling city hospital where she'd spent the last five years honing her skills as an emergency medicine physician.  But Blackwood, with its winding roads, isolated farmsteads, and a chronic shortage of everything from qualified doctors to decent coffee, was now her reality.  Tonight, however, the quiet hum of the rural setting was punctuated by the ear-splitting shriek of a siren, cutting through the storm like a desperate cry for help.  Eleanor braced herself; another night, another emergency in the heart of nowhere.
