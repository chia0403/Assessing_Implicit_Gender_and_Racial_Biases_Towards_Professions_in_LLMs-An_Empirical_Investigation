The air in Judge Evangeline "Evie" Bellweather's chambers hung thick with the scent of old leather and impending doom.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun struggling through the grimy Victorian windows, danced in the silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner â€“ a clock that seemed to mock the glacial pace of justice itself.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the ancient stone of the Old Bailey, a symphony of grey mirroring the grim mood that had settled over Evie's usually meticulously organised desk.  A half-empty cup of lukewarm tea sat beside a mountain of case files, their stark white spines a stark contrast to the oppressive darkness of the mahogany furniture that dominated the room.  Tonight, the weight of the law felt particularly crushing.  The case of *Regina v. Alistair Finch*, a case that had already stretched the boundaries of her patience and her moral compass, awaited her final judgment.
