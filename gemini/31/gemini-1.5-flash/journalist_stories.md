She adjusted the collar of her trench coat, the damp wool clinging to her skin, and stared up at the flickering gaslight in the grimy window of apartment 3B.  It was a single, defiant spark in the encroaching darkness, a beacon promising – or perhaps foreboding – the story that had brought her to this desolate corner of the Lower East Side.
