The humid air hung thick and heavy, a clinging shroud woven from the scent of frying garlic, simmering ginger, and the faintly metallic tang of blood.

Tonight, however, the usual controlled pandemonium felt particularly charged, a storm brewing beneath the surface of polished stainless steel and simmering sauces.  The air crackled with anticipation, the kind that promised either culinary triumph or utter, spectacular disaster.
