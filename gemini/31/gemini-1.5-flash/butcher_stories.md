The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, sliced through Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's thick wool coat as he unlocked the heavy oak door of Butterfield's Best, his family butcher shop.  The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust, rendered fat, and something elseâ€¦ something faintly metallic and unsettling that clung to the cobblestones of Butcher's Row like a persistent fog.  Barty shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The gas lamps flickered weakly, casting long, dancing shadows across the narrow street, their feeble light barely piercing the pre-dawn gloom that draped over the ancient, half-timbered buildings of Oakhaven.  This wasn't just the usual pre-sunrise stillness;  it was a silence thick with anticipation, a silence that prickled Barty's skin and made the hairs on the back of his neck stand to attention.  Something felt wrong, terribly wrong, in Oakhaven this morning.
