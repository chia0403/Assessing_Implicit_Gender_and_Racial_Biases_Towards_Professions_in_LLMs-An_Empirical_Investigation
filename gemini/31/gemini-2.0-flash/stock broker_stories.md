## Story Opening:

The seventh espresso of the day tasted like burnt rubber, but Amelia Sarah Brighton didn't care. She needed it. Needed the jolt, the artificial pep, the distraction from the bloodbath currently unfolding on her six screens. The market was plunging, a crimson tsunami threatening to engulf everything she had painstakingly built over the past decade. Her clients were panicking, their voices a shrill chorus of fear and recrimination in her headset.

Amelia took a deep breath, forcing a calm she didn't feel. "Mr. Henderson," she said, her voice even and professional, "I understand your concerns. We're monitoring the situation closely. We're going to ride this out."

Liar. She was terrified. She had persuaded Mrs. Gable to re-mortgage her house to invest in tech stocks. Mrs. Gable, who baked the best lemon meringue pie Amelia had ever tasted. If Amelia lost her money, she didn't know what she would do.

The phone buzzed again. Another fire to put out. Another panicked voice pleading for help. Another day in hell.

## Setting:

Amelia Brighton's office was located on the 47th floor of the Pinnacle Tower in downtown Chicago. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a breathtaking, and currently terrifying, view of Lake Michigan churning under a stormy grey sky. Inside, the space was a testament to pragmatic efficiency, not ostentatious wealth. Steel and glass dominated, softened only by a small, struggling ficus plant in the corner and a framed photograph of Amelia smiling broadly on a windswept beach â€“ a memory of a happier, simpler time. Six computer screens, each displaying a different flurry of numbers, charts, and breaking news headlines, were arranged in a semi-circle around her ergonomically designed chair. The desk itself was meticulously organized, save for the overflowing ashtray (a habit she was constantly trying to break) and the overflowing stack of unopened client files. The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and unspoken anxiety, vibrated with the relentless hum of servers and the cacophony of ringing phones. This was the war room, and today, Amelia Brighton was losing the battle.
