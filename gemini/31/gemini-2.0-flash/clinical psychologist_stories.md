## Story Opening:

Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted the small, ceramic elephant on her desk, a nervous tic she'd developed years ago, just as she was finishing her residency. Its trunk, permanently raised in a hopeful salute, seemed woefully inadequate to dispel the storm brewing in her chest. The insistent buzzing of the intercom was a jagged note in the otherwise muted symphony of the office: the soft whir of the air purifier, the distant city hum, and the rustle of leaves from the ancient oak tree visible through her window.

"Dr. Vance," Margie's voice, usually a comforting presence, sounded strained. "Mr. Davies is here. He's...agitated."

Eleanor sighed, the sound barely audible. "Send him in, Margie. And please, hold my calls."

She took a deep breath, smoothed down her sensible tweed skirt, and prepared herself. Some days, being a clinical psychologist felt less like healing and more like navigating a minefield. And judging by Margie's tone, Mr. Davies was likely packing some serious explosives.

## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Vance's office is located on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Portland, Oregon's historic Hawthorne district.** The house, painted a calming shade of sage green, now houses a small collective of therapists and counselors. Eleanor's office is designed to be both professional and comforting. Sunlight streams through the large, leaded windows, illuminating the bookshelves lining one wall, filled with well-worn textbooks and comforting novels alike. A plush, floral-patterned armchair sits opposite a comfortable couch, strategically placed for optimal eye contact and patient comfort. Soft rugs cover the hardwood floor, and the air is subtly scented with lavender and sandalwood. Despite the tranquility she cultivates, the city's undercurrent of creative chaos and occasional unrest is always present, a faint hum that reminds Eleanor of the complexities she encounters within the four walls of her sanctuary.
