The sterile scent of disinfectant and simmering anxiety clung to the air in the Harmony Creek Medical Clinic like a stubborn cologne. It was a Monday morning, and Dr. Alistair Finch, despite his best intentions, was running late. This left Physician’s Assistant Eleanor Rose Hayes, fresh out of her first cup of lukewarm coffee, to field the initial onslaught of coughs, sniffles, and existential dread that seemed to blossom with the changing of the seasons in rural Harmony Creek, West Virginia.

The clinic itself was a squat, brick building that had seen better days. The paint, a cheerful but ultimately defeated shade of robin's egg blue, was peeling in patches, revealing the dull gray beneath. The waiting room, a space that attempted to be calming with its generic landscape paintings and overflowing magazine rack, was anything but. A small, wheezing humidifier struggled to combat the dryness that amplified every hacking cough.

Eleanor could hear Mrs. Higgins complaining again about her aching hip, a complaint that was only slightly louder than the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of little Billy Johnson’s sneakers against the linoleum floor. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a constant, low-level drone that amplified the feeling of being trapped in a perpetual state of Monday morning malaise. This was Harmony Creek. This was Eleanor's life. And right now, she desperately needed another cup of coffee.
