The galley was a shimmering, aluminum-clad oasis of controlled chaos, lit by the unnatural brightness of the 787 Dreamliner’s interior lights. Amelia Rose Harding, her blonde hair pulled back in a severe but elegant bun, carefully arranged the miniature water bottles on a refreshment cart, the plastic clinking a sterile symphony against the drone of the engines. Outside the small porthole window, the world was a canvas of deepest indigo, speckled with the distant, indifferent glitter of stars.

Amelia was flying the red-eye, British Airways Flight BA249 from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. The majority of the 300-odd passengers were currently lost in the restless slumber of jetlag, punctuated by the occasional snore or a whispered request for a blanket. It was 3 AM Pacific Standard Time, but Amelia’s internal clock was stubbornly refusing to acknowledge either Los Angeles or London. Her body was somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic, adrift in a sea of recycled air and the hushed anxieties of strangers.

Tonight, the flight felt… different. Not in a dramatically-engine-fire-mid-flight kind of different. More of a prickling-at-the-back-of-your-neck, things-are-not-quite-right different. And Amelia, with her ten years of experience navigating turbulence both physical and emotional at 30,000 feet, trusted her instincts implicitly.
