Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a hairdresser as the main character:

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, a sound that usually brought a smile to Genevieve Marie Dubois' face. Not today. Today, it sounded like a death knell. Another client, another head of hair that needed rescuing, another hour spent battling split ends and brassy tones. Genevieve sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose beneath her perpetually smudged glasses. The humidity from the just-opened salon door immediately frizzled the stray tendrils that escaped her messy bun.

**Setting:**

"Shear Perfection" was nestled in the heart of the historic district of Port Serenity, a quaint coastal town in Maine, known for its lobster shacks and breathtaking ocean views. The salon itself was a testament to Genevieve's quirky personality. Peeling lavender paint adorned the Victorian facade, contrasting sharply with the neon-pink lettering of the salon's name. Inside, antique barber chairs, rescued from estate sales, sat alongside modern, sleek styling stations. Bottles of brightly colored hair dye lined the shelves like a painter's palette, and the air was thick with the sweet, slightly chemical scent of perm solution and floral shampoo. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the carefully curated collection of vintage hair dryers that Genevieve insisted on displaying, despite their complete impracticality. The floor was a kaleidoscope of brightly colored tiles, each one hand-painted by Genevieve herself, a testament to her artistic spirit that often felt suffocated by the demands of everyday salon life.
