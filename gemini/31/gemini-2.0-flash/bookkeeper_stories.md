The fluorescent lights of "Numbers R Us" hummed a monotonous, buzzing lullaby, a sound that usually lulled Beatrice Eleanor Plum to a state of blissful focus. But today, the hum felt more like a persistent, irritating fly, buzzing around the edges of her already frayed nerves. Beatrice sat hunched over a towering stack of invoices, their crinkled edges practically begging for her attention, but her mind refused to cooperate. Usually, the ordered chaos of columns and decimal points brought her a sense of profound satisfaction, a feeling akin to a musician finally tuning a discordant instrument. Today, though, the numbers swam before her eyes like angry bees, threatening to sting her into oblivion.

The setting was the back office of "Numbers R Us," a small, family-run accounting firm tucked away in a strip mall on the outskirts of Willow Creek, Ohio. The office was functional but far from inspiring. Beige was the prevailing color: beige walls, beige carpet, beige desks, even Beatrice suspected the coffee in the ancient pot in the corner might be beige. A lone, wilting fern sat precariously on the windowsill, its brown tips a testament to Beatrice's less-than-stellar green thumb. The only splash of color came from the meticulously organized files lining the walls, each labeled with the client's name in Beatrice's neat, blocky handwriting. Outside, the relentless Midwestern sun beat down on the asphalt parking lot, reflecting heat back into the already stifling room. Beatrice sighed, adjusted her bifocals, and took another sip of lukewarm coffee. Today was going to be a long one.
