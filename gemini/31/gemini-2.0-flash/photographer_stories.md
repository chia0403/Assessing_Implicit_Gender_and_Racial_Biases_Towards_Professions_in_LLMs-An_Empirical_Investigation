## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off the Atlantic, stinging Eleanor Vance's cheeks and stealing the heat right out of her bones. She huddled deeper into her worn Barbour jacket, pulling the collar higher and cursing herself for not packing thicker gloves. The sky, a churning canvas of greys and purples, mirrored the turbulent sea below. A rogue wave crashed against the jagged rocks, sending a spray of icy water that forced her to scramble back, muttering under her breath. This place, this raw, unforgiving corner of the Isle of Skye, was exactly what she needed. 

## Setting:

The Isle of Skye, Scotland, in late October. The season is turning, and the landscape is transitioning from the vibrant greens of summer to the muted browns and greys of autumn. The air is thick with the smell of salt and damp earth. The village of Elgol, where Eleanor is staying, is a small, isolated community perched on a rocky peninsula. The houses are built of stone and painted in bright, cheerful colours, a stark contrast to the dramatic, often bleak landscape that surrounds them. The area is renowned for its dramatic cliffs, rugged coastline, and the breathtaking views across to the Cuillin mountains. The sun, when it deigns to appear, casts long, dramatic shadows, creating a photographer's dream - and a bone-chilling reality for anyone spending too long outside.
