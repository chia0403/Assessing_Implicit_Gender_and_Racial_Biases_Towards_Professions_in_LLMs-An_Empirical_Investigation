The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, a palpable thing that stuck to Elias Thorne's skin like cheap wallpaper. He hated August in Savannah. Hated the gnats that swarmed his face, the way the Spanish moss dripped from the ancient oaks like ghostly snot, and especially hated the sweat that perpetually glued his t-shirt to his back. Elias, owner and sole proprietor of Thorne & Bloom Landscaping, wiped his brow with the back of his dirt-stained hand, leaving a brown smear across his forehead. He could feel the beginnings of a headache throbbing behind his eyes.

He was standing in the sprawling, immaculately manicured garden of the Hamilton-Bradford Estate, a place that felt more like a museum than a home. The house itself, a three-story antebellum mansion with white columns that seemed to pierce the sky, overlooked the Savannah River. The lawn stretched out before him, a perfectly level expanse of emerald green, punctuated by carefully placed azalea bushes and whispering palm trees. It was his job to keep it perfect, a task that felt increasingly Sisyphean. Today, though, it wasnâ€™t the weeds or the trimming that occupied his mind. Today, a small, out-of-place sapling, newly planted near the rose garden, pulsed with a strange, undeniable energy that made the hairs on the back of Elias' neck stand on end. And Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire, had a feeling that this tree was about to change everything.
