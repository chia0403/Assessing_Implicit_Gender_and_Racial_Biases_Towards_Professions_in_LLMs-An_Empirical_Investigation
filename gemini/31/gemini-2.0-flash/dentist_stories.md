The high-pitched whine of the drill, a sound Dr. Amelia Thorne had grown almost fond of over the years, vibrated through her gloved hand. Today, however, it felt particularly grating. She was hunched over Mrs. Gable's gaping maw, the fluorescent light reflecting harshly off the stainless steel instruments arrayed on the tray beside her, and a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. It wasn't Mrs. Gable, bless her soul, who was causing the unease. It was the silence outside the door. A silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the waiting room, a sound usually masked by the cheerful chatter of patients and the gentle strumming of the classical radio station.

Amelia practiced at "Thorne & Son: Dentistry with a Smile," a modest practice nestled on the second floor of a Victorian building in the heart of Harmony Falls, Vermont. Harmony Falls was exactly what its name suggested - a picturesque town where life moved at a glacial pace, secrets simmered beneath the surface, and the biggest excitement was the annual maple syrup festival. The building itself was a testament to small-town charm, with its creaky wooden floors, floral wallpaper peeling at the edges, and windows overlooking the town square. The practice had been her father's pride and joy, and Amelia, after much deliberation, had reluctantly taken it over after his passing a year ago. It was a constant reminder of him, a bittersweet blend of legacy and responsibility.

But today, the familiar comfort of the practice felt different. It feltâ€¦empty.
