Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The persistent chime of the lobby's Art Deco doorbell, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had heard approximately 27,384 times since she'd taken the concierge position at The Grand Meridian Hotel, sliced through the early morning quiet like a butter knife through warm toast. Beatrice sighed, a tiny, almost imperceptible sound that barely ruffled the perfectly coiffed waves of her silver hair. 6:17 AM. Far too early for check-ins, much too late for late-night revelers. It was, almost invariably, a guest with a ridiculous request or a misplaced sense of urgency. She smoothed the lapel of her navy blue uniform, straightened the ever-so-slightly askew brass nameplate, and pasted on the most reassuring, practiced smile she could muster. Whatever awaited her on the other side of the imposing mahogany doors, Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, guardian of The Grand Meridian's secrets and soother of its guests' anxieties, was ready. (Or at least, she would be after her first sip of Earl Grey, which was growing lukewarm in its porcelain cup behind the desk.)

**Setting:**

The Grand Meridian Hotel occupies a prime piece of real estate on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. Built in the roaring twenties, it exudes an old-world glamour that is both carefully preserved and subtly modernized. Think: crystal chandeliers the size of small cars, polished marble floors reflecting the city lights, and plush velvet seating arranged in intimate groupings. The lobby, Beatrice's domain, is a carefully curated symphony of beige, gold, and the occasional splash of emerald green from the strategically placed potted ferns.

Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows in the mornings, illuminating the intricate plasterwork on the ceiling and casting dancing shadows across the antique rugs. The air is perpetually perfumed with a delicate blend of lilies, beeswax polish, and a hint of something indescribably expensive. It's a place where whispers carry more weight than shouts, where discretion is paramount, and where the wealthiest, most influential, and sometimes, most eccentric people in the world come to rest their heads.
