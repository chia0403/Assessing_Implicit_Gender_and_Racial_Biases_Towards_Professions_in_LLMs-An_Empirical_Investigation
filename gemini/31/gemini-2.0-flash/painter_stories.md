## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, fragrant air hung heavy in the small courtyard of "Casa Rosa," a rambling, two-story house painted a vibrant shade of flamingo pink. Bougainvillea, a riot of fuchsia and orange, cascaded over the wrought-iron balconies, their thorny branches scratching softly against the plaster. The courtyard itself was paved with uneven terracotta tiles, baking under the relentless midday sun of Oaxaca, Mexico. A trickling fountain, adorned with chipped Talavera tiles, provided the only relief from the oppressive heat, its gentle murmur a constant, soothing presence.

**Opening:**

The brush trembled in the hand of Cordelia Beatrice Ainsworth. Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring her vision. Damn the humidity. Damn the mosquitos that buzzed incessantly around her head. And damn this blank canvas that mocked her with its emptiness. It was supposed to be a simple commission: a portrait of Doña Elena de la Vega, the matriarch of one of Oaxaca's wealthiest families. Yet, Cordelia had been staring at it for three days, unable to capture the subtle arrogance and deep-seated sorrow that swirled in the old woman's eyes.

She dipped the brush into a pool of crimson paint, intending to capture the shade of Doña Elena's silk shawl, but her hand faltered. The crimson seemed too…loud. Too brash. It didn't reflect the weight of centuries etched onto the Doña's face. With a frustrated sigh, Cordelia flung the brush onto the worn table beside her, scattering a constellation of paint splatters across its surface. She needed inspiration. She needed a distraction. She needed, more than anything, a strong shot of mezcal.
