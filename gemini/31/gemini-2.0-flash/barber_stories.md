## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Tony's Trim & Shave" jingled, a cheerful sound that was quickly swallowed by the comforting aroma of sandalwood and bay rum. A gust of wind, still clinging to the last vestiges of winter, swept in, making the single overhead bulb flicker and causing Anthony "Tony" Salvatore, mid-shave on a regular customer, to pause with his straight razor poised just above Mr. Henderson’s Adam’s apple.

"Whoa there, Tony," Mr. Henderson mumbled, his voice muffled by the lather. "Almost lost a year of my life right there."

Tony Salvatore, a man whose hands knew the angles of a jawline better than he knew the constellations in the night sky, chuckled. “Just keeping you on your toes, Harry. Wouldn’t want you getting bored under my expert care.” He carefully re-adjusted the razor, his dark eyes, framed by a thick salt-and-pepper mustache, twinkling with genuine affection. "Though, I'll admit, that wind feels like it could cut a man cleaner than this blade."

He glanced towards the door, the last tendrils of the wind carrying a scattering of withered leaves across the worn linoleum floor. Business had been slow since the snow started melting. He hoped this new customer, whoever they were, had more than just the biting wind to offer.

## Setting:

The year is 1968. Tony’s Trim & Shave, a small, single-room barbershop, is located on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of the Italian-American neighborhood of "Little Italy" in Providence, Rhode Island. The building itself is a two-story brick structure, weathered but well-maintained, with Tony’s barbershop occupying the ground floor and a family living upstairs.

Inside, the shop is a testament to timeless tradition. Two well-worn barber chairs, upholstered in faded red leather, dominate the space. A long, mirrored wall stretches along one side, reflecting the shelves lined with bottles of hair tonic, shaving creams, and aftershaves. The air is thick with the scent of these classic barbering products, a nostalgic blend that evokes a sense of comfort and familiarity.

Newspaper clippings and photographs, mostly family portraits and old baseball teams, are haphazardly pinned to the wall beside the mirror, a visual history of Tony's life and the neighborhood he calls home. A vintage cash register sits on a small wooden counter, alongside a cigar box overflowing with loose change. The floor is covered in worn linoleum, patterned with a faded geometric design, and the single overhead bulb casts a warm, slightly yellow glow.

The whole shop breathes with a sense of history, a place where men gather not just for a haircut or a shave, but for conversation, camaraderie, and a connection to a simpler time. It's a sanctuary from the changing world outside, a haven where tradition reigns supreme, at least for now.
