## Story Opening:

The relentless Adriatic wind, a seasoned sculptor of stone and soul, howled a mournful symphony against the ancient ramparts of Dubrovnik. Alistair Finnigan O’Connell, architect and reluctant romantic, pulled his wool scarf tighter, burying his chin against the chill. He squinted, his salt-and-pepper eyebrows knit together as he surveyed the city. Even through the swirling rain and gathering dusk, Dubrovnik remained a breathtaking defiance of time, a testament to the enduring power of human ingenuity and, Alistair suspected, stubborn Irish luck.

He took a swig from his lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the honeyed hues that still clung to the limestone walls. He was here on a commission, of course. A wealthy, demanding art collector wanted to build a modern, “symbiotic” structure within the city walls - a feat Alistair considered akin to painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. But the money was good, desperately good, and Alistair was a practical man first, and an idealist when the bills were paid. He just hoped he could accomplish the impossible without defacing a masterpiece.
