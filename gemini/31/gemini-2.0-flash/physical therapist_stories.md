The antiseptic smell of the clinic clung to Dr. Anya Petrova like a second skin. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the sycamore trees lining Willow Creek Boulevard, but inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed a sterile harmony that was supposed to offer comfort and healing. Anya sighed, watching the last rays of the setting sun paint long, orange streaks across the linoleum floor. Another day, another dozen aching backs, frozen shoulders, and stubborn knee replacements. Sometimes she wondered if all the stretching and strengthening and ultrasound gel in the world could truly conquer the relentless march of time, or if she was just a glorified band-aid for the inevitable decay.

Her clinic, "Revive Physical Therapy," was located in a strip mall in the quaint, albeit rapidly gentrifying, town of Oak Haven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The building itself was unremarkable, a beige box sandwiched between "Mama Rosa's Pizza" and "Fido's Fancy Cuts," but Anya had poured her heart and soul (and a hefty chunk of her student loans) into making the interior welcoming. Soft, earth-toned paint adorned the walls, and prints of local landscapes, captured in the vibrant hues of spring and summer, offered a visual escape for her patients. A small water fountain bubbled gently in the corner, its gentle splashing a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the treadmill and the occasional groan of someone pushing through their pain. It wasn't much, but it was hers, a space she had built to help people reclaim their bodies and their lives.
