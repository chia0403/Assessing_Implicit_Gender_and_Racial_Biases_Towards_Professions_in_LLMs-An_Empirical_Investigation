## The Dust & The Echo

**Setting:** The relentless sun beat down on Harmony Gulch, Montana. It was late August, the time of year when the grass, starved of moisture for weeks, crackled underfoot like brittle bones. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of thunderstorms that never seemed to arrive. The only sounds were the mournful creak of the windmill at the far end of the valley, the distant lowing of cattle, and the incessant buzzing of flies drawn to the sweat that perpetually clung to skin and leather. Harmony Gulch wasn't a place for the faint of heart, but it was home to Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood.

**Opening:** The dust clung to Ezekiel Blackwood like a second skin. He stood on the porch of his weathered farmhouse, the same porch his grandfather had built a century ago, his calloused hands gripping the worn railing. His gaze, the color of a storm-bruised sky, swept across the parched landscape. The Blackwood Ranch was his inheritance, his legacy, and right now, it looked like a losing battle. He’d seen droughts before, tougher ones even, but this felt different. This felt like the land itself was giving up. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the red dirt below, the sound a sharp counterpoint to the oppressive silence. “Damn shame,” he muttered, the words swallowed by the vast emptiness of the gulch. He needed rain. He needed it bad. And he needed it now, before the whole damn thing turned to dust and echoes of what used to be.
