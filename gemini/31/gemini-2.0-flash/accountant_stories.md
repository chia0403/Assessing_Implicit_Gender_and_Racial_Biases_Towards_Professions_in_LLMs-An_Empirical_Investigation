Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and main character details you requested:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the silent, internal symphony of numbers swirling in Mildred Abigail Periwinkle's mind. Spread before her were the meticulously organized receipts, invoices, and bank statements of "Bloom & Brew," a local flower shop and coffee bar hybrid. Outside, the late afternoon sun was painting long shadows across Willow Creek's main street, but Mildred remained oblivious, her brow furrowed in concentration. She was on the hunt for a discrepancy, a phantom decimal point that dared to hide in the labyrinthine financial records. It was more than just a job for Mildred; it was a sacred duty, a quest for order in a chaotic world.
The setting was a small, unassuming office tucked away on the second floor of an older building on Willow Creek's main street. A single window looked out onto the bustling street below, but was often blocked by files. The walls, painted a neutral beige, were adorned with framed certificates of accounting proficiency and a motivational poster featuring a kitten clinging to a rope.
