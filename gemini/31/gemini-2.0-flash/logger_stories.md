## Story Opening:

The biting wind, scented with pine and damp earth, whipped at Jedediah "Jed" Monroe's beard, tugging strands of gray across his weathered face. He spit a stream of dark juice, the taste of chewing tobacco a familiar comfort against the cold. The dawn was just a smear of bruised purple and orange bleeding across the eastern sky, but Jedediah could already hear the grumble of engines, the crackling of radios, and the distant, echoing thud of falling timber. Another day in the cut, another day wrestling giants. He tightened his grip on the worn handle of his axe, the weight a familiar extension of his own arm, and turned to face the looming silhouette of the old-growth forest.

## Setting:

The story unfolds in the heart of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington State. Specifically, itâ€™s set within a privately-owned logging concession nestled deep in the Hoh Rainforest, a place where ancient Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees reach towards the perpetually overcast sky. The ground is a tapestry of emerald moss and decaying leaves, thick and spongy beneath the feet. The air is perpetually damp, laden with the smell of pine, cedar, and the earthy aroma of decomposition. The constant drizzle, often escalating into torrential downpours, makes the landscape a challenging, but breathtakingly beautiful, place to work and live. The logging camp itself is a cluster of weathered trailers and hastily built structures, clinging precariously to a relatively flat patch of land carved out of the dense forest. A constant buzz of activity emanates from the camp: the clang of metal, the roar of machinery, and the gruff voices of the men and women who have dedicated their lives to harvesting the forest's bounty.
