Okay, here is a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character:

**Setting:**

The small town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone elseâ€™s business, and the local butcher shop was the epicenter of it all. The air, even in the heart of summer, held a crispness that hinted at the mountains' nearness, and the scent of woodsmoke and honeysuckle usually mixed with the savory aroma of cured meats emanating from "The Havenwood Hanger," as the shop was affectionately known. The buildings were mostly aged brick and weathered wood, painted in muted shades of green and brown, clinging to a Main Street that had seen better days. The rhythms of life were slow and predictable; church on Sunday, the Havenwood Hornets football games on Friday nights, and the steady hum of business at The Havenwood Hanger throughout the week.

**Opening:**

Edmund Bartholomew Finnegan, a man whose hands knew the language of meat better than most men knew their own mothers tongue, wiped his brow with a blood-stained rag. The summer heat was oppressive, even with the large industrial fan whirring in the corner of The Havenwood Hanger. Flies buzzed lazily around a hanging string of sausages, and Edmund slapped at them absentmindedly, his thoughts elsewhere. He stared out the window, past the faded lettering that advertised "Finest Cuts in Havenwood," at the old Ford pickup truck idling across the street. Jedediah "Jed" Perkins, the town's self-proclaimed conspiracy theorist, was behind the wheel, staring back with an intensity that could curdle milk. Edmund sighed. Jed had been staring at the shop for three days now, ever since that unusual deer carcass showed up on Edmund's doorstep. Unusual because it was missing its heart, and because it was *way* too early in the season for deer to be running so close to town. Edmund knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the mundane routine of slicing chops and grinding sausage was about to be violently interrupted. Something was rotten in Havenwood, and Edmund Bartholomew Finnegan was about to find himself in the middle of it.
