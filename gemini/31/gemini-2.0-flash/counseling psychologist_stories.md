Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the full name of the main character, a counseling psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of old paper and lavender sachets hung heavy in the air of Serenity Falls Counseling Center, a small, Queen Anne Victorian house converted into a haven for troubled minds. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her brow furrowed with concentration, traced the rim of her teacup, the delicate china humming softly against the chipped edge. Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows, mimicking the frantic tempo of the city just beyond the sleepy suburban border. She could hear Mrs. Higgins, the receptionist, humming along to some old Motown tune on her crackly radio, a comforting, albeit slightly off-key, counterpoint to the storm brewing both outside and, she suspected, within the soul she was about to meet.

Eleanor glanced at the worn leather armchair facing her desk, the seat of countless confessions and tearful revelations. It was almost 9:55 AM, and in five minutes, her first client of the day, a young man named Mark Reynolds, was scheduled to arrive. His initial intake form painted a familiar picture: anxiety, social isolation, a general sense of being adrift. Eleanor sighed, the familiar weight of responsibility settling on her shoulders. She truly wanted to help these people find their way, but the weight could be a heavy burden to bear.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is **Serenity Falls Counseling Center**, a converted Queen Anne Victorian house located in a quiet, leafy suburb bordering a major city.

*   **Exterior:** The house is painted a faded, soft yellow with white trim. It features a wide porch, a turret, and a small, overgrown garden. It's charming but slightly dilapidated, reflecting the wear and tear of time and limited funding.

*   **Interior (Specifically Eleanor's Office):** Cozy and cluttered. The walls are painted a calming sage green. Bookshelves overflowing with texts on psychology, philosophy, and literature line one wall. The room is filled with antique furniture - a large, mahogany desk, the aforementioned leather armchair, and a small, round table with two mismatched chairs. There's a noticeable effort to create a soothing atmosphere: soft lighting from a Tiffany-style lamp, a small fountain trickling gently in the corner, and a collection of potted plants. The overall feel is welcoming but also slightly old-fashioned.

**Main Character:**

**Full Name:** Dr. Eleanor Vance

**Occupation:** Counseling Psychologist.
