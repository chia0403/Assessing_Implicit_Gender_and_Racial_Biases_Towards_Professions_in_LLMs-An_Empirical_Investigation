## Story Opening:

The hum was a constant companion, a familiar blanket thrown over Arthur Reginald Finch's existence. Tonight, however, it wasn't the usual comforting drone of the power supply to Station KROW's aging transmitter. This was different. This hum felt…wrong. It vibrated not just in his ears, but deep within his chest, a low, resonant thrum that made the fluorescent lights of his cramped workshop flicker erratically. Arthur paused, his soldering iron held mid-air above the tangle of wires he was wrestling with, and listened intently. The radio static, usually a predictable white noise, now crackled with an unnatural urgency. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine. He’d been a radio technician for longer than he cared to admit, tuning out static was practically second nature, but this felt like something was trying to break through.

## Setting:

The story is set in the small, isolated town of Redemption Falls, Montana, in 1958. Arthur's workshop is a converted storage room in the basement of the KROW radio station, the only source of news and entertainment for miles around. The room is cramped, cluttered with disassembled radios, spare parts, vacuum tubes, and oscilloscopes. Dust motes dance in the harsh, flickering fluorescent light. The walls are lined with shelves overflowing with technical manuals and worn copies of "Popular Electronics" magazine. The air smells of ozone, solder fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of old machinery. Outside, the Montana night is vast and silent, punctuated only by the distant howl of coyotes and the blinking red beacon atop the radio tower that pierces the star-dusted sky. The nearest town of any significant size is a full two-hour drive away, across winding mountain roads, isolating Redemption Falls and its residents from the rest of the world, making KROW, and Arthur Finch, all the more vital.
