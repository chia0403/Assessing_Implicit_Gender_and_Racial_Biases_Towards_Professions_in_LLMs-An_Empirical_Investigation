## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The pre-dawn air in Havenwood was a biting, lavender-laced chill that clung to everything, especially the exposed brick of “Flour Power,” the beloved bakery. Inside, the air was a cocoon of warmth, smelling of toasted hazelnuts and warm butter. Amelia Beatrice Bellweather, her auburn hair escaping its messy bun in defiant tendrils, kneaded dough with a fierce rhythm. The repetitive motion was soothing, a familiar anchor against the rising anxiety that threatened to choke her like a stale croissant. Today was the day. The day Havenwood held its annual Harvest Festival, and the day Amelia, after years of dreaming, finally entered her famous spiced apple crumble into the prestigious baking competition. 

**Setting:**

Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the ancient Whisperwind Mountains, was a village steeped in tradition. Quaint cobblestone streets wound past timber-framed houses, their window boxes overflowing with autumnal blooms. "Flour Power" was situated on the corner of Elderberry Lane and Market Square, its bright blue awning a beacon on even the gloomiest of days. Inside, mismatched vintage furniture offered cozy seating for patrons, while shelves overflowed with crusty loaves, delicate pastries, and jars of homemade jams. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the copper pots hanging above the brick-lined oven. The bakery was more than just a business; it was a haven, a place where the scent of freshly baked bread could chase away the shadows and bring the community together.
