The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop 'n Go" hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound Amelia Eleanor Hawthorne had come to find both irritating and strangely comforting. It was Friday night, the witching hour for convenience store cashiers â€“ a chaotic mix of bleary-eyed parents grabbing milk and diapers, teenagers fueling up on sugary snacks before a night out, and the lone wolves seeking solace in a microwaved burrito and a lottery ticket.

Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, leaned against the counter, her chipped, floral-painted fingernails drumming a silent rhythm on the laminate surface. Outside, the rain hammered against the dusty windows, blurring the neon signs into abstract streaks of colour. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee, day-old donuts, and that vaguely chemical scent that seemed to cling to every surface in Quick Stop 'n Go.

This particular Quick Stop 'n Go, the one Amy had called her workplace for the past three years, was located on the outskirts of Havenwood, a small, unassuming town nestled in the heart of rural Pennsylvania. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, where gossip spread like wildfire, and where the most exciting thing to happen all week was Mrs. Abernathy's prize-winning zucchini growing to an unprecedented size. It was, in short, boring. But it was also home.

And tonight, as the rain continued its relentless assault and a line of customers began to snake towards her register, Amelia Eleanor Hawthorne knew, deep in her gut, that something was about to disrupt the quiet monotony of Havenwood, and her life along with it. The feeling was a strange mix of trepidation and a peculiar, almost exhilarating, anticipation. The kind of feeling that buzzed in your blood, whispering, "Something's coming."
