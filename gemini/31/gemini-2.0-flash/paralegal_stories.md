The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song above Amelia Grace Thornton's head, a soundtrack that had accompanied countless late nights and lukewarm cups of office coffee. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law offices of "Stern, Roth & Davies," blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolor mess of grey and yellow. It was just past 10 PM on a Thursday, and Amelia was surrounded by stacks of depositions, witness statements, and enough legal briefs to build a small fort. The scent of old paper and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the occasional sigh that escaped her lips. Amelia, a paralegal with a sharp mind and a crippling caffeine addiction, was knee-deep in the Johnson v. Interstate Shipping case, a multi-million dollar lawsuit that promised to either make or break the firm (and probably her sanity). Outside, the world was vibrant with life; inside, it was just Amelia and the ghosts of legal precedents.
