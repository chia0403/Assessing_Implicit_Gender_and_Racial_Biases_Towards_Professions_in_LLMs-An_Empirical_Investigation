The hammer echoed a sharp, metallic cry across the valley, a counterpoint to the chirping crickets and the distant bleating of sheep. Sweat stung at Abraham "Abe" Elias Thorne's brow, blurring the already dizzying vista of rolling hills and patchwork fields that stretched out below. He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a grime streak across his forehead that looked suspiciously like charcoal.

The setting was the sleepy, almost forgotten village of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. The air here held a certain ancient stillness, broken only by the sounds of nature and the occasional sputtering of a rusted pickup truck. Abe was perched precariously on the steeply sloped roof of the old Oakhaven General Store, a two-story wooden building that had seen better days. Its once-vibrant red paint was now faded and peeling, like sunburnt skin, and the roof, well, the roof was practically hemorrhaging shingles.

The General Store was the heart of Oakhaven, or what was left of it. A place where locals gathered to swap stories, buy supplies, and lament the slow, steady decline of their way of life. Abe, raised in Oakhaven, had watched the town wither, families move away in search of opportunity, and the store itself teeter on the brink of closure more than once. Now, with the recent heavy rains, the leaking roof threatened to finally push it over the edge. Replacing it was Abe's small contribution, his way of holding onto a piece of his past, a piece of himself. He just hoped the old timbers could hold him long enough to finish the job.
