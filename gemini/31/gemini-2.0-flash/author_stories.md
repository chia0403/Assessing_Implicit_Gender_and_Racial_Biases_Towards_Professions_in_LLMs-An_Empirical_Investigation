The chipped mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Thorne's hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window. The view offered little solace – a perpetually grey London sky hanging heavy over Primrose Hill, the leafless trees skeletal against its muted canvas. She’d sought refuge here, in this tiny, overpriced flat overlooking the park, hoping the change of scenery would break the creative drought that had gripped her for months. 

This flat, charming as a postcard but soul-crushingly silent, was her writer's retreat, her self-imposed prison. It smelled faintly of old books and desperation. The walls, painted a cheerless shade of off-white, were sparsely adorned with photographs: Amelia's grandmother, a flamboyant woman with a penchant for peacock feathers; Amelia receiving the 'Debut Author of the Year' award, her face a mask of forced composure; and a faded print of Virginia Woolf's Monk's House garden, a constant, mocking reminder of creative legacies she felt hopelessly inadequate to emulate.

Her writing desk, a chaotic jumble of notebooks, pens, and half-empty teacups, sat beneath the window, a testament to her fruitless efforts. The screen of her laptop glowed faintly, a blank document blinking mockingly. Amelia Beatrice Thorne, author of the critically acclaimed (but commercially underwhelming) historical romance, "The Crimson Corset," was officially, agonizingly, blocked.
