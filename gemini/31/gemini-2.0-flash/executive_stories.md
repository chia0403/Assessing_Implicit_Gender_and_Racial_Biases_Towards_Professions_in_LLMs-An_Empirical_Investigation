## Story Opening:

The rain was a cold, insistent percussion on the panoramic window of Elias Thorne’s corner office, mirroring the drumming anxiety in his chest. Sixty floors above the churning, neon-slick streets of Manhattan, the city looked beautiful, powerful, untouchable. Except, it felt like it was all teetering on the edge, ready to crumble beneath the weight of tomorrow's market opening. Elias swirled the remaining whiskey in his crystal tumbler, the amber liquid catching the faint, distorted reflections of the skyscrapers opposite him. His reflection was just as distorted – a man pushing fifty, with eyes that had seen too many late nights and made too many compromises, staring back at him. He wasn't sure which was more unsettling: the city outside, or the man in the glass.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne's office is located on the 60th floor of the Thorne & Sterling headquarters, a monolithic glass and steel skyscraper dominating the Lower Manhattan skyline. The space is deliberately minimalist, a calculated display of understated wealth and power. Polished concrete floors are softened by a hand-knotted Persian rug in muted greys and blues. Modern art adorns the walls - abstract pieces that cost more than most people's homes. The furniture is sleek and expensive, mostly leather and chrome. Dominating the room is a large, custom-built desk made of dark, reclaimed wood. The entire north wall is a floor-to-ceiling window offering a breathtaking, if somewhat intimidating, view of the city. The air is always meticulously climate-controlled and subtly scented with sandalwood. The overall impression is one of refined, almost sterile, control, a world away from the chaotic energy of the city below.
