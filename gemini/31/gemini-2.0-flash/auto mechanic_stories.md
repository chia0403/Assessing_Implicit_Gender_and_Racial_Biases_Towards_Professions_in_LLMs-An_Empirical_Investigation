## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and burnt oil clung to the air around Beatrice "Bea" Kowalski like a second skin. Bea sighed, pushing a stray strand of grease-smeared hair from her forehead with the back of her hand. The rhythmic clang of her wrench against stubborn lug nuts was usually a soothing balm to her nerves, a comforting symphony of metal and muscle. Today, though, it felt like a dull, throbbing ache echoing the anxiety churning in her gut. Mrs. Henderson's beat-up Buick Skylark, usually a reliable source of income and minimal fuss, had decided to throw a hissy fit right as the rain started coming down in sheets, turning the parking lot outside Kowalski's Auto Repair into a shimmering, reflecting lake.

**Setting:**

Kowalski's Auto Repair was a fixture in the sleepy, Rust Belt town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The building itself was a weathered, brick structure, its faded red paint peeling in places like sunburnt skin. A neon sign, sputtering intermittently, proudly proclaimed "KOWALSKI'S AUTO REPAIR - HONEST WORK, FAIR PRICE." Inside, the shop was a carefully curated chaos of tools, spare parts, and the lingering scent of every conceivable automotive fluid. Three lifts occupied the main bay, each currently housing a different patient in various stages of repair. Walls were adorned with vintage pin-up posters, calendars featuring classic cars, and a hand-drawn sign that read "Keep Out! (Unless you brought donuts)." In the corner, near the ancient, perpetually-whirring coffee machine, sat Bea's desk, a testament to organized disarray - stacks of invoices, worn service manuals, and a half-eaten box of peanut butter crackers. Outside, a small, gravel parking lot barely contained the waiting queue of cars, a motley collection of pickups, minivans, and the occasional classic muscle car, all vying for Bea's expert attention. The entire place spoke of years of hard work, honest living, and a deep-seated love for the mechanical heart that kept Havenwood humming.
