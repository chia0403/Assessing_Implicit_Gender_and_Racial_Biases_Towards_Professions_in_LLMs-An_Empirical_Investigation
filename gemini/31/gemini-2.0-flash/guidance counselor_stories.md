The chipped ceramic mug warmed Ms. Eleanor Rose Cartwright's hands as she stared out the window at the dreary Tuesday morning. Gray sky, gray pavement, and a general air of grayness that seemed to permeate everything within the hallowed halls of Northwood High. Eleanor, or Ms. Cartwright as she was professionally known, had been a guidance counselor at Northwood for fifteen years, and while she loved her job, she couldn't help but feel a little disheartened on days like these. The teenage angst seemed to thicken in the humidity, clinging to the air like a persistent fog.

Her small office, a haven of slightly-too-bright posters and mismatched furniture salvaged from various school remodels, offered a stark contrast to the dullness outside. Motivational quotes - "Believe in Yourself," "Reach for the Stars," and a particularly ironic one featuring a smiling sloth that read "Slow and Steady Wins the Race" - plastered the walls, battling against the pervasive gloom. A stack of student files teetered precariously on her desk, each one a miniature universe of hopes, anxieties, and potential, waiting to be navigated. The scent of stale coffee and desperation, a perfume unique to high school guidance offices everywhere, hung heavy in the air.
