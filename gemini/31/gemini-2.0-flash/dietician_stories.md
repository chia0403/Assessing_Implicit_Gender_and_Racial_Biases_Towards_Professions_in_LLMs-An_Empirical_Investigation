## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of burnt almond croissants, a travesty in even the best of circumstances, hung heavy in the air, stinging Dr. Eleanor Vance's nostrils as she navigated the chaotic farmers market. It was Saturday morning, her one day of relative peace before the onslaught of calorie counts, carb anxieties, and the perennial "is fruit *really* that bad for me?" questions that plagued her work week. She usually relished these market trips, sourcing vibrant, locally grown ingredients for her meticulously planned recipes, but today, the acrid smell was just another layer in the thick fog of frustration that had settled over her. The reason? A text message, received an hour ago, shattering her carefully constructed weekend serenity like a dropped kombucha bottle.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Portland, Oregon**. More specifically:

*   **Dr. Eleanor Vance's small, sun-drenched apartment** in the Hawthorne district, filled with cookbooks, overflowing spice racks, and a surprising number of house plants that she diligently, almost obsessively, tended. The apartment is a refuge from the city's often overwhelming energy, a place of order and carefully curated calm.
*   **The bustling Portland Farmers Market at PSU** (Portland State University). It's a vibrant scene, a kaleidoscope of colors, scents, and sounds. Local farmers hawk their wares, musicians busk for spare change, and food vendors offer everything from artisanal cheeses to exotic mushrooms. It's a place Eleanor usually finds inspiration, but also a reminder of the conflicting messages people receive about food and health.
*   **"The Balanced Plate," Eleanor's private practice office**, located in a converted Victorian house in Northwest Portland. The office is designed to be calming and inviting, with soft lighting, comfortable seating, and a gallery wall showcasing healthy (and delicious-looking) food photography. It's a place where Eleanor hopes to empower her clients to make positive changes, but often finds herself battling years of ingrained dietary habits and misinformation.

The story may also touch upon other locations within Portland, such as trendy restaurants, independent grocery stores, and maybe even the scenic trails of Forest Park, where Eleanor occasionally seeks solace and inspiration. The city's emphasis on local, sustainable food culture plays a significant role in the narrative.
