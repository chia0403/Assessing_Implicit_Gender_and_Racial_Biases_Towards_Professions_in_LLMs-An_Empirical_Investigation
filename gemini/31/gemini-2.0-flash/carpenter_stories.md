The crisp autumn air, scented with wood shavings and the lingering sweetness of dying leaves, nipped at the exposed skin on Silas Tiberius Thorne’s face. He squinted against the low afternoon sun, its golden light painting the weather-beaten clapboard of his workshop in hues of honey and amber. Around him, the mountains of the Appalachian range stood stoic, their slopes ablaze with the fiery hues of fall foliage. He could see patches of scarlet, burnt orange, and vibrant yellow peeking through the gaps in the dense forest that surrounded the small, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the mountains.

Silas had been a carpenter in Havenwood his entire life, just like his father and his grandfather before him. His hands, calloused and strong from years of planing, sawing, and hammering, were as familiar with the grain of wood as he was with the winding paths of the surrounding forests. His workshop, a ramshackle structure held together more by habit and ingenuity than sound carpentry (a bit of an irony, he often mused), was his sanctuary. Inside, the air hummed with the scent of pine, oak, and walnut – the very breath of the mountains themselves. Today, however, the usual comfort of his workshop felt tinged with unease. He was working on a commission that felt… wrong. A coffin, ordered by Mrs. Eldridge, the town’s elder matriarch, for a purpose no one dared to speak aloud.
