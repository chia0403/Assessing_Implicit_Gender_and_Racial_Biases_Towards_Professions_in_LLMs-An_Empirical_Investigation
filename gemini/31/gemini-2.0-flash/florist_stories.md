## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windowpanes of "Petal & Stem," a small, stubbornly cheerful flower shop nestled on the cobbled High Street of the ancient Scottish fishing village of Stonehaven. The shop, a riot of colour against the grey, was a haven of warmth and the scent of damp earth and blooming promise. Inside, bouquets overflowed from mismatched vases, filling the air with the heady aroma of lilies, roses, and something wild and earthy, like the gorse that clung to the cliffs just beyond the town.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Isobel MacLeod hummed a tuneless melody under her breath as she delicately wired a sprig of lavender into a posy. Outside, the November sky was the colour of a bruised plum, threatening snow. She glanced at the grandfather clock ticking softly in the corner of the shop - five o'clock. Almost time to close. Eleanor brushed a stray wisp of her fiery red hair from her face with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of pollen on her cheek. Another day, another handful of bouquets whispered into existence. She hoped this one, destined for the grieving widow of old Mr. Henderson, would bring a sliver of comfort amidst the inevitable storm of grief. Eleanor had learned, over the years, that even in the face of loss, flowers could sometimes speak louder than words. But tonight, she felt a prickle of unease, a sense of something more than just the biting wind rattling the windows. It was a feeling she couldn't quite name, a disquiet that settled in her bones like the damp chill of the North Sea.
