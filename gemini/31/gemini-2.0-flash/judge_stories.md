## Story Opening:

The incessant buzzing of the fly felt, to Judge Eleanor Ainsworth, like a personal affront. It circled her head, a tiny, winged irritant in the otherwise silent, hushed chamber of her office. Eleanor gripped the worn leather arm of her high-backed chair, willing it to be still. She wasn’t a woman easily rattled. Twenty years on the bench had forged her spine into something resembling tempered steel. But today, the fly, the overflowing inbox, the lingering scent of mothballs from the antique furniture, all conspired to prick the bubble of her carefully cultivated calm.

She sighed, a small, almost imperceptible sound. She was usually at home by now, sipping chamomile tea and losing herself in the pages of a good biography. Instead, she was stuck sifting through the aftermath of the Miller case, the weight of a young man’s life pressing down on her like a physical burden. The jury had reached a verdict of guilty, but something about the whole affair gnawed at Eleanor, a sliver of doubt lodged deep within her gut.

Suddenly, a sharp rap at the door startled her. The fly, momentarily disoriented, buzzed even louder.

"Come in," Eleanor said, her voice a low, steady rumble that belied the unease churning within. The door creaked open, and the young court clerk, Tim, peeked his head in, his face pale.

"Judge Ainsworth," he stammered, "there's... there's someone here to see you. Says it's urgent."

Eleanor frowned. Urgent visits were never good news. "Who is it, Tim?"

He swallowed hard. "He wouldn't give his name. Just said he's got information about the Miller case. He looks... well, he looks a little rough around the edges."

The fly buzzed again, closer this time. Eleanor swatted it away, a sudden, sharp movement. The sliver of doubt in her gut sharpened.

"Send him in, Tim," she said, her voice betraying none of the anxiety that was tightening its grip. "And please, make sure we aren't disturbed."

## Setting:

The setting is the chambers of Judge Eleanor Ainsworth, located on the third floor of the grand, but slightly dilapidated, County Courthouse in the small, rural town of Havenwood, Ohio.

The room is a study in contrasts. High ceilings, adorned with faded plaster moldings, speak to a time of grandeur and civic pride. However, the furniture is old and worn, showing the signs of years of use and a shrinking budget. Bookshelves, overflowing with legal tomes and personal favorites, line one wall. Sunlight streams through the tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A large, mahogany desk dominates the room, currently buried under stacks of files and legal documents. The air hangs heavy with the scent of old paper, leather, and a faint, lingering odor of mothballs, a testament to the building's age and the meticulous (if slightly outdated) practices of its long-term occupants. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet authority, punctuated by the persistent buzzing of a single, stubborn fly.
