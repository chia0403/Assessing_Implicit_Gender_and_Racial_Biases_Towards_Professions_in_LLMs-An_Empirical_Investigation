Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop:

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel, New Orleans. It's late October, just before the frantic energy of Halloween descends upon the city. The air hangs thick and humid, scented with a mixture of jasmine, river water, and the faintest whiff of beignets from a nearby cafe. The hotel lobby is a riot of opulent details: towering Corinthian columns, a shimmering chandelier that could house a flock of pigeons, and plush, velvet furniture that seems to swallow guests whole. Tourists in floral shirts and sensible shoes mingle with impeccably dressed locals, creating a constant hum of conversation and activity.

**Opening:**

Ignatius "Iggy" Broussard adjusted the brim of his maroon bellhop cap, the gold braid scratching lightly against his forehead. Heâ€™d been polishing the brass luggage cart for the last twenty minutes, a task he usually despised, but today it was a welcome distraction. The Grand Majestic was his second home, a gilded cage he simultaneously loved and resented. He knew its hidden corners, the best spots to eavesdrop on juicy conversations, and the quickest routes to avoid Mr. Henderson, the perpetually disgruntled assistant manager. But today, the hotel's familiar rhythms felt off-kilter. A strange anticipation coiled in his gut, a feeling he couldn't quite place but knew was linked to the arrival of *her* reservation. According to the manifest, a Miss Evangeline Dubois was expected.
