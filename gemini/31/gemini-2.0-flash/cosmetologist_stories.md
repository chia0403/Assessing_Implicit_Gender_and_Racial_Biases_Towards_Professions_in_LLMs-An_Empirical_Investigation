## Story Opening:

The humid Savannah air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Seraphina Magnolia Dubois tapped her foot impatiently behind the counter of "Magnolia Bloom Beauty," her own namesake and lifelong dream. The rhythmic click-clack of her patent leather pumps against the faux-hardwood floor was the only sound breaking the afternoon lull. A strand of vibrant turquoise dye, escaped from a rogue tendril in her intricately braided updo, tickled her cheek. She blew it away, the frustration bubbling up inside her.

Mrs. Gable was thirty minutes late for her root touch-up, and Seraphina was starting to picture the woman's silver roots staging a revolt against the honey-blonde highlights Seraphina had painstakingly applied just six weeks ago. More than the lost revenue, Seraphina hated the waste of time. Time she could be spending perfecting the art of ombre brows, experimenting with new vegan mascaras, or, truth be told, finally finishing that historical fiction novel gathering dust on her nightstand.

Seraphina chewed on her lip, the bright pink gloss sheâ€™d crafted herself tasting vaguely of disappointment and crushed dreams. It wasn't just the tardy clients; it was the constant feeling that her creativity, her passion for turning ordinary faces into works of art, was slowly being suffocated by the mundane realities of running a small business.

## Setting:

Magnolia Bloom Beauty was tucked away on a quiet side street, just a block off Savannah's bustling Broughton Street. The building itself was a charming, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian townhouse painted a cheerful shade of wisteria purple. A wrought-iron sign adorned with blooming magnolias swung gently in the breeze.

Inside, the salon was a vibrant explosion of color and texture. Deep teal walls were adorned with vintage posters featuring glamorous actresses of the Golden Age, and shelves overflowed with an eclectic mix of high-end cosmetics and handcrafted beauty products. Seraphina had tried to create a space that felt both luxurious and welcoming, a place where women could come to not only enhance their physical beauty but also feel pampered and empowered.

Three stylist stations, each with a large, ornate mirror, faced a wall lined with plush velvet waiting chairs. The air perpetually smelled of exotic oils, hairspray, and the faint, comforting aroma of Seraphina's signature chamomile tea, which she brewed fresh every morning for her clients. Despite the efforts to create a tranquil oasis, a nagging feeling of impending change, of something brewing beneath the surface, seemed to permeate even the sweetest scents within Magnolia Bloom Beauty.
