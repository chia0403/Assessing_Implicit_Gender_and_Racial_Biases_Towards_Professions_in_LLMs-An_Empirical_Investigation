The clatter of tiny, sticky fingers against the plastic train track was a surprisingly soothing sound to Elara Maeve Oâ€™Connell, especially after the screaming match over the coveted blue engine had finally subsided. It was a sound that meant (for the next few minutes, anyway) relative peace in the chaotic ecosystem that was the "Little Sprouts" daycare, her domain of controlled (and sometimes, not-so-controlled) pandemonium.

The setting was the main play area of Little Sprouts, a converted storefront on a busy corner of Willow Creek, Iowa. Sunlight streamed through the large, rainbow-stained windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above a sea of brightly colored toys. One wall was dominated by a mural of a fantastical forest, painted with the kind of cheerfully inaccurate detail only a well-meaning, but slightly artistically challenged, parent volunteer could achieve. Bins overflowing with mismatched blocks lined another wall, guarded by a perpetually grumpy-looking stuffed bear. In the center of the room, a well-worn rug depicting the alphabet served as a communal gathering spot.

Elara, perched on a miniature plastic chair that threatened to collapse under her at any moment, surveyed her charges. Four-year-old Leo was meticulously arranging dinosaurs in a perfect circle, while two-year-old Maya was attempting to eat a crayon. A sigh escaped her lips, a mixture of exhaustion and affection. It was 2:47 PM - just over an hour until the parents arrived, and an eternity in daycare time. Anything could, and probably would, happen before then.
