## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A desolate, pre-dawn truck stop somewhere on Interstate 80, Nebraska. The biting wind whips across the cracked asphalt, carrying the scent of diesel and stale coffee. A single flickering neon sign reading "EAT" buzzes intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the few hulking semi-trucks parked haphazardly across the lot. The vast, flat landscape stretches out in all directions, an endless expanse of brown fields barely visible in the dim light.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret "Maggie" O'Connell slammed the door of her Peterbilt 379, the metallic clang echoing through the otherwise quiet truck stop. A plume of vapor puffed from her mouth, quickly dissipating in the frigid air. She adjusted the worn leather gloves on her calloused hands, her face etched with the weariness of another long haul. Three days on the road, hauling a load of auto parts from Detroit to Denver, and the Nebraska landscape was starting to bleed into her dreams. She wasn't a woman who complained, not usually. Hard work was in her blood, passed down from her father and grandfather, both truckers who'd crisscrossed this country long before GPS and automated transmissions made it even remotely easy. But even Maggie, a seasoned veteran of the open road, felt the relentless miles grinding her down this morning. She just needed a damn cup of coffee and maybe a greasy breakfast before facing another hundred miles of nothing but cornfields and her own thoughts.
