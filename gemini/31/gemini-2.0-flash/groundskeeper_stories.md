## Story Opening:

The smell of freshly cut grass, a scent most found invigorating, clung to Thomas Arthur Finch like a stubborn second skin. It permeated his clothes, his hair, and even, he suspected, seeped into his bones. Today, however, the familiar aroma did little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in his chest. He hadn't seen the swans in days.

The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears, usually a meditative mantra against the world's chaos, now seemed a nervous staccato echoing the frantic thump of his own heart. He glanced across the expanse of emerald green, the meticulously sculpted rose bushes standing sentinel along the perimeter, searching for a flash of white against the deep blue of the lake. Nothing.

A shiver, unrelated to the late October chill, crawled down his spine. Swans were creatures of habit, creatures of routine. And the pair that called Oakhaven Estate home, a majestic male named Orion and his elegant mate, Lyra, were the most predictable residents of all. Their absence wasâ€¦ wrong.

## Setting:

**Oakhaven Estate** is a sprawling, privately owned manor house nestled deep in the heart of the Cotswolds, England. Generations of the wealthy Ashworth family have called it home, leaving behind a legacy of manicured gardens, meticulously maintained lawns, and an almost unnaturally tranquil atmosphere.

The Estate comprises of:

*   **The Manor House:** A stately, centuries-old stone building, ivy clinging to its walls and numerous windows reflecting the ever-changing sky.
*   **Formal Gardens:** A carefully planned labyrinth of rose bushes, herbaceous borders, and geometrically precise hedges.
*   **The Lake:** A tranquil body of water, home to a variety of wildlife, most notably the resident swan pair.
*   **Woodland:** A dense patch of ancient woodland borders the estate, shrouded in mystery and a sense of foreboding.
*   **The Grounds:** Meticulously kept lawns, perfectly trimmed hedges, and gravel pathways that wind through the entire estate, all meticulously maintained by Thomas Arthur Finch.

The atmosphere is typically one of serene beauty, a sanctuary from the outside world. However, a sense of old money and hidden history hangs in the air, a subtle undercurrent of secrets and unspoken truths that only Thomas, with his intimate knowledge of the land, seems to truly sense. In autumn, the estate is painted in vibrant hues of red, orange, and gold, lending a dramatic backdrop to the unfolding mystery of the missing swans.
