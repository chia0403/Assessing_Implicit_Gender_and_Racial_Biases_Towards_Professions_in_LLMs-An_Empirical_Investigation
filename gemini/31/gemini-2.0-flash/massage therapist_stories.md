## Story Opening:

The rain was drumming a relentless tattoo against the skylight, mimicking the tension knots burrowing deep into Arthur Reginald Finch's own shoulders. He kneaded them unconsciously with one hand, a habit born of a decade spent coaxing relaxation from others while holding onto his own stress for dear life. The scent of lavender and eucalyptus, usually a soothing balm in his small studio, felt cloying and oppressive today. He glanced at the clock for the tenth time in as many minutes. Penelope had cancelled, citing a migraine brought on by "existential dread" (Arthur suspected it was more likely a bad Tinder date). Now, the only sound besides the rain was the low hum of the heated massage table, a lonely beacon of comfort in the gathering gloom.

**Setting:**

Arthur's studio, "The Quiet Finch," occupied a converted attic space above a vintage bookstore in the historic district of Havenwood, Maine. The room was deliberately designed to evoke a sense of calm and rustic elegance. Exposed brick walls were painted a soft, calming grey. Mismatched Persian rugs covered the floor, muffling sound and adding warmth. Sunlight, when it bothered to make an appearance, streamed through the large skylight, illuminating the carefully curated collection of antique massage tools â€“ smooth river stones, fragrant wooden rollers, and even a tarnished silver cupping set that Arthur rarely used but kept as a conversation piece. A bookshelf overflowing with aromatherapy guides, anatomy texts, and dog-eared paperbacks formed one wall, showcasing both Arthur's professionalism and his eclectic tastes. Overall, the atmosphere was intended to be a sanctuary, a place where the anxieties of modern life could be kneaded, stretched, and soothed away. Today, however, it felt more like a gilded cage.
