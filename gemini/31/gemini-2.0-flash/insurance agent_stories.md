## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a weary tune, mirroring Amelia "Amy" Harrington's inner state. Another Thursday, another stack of policy renewals threatening to topple onto her already cluttered desk. Amy sighed, pushing aside a half-eaten container of yogurt and the crumpled remains of a tuna sandwich. It was the kind of Thursday where even the most seasoned insurance agent felt like throwing in the towel and moving to a tropical island where the only risk assessments involved sunscreen application and umbrella rentals.

This particular renewal packet, however, wasn't just another mundane piece of paperwork. It was the application for the Willow Creek Historical Society, and tucked inside, between the standard fire and liability questionnaires, was a photograph. A black and white image, grainy and faded, depicting the old Willow Creek Manor, a rambling Gothic edifice perched precariously on the edge of the Blackwood Forest. Amy had heard the whispers, the stories of strange occurrences, and the persistent rumor of a hidden room. She just hadn't expected them to creep into her workday.

She took another bite of the yogurt, the tangy taste doing little to quell the growing unease churning in her stomach. This wasn't just another insurance claim waiting to happen; this felt like a case of history itself demanding to be insured, secrets and all.

## Setting:

The story primarily unfolds in two locations:

1.  **The office of "Coastal Assurance" in the small coastal town of Seabreeze, Oregon.** Coastal Assurance is a fairly generic, medium-sized insurance agency, specializing in property and casualty insurance for the residents of the Pacific Northwest. Amy's office is small, functional, and perpetually cluttered with paperwork, coffee mugs, and small, motivational posters. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, diligent work punctuated by the occasional ringing phone or frustrated sigh. The town itself, Seabreeze, is a charming, tourist-friendly community known for its picturesque beaches, quaint shops, and proximity to the Blackwood Forest, a sprawling, ancient woodland steeped in local lore.

2.  **Willow Creek Manor.** A dilapidated, Gothic-style manor house located just outside Seabreeze, on the edge of the Blackwood Forest. Built in the late 19th century by a reclusive shipping magnate, the manor has a dark and brooding presence. It's now owned by the Willow Creek Historical Society, a small group of dedicated volunteers struggling to preserve the building from further decay. The manor is rumored to be haunted and filled with hidden passages and forgotten secrets, adding an element of mystery and intrigue to the story.
