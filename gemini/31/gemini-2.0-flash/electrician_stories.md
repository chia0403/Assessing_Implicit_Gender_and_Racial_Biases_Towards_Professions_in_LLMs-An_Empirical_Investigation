The incessant buzzing of the fluorescent lights was enough to drive even the most seasoned electrician to madness, but for Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, it was merely the opening act of a symphony of urban discontent. He stood perched precariously on an aluminum ladder in the dimly lit stairwell of the Bradbury Building, the ornate ironwork digging into the thin fabric of his work trousers. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through a stained-glass window depicting a somewhat alarmingly stern-looking Roman centurion.

Bart adjusted his hardhat, the plastic already sticky with the oppressive Los Angeles humidity, and ran a hand through his perpetually disheveled, ginger hair. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling faintly of aged brass and something vaguely reminiscent of mothballs. He hated this job. Hated the noise, hated the confined space, and especially hated the condescending tone of the building manager, Mr. Henderson, who had made it abundantly clear that Bart was the only electrician willing to touch the Bradbury's archaic wiring on such short notice.

The Bradbury Building, a labyrinthine masterpiece of Victorian architecture located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, was a character in itself. Built in 1893, it was a tourist attraction, a historical landmark, and, according to Bart, a deathtrap waiting to happen. Every wire was a relic, every connection a potential fire hazard. Today, his mission was to trace a short in the lighting system on the third floor, a task about as enjoyable as wrestling an octopus in a bathtub. The buzzing intensified, mocking him, and Bart Finch sighed. This was just another day in the life of an electrician who preferred the quiet hum of a residential circuit to the theatrical chaos of a historical monument teetering on the brink of electrical collapse.
