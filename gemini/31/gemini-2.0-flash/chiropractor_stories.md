Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a chiropractor named Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance:

**Setting:** The opening scene is in the waiting room of Dr. Eleanor Vance's chiropractic clinic, "Vance Wellness," located in the small, fiercely independent town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Redwood forests of Northern California. The waiting room is deliberately designed to evoke a sense of calm and connection to nature. Sunlight streams through large windows overlooking a small, carefully cultivated garden with towering redwoods visible in the background. Woven tapestries depicting local flora and fauna adorn the walls. Soothing nature sounds play softly from hidden speakers, mingling with the faint, earthy aroma of essential oils diffusing in the air. Comfortable, oversized chairs and couches are arranged around a low coffee table displaying current issues of *National Geographic* and *Yoga Journal*. Everything screams "holistic," "earthy," and "not your typical doctor's office."

**Opening:**

The clatter of a fallen magazine shattered the tranquil atmosphere. Martha, a woman whose face was etched with the familiar landscape of worry lines, bent to retrieve her copy of *The New Yorker*, muttering apologies. The door to the inner office creaked open, and Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance emerged, her warm smile radiating a genuine kindness that often eased even the most tense patients. "Martha, dear, don't you fret," she said, her voice a calming melody. "And please, come on in. Looks like we're running a few minutes behind schedule today. Little Billy Henderson tried to climb the redwood in the garden again, and his mother insisted I check him out. Boys will be boys, I suppose." Ellie gestured with a gentle wave of her hand toward the open doorway. But Martha remained frozen, her eyes darting nervously toward the closed door across the hall. "Is...is he in there?" she stammered, her voice barely a whisper. Ellie paused, her smile faltering slightly. "He? Who are you referring to, Martha?" Martha swallowed hard, her knuckles white as she clutched her magazine. "The new patient. The one with the...the aura." Ellie sighed inwardly. Of course. Havenwood was a town known for its alternative leanings, but sometimes, it leaned a little *too* far. She glanced at the closed door, the knot in her stomach tightening. "Yes, Martha," she said carefully. "Mr. Silas Blackwood is currently in examination."
