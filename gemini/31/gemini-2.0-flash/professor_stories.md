## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Professor Eleanor Vivian Hawthorne, Ph.D., stared at the flickering candlelight, its warmth a pathetic attempt to combat the oppressive chill that clung to the air.  The storm, a tempestuous beast that had snarled and clawed at the Welsh coastline for the better part of a week, showed no signs of relenting.  Each gust of wind that rattled the ancient windows felt like a spectral hand trying to pry them open, a chilling reminder of the isolation she had so willingly embraced.  Tonight, however, that isolation felt less like a haven for academic contemplation and more like a prison sentence imposed by the elements.  She took a sip of her tepid tea, the bitter tang a familiar comfort, but even that failed to dispel the unsettling premonition that had been whispering in her ear all day. Something was coming. Something other than the storm.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a remote, Victorian-era manor house called *Plas Brongwyn*, perched precariously on a craggy cliff overlooking the turbulent Irish Sea in North Wales.  The house, purchased by Eleanor several years ago with the royalties from her acclaimed biography of a little-known Welsh mythologist, is crumbling but charming.  Itâ€™s filled with overflowing bookshelves, dusty antiques, and the lingering scent of old paper and beeswax.  Outside, the landscape is a dramatic tapestry of windswept moors, jagged cliffs, and a grey, unforgiving sea.  The nearest village, Llanfairfechan, is several miles away down a treacherous, winding road, making Plas Brongwyn a truly secluded and often desolate place. The time is present-day, late Autumn.
