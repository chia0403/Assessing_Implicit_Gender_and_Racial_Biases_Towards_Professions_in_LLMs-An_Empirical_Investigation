## The Opening:

A prick of the needle, a suppressed sigh, and the relentless ticking of the grandfather clock were the only sounds competing with the crackling fire in the hearth. Bartholomew Finch, tailor extraordinaire of Willow Creek and, in his own estimation, its most undervalued resident, squinted at the intricate embroidery he was adding to the Duke’s ridiculously ostentatious waistcoat. He hated crimson thread. It was a vulgar color, lacking the subtle nuance of a good indigo or the comforting depth of forest green. But the Duke, alas, possessed the fashion sense of a drunk badger.

"Almost...there," Bartholomew muttered, biting the inside of his cheek as his nimble fingers danced over the silk. He could practically taste the bitterness of the Duke's eventual praise, knowing it would be followed by an immediate demand for something even more garish. This was the curse of being the best; you were forever condemned to cater to the worst.

He snipped the thread, knotted it, and carefully smoothed the silk. Satisfied, for the moment, he leaned back in his worn leather chair, his back protesting with a chorus of pops and clicks. The firelight danced across his face, highlighting the fine lines etched around his kind, hazel eyes and the stubborn set of his jaw. He was, despite his discontent, a man who took pride in his craft, a craftsman bound to the traditions of his ancestors, even if those traditions were currently being sullied by the whims of a badger-like Duke.

## The Setting:

The year is 1888. Bartholomew Finch’s Tailoring Emporium, a quaint, two-story building nestled on the cobblestone main street of Willow Creek, a small village nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds, England. The air outside is crisp and carries the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth.

Inside, the Emporium is a haven of organized chaos. Bolts of fabric in every color imaginable line the walls, stacked floor to ceiling. Patterns hang from hooks, their edges frayed from years of use. Spools of thread, buttons of all shapes and sizes, and measuring tapes litter every available surface. The aroma of beeswax, lavender, and the faint metallic tang of iron fill the air. Sunlight streams through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the intricate details of the many finished garments displayed on mannequins throughout the shop. A large cutting table dominates the center of the room, scattered with scraps of fabric and chalk markings. In the back, a small, private workshop holds Bartholomew’s prized sewing machine, inherited from his grandfather, and the well-worn leather chair where he spends countless hours perfecting his craft.
