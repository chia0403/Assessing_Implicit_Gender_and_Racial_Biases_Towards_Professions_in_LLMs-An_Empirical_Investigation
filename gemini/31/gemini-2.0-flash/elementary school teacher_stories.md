The insistent, high-pitched whirring of the school bell sliced through the humid Georgia air, signaling the end of another sweltering day at Dogwood Elementary. Sweat beaded on the forehead of Ms. Eleanor Marguerite Finch as she surveyed her chaotic, glitter-strewn classroom. Twenty-two miniature cyclones had ripped through it in the past seven hours, leaving a delightful (and exhausting) tapestry of half-finished art projects, abandoned spelling tests, and a palpable residue of youthful exuberance.

Eleanor sighed, a fond smile playing on her lips. She loved her job. She loved the wide-eyed wonder of her second graders, their boundless curiosity, and even their occasional outbursts. But right now, all she craved was the blessed silence of her apartment, a cold glass of iced tea, and maybe, just maybe, an escape into the pages of a good book.

The late afternoon sun streamed through the window, illuminating the colorful alphabet letters strung above the chalkboard. Eleanor, with her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun and her perpetually kind eyes magnified by her slightly-too-large glasses, began the familiar ritual of tidying. Chairs were stacked, papers were filed (or at least attempted to be), and the remnants of Mrs. Higgins’ famous chocolate chip cookies, brought in for Tommy’s birthday, were carefully wrapped and placed in her worn, leather tote bag. As the last sliver of sunlight dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Eleanor switched off the lights, a deep breath of anticipation filling her lungs. Time to go home.
