Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on Elias Vance, an emergency medical care professional:

**Opening:**

The blare of the dispatch radio sliced through the quiet hum of the ambulance, jolting Elias Vance from the precarious edge of sleep.  He scrubbed a hand across his face, the scent of stale coffee and antiseptic clinging to his fingers. "Medic One, respond to a reported structure fire, multiple occupants, possible entrapment. Address: 32 Oak Street."  The monotone voice of dispatch filled the small cab, painting a vivid, terrifying picture.

A jolt of adrenaline slammed into Elias, instantly clearing the fog of fatigue. His partner, Chloe Ramirez, swore under her breath as she slammed the rig into gear, tires squealing against the asphalt. "Great. Just what I needed. This shift was too quiet," she muttered, her voice laced with the grim humor only shared by those who danced with danger every day. Elias just buckled his harness tighter, his gaze fixed on the rapidly approaching horizon. He knew that behind the glowing orange smear on the night sky, people were waiting, desperate for someone like him to arrive.
**Setting:**

The city of Oakhaven, nestled in a valley carved by the meandering Oakhaven River, prided itself on its picturesque charm and close-knit community. Colonial-era buildings lined the town square, home to a weekly farmer's market and the annual Oakhaven Apple Festival. Despite its idyllic facade, Oakhaven faced the same challenges as any other small city: poverty in the forgotten corners, a rising opioid crisis, and the ever-present risk of accidents in its aging industrial sector. Elias Vance had seen all those sides of Oakhaven in his eight years as a paramedic for Oakhaven Emergency Medical Services.  The Oakhaven EMS headquarters was a small, brick building on the outskirts of town, its cramped quarters a familiar comfort. Here, paramedics and EMTs shared war stories over lukewarm coffee, polished their gear, and braced themselves for the next call that would tear them away from their fleeting moments of normalcy. Tonight, the normalcy was shattered, and Oakhaven's quaint charm was about to be consumed by flames.
