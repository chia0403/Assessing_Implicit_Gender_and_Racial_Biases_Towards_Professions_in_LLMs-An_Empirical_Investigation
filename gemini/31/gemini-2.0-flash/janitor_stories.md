The clang of the mop bucket against the linoleum echoed through the cavernous halls of the Bradbury & Sons Widget Factory, a sound that had become as familiar to Arthur Penhaligon as his own heartbeat. It was just past 3:00 AM, the silence broken only by the hum of the dormant machinery and the rhythmic swoosh of Arthur's weary mop. Dust motes danced in the beam of his headlamp, illuminating the shadowy corners of the factory floor. He paused, his back aching, and straightened up, pulling down the bandana that kept stray strands of his silvering hair from falling into his eyes. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of welding and the faint, lingering scent of oil and grease â€“ a potent cocktail that always made him feel a little dizzy after a long shift. Arthur had been cleaning this place for twenty-seven years, watching widgets come and go, watching workers age and retire, watching even the gargantuan machines get replaced with sleeker, more efficient models. He was a fixture, a silent observer, a man often overlooked but eternally present in the pre-dawn gloom of the Bradbury & Sons Widget Factory. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of his neck, a sense of being watched even in this usually desolate space.
