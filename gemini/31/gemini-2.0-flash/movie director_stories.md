The humid air hung thick and heavy, a sticky blanket clinging to everything in Savannah. Sweat beaded on Julian Vance’s forehead as he squinted through the viewfinder of his ARRI Alexa, the camera nearly vibrating in his hands from the heat. Julian, a name whispered in reverent tones in Hollywood boardrooms and film festivals, was a long way from the manicured lawns of Beverly Hills. Here, in this forgotten corner of Georgia, Spanish moss draped like ghostly shrouds from ancient oaks, and the air smelled of damp earth and blooming magnolias.

He was standing on the cracked, sun-baked porch of the Abernathy House, a pre-Civil War mansion that had seen better days – much, much better days. The white paint was peeling, revealing the grey, weathered wood beneath. One of the Corinthian columns was missing its capital, and a pervasive air of decay hung about the place, thick as the humidity.

This was the perfect location.

Julian Vance, his silver hair plastered to his scalp, adjusted the focus, his eyes narrowed in concentration. He was here to shoot "Whispers of the Past," a gothic horror film about a family haunted by a dark secret buried within the very foundation of this decaying Southern Belle. And the Abernathy House, with its crumbling grandeur and oppressive atmosphere, was precisely the character Julian needed to bring his vision to life.

The question was, could he tame this beast, this suffocating, haunted landscape, before it swallowed him whole?
