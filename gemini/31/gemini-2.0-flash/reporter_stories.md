The humid Atlanta air hung thick as soup, clinging to Amelia Katherine Hayes like a damp shroud. August in Georgia was a cruel mistress, and the fact that Amelia's apartment air conditioning had chosen this week, of all weeks, to give up the ghost only amplified the feeling. She sat perched precariously on the edge of her faded floral couch, a half-eaten bowl of lukewarm ramen precariously balanced on her knee, and scrolled through the threadbare news wire feed on her battered laptop.

Amelia Hayes was a reporter for the *Atlanta Chronicle*, and frankly, a relatively lowly one at that. Her beat was primarily fluff pieces: "Best Ice Cream Parlors for Summer Romance" or "Local Artist Turns Trash into Treasure." She dreamed of hard-hitting investigations, of uncovering political conspiracies and holding the powerful accountable. Instead, she was stuck writing articles about miniature poodle beauty pageants.

The laptop, a hand-me-down from her father who'd claimed it was "too slow" (Amelia suspected it was just too old-fashioned for his tech-obsessed tastes), sat on a rickety folding table that doubled as her desk. The living room of her small, one-bedroom apartment in the historic (and rapidly gentrifying) Inman Park neighborhood was a chaotic symphony of mismatched furniture, overflowing bookshelves, and stacks of newspapers she swore she'd get around to recycling, eventually. The walls were adorned with prints she'd found at thrift stores: a faded Monet, a black and white photograph of a bustling New York street, and a particularly garish painting of a velvet Elvis.

The setting was undeniably bohemian, a testament to Amelia's artistic aspirations and perpetually tight budget. It was also a visual representation of her career: a place bursting with potential, but perpetually on the verge of collapsing under its own weight. And as another sweltering breeze drifted in through the open window, carrying the faint scent of magnolia and the distant rumble of MARTA, Amelia knew she was about to stumble onto something that could finally change everything.
