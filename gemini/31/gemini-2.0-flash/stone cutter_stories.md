## Story Opening:

The bite of the hammer against the chisel was a familiar comfort to Silas Bartholomew Blackwood. Each sharp, decisive strike echoed in the morning mist that clung to the Quarry of Whispers, a sound that both summoned the dawn and chased away the lingering shadows of night. He relished the raw, earthy smell of the freshly exposed granite, its cool touch a grounding presence in his often turbulent mind. He squinted, wiping sweat from his brow with a forearm dusted in fine stone powder, and stepped back to assess his work. The nascent wing of the angel was beginning to emerge from the unyielding grey mass. He had imagined it for weeks, the curve and flow of feathers, the subtle strength implied in its delicate form. Now, he only had to coax it into being. But the stone resisted, whispering its secrets of ages past, and Silas felt a familiar unease settle in his gut. It wasn't the stone's stubbornness that troubled him, but the recurring dream that had plagued his sleep for the past month - a dream of wings, but not of angels, and a darkness that promised something far more profound than beauty.

## Setting:

The Quarry of Whispers, perched high on the windswept crags overlooking the village of Hollow Creek, was a place of stark beauty and ancient power.  Generations of Blackwoods had carved their living from its granite face, their tools etching stories into the land itself.  The air was thin and crisp, carrying the scent of pine from the surrounding forests and the metallic tang of raw stone.  The quarry floor was a chaotic tapestry of fallen rock, discarded chisels, and puddles of rainwater reflecting the vast, ever-changing sky.  Silas' small stone shack, built into the side of the quarry wall, served as both workshop and home.  Inside, it was a sanctuary of organized chaos: half-finished sculptures littered every surface, blueprints and sketches clung to the damp stone walls, and the air thrummed with the silent energy of creation waiting to be unleashed.  Beyond the quarry lay Hollow Creek, a tight-knit village nestled in the valley below, its inhabitants both reliant on and wary of the stonecutters who toiled on the mountain above.
