The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. She wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, her neon-pink headband already saturated. The community center gymnasium, usually buzzing with the energetic rhythm of her Zumba class, felt strangely desolate at 6:00 AM. Sunlight, still weak and hesitant, filtered through the dusty windows, painting long, distorted squares on the faded linoleum floor. A lone basketball hoop, its net frayed and torn, stood sentinel in the corner. The air smelled faintly of stale sweat and forgotten dreams, a familiar scent in this aging space.

Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a woman whose energy could power a small city, bounced on the balls of her feet, trying to shake off the pre-class jitters. She was used to a full house, but the sign-up sheet for her new "Sunrise Sweat Session" only showed three names. Three! This was supposed to be her ticket to a bigger, better space, a chance to finally ditch the cramped confines of the community center and open her own studio. But with numbers like these, it was more likely sheâ€™d be teaching yoga to squirrels in the park. She plastered a smile on her face, a habit honed over years of encouraging even the most reluctant participants, and took a deep breath. Today, she decided, even if only three people showed up, they would leave feeling like they could conquer the world.
