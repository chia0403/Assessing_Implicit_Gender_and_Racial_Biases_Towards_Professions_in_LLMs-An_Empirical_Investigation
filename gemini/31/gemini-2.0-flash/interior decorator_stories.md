## Story Opening:

The scent of bergamot and old money hung thick in the air, a perfume clinging to the walls of the Grand Duchess Irina Romanov's former New York City townhouse. Anabelle Rose Beaumont, interior decorator extraordinaire, wrinkled her nose, not in disgust, but in concentration. It was a complex fragrance, a tapestry woven from history and opulence, and Anabelle needed to understand it before she could even begin to envision the transformation Mr. Archibald Finch, her new client, so desperately desired. He wanted "modern living" grafted onto the bones of Russian royalty. A challenge, certainly, but challenges were Anabelle's bread and butter.

She traced the faded gold leafing on the ceiling with a gloved finger, the intricate floral design a whisper of a bygone era. The light, filtered through dust-laden tapestries of hunting scenes, cast long, dancing shadows. Anabelle imagined Irina herself gliding through these rooms, the rustle of silk against silk, the glint of diamonds catching the light. It was beautiful, haunting, and utterly impractical for a bachelor lawyer who, Anabelle suspected, preferred Netflix and takeout to social galas and champagne.

**Setting:**

The Grand Duchess Irina Romanov's former townhouse, now owned by Mr. Archibald Finch. Located in the heart of the Upper East Side, New York City, the townhouse is a magnificent, five-story behemoth dating back to the early 20th century. Inside, it's a time capsule of pre-revolutionary Russian grandeur:

*   **High ceilings** adorned with intricate moldings and faded gold leafing.
*   **Dusty tapestries** depicting scenes of hunting and courtly life hang on the walls, obscuring the windows and casting the rooms in perpetual twilight.
*   **Ornate, though slightly chipped, furniture** covered in velvet and damask is scattered throughout, testament to the Duchess's impeccable taste.
*   **Heirloom antiques**, like porcelain figurines and silver candelabras, sit precariously on tables, remnants of a vanished era.
*   **A grand, sweeping staircase** leads to the upper floors, its mahogany banister worn smooth by generations of hands.
*   The air is thick with the scent of dust, old wood, and a faint, lingering perfume of bergamot and old money.

The house is beautiful, but desperately needs updating to fit the lifestyle of its new, decidedly less regal, owner. It's a project that requires sensitivity, imagination, and Anabelle Rose Beaumont's particular brand of magic.
