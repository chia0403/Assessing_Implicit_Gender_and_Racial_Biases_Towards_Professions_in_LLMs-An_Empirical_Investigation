**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Carter's Thursday morning. She stifled a yawn, subtly adjusting her headset. Outside, the late October wind howled a more dramatic melody, rattling the glass doors of Sterling & Stone Investment Firm and sending shivers down the spines of the unlucky few who dared brave it without adequate outerwear. Amelia, however, was bundled in a knitted cardigan that her grandmother had gifted her, a shield against both the chill of the season and the even chillier atmosphere of the office.

**Setting:**

Sterling & Stone occupied the entire 12th floor of the Commerce Tower downtown. The lobby was meticulously curated to project an image of success and stability. Polished marble floors reflected the light from the recessed fixtures above, almost blindingly so. A sleek, ebony reception desk, where Amelia presided, faced a wall adorned with abstract art - swirls of gold and silver that Amelia privately thought looked like spilled coffee. Comfortable, modern armchairs in shades of gray and navy were strategically placed to encourage waiting clients to linger.

Beyond the reception area, double glass doors led into the inner sanctum of the firm, where the real work – the buying, selling, and maneuvering of vast sums of money – took place. Amelia had only ventured past those doors a handful of times, mostly for the annual holiday party, and even then, she felt like an intruder in a world she didn't quite understand, a world populated by sharp suits, sharper minds, and the constant, low hum of ambition.
