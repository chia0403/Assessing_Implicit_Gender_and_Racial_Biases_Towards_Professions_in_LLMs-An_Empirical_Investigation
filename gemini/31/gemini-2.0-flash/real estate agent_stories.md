The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights in the empty kitchen seemed to amplify Amelia Beatrice Stone’s growing anxiety. It was a sound that, on any other day, would blend seamlessly into the background of her open house, a subtle signal of efficiency and cleanliness. Today, however, it felt like a low, droning judgment.

Amelia, a crisp forty-two years old with a perpetual splash of auburn highlights fighting their way out of her otherwise perfectly blonde bob, smoothed down the navy blue sheath dress she'd chosen specifically to project competence and confidence. The dress felt stifling now, clinging to her in the unnatural stillness of the house. She checked her reflection in the stainless-steel oven door, pinching the faint lines around her eyes, a testament to years spent squinting into the Florida sun, but also, more recently, to a string of deals that had fallen through just as quickly as they’d appeared.

The setting was 14 Pelican Point Lane, a sprawling, Mediterranean-style villa nestled in the exclusive gated community of Sea Breeze Shores, just south of Sarasota. It was the kind of property that practically sold itself - or, at least, that’s what Amelia had believed when she’d taken the listing. Ocean views stretched as far as the eye could see from the wraparound balcony, a private dock beckoned with promises of sunset cruises, and the interior boasted a chef’s kitchen, a home theater, and enough marble to rival a Roman bathhouse. Yet, here she was, two hours into the open house, and the only visitor had been Mr. Henderson, the elderly gentleman from across the street who mainly wanted to complain about the HOA fees and snag some of the miniature quiches.

Amelia straightened her shoulders, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace. She had to stay positive. This house was her ticket to making partner at Coastal Estates Realty, and she wasn't about to let a slow Sunday afternoon sink her chances. Somewhere out there, she told herself, was the perfect buyer, just waiting to fall in love with this place. She just had to be ready when they walked through the door.
