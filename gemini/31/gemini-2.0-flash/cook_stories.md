The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elara Maeve Dubois like a second skin as she haggled with Mrs. Nguyen over the price of okra at the vibrant Little Saigon Farmer's Market. Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the canvas awnings, painting dappled patterns on the bustling crowd. The air, a heady mix of ripe mangoes, frying spring rolls, and exhaust fumes from the passing motorbikes, vibrated with the energy of a Saturday morning in New Orleans' Westbank.

Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid and her faded floral apron stained with splashes of turmeric and beet juice, pointed a slender finger at a particularly plump pod. "Two dollars a pound, Mrs. Nguyen? You're breaking my heart. For Elara Maeve Dubois, chef of the famed 'Second Line Suppers,' you simply must offer a better price."
