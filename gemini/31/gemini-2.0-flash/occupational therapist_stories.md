## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of rubber soles on linoleum echoed around Dr. Amelia Hayes as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center. It was a sound that usually soothed her, a predictable rhythm to the chaos of her day, but today it felt like a relentless metronome counting down to an event she desperately wanted to avoid: Mrs. Gable's discharge meeting. Amelia took a deep breath, the sterile scent of antiseptic clinging to the back of her throat. Mrs. Gable was ready, physically stronger, more mentally acute than when she’d arrived, but Amelia knew the transition back to her isolated farmhouse would be a lonely and challenging one. Could she truly say she had prepared her enough? Had she given her enough tools to face the silence, the loneliness, and the quiet despair that Amelia suspected haunted her days?

**Setting:**

Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center sits nestled, somewhat ironically, between a bustling highway and a whispering willow grove just outside of the small, rural town of Meadow Creek, Ohio. The building itself is a sprawling, two-story structure built in the late 1970s, a testament to function over form. Beige brick dominates the exterior, punctuated by rows of large, but energy-inefficient, windows. Inside, the color scheme is equally utilitarian: pale greens, soft yellows, and the ubiquitous beige. The center boasts a large gymnasium, complete with parallel bars, weight machines, and a mock kitchen for occupational therapy sessions. There’s also a dedicated sensory room filled with calming lights, textures, and sounds, designed to aid patients with neurological conditions. Despite the attempts to create a welcoming environment, the air is thick with the faint hum of fluorescent lights and the ever-present undercurrent of medical urgency. The patients, a mix of ages and conditions, range from stroke survivors learning to walk again to individuals recovering from traumatic brain injuries, all striving to reclaim some semblance of normalcy within its sterile walls. The surrounding willow grove offers a sliver of peace and a reminder of the world outside, a world Amelia often dreamt of escaping to herself.
