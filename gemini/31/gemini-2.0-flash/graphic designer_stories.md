The scent of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to Abigail Lucille Hawthorne's latest attempt at multitasking. She squinted at the glowing screen, the harsh light reflecting in her tired eyes. Outside, the perpetually grey Seattle sky threatened another downpour, mirroring the brewing storm of deadlines and client revisions swirling inside her.

Abigail, a graphic designer with a penchant for vintage fonts and a deep-seated aversion to Comic Sans, sat hunched over her meticulously organized chaos – a custom-built drafting table littered with sketchbooks, Pantone swatches, and half-eaten granola bars. The space was her sanctuary, a converted loft apartment above an old brick warehouse in Pioneer Square. Exposed pipes snaked across the high ceilings, and sunlight, when it dared to peek through the clouds, illuminated a gallery wall showcasing her most prized projects: posters for local bands, book covers for obscure indie authors, and the surprisingly successful logo she'd designed for a dog-walking collective.

Her phone buzzed, shattering the already fragile peace. It was Mark, her perpetually frantic boss at “Pixel Perfect Design,” the trendy, yet ultimately soul-crushing, agency downtown. Abigail braced herself. The day had officially begun. And judging by the taste of burnt coffee still lingering on her tongue, it wasn't going to be pretty.
