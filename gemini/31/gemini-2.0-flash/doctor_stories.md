## Story Opening:

The insistent chirping of the bedside clock radio sliced through the last vestiges of a fitful sleep. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth groaned, swatting at the snooze button with a hand that felt heavy and unresponsive. 5:30 AM. Again. She knew she should just get up. Should brew herself a strong cup of Earl Grey, do twenty minutes of yoga, and prepare for the day. But the weight of her responsibilities, a familiar blanket woven with exhaustion and a thread of anxiety, kept her pinned beneath the covers. Today was the day. The day she had to face Mr. Henderson, and she knew, deep down, that the news she had to deliver would be anything but good.

## Setting:

The story opens in Eleanor's small, cluttered apartment in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. Sunlight, already intense at this early hour, streamed through the louvered blinds, painting stripes of gold across the faded floral wallpaper. Her bedroom was a reflection of her personality: organized chaos. Medical journals and textbooks were stacked precariously on a bedside table overflowing with empty teacups and prescription pads. A well-worn quilt, a family heirloom, covered a queen-sized bed that had clearly seen better days. Outside, the sounds of the city were beginning to stir â€“ the distant rumble of delivery trucks, the cries of gulls circling the harbor, and the faint strains of a jazz trumpet practicing scales somewhere nearby. The air, even this early, hung thick with humidity, promising another sweltering Charleston summer day. The apartment, though small, held a comforting familiarity for Eleanor, a refuge from the relentless pressures of her job as a general practitioner in the heart of the city.
