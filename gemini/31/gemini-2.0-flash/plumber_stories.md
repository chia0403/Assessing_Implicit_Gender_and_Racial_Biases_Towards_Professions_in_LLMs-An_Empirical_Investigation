The rusty wrench slipped in Elias Thorne’s sweating palm, clattering against the grimy porcelain of the antique sink. He swore under his breath, a low rumble that was lost in the cacophony of dripping water and the mournful wail of the wind whistling through the dilapidated Victorian house. Elias, owner and operator of Thorne & Son Plumbing (though the “Son” part was purely aspirational), hated old houses. They were beautiful, yes, steeped in history, but also choked with corroded pipes and plumbing that seemed designed to defy every law of physics.

He was currently hunched under the sink of the grand master bathroom in Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a stack of dusty old magazines that threatened to crumble beneath his weight. Blackwood Manor itself loomed large and forbidding atop a windswept hill overlooking the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Its blackened shingles and gothic architecture gave it the air of a haunted relic, a feeling only amplified by the swirling fog that perpetually clung to its edges and the rumour that the original owner, a reclusive sea captain, had murdered his entire family within its walls. Elias had been called in by the new owner, a bubbly social media influencer named Tiffany Delight (he’d had to resist rolling his eyes at the name), who wanted to “restore the manor to its former glory” and, presumably, film a bunch of spooky TikToks in the process. So, Elias Thorne, master plumber and reluctant ghost-buster, was battling a clogged drain and a creeping sense of unease, surrounded by the ghosts of plumbing past and the chill of a Maine autumn that promised a long, dark winter.
