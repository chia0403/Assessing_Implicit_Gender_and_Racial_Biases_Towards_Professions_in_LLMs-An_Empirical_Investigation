## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the windowpane like a frantic drummer, each beat a metronome marking time in Amelia Hayes's increasingly frantic life. Outside, the Edinburgh cityscape was a blurred impressionist painting in shades of grey, the gothic spires and chimney pots softened by the relentless downpour. Inside, Ameliaâ€™s tiny, book-lined flat felt more like a pressure cooker.

She scrubbed furiously at a stubborn ink stain blooming on the manuscript of "The Crimson Quill," the debut novel by a notoriously temperamental history professor named Dr. Archibald Featherstonehaugh (who, in Amelia's honest opinion, was about as sharp as a blunt spoon). Featherstonehaugh, bless his tweed-clad soul, had a penchant for both florid prose and spilling his lukewarm Earl Grey on everything he touched.

Amelia Hayes, senior editor at Thistle & Thorn Publishing, sighed, the sound a small puff of frustration lost in the din of the storm. This was her life. Coffee, deadlines, and the constant, nagging feeling that she was single-handedly keeping the Scottish literary scene afloat. Tonight, however, it felt more like she was slowly sinking under a deluge of red pen marks, misplaced commas, and spilled tea.

## Setting:

The year is 2024. Amelia's flat is a cramped but cozy space on the third floor of a Victorian tenement building in the Morningside district of Edinburgh. The walls are painted a soft, calming blue, but are mostly obscured by overflowing bookshelves crammed with everything from classic Scottish literature to dog-eared paperback thrillers. A worn Persian rug covers most of the hardwood floor, attempting to add a touch of warmth to the slightly drafty space. The dominant feature is a large, oak desk piled high with manuscripts, research notes, and an assortment of half-empty coffee mugs. The atmosphere is simultaneously intellectual and chaotic, reflecting Amelia's own personality perfectly. The constant rain outside adds a layer of melancholic charm to the scene, a classic Edinburgh tableau.
