Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a probation officer named:

**Setting:** The gritty, late afternoon air of a fading industrial district in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The sky is a bruised purple, threatening rain. Brick warehouses stand shoulder-to-shoulder, their windows long since boarded up. Across the street, a half-abandoned laundromat buzzes with a flickering fluorescent hum, its machines coughing and sputtering like asthmatic lungs. The air smells of diesel exhaust, stale fryer oil, and damp concrete.

**Opening:**

The chipped enamel of the front door to 427 Elm Street groaned in protest as it swung inward. **Eleanor "Ellie" Rose Callahan**, probation officer for Lackawanna County, braced herself against the familiar wave of stale cigarette smoke and simmering resentment. She adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the weight of case files digging into her shoulder. She was already late, another appointment crammed into a day already overflowing with parole violations, domestic disputes, and the quiet desperation that clung to this part of town like grime. The buzzer she pressed did little to rouse the interior; a muffled bark, followed by the clatter of something falling, was the only response. Ellie sighed. This wasnâ€™t going to be easy. Another check-in with a client teetering on the edge, and she was running on fumes herself. Today's visit was Anthony "AJ" Deluca, a twenty-two year old arsonist whose probation was almost up. She hoped against hope that he was trying to turn his life around, or else she might have to start the paperwork to send him back in, and no one needed that.
