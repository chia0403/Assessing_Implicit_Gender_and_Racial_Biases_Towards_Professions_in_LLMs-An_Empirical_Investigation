The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy"  Harding's flight suit, stinging her cheeks as she peered through the cockpit’s panoramic viewscreen.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Azure Mountains clawed at the bruised cerulean sky.  The year was 2347, and Amy, a seasoned pilot for the interstellar courier service, Stellar Express, gripped the controls of her sleek, crimson  "Zephyr" freighter.  Its twin, bioluminescent engines hummed a low, rhythmic thrum that seemed to vibrate through her very bones.  She was on a routine cargo run from the lunar mining colony of Luna Nova to the bustling spaceport of Xylos Prime.  The cargo hold contained a consignment of rare, bioluminescent minerals, invaluable to the fledgling bio-tech sector on Earth.  The delivery was critical – Stellar Express’s reputation, and Amy’s own career, hinged on its safe and timely arrival.  

High above the towering spires of the Azure Mountains, the Zephyr pierced the perpetual twilight, the landscape below a tapestry of emerald valleys and shimmering glacial rivers.  The silence of space was broken only by the whispers of the Zephyr's engines and the distant, rhythmic crackle of a nearby asteroid field, a reminder of the vast and unforgiving emptiness that surrounded her.
