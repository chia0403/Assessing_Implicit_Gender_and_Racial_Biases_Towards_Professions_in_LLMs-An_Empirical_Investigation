The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of springâ€™s tardiness, whipped across the parched fields of  Emberton Manor.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and clay, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the weathered figure of  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, the manor's farmer.  Barty, a man weathered as the ancient stone walls of his barn, squinted against the stinging grit.  His calloused hands, stained a perpetual brown from years of tilling the unforgiving soil, tightened around the worn leather reins of his ancient plow horse, Bess.  The year was 1887, and the promise of a bountiful harvest hung as precariously in the air as the wisps of smoke from the distant village chimney.  

The setting was the sprawling, yet unforgiving, countryside of the English Midlands.  Emberton Manor, a stately pile of grey stone looming over the valley, cast a long, skeletal shadow across the fields.  The manor itself was a relic of a bygone era, its grandeur somewhat obscured by the creeping, tenacious growth of the surrounding countryside.  Wildflowers, though, fought for survival in the scant patches of sunshine, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the surrounding landscape.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and hay, was punctuated by the distant bleating of sheep and the ceaseless chirping of unseen birds.  Barty, though, could only focus on the arduous task before him - preparing the soil for the planting of the fragile spring seed, a task made all the more precarious by the drought.
