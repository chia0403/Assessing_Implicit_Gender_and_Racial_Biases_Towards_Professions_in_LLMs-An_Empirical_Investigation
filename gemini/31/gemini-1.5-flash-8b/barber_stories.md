The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soaps, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of his tiny barbershop, "The Clipper's Curl."  The scent of lavender, a faint but persistent ghost from a bygone era of fragrant products, mingled with the almost cloying aroma of stale coffee and the earthy tang of unwashed heads.  Barty, a man whose greying temples seemed to mirror the faded glory of his once-vibrant shop, sighed.  Another slow Tuesday.  The only sounds in the otherwise silent room were the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears and the occasional, heavy sigh emanating from the worn, leather armchair where a particularly stout customer was currently losing a battle against the urge to nod off.  The faded wallpaper depicting a romanticized view of a bustling city street seemed to mock the desolation of the present. Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city pulsed, oblivious to the quiet desperation within The Clipper's Curl.
