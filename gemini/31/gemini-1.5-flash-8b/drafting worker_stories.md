The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic scraping of pencils across the crisp, white paper.  Dust motes danced in the meagre shafts of light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the intricate lines and curves of blueprints meticulously crafted by dozens of hands.  This was the kingdom of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a drafting worker at the sprawling, grey behemoth of Blackwood Industries.  Barty, a man whose life, like the blueprints themselves, was a carefully measured, precise affair, stared at the latest iteration of the prototype for the "Titan" – a colossal mining excavator slated to revolutionize the extraction of rare earth minerals.

The setting was a cramped, windowless drafting room, a hive of activity amidst the echoing emptiness of the Blackwood Industries complex.  Long, metal tables lined the room, each laden with drawing boards, drafting instruments, and stacks of paper – all smelling faintly of old ink and graphite.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the almost imperceptible scent of industrial grease, hung heavy and static.  Outside, the city of Ashwood sprawled, a sprawling concrete jungle shrouded in an oppressive haze of smog and industrial exhaust, a testament to the very industry Barty spent his days meticulously documenting.  Barty felt a familiar thrum of frustration in his chest.  He wasn't just drawing lines; he was breathing the dust of the future.
