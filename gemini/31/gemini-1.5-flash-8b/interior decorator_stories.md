The scent of aged parchment and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of jasmine.  Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of mythical beasts and soaring dragons, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  This was the atelier of  Eleanor Ainsworth, interior decorator extraordinaire, a space more reminiscent of a medieval library than a modern workspace.  Shelves overflowing with antique books, hand-painted textiles, and meticulously curated ceramic figurines lined the walls, creating a kaleidoscope of colour and texture.  Eleanor, a woman of thirty-five with eyes the colour of polished jade and a cascade of raven hair, meticulously arranged a collection of antique porcelain teacups on a delicate, ornately carved wooden table.  Each cup, a miniature work of art, held a tiny, perfectly formed sprig of rosemary.  This, she knew, was the key to the mood she was aiming for: serenity, tempered by a touch of forgotten elegance.  Her latest commission awaited. A sprawling, centuries-old manor house nestled deep within the English countryside, a place steeped in history and whispers of secrets.
