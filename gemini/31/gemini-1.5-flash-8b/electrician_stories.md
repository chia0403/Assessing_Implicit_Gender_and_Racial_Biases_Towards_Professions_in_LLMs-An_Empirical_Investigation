The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water seeping from a cracked ceiling.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the skeletal remains of machinery.  This was Arthur "Sparky"  Pendleton's domain, or at least, it was where he found himself now, knee-deep in a tangle of corroded wires.  He was an electrician, but today, he felt more like a spelunker in a forgotten catacomb of industrial decay.  Sparky, despite his years of experience navigating the labyrinthine underbelly of electrical systems, felt a prickle of unease. The job was supposed to be straightforward â€“ a routine fixture replacement at the long-dormant "Echo Manufacturing" plant. But something about this place, with its whispers of forgotten machinery and tales of strange occurrences, felt undeniably wrong.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and something else, something indefinably metallic, clung to him like a shroud.
