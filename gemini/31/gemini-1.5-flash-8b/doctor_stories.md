The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington’s lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  Snow, thick and relentless, blanketed the sprawling, windswept plains of the Arctic Research Station.  The fluorescent lights of the makeshift clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the howling blizzard outside.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Kensington, rubbed her numb fingers together, the rhythmic grinding a small comfort against the bone-deep cold.  A single, flickering candle on the lab table cast long, dancing shadows on the walls, illuminating the intricate tangle of wires and tubes surrounding a small, metal cot.  On the cot lay a young Inuk woman, her face pale and drawn, her breathing shallow and ragged.  The air thrummed with the unspoken tension of a remote outpost, the only sound audible above the wind and the whirring machines was the rhythmic thump of the woman's fragile heart.  The station’s emergency radio crackled intermittently, a message of urgent concern amidst the storm, but the signal was weak, barely audible.   The fate of this fragile life, and perhaps the fate of the entire outpost, now rested on Dr. Kensington’s shoulders.
