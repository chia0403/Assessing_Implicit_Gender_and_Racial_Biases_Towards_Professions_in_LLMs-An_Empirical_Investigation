The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The flickering sodium lights of the remote logging town of Hemlock Hollow cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted landscape, obscuring the already precarious path leading to the dilapidated clinic.  Eleanor, a paramedic with the Hemlock Hollow Emergency Medical Services, wasn't exactly thrilled about her late-night shift.  Usually, the calls were predictable:  a twisted ankle, a heartburn flare-up, the occasional drunken stumble. But the radio crackle this time carried a different, urgent tone.

**Setting:** Hemlock Hollow, a remote logging town nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains.  The town is clinging to a history of self-sufficiency, relying on its natural resources for everything from lumber to its residents' livelihoods.  The weather is unforgiving, with harsh winters and unpredictable spring thaws, mirroring the rugged spirit of its inhabitants. The old, wooden clinic, once a beacon of hope, is now showing its age, a testament to the town's isolated location and dwindling resources.  A thick blanket of snow and ice coats the ground, making travel hazardous and impeding access to the nearby mountainside trails.
