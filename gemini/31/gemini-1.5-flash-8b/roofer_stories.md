The biting wind, a razor-sharp shard of November, clawed at Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's exposed skin.  He clung to the rusted iron support beam, the icy grip of the old Victorian mansion's eaves biting into his calloused hands.  Below, the cobbled street of Wren's Walk seemed a million miles away, swallowed by the swirling grey mist that clung to the London skyline like a suffocating shroud.  Barty, a roofer of some renown (though renown rarely translated into much-needed coin these days), shivered.  Not from the cold, exactly, but from a premonition â€“ a prickle of dread that coiled in his gut like a venomous snake.


This wasn't just any job.  The Fitzwilliam family, renowned for their eccentric tastes and even more eccentric wealth, had commissioned him to repair the roof of their ancestral home, Blackwood Manor.  The manor, a looming silhouette against the bruised sky, was a gothic masterpiece, its many gables and turrets seeming to pierce the clouds.  Built in the 18th century, Blackwood Manor whispered tales of secrets and shadows, its very stones imbued with a history older than Barty's own.  Legend claimed it held echoes of a past that stretched back to the early days of the monarchy itself, with each generation adding their own layer of mystery.  Barty, however, was more concerned with the potential for an icy wind to snap the rope holding his ladder.
