The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Peabody's meticulously ordered life.  Her name, a testament to her grandmother's love of Victorian novels, felt oddly out of place in the sterile, beige-walled office.  Amelia, with her meticulously pressed floral dresses and sensible shoes, was a creature of precise routines and even more precise calculations.  Today, however, the rhythm was off.  The usual harmonious ticking of the clock was punctuated by a frantic pinging from her computer, and the familiar scent of stale coffee was strangely replaced by the acrid tang of something akin to burnt sugar.  The air hung heavy with the unspoken tension that precedes a major financial disaster, a feeling that Amelia, with her years of experience, recognized all too well.

The setting:  A bustling, yet somehow claustrophobic, office complex in the heart of a rapidly developing sector of the city.  Modern skyscrapers scraped the clouds, their sleek glass facades reflecting the relentless city light.  Within this concrete jungle, Numbers & Nuggets was a small island of efficiency, tucked away on a quiet side street.  Amelia's cubicle was situated in the back corner, next to the perpetually overflowing coffee machine.  Outside the window, construction crews hammered and bulldozed, a stark contrast to the quiet hum of paperwork within. A sense of impending change, not just in the city, but within the firm itself, hung heavy in the air.
