The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow by years of undiluted bleach and spilled fillings, reflected the flickering fluorescent light above Dr. Amelia Nightingale's head.  Dust motes danced in the beam, illuminating the chaotic array of dental tools – gleaming instruments, rusted pliers, and forgotten prophylaxis cups – strewn across the countertop.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, a persistent tang that clung to the worn linoleum floor.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-eight with tired eyes and a stubborn streak of auburn hair that refused to stay tamed, meticulously cleaned a chipped molar from a plaster model, the tiny fragments rattling against the metal tray.  Outside, the relentless rain hammered against the grimy windows of her small, downtown dental office, mirroring the insistent throbbing in her temples.  This was a Tuesday.  The kind that felt like a bottomless pit of paperwork and patient complaints, a perpetual reminder that the promise of a perfect smile, often just a fleeting illusion.
