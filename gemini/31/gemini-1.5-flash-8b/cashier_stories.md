The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" superstore hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic clinking of coins and the occasional frustrated sigh.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, a young woman with eyes the color of faded amethyst, meticulously scanned a carton of eggs.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap disinfectant, clung to her like a second skin.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, a time Amy loathed, the lull between the morning rush and the evening stampede, when the store felt cavernous and eerily silent.  The colossal space, lined with rows upon rows of brightly-packaged goods, felt almost hostile.

The setting:  a sprawling, impersonal superstore located in the heart of a rapidly developing suburb, a place where the edges of familiar neighborhoods blurred into endless asphalt.  Rows of identical houses, with identical lawns meticulously maintained, stretched out to the horizon.  The only hint of individuality was the odd splash of vibrant color in a flowerbed, a stubborn rose bush pushing its way through the monotonous landscape.
