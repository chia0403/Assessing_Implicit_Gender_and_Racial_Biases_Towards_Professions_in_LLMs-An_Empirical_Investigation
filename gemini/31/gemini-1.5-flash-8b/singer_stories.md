The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the smudges of soot that clung to her cheeks like a second skin.  The air inside the smoky tavern hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia, a singer with a voice like liquid moonlight, adjusted the worn leather strap of her guitar case, her fingers tracing the familiar grooves.  Tonight, the stage was a narrow platform in the corner, barely bigger than a coffin, and the audience, a collection of weary faces etched with the stories of a thousand lost nights.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her temporary home in the ever-shifting landscape of the Neon Quarter.
