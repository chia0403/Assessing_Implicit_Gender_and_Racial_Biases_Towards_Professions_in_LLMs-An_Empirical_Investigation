The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the cracked earth of the Badlands, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and something faintly metallic, like old blood.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains, swirling around the weathered silhouette of Silas Blackwood, the Blackwood Ranch foreman. Silas, a man carved from sun-baked granite and hardened by years of relentless drought, squinted at the horizon, a faint line of smoke clinging to the distant peaks.  Heâ€™d seen that smoke before, a familiar, and increasingly unwelcome, sign.

The setting was the unforgiving, sun-scorched Badlands of Montana, 1887.  Vast swathes of scrubby, thorny vegetation clung desperately to the cracked earth, interspersed with the occasional, ancient, gnarled juniper.  The air, thick with the dry heat, crackled with the promise of another harsh summer.  Blackwood Ranch, a sprawling but worn homestead, was nestled in a narrow valley, its wooden buildings weathered and faded, whispering stories of past droughts and hard-won victories.  Livestock, gaunt and resigned to their fate, grazed in the thin, scrawny grass, their eyes mirroring the dust-filled skies.  The river that once flowed freely, now trickled weakly, a mere whisper against the relentless demands of the land.
