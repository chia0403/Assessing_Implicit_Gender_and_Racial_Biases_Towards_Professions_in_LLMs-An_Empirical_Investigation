Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hayes's heart.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and antiseptic, hung heavy in the sterile-yet-grimy examination room.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Hayes, forensic psychologist, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  The case file, its pages brittle with age and stained with the lingering residue of desperation, lay open on the scarred Formica table.  It was the case of the “Silent Scream,” a moniker whispered among the city's hushed circles, a case that had burrowed its way into Amelia's consciousness, a relentless, creeping vine choking the space around her.

The setting was the neglected, once-grand Blackwood Manor, a crumbling Victorian mansion perched on the edge of the city's forgotten periphery.  Years of neglect had turned its grandeur into a skeletal husk, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at a world that had moved on.  Ivy choked the stone walls, transforming the stately façade into a claustrophobic jungle.  Inside, the silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the whisper of the wind whistling through broken panes and the occasional drip of water echoing through the empty halls.  It felt like a place where time had stopped, where shadows danced with secrets and the past clung to the present like a shroud. The case, revolving around a series of baffling disappearances within the manor's tangled history, had Amelia haunted for months, each day bringing her closer to the chilling truth.
