The flickering fluorescent lights of the Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the worn oak desk.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the chipped paint and faded floral wallpaper.  Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist with a practiced calm, stared across at Amelia, her client, a young woman with eyes the color of storm clouds, perpetually shadowed by anxiety.

The small, cluttered office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of a bustling metropolis, was a microcosm of Eleanor's life.  Bookshelves crammed with volumes on human behavior lined one wall, overflowing onto a small, rickety table.  A worn leather armchair, smelling faintly of aged paper and burnt coffee, sat opposite the desk, its weathered surface reflecting the faint glimmer of a half-empty mug and the tension coiled in Amelia's posture.  Eleanorâ€™s own tension, less visible but no less present,  lay coiled in the familiar knots of her shoulders.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the weight of the city, its anxieties and unspoken burdens, pressed down on the room, mirroring the heavy atmosphere of the session.
