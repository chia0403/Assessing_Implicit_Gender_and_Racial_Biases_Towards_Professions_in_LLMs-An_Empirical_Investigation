Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the anxieties swirling in Dr. Amelia Petrovaâ€™s mind.  The fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed, casting a sterile glow on the chipped Formica table and the overflowing recycling bin.  Outside, the city, usually a vibrant tapestry of lights and sirens, was muted, swallowed by the storm.  This was her routine, this oppressive grey predictability.  Amelia, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, stared out the window, the blurring cityscape a stark contrast to the sharp, focused image of the young man waiting for her, a troubled soul submerged in the storm's intensity.  The man, whom she knew only as "Ethan," was a case study of resilience.  He'd come to her clinic three months ago with a fragmented narrative, a broken spirit, and an almost impossible yearning for healing. This particular session felt pivotal.
