Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "The Healing Hands," a small, unassuming massage therapy studio tucked away on a side street in the bustling, yet oddly quiet, city of Emberwood.  The rhythmic drumming was a comforting counterpoint to the frantic pulse of Amelia Nightingale's thoughts.  Amelia, a woman of twenty-eight with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a touch as gentle as moonlight, was meticulously preparing her treatment room.  Essential oils, the faintest floral scent of lavender and chamomile, hung heavy in the air, mixing with the earthy aroma of sandalwood from the diffuser.  Today's appointment was particularly important.  A client known only as "Mr. Blackwood," a man shrouded in a peculiar aura of both quiet intensity and guarded vulnerability, was scheduled for a deep tissue massage.  Amelia had sensed a palpable tension in his past few sessions, a quiet tremor beneath the surface of his outwardly controlled demeanor.  The echoing rain, a constant presence outside, seemed to mirror the unspoken anxieties churning within the room, awaiting her touch.
