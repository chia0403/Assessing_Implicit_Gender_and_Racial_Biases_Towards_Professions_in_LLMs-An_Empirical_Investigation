The greasy, flickering fluorescent lights of "Rusty Wrench" hung low, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered workshop.  A faint metallic tang hung in the air, a mixture of oil, gasoline, and something indefinably chemical, a scent that clung to everything from the worn leatherette armchairs to the grime-encrusted toolbox of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, the proprietor of Rusty Wrench.  Barty, a man whose face bore the same map of tool marks and engine scars as his hands, hunched over a mangled minivan, its once-bright paint now a faded, chipped mess.  The engine block, exposed and stark, looked like a prehistoric beast, its metal veins and arteries twisted and bruised.  Barty’s brow furrowed, his thick eyebrows drawing together like a caterpillar preparing for a nap.  Outside, the rhythmic rumble of city traffic pulsed through the grimy windows, a constant low hum that underscored the quiet desperation of the midday.  This wasn’t a day for miracles, and Barty, though secretly optimistic, knew he was facing a formidable challenge.
