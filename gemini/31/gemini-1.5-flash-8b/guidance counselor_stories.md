The fluorescent lights of the high school cafeteria hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the clatter of trays and the muffled whispers of teenagers.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating the chipped Formica tables and the faded posters advertising upcoming school events.  This was the daily ritual for Eleanor Vance, guidance counselor extraordinaire (or at least, that's what she hoped).  Today, however, the usual cacophony of teenage angst was muted. A thick, unsettling silence hung over the room, broken only by the rhythmic chewing of gum and the occasional, strangled sob.  Eleanor, perched precariously on the edge of a stool beside the perpetually overflowing recycling bin, felt a knot tighten in her stomach.  She knew, somehow, that something was terribly wrong.  Outside the window, the vibrant autumn leaves, normally a source of welcome color, seemed muted, mirroring the atmosphere inside.
