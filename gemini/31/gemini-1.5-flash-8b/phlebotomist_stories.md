The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound that truly registered with Elara Vance.  Outside, the relentless Chicago rain hammered against the corrugated steel of the building's exterior, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic beep of the automated blood-analysis machines within.  Elara, her name a whisper against the sterile white walls, worked the late shift at the bustling Northside Community Clinic.  The air, thick with the antiseptic tang of bleach and the faint, metallic scent of blood, hung heavy and still.  Each drop, each vial, each sample, carried with it a universe of stories, a whisper of lives, and Elara, the phlebotomist, was the silent custodian of them all.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A prickling unease, a feeling that the usual rhythm of the clinic had been subtly shifted, settled over her.  The rain outside seemed to intensify, a relentless drumming on the windows, mirroring the frantic pulse she felt in her own veins.
