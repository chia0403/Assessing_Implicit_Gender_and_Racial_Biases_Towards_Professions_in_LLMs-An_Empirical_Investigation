The fluorescent lights of the Salt Lake City International Airport hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythmic thrum of Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's heart.  Amy, a flight attendant for Skyward Airlines, meticulously checked the manifest, the tiny, almost invisible numbers blurring into a chaotic dance in the stale air.  Outside, a blizzard raged.  Gusts of icy wind howled against the towering terminal windows, their roar a stark contrast to the hushed, controlled atmosphere inside the airport.  Amy shivered, not just from the cold but also from a growing sense of unease.  Tonight's flight, Skyward 234, to Anchorage, was scheduled to depart in two hours, but an unnerving tension hung heavy in the air, a palpable weight that seemed to press down on everyone in the terminal. The airport, usually bustling with travelers, felt strangely empty, as if the blizzard had sucked the life out of it, leaving only the relentless, cold, and the ever-present fear of what lay beyond.
