The chipped paint of the Grand Veridian Hotel, peeling like sunburnt skin, reflected the sickly yellow light of a late afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the lobby, highlighting the faded grandeur of the once-opulent establishment.  Barnaby "Barney" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire (or at least, that was what he told himself), sighed dramatically, polishing a brass doorknob with a fervor that belied the profound boredom in his soul.  The hotel, once humming with the boisterous energy of wealthy tourists, now echoed with a melancholy silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional creak of the aged floorboards.  It was a Tuesday, and Barney was practically drowning in the quiet.
