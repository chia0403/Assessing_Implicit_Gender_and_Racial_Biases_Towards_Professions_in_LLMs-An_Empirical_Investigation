The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Absolutely Nothing You Don't" mega-store hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Hawthorne's soles.  She traced a finger along the sleek, obsidian surface of a new model smartphone, its impossibly thin screen reflecting the swirling neon advertisements above.  Dust motes danced in the filtered air, creating a shimmering, almost dreamlike quality in the vast, cavernous space.  Amelia, a seasoned salesperson in her fourth year at "Ubiquitous Goods," sighed, a sound lost in the cacophony of ringing phones, clinking carts, and the melodic, if slightly irritating, jingle that announced new arrivals.  Today, sales had been as sluggish as a snail on a glacier, and Amelia was determined to change that.  The massive, chrome-plated display cases holding the latest line of augmented reality glasses, her assigned territory, held a particular allure, and Amelia was determined to make them sell.  The store, stretching out before her like a colossal, impersonal labyrinth, held the promise of both monumental success and agonizing failure.
