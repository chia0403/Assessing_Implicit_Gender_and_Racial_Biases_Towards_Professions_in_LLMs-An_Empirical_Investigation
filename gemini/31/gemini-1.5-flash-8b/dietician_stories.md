The biting November wind whipped Amelia Josephine Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the cobbled streets of Greystone.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered the narrow alleyways in a sheen of grey.  Greystone, nestled within the foothills of the whispering Black Peaks, was a city sculpted from gloom and steeped in the melancholic aroma of damp earth and brewing tea.  Ancient stone houses, each with their own stories etched into their weathered facades, huddled together like weary travellers.  Amelia, a registered dietician with a keen eye for detail and a profound understanding of nutrition, found a particular, almost unsettling, beauty in the city's muted palette.  Today, however, her focus wasn't on the aesthetic.  It was on the alarmingly high incidence of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) amongst the residents of Greystone, a trend she suspected was linked to their nutrient-poor, traditionally based diet.  Her latest client, a frail woman named Elara Vance, had been the catalyst for Amelia's investigation, her case a stark example of the city's dietary disharmony.
