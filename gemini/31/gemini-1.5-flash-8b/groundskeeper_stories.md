The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's hands, a meagre comfort against the biting November wind that whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, illuminating the frost-laced blades of grass.  Amy, groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, squinted at the sprawling estate.  Its grandeur, usually a source of quiet pride, felt heavy, oppressive this morning.  A subtle, almost imperceptible, shift had settled over the place, a palpable sense of something amiss.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, held a tremor, a hushed anticipation.  She'd noticed it earlier, a strange stillness where normally the symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves vibrated through the air.  The manor itself seemed to hold its breath, a silent observer of this brewing change.
