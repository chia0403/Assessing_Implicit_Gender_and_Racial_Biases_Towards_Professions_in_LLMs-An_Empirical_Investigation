The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel skeleton of the new skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  Thirty stories up, the city sprawled beneath him like a tapestry woven from concrete and glass, a dizzying expanse that seemed to shrink with every breath he took.  He gripped the safety harness, the metal cold against his palms, a stark contrast to the simmering heat that pulsed in his chest.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the fractured clouds, painting the scene in shades of grey and bruised purple.  Below, the rhythmic clang of hammers and the distant roar of machinery echoed upwards, a relentless soundtrack to the construction that consumed him, both physically and mentally.

Elias Thorne, thirty-two years old and hard-muscled, was a structural ironworker for Apex Construction.  He'd been with the company for ten years, climbing these same precarious heights, seeing the city grow in a flurry of concrete and steel.  His work boots were scuffed, his denim overalls stained with the grime of a thousand construction days.  A faded, embroidered patch of a crimson phoenix, a symbol of his native Puerto Rican heritage, was sewn onto his pocket.  Today, however, the phoenix seemed a distant, almost irrelevant image.  The wind carried with it the scent of something acrid, something burnt, somethingâ€¦wrong.  A premonition tightened in his gut, a knot of unease that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed calm Elias had maintained for so many years.
