The biting wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s coat, stinging her cheeks as she steered her battered Land Rover through the skeletal remains of the Whispering Pines forest.  Autumn had arrived with a ferocity that seemed to mock the fragile beauty of the dying trees.  Sun-bleached needles, like skeletal fingers, clawed at the bruised sky.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and decaying leaves, carried a faint, metallic tang.  This particular stretch of the Blackwood Mountains, usually a haven for deer and grouse, now felt eerily silent, a place where the whispers of the wind seemed to hold secrets, none of them pleasant.

Dr. Vance, her name a whispered legend amongst the mountain folk, had arrived at the edge of the ravine with a sense of dread that clung to her like the clinging ivy of the forest's perimeter. A frantic call had come through the crackling radio from a local farmer, a plea for help tinged with a desperate fear.  The call had described a strange illness afflicting his prized herd of Highland cattle, an affliction that had left the animals contorting in agonizing postures, their breath hissing like escaping steam.

The Blackwood Mountains, a sprawling, unforgiving wilderness clinging to the jagged edges of the northern border, housed a peculiar blend of ancient secrets and modern anxieties.  Small, isolated homesteads dotted the landscape, their inhabitants fiercely independent and connected to the land in a way that seemed almost archaic. The mountains themselves felt alive, their peaks perpetually shrouded in mist, their valleys holding secrets deep within their mossy folds.  This was Eleanor's domain, a territory she had navigated since childhood, a territory that held its own peculiar, often frightening, magic.
