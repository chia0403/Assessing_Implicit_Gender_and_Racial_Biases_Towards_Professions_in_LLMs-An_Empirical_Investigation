Today, however, the usual symphony of bird calls and the low rumble of herbivores was muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness. Elara, clutching her thermos of lukewarm tea, hurried down the winding path toward the griffin enclosure.  She was the Sanctuary's animal caretaker, a role that, for all its hardships, held a profound beauty, a whispering bond with the creatures that called the Whisperwind home.
