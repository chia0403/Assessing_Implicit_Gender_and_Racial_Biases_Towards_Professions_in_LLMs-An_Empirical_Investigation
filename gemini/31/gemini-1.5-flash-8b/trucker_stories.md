The biting wind whipped at the oversized visor of Amelia "Ace"  Hart's cab, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Snow, the consistency of crushed glass, plastered itself against the windshield of her rig, "The Iron Horse."  The interstate, usually a ribbon of controlled chaos, was a frozen, ghostly expanse, stretching out before her like a ribbon of ice wound around a desolate landscape.  A lone, skeletal pine tree, its branches clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers, stood sentinel on the far side of the road.  Around her, the vast, unforgiving plains of Montana whispered secrets only the wind could carry.  The temperature gauge on her dashboard hovered around -20°F.

Ace, her face etched with the familiar lines of a woman hardened by years on the road, adjusted the thick wool of her trucker's hat.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her rig’s engine was the only constant sound amidst the howling blizzard.  This was her reality.  This was her life.  Tonight, she wasn't just hauling a load of frozen produce; she was hauling a secret, a secret as heavy as the load of crates stacked high in her trailer.
