The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Maisie"  Montgomery's face, highlighting the faint stubble that had stubbornly refused to disappear beneath her chin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic clinking of glasses in the small, smoky bar.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely floral â€“ likely wilting jasmine from a forgotten bouquet somewhere in the back room.  Maisie wiped down the sticky mahogany counter, the wood grain a worn, familiar tapestry against which her fingers danced with practiced ease.  Tonight, however, the familiar rhythm felt off-key.  A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a tangible thing pressing against her ribs.  This was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, but the stillness felt wrong, pregnant with a silent anticipation. The single, flickering fluorescent light over the pool table cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her frustration. The only other customer, a man hunched over a glass of whiskey, remained stubbornly silent, lost in his own thoughts, a silent observer in the otherwise empty room.
