The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of rain that had begun to fall outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia "Poppy"  Periwinkle's tiny shop,  "Blooms by the Bay."  The rhythmic drumming was a constant, insistent companion to the soft clinking of glass and the occasional sigh of Poppy as she meticulously arranged a bouquet of anemones, their delicate petals mirroring the pale grey sky.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the port town of Seabreeze, was a riot of colour despite the gloom.  Vivid blooms – sunflowers, geraniums, even a fiery hibiscus – bursting from overflowing terracotta pots, fought for space amongst the overflowing shelves laden with silk ribbons, vases, and dried lavender.  Sunlight, fractured by the rain, struggled to pierce the gaps in the awning, casting long shadows that danced with the rain-slicked cobblestones outside.
