Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of "The Whispering Scissors," a salon tucked away on a side street of the bustling port city of Veridia.  The rhythmic drumming was a familiar soundtrack to Elara Abernathy, a cosmetologist with fingers as nimble as the city's restless tides.  Today, however, the relentless downpour seemed to amplify the usual murmur of salon chatter, turning it into a low, almost mournful hum.  Elara, with her signature auburn braid pulled tight against the dampness, was hunched over a client, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Across the small, cluttered room, the flickering fluorescent lights cast an eerie glow on the chipped porcelain sinks and the faded floral wallpaper.  Dusty, faded images of sun-drenched beaches and palm trees clung stubbornly to the walls, a stark contrast to the grey reality outside.  Veridia, a city built on the salt-laced breath of the sea, had seen better days, reflected in the faces of its citizens, and the struggles of its residents were often etched onto their skin. Elara's skilled hands, trained to sculpt beauty, were today also working with a deeper understanding of the scars and stories behind those faces.
