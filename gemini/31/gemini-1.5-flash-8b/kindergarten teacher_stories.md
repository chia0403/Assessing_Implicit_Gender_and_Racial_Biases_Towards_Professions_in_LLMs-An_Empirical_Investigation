The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom, a faded, sun-bleached apricot, seemed to sigh with the afternoon heat.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight piercing the window, illuminating the scattered treasures of a child's imagination:  crayon shavings, a meticulously crafted paper castle, and a miniature plastic dinosaur, its tiny eyes gleaming with prehistoric menace.

Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair always seemed to capture a stray strand of sunlight, surveyed her charges.  They were engaged in a passionate game of "pretend" â€“ a game she knew, with a knowing smile, was secretly a mirror reflecting their own miniature dramas, anxieties, and triumphs.
