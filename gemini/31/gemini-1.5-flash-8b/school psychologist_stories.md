The fluorescent hum of the high school cafeteria buzzed, a low-frequency thrum that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's bones.  Crumbs, the ghosts of spilled soda, and the murmured anxieties of teenagers clung to the air like a damp fog.  Amelia, School Psychologist at Northwood High, pushed her half-eaten salad away.  The vibrant greens and pale yellows of the salad seemed a cruel mockery of the bleakness she felt settling over her.  Another restless night, another cascade of tears from a student sobbing into a counselor's shoulder, another impossible tangle of fractured emotions.  This was her third year at Northwood, and the weight of the school – a concrete monument to teenage angst and burgeoning disillusionment – felt heavier with each passing semester.

The setting was the bustling, echoing cafeteria of Northwood High School, a sprawling, grey-brick building nestled in the heart of a suburban town.  Overgrown ivy clung to the aged stone walls, a stark contrast to the sterile, polished surfaces inside.  Chrome-plated tables and chairs, echoing the clinical nature of the school, contrasted with the raw energy spilling from the teenagers who filled the room.  The scent of cheap, cafeteria-style food – mystery meat and suspiciously bright-colored fruit snacks – hung heavy in the air, a tangible representation of the sometimes-empty calories that fueled the students’ lives.
