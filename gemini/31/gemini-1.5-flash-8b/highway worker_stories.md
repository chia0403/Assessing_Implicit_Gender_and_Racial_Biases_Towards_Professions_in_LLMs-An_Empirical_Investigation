The biting wind whipped at Amelia Hawthorne's worn raincoat, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  She hunched deeper into the oversized, fluorescent-yellow jacket, the only splash of colour against the monochrome landscape of the desolate Montana highway.  Snow, the consistency of fine gravel, coated everything in a suffocating white.  Mile after mile stretched out before her, a featureless expanse broken only by the skeletal remains of a rusted-out pickup, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the high plains.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the Montana Department of Transportation, was alone, save for the relentless drone of the wind and the silent, watchful presence of the vast, empty sky.

The year was 1978.  Winter had descended on the desolate stretch of Highway 212, a ribbon of asphalt winding through the rugged heart of the Continental Divide.  The temperature hovered just above freezing, but the biting wind made the air feel far colder.  Amelia's work site was a remote, isolated patch of highway, several miles from the nearest town, nestled in a valley choked by towering pines and jagged peaks.  The silence was broken only by the rhythmic clang of her pickaxe against hardened earth and the occasional screech of a hawk circling overhead, searching for scraps of life in the stark wilderness.  The biting frost had coated the steel of her tools, and the snow-covered landscape offered little escape from the gnawing loneliness that clung to the mountain air.
