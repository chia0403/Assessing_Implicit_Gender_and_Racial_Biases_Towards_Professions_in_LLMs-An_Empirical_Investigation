Professor Eleanor Vance, renowned astrophysicist and meticulous record-keeper, stared at the swirling nebulae on her monitor.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight slicing through her cluttered office, illuminating the constellations tattooed onto the worn wooden desk.  The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and stale coffee, hung heavy with the weight of centuries of astronomical data â€“ a mountain of numbers, charts, and observations meticulously compiled over her career at the prestigious University of Chandragupta.  Her office, tucked away on the third floor of the dusty observatory, felt both ancient and futuristic.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows, illuminating the vast, empty space around her desk.  A half-eaten bowl of mango chutney sat beside a stack of precariously balanced journals, their leather spines cracked and worn.  A single, oversized telescope, its metallic lens reflecting the muted sunlight, loomed behind her, a silent observer of the cosmic secrets she sought to unlock.  Today, however, something was different.  A subtle tremor, almost imperceptible, seemed to emanate from the core of the nebula, a flicker of something...unnatural.
