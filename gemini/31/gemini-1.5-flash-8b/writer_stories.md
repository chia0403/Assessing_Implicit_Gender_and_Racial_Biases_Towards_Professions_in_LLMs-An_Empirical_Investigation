Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, ramshackle cottage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, clung to her like a second skin.

A place where the only company she kept were the unsettling whispers of the ancient forest bordering the property.  The whispers, she now suspected, were more than just the wind's lament.  They were a symphony of secrets, a prelude to something far more sinister.
