The fluorescent hum of the newsroom buzzed, a low, insistent drone that seeped into Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's bones.  Empty coffee cups, half-eaten sandwiches, and crumpled drafts littered her desk, a testament to the relentless rhythm of deadlines.  Across the cluttered mahogany table, her colleague, Leo, hunched over a laptop, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and impending disaster.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridian thrummed with a life Em barely registered anymore.  She was buried in the digital graveyard of tomorrow's headlines.

The city was in the grip of an unusual economic downturn, and the report, meant to be reassuring, was oddly… hollow.
