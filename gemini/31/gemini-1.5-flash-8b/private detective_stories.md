Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rusty Mug" diner, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's head.  The stale coffee smelled of burnt sugar and desperation, just like the case she was wrestling with.  The diner, a greasy spoon sanctuary clinging precariously to the edge of the Rust Belt town of Havenwood, was her temporary office.  Outside, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the overcast sky, mirroring the gnawing anxiety in Ash's gut.  Havenwood, a town built on whispers and secrets, seemed to hold its breath, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet beside her booth.  

Amelia "Ash" Ashworth, private investigator, 32 years old and a walking, talking storm cloud, took another sip of her coffee.  The aroma, acrid and unwelcome, failed to mask the scent of fear that clung to the air like a shroud.  The case, a baffling disappearance of a renowned local artist, Silas Blackwood, had Ash on high alert.  The clues, few and far between, were as cryptic as Blackwood's own abstract paintings, each brushstroke a cryptic whisper lost in the labyrinth of Havenwood's murky history.  Ash needed answers, and fast. The only thing keeping her from leaving Havenwood and the whispers that haunted its streets was the slim chance that the truth could be found within those very walls.
