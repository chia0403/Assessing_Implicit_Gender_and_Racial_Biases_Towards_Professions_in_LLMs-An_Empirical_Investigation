Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small physiotherapy clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the insistent throb in Amelia Hayes's temples.  The clinic, nestled in the heart of the sprawling, grey industrial estate of Northcliffe, was a stark contrast to the vibrant, sun-drenched coastal towns she'd grown up near.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light above her head, highlighting the chipped paint and faded posters advertising back pain relief and sports injury rehabilitation.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a name that spoke of a sun-drenched past, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.  Today was supposed to be a turning point, a chance to prove herself capable of handling the crushing demands of this unfamiliar practice, but the relentless downpour outside seemed to mock her inner turmoil.  Each drip echoed the slow, painstaking progress of her patients, each lingering doubt a reminder of the vast gulf between her aspirations and her current reality.
