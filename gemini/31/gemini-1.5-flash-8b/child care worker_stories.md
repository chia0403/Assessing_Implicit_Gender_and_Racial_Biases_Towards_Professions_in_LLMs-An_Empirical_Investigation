The fluorescent lights of the "Rainbow Rockets" preschool hummed, a relentless, slightly unsettling drone that echoed Amelia Blackwood's growing frustration.  Eight-thirty in the morning, and already, the tiny, colourful playroom was a whirlwind of unbuttoned jackets, spilled crayons, and the high-pitched shrieks of toddlers negotiating the intricacies of a Lego castle. Amelia, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually hopeful smile, stood amidst the chaos, trying to corral a particularly energetic group of three-year-olds who had decided that the alphabet blocks were a perfect medium for a miniature demolition derby.  Her name tag, embroidered with "Amelia Blackwood - Childcare Worker," felt heavy against her sweater.

The setting was a cramped, brightly painted room, the walls adorned with posters of friendly cartoon animals and motivational quotes about the joys of learning.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-laden windows, cast long shadows across the colourful floor and scattered toys.  The air, thick with the scent of plastic, baby food, and unwashed hair, hung heavy in the early morning air.  A faint whiff of cinnamon from a nearby, ever-present container of children's snack mix hung in the air, a small, sweet contrast to the overwhelming energy of the room.  The small playroom was barely enough space for all the little ones and their activities, the constant noise of their activity a testament to the limited size. Outside, a cold November drizzle hammered against the windows, making the indoor chaos feel all the more contained and urgent.
