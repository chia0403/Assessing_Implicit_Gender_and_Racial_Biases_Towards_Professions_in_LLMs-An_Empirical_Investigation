Glass walls of the office overlooked the bustling cityscape, the ceaseless symphony of honking cars and distant sirens amplifying the internal pressure within the firm.  A constant flow of clients, each with their own tale of woe or triumph, flooded the halls, their stories echoing in the sterile halls, waiting to be translated into the dense language of law.
