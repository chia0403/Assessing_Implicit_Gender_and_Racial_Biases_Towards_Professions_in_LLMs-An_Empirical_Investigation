Rumours whispered of ancient power, of a forgotten god's final resting place, and of the horrors that awaited those who dared to trespass.  And Kael, despite the gnawing cold, felt a growing sense of dread.  The emptiness of the valley, the silent scream of the wind, had always been unsettling.  Tonight, though, it was different.
