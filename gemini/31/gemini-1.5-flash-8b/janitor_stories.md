The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Tower hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of Elias Thorne's broom.  Elias Thorne, janitor of the prestigious Zenith Corporation, was, in a way, a silent guardian of the skyscraper's secrets.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, swirling around his worn cleaning cloths, mirroring the swirling thoughts in his mind.  He'd been meticulously polishing the marble floor of the penthouse suite – an exercise in futility, really, as the next morning would inevitably see the faintest of scuff marks and stray crumbs.  But there was something different today.  Something… *unsettling*.

The setting was the 90th floor of the Zenith Tower, a glass-and-steel marvel that pierced the grey London sky.  Inside the opulent penthouse, the scent of expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the cleaning solution Elias used.  The only other sounds besides the hum of the fluorescent lights and the scrape of his broom were the faint, almost inaudible, whispers drifting from the closed office at the far end of the suite.  They were nothing he could truly interpret, more like the rustle of unseen papers. But the whispers lingered, and in the quiet expanse of the penthouse, they grew into a kind of unnerving presence. Elias felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine, a feeling he'd come to recognize, a harbinger of something amiss.
