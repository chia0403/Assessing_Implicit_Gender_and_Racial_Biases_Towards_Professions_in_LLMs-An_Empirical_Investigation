The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the moor.  Fog, thick as a shroud, clung to the jagged peaks of the Pennine range, obscuring the familiar landmarks.  This wasn't the usual, vibrant spectacle of the Derbyshire Peak District; today, the valley seemed to hold its breath, a suffocating stillness punctuated only by the mournful cry of a lone curlew.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide known for her vibrant storytelling and infectious enthusiasm, felt a prickle of unease.  This was the "Whispering Vale," and even she, despite her years exploring its haunted history, felt a shiver run down her spine.  Today's guided tour, focusing on the legends of the lost Lady Alice and the cursed Blackwood stone, was set to be particularly gripping.  But this atmosphere...this was different.  Something was amiss.  Her clients, a group of ten intrepid tourists from Toronto, fidgeted nervously behind her, their excited chatter replaced by hushed whispers.  The air crackled with an unseen tension, a palpable fear that lingered in the very mist itself.
