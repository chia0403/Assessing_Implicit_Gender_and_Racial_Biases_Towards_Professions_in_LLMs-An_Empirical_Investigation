The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the ragged breaths of the patients sprawled across the examination tables.  Dr. Alistair Finch, Physician's Assistant, felt the familiar knot tighten in his stomach.  Another night, another barrage of trauma.  Outside, the city throbbed with a life he rarely glimpsed, a world of vibrant lights and bustling energy that seemed so far removed from the sterile, antiseptic reality of the ER.  He was Elias Thorne, PA-C, but to the chaotic symphony of the night, he was just Elias, a silent witness to the human condition in its most fragile state.

The setting was the bustling, perpetually tired emergency room of Mercy General Hospital, a sprawling institution on the edge of the city, where the vibrant energy of the urban landscape collided with the raw, urgent reality of human suffering.  The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, the clatter of medical equipment a constant, rhythmic pulse.  Rows of examination bays, each a microcosm of someone's crisis, lined the room.  The rhythmic beeping of heart monitors mixed with the pained moans of the patients, creating a cacophony that Elias, like every other staff member, had long since grown accustomed to but never truly learned to ignore.
