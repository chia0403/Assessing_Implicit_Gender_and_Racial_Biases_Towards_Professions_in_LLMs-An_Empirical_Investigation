The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones.  Drip, drip, drip.  The sound, insistent and monotonous, echoed through the cavernous interior, a soundtrack to the low hum of conversation and the clinking of mugs.  Elara Nightingale, a server at the Rusty Mug for the past three years, wiped a stray drop of condensation from the chipped porcelain of a half-empty tankard.  Her apron, stained with the grease of countless fried onions and the tannins of countless brews, clung to her like a second skin.  Tonight, the rain seemed especially heavy, and the air hung thick with the scent of roasted barley and damp earth. The flickering gaslight in the corner cast long, dancing shadows across the tables, transforming the already dimly lit establishment into a realm of perpetual twilight.  Customers, huddled close for warmth, whispered amongst themselves, their voices muffled by the constant, rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Elara felt a familiar tremor of unease crawl up her spine. It was a feeling she'd learned to ignore, to bury under the layers of routine and forced smiles.  Tonight, however, the rumble of the storm seemed almostâ€¦ominous.
