The air hung thick and cloying, a miasma of blood, bone dust, and simmering offal.  It clung to everything in Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers' shop, from the worn wooden counter, slick with years of spilled suet, to the hooks hanging heavy with sides of beef, their marbled flesh a dark, rich tapestry against the dim gaslight.  Outside, the cobblestones of Grimsborough’s Butcher’s Row glistened with a recent rain, reflecting the pale light of the waning moon like a treacherous, oily mirror.  Barty, his apron stained a deep crimson that mirrored the setting sun bleeding across the sky, sharpened his cleaver with a practiced, almost meditative rhythm. The rhythmic *shink-shink-shink* was the only sound louder than the frantic chirping of unseen rats scuttling in the walls – a sound that, to Barty, was as familiar as the smell of his own breath. Tonight, however, even the rats seemed to hold their breath, a palpable tension settling over the usually bustling alley.
