The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled lane, the collar of her heavy wool coat pulled high.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, stung her lungs, a stark contrast to the sterile, antiseptic atmosphere of the hospital she'd just left.  She tugged her worn leather satchel tighter against her side, its contents – a well-worn stethoscope, a battered copy of Gray's Anatomy, and a half-eaten apple – rattling softly.  The gas lamps of Aisling Bay flickered weakly against the encroaching darkness, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like the restless sea crashing against the rocky cliffs just beyond the town's edge.  Tonight, however, Eleanor wasn't headed for the comforting warmth of her cottage; she was on her way to the isolated lighthouse, its lonely beam piercing the stormy night, to attend to a patient far more enigmatic than any she'd encountered within the hospital walls.
