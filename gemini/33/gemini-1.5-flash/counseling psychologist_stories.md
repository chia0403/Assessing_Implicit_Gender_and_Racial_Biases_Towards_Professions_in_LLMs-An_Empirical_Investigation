The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room was a familiar shade of institutional beige, a color that seemed to absorb the anxieties of her clients as readily as it absorbed the afternoon sun slanting through the dusty window.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old carpet and something vaguely floral, a perfume perhaps left lingering by a previous patient – a ghost of their emotional turmoil clinging to the plush, slightly threadbare armchair. Eleanor, whose own anxieties were usually meticulously tucked away beneath a professional facade of calm, found herself unusually unsettled this afternoon.  A low hum, almost subsonic, vibrated through the floorboards, a subtle tremor that seemed to mirror the unease growing in her stomach.  Outside, the relentless drumming of a summer thunderstorm added a chaotic counterpoint to the otherwise quiet space. This was her office in the heart of Greyhaven, a coastal town where the sea’s relentless rhythm mirrored the relentless ebb and flow of human emotions, a rhythm Eleanor had, for the most part, mastered.  But today, the rhythm felt off-key.
