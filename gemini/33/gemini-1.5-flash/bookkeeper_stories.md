The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Featherstonehaugh’s hands, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the single-pane windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of meticulous habit and unwavering routine, found herself utterly, unnervingly, out of her element.  Her cramped office, usually a sanctuary of organized chaos – meticulously labeled files stacked in precarious towers, ledgers gleaming under the harsh fluorescent light, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her trusty Underwood typewriter a constant companion – felt suffocating tonight.  The air, usually thick with the scent of old paper and slightly burnt coffee, now carried a sharper, metallic tang, the lingering aroma of fear.  Outside, the gas lamps of Grimsborough flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the cobbled street, a scene playing out against the backdrop of the perpetually overcast sky that seemed to mirror Amelia’s own gloomy mood.
