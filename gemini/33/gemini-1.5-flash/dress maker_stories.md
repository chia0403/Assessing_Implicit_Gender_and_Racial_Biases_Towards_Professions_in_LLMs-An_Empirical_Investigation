Sunlight, fractured by the leaded-glass windowpanes, painted dappled patterns across the worn oak floorboards, illuminating spools of thread in every imaginable hue, and mountains of shimmering fabrics piled haphazardly on antique dress forms.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, each a tiny, glittering spotlight on the intricate handiwork scattered across the room: unfinished seams, delicate lace appliqu√©s, and a half-finished gown of emerald green silk, its bodice shimmering with thousands of tiny, hand-sewn beads, lay abandoned on a worktable.  Esme Evelyn Worthington, her nimble fingers stained with dye and her silver hair escaping from its severe bun, sat hunched over a delicate sketch, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The year was 1927, and the whispers of the Jazz Age swirled just outside the quiet sanctuary of her London workshop.
