The biting wind, sharp as shattered glass, whipped across Jedediah "Jed" Stone's weathered face.  He squinted, the pale morning sun barely piercing the dense canopy of Douglas firs that cloaked the slopes of Mount Rainier like a thick, emerald cloak.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar aroma that clung to Jed like a second skin after thirty years spent wrestling giants in the Cascade Mountains.  His calloused hands, gnarled and knotted like the roots of the very trees he felled, gripped the worn handle of his axe, the steel gleaming faintly in the weak light.  The logging camp of Timberline, nestled deep within the shadow of the mountain's imposing peak, lay silent save for the occasional creak of a swaying branch and the distant, mournful cry of a raven.  This morning, however, the silence held a different edge, a tension Jed felt in his bones, a premonition as cold and sharp as the wind itself.  He knew, somehow, that this day would be different.
