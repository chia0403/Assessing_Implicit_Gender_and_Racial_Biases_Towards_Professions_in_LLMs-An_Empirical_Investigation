The chipped porcelain mug warmed Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her office.  Rain lashed against the grimy panes of glass, mirroring the turmoil churning in her gut.  Her office, if you could call it that – a cramped, book-lined space above a failing laundromat in the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District – smelled faintly of stale cigarettes, old paper, and the lingering sweetness of the panaderia downstairs.  The air hung thick with the scent of impending rain and the unspoken anxieties of a city that never truly slept.  Outside, the cable cars groaned their familiar ascent up the steep hills, their metallic shriek a counterpoint to the mournful wail of a distant siren.  Izzy, however, was focused on the crumpled photograph in her hand – a faded image of a smiling woman, her eyes holding a haunted glimmer that mirrored Izzy’s own.  This woman, Clara Hernandez, had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a trail of unanswered questions that Izzy, San Francisco's most resourceful (and arguably, most caffeine-dependent) private investigator, was determined to answer.
