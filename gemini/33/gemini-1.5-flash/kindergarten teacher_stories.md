The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Class!” sign flaked onto the freshly swept linoleum floor like a gentle, colourful snow.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak autumn sun slanting through the grimy classroom window, danced in the air, a silent ballet performed for an audience of empty miniature chairs.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that loomed over the playground of Willow Creek Elementary, a sound that somehow both comforted and unsettled Eleanor Vance.  The smell of crayons and slightly sour milk lingered in the air, a familiar perfume that usually filled her with a gentle warmth, but today, it only served to amplify the unsettling quiet.  Eleanor, a woman whose smile lines were as deep as her compassion was wide, sat at her desk, a half-finished cup of lukewarm coffee growing cold beside a stack of brightly coloured construction paper, her usually vibrant spirit dimmed by a cloud of unspoken worry.
