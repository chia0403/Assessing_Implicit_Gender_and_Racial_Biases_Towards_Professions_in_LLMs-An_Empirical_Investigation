The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips as she polished a glass already gleaming under the low, amber light of "The Rusty Mug."  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Emporium" across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and something faintly floral – Elara suspected it was the lingering perfume of the woman who'd just left, her mascara running down her cheeks like charcoal rivulets.  Outside, the city of Veridia howled; inside, The Rusty Mug hummed with a low, contented thrum – a symphony of clinking ice, hushed conversations, and the rhythmic thud of Elara's own practiced hand as she wiped down the bar.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm felt…off.  A prickle of unease, sharper than the usual Friday night anxieties, settled on her skin.
