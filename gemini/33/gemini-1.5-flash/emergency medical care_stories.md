The siren's wail was a banshee scream slicing through the humid Louisiana night, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ambulance's engine.  Rain, thick and relentless, plastered itself against the windshield, blurring the already indistinct outlines of cypress trees lining Highway 190.  Inside, Amelia Jean Dubois, a paramedic with five years and a thousand near-death experiences under her belt, gripped the wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The flashing red and blue lights reflected in her dark eyes, mirroring the urgent pulse of adrenaline coursing through her veins. The air hung heavy with the scent of rain-soaked earth and something else, something metallic and sharp that pricked at the edges of her senses.  This wasn't just another fender bender;  Amelia felt it in her gut, a cold dread that settled like a lead weight in her stomach. This callâ€¦ this call felt different.
