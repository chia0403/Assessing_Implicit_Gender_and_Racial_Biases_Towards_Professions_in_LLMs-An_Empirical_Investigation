The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the city a dizzying panorama below.  Construction dust, fine as powdered sugar, clung to her eyelashes and the collar of her crisp white shirt, a stark contrast to the brooding grey sky above.  From this height, the skeletal frame of the Zenith Tower, a behemoth of glass and steel she’d poured her heart and soul into designing, looked less like a building and more like a colossal, unfinished puzzle.  The air hummed with the tireless activity of the workers far below – a symphony of clanking metal, the roar of machinery, and the occasional shouted instruction carried on the wind.  The scent of fresh concrete and exhaust fumes battled for dominance, a pungent perfume unique to this city, a city Amelia both loved and loathed in equal measure.  Tonight, however, the loathing held a distinct edge, a sharp, icy bite mirroring the wind.  For the Zenith Tower, Amelia’s masterpiece, was about to be judged.  And not by her peers, not by critics, but by forces far more formidable.
