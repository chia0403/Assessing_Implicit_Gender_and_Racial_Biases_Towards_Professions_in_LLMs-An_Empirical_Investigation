The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Frost, a cruel white blanket, clung to the browning stalks of wheat, a stark reminder of the unforgiving autumn settling over the valley of Aethelred.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, carried the mournful cry of a distant hawk, a sound as familiar to Elias as the creak of his own aging barn doors.  His farm, Oakhaven, perched precariously on the edge of the valley, a patchwork of fields clinging to the steep hillside, had been in his family for generations â€“ a legacy he was struggling to maintain.  This year, the harvest had been meager, the winter promised to be harsh, and the shadow of debt loomed larger than the imposing peaks of the Black Mountains that guarded the valley's southern edge.
