The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Elara Vance's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-chilled plexiglass.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-capped peaks shrouded in a swirling veil of snow and mist.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic thrum of the engine, a heartbeat against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.  Elara, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, gripped the yoke, her knuckles bone-white against the worn leather. Tonight's flight wasn't just another charter; it was a desperate race against the encroaching blizzard, a lifeline stretched thin across a landscape indifferent to human struggle.  The cargo wasn't gold or jewels, but something far more precious: a desperately ill child needing urgent medical attention in Anchorage, hundreds of miles away.
