The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a perpetually leaking pipe overhead.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grime-coated window high in the north wall, danced in the shafts of pale winter light.  This was the sanctuary of Elias Thorne, a man whose hands, calloused and scarred like ancient parchment, were as familiar with the feel of chisel and mallet as a lover’s with the curve of a beloved’s spine.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet stone and woodsmoke, a fragrance both pungent and comforting, a smell Elias Thorne had inhaled since he was a boy, learning the trade at his father’s knee in this very workshop, nestled amongst the crags and slopes of the forbidding Pennine Hills.
