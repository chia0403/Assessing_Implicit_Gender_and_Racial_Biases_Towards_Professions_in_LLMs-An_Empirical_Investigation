The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co." Nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague’s Old Town, the shop was a charming anachronism, a splash of vibrant colour amidst the grey stone buildings.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and illuminating the meticulously organized maps pinned to the walls – a patchwork of the world, charting Mia’s own wanderlust and the destinations she so expertly curated for her clients.  Outside, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingled with the cheerful chatter of tourists, a constant soundtrack to the quiet hum of activity within.  Today, however, the usual gentle bustle was absent, replaced by an unnerving silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner. Mia, perched behind her antique desk, felt a prickle of unease.  It wasn’t the quiet itself that bothered her, but the *kind* of quiet – the heavy, expectant silence that precedes a storm.
