The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song around Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's rig, a symphony of ice scraping against steel and the groan of stressed metal protesting the sub-zero temperatures.  He sat hunched in the worn leather seat of his eighteen-wheeler, a 1998 Kenworth W900 affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," the steam from his breath clouding the already frosted windows.  Outside, the vast expanse of the High Plains stretched under a sky the color of bruised plums, the snow swirling into phantom shapes against the fading light.  The only visible landmarks were the skeletal silhouettes of distant buttes, stark against the bleak horizon, and the flickering neon sign of the deserted truck stop, "The Last Chance Oasis," miles behind him, a forgotten promise of warmth and respite.  Zeke, his face etched with the map of a thousand sunrises and sunsets, felt a familiar pang of loneliness tug at him, a feeling as constant a companion as the rumble of Betsy's engine.
