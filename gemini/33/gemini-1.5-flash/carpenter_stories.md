The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn oak plank onto the small, pitching deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered timbers of the fishing boat.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and sawdust, vibrated with the rhythmic clang of Elias's hammer against the nail, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of gulls overhead.

Elias, his calloused hands rough as bark itself, paused, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm.  This wasn't the quiet carpentry he was used to; this was a fight against the elements, a battle to keep the *Sea Serpent* afloat, one nail at a time.
