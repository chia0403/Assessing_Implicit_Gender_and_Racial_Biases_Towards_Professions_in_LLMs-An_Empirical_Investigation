The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda – a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia like a second skin after seven years behind this register. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering smear.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *beep* *beep* *beep* of the scanner, the only other sound besides the low murmur of Amelia’s own weary thoughts.  Tonight, however, the usual humdrum of the night shift felt different; heavier, charged with an unspoken tension that prickled at the edges of her awareness.
