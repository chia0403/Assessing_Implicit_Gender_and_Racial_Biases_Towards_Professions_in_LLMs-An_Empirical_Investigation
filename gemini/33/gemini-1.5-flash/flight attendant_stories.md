The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  Amelia, or Amy as most passengers – and some of the more lenient pilots – called her, adjusted the tiny, almost invisible microphone clipped to her crisp, navy blue uniform.  The cabin lights of Flight 743, a Boeing 777 bound for Hong Kong, were dimmed to a dusky amber, the pre-landing hush settling over the passengers like a weighted blanket.  Outside, the inky blackness of the Pacific Ocean stretched endlessly, punctuated only by the occasional, fleeting flash of lightning illuminating the roiling clouds below.  The rhythmic drone of the engines, a constant companion for the last thirteen hours, was slowly fading, replaced by the subtle hum of the plane’s descent and the nervous energy that always preceded landing.  Amy ran a hand through her perfectly styled auburn bun, feeling the familiar knot of responsibility tightening in her stomach.  This was her last flight of the month, a final leg before a desperately needed two weeks off, and tonight, something felt… different.
