The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias Thorne's pencils on the mylar. Elias, a man whose life seemed to be measured in the precise angles and meticulous lines he drew, sat hunched over a sprawling blueprint of the proposed Zephyr Tower – a gleaming, glass-and-steel behemoth destined to pierce the perpetually overcast sky of Seattle.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, a relentless, grey curtain obscuring the city's usual vibrant chaos.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, chemical tang of drafting ink, a familiar aroma that Elias, after twenty years at Peterson & Sons Architects, could practically taste.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort was tinged with a growing unease.  Something felt…off. Not in the drawing, which was perfectly to spec, but in the very fabric of the night itself.
