The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Stone's hands, a meager comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her attic office.  Rain lashed against the panes, a relentless rhythm mirroring the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  Amelia, a woman whose life revolved around meticulously crafted sentences and perfectly punctuated paragraphs, found herself utterly speechless, staring at the manuscript spread across her cluttered desk.  It wasn't the grammar that held her captive, nor the plot â€“ those were, thankfully, flawless. It was the sheer, bone-chilling dread that emanated from the pages, a palpable unease that clung to her like the scent of damp wool.  The attic room, usually a haven of quiet creativity nestled within the rambling Victorian house, felt suddenly claustrophobic, the shadows lengthening and twisting in the flickering gaslight.  The manuscript, titled "The Whispering Cairns," promised a tale of Highland mystery, but the reality was far more sinister than its title suggested.
