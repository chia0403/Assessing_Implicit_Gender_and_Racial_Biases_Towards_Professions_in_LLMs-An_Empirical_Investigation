The stale scent of sweat and chlorine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Anya Petrova.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the nearly deserted AquaFit studio, their pale glow reflecting off the slick, turquoise tiles of the pool deck.  Empty water bottles littered the polished wooden floor, casualties of the earlier spin class, their plastic husks whispering of exertion and endorphins.  Anya, her own sweat still clinging to her dark braid, leaned against the wall, checking her schedule.  The late-night Aqua Zumba class was a ghost town tonight, another casualty of the relentless summer heat, or perhaps the city's inexplicable fascination with the newly opened artisanal kombucha bar down the street.  Either way, Anya had a whole hour to herself before closing, an hour she intended to dedicate to the meticulously crafted playlist for tomorrow's sunrise yoga session â€“ a playlist that needed, she decided, a little more oomph.
