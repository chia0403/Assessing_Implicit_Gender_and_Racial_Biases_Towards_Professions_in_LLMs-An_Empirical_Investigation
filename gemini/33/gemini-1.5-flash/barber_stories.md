The scent of Bay Rum and Old Spice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the worn velvet of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barber chair like a second skin.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy window of Butterfield's Barbershop.  The shop itself was a time capsule â€“ a relic of a bygone era nestled incongruously amidst the gleaming chrome and glass of modern-day Oakhaven, its walls adorned with faded photographs of mustachioed men and vintage shaving mugs, their once vibrant colours now dulled by time and neglect.  Barty, a man whose own silver hair mirrored the shop's age, hummed a mournful blues tune as he meticulously sharpened his straight razor, the rhythmic scrape a counterpoint to the city's distant rumble.
