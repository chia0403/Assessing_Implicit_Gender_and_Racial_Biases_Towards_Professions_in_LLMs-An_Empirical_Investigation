The biting Montana wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate plains, whipping snow into frenzied dervishes that stung Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's cheeks.  Her breath plumed white against the pre-dawn gloom, a stark contrast to the roaring rumble that emanated from the behemoth she commanded â€“ a Caterpillar D11T, its massive treads churning through the frozen earth like a lumbering, steel dinosaur.  Amy, bundled in layers of fleece and oilskin, gripped the joystick with gloved hands, her knuckles white against the worn metal.  The air inside the cab, despite the heater's valiant efforts, remained frigid, mirroring the icy grip of the contract looming over her and her small, family-run earthmoving business, Blackwood Excavation.  This land, a sprawling expanse of frozen prairie slated for a new wind farm, was their last, best hope.
