The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas tarp off her weathered Jeep.  The wind, a relentless Pacific gale, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek, carrying the scent of brine and something else, something faintly acrid, that prickled at the back of her throat.  She was perched precariously on the edge of the craggy coastline of Mendocino, California, the churning grey ocean a dramatic backdrop to her makeshift clinic: a repurposed shipping container painted a cheerful, albeit slightly faded, sunflower yellow.  Inside, the air smelled less of the sea and more of arnica and essential oils, a stark contrast to the raw, untamed beauty that surrounded it.  Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the wind's roar, and pulled a battered toolbox from the Jeep’s bed.  Another day, another patient – or perhaps, another rescue.  This remote coastal town demanded more than just spinal adjustments; it often required a hefty dose of grit and a willingness to tackle the unexpected.
