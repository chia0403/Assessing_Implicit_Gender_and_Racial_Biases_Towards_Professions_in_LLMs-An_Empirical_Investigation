The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy easel onto the precarious cliff edge.  Below, the churning grey Atlantic gnawed at the jagged teeth of the Cornish coastline, sending spray hissing against the wind-battered rocks.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and dying seaweed, was a stark contrast to the vibrant hues exploding on her palette – a riot of cerulean, cadmium yellow, and vermillion that seemed to mock the monochrome landscape before her. Amelia, her breath misting in the cold air, adjusted her oilskin and braced herself against the gale.  This was it – the perfect spot, the perfect light, for the painting that would, she hoped, finally capture the untamed soul of the Cornish coast.
