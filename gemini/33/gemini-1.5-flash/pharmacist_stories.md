The bell above the door of "Apothecary & More" jingled a discordant C-sharp, a sound Elias Thorne, RPh, had grown accustomed to associating with the onset of headaches.  It was a humid Tuesday in the sleepy coastal town of Seabrook, Maine, the kind of day where the salt air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like a damp shroud.  The scent of brine and seaweed battled with the more refined aromas emanating from Elias’s meticulously organized shelves – lavender, chamomile, and the faintly bitter tang of wormwood.  Rain threatened, the sky a bruised purple mirroring the anxiety that had begun to bloom in his chest.  He’d been expecting a call all day, a call that could irrevocably alter the quiet rhythm of his life in Seabrook.  The jingling bell was momentarily forgotten as a low thrum of unease vibrated through him, a prelude to the storm brewing both outside and within.
