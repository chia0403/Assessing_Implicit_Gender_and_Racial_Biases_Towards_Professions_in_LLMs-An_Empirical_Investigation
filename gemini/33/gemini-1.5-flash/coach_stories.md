Westview’s football team, once a powerhouse, now clung to a dismal 3-6 record, their playoff hopes hanging by a thread thinner than the shoelaces of their star running back, currently nursing a bruised knee on the sidelines.  Tonight's practice, Elias knew, would determine not just the fate of the game against their arch-rivals next week, but the very spirit of this team.
