The relentless Florida sun beat down on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's sensible beige sedan, baking the vinyl interior to a temperature that could curdle milk.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, reflecting the blinding glare off the cracked asphalt of Coconut Grove’s Ocean Drive.  Barty, a man whose life was as meticulously organized as his meticulously organized Rolodex, felt a tremor of unease unlike anything he'd experienced in his twenty years selling insurance for Sunshine State Assurance.  He adjusted his crisp, white linen shirt – a stark contrast to the wilting hibiscus bushes lining the street – and wrestled the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the leather.  The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and something else… something acrid, metallic, and distinctly unsettling.  This wasn't just another sweltering Tuesday in paradise; something was rotten in the heart of Coconut Grove, and Barty Butterfield, insurance agent extraordinaire, was about to find out just how rotten.
