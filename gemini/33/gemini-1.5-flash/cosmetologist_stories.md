The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a fragrant battleground fought between the simmering sugar wax and the freshly brewed chamomile tea cooling on Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s cluttered desk.  Izzy, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a laugh as warm as the midday sun, surveyed her domain:  "Izzy's Glamour Grotto," a tiny, vibrant salon nestled in the heart of a bustling, sun-drenched Miami neighborhood, Little Havana.  The walls, painted a cheerful coral, were adorned with framed family photos, vibrant posters of classic Hollywood glamour, and an overflowing shelf of brightly colored hair dyes. Salsa music pulsed softly from a hidden speaker, a comforting rhythm against the backdrop of the city’s midday hum. Today, however, the usual cheerful chaos was punctuated by an unnerving silence.  Izzy’s usually full appointment book lay open, starkly empty, except for one solitary appointment – and it was scheduled for three hours from now.  A nervous flutter stirred in her stomach. This quiet was unsettling, far more so than any busy day.
