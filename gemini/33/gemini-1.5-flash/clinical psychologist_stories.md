The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room felt like a metaphor.  Flaking cerulean, once vibrant, now hinted at the faded optimism of a bygone era, much like the hopes of some of her patients.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her Victorian practice, located on a secluded lane tucked between the bustling commercial district of Ashwood and the sprawling, whispering cemetery that gave the street its unnerving name: Cypress Grove.  The air inside, despite the storm’s fury, hung thick with the scent of old paper and something else, something faintly floral yet undeniably melancholic – a scent Eleanor couldn’t quite place, but that always seemed to precede a particularly challenging session.  Tonight, the floral undertone was pronounced, almost cloying.  She glanced at the clock; 7:53 PM.  Mr. Silas Blackwood was late.  Again.
