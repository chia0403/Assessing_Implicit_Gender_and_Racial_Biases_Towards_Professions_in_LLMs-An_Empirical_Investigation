The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, steady erosion of Eleanor Vance's patience.  It was the last day before summer break, a day traditionally synonymous with the untamed chaos of a zoo escaped its cage, only instead of lions and tigers, it was twenty-eight eight-year-olds brimming with pent-up energy and the sugar rush of a thousand juice boxes.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of fruit punch, the scent of impending anarchy, and the faint, lingering aroma of Elmer's glue â€“ a potent cocktail unique to the final days of the school year.  Sunlight, slanted low through the dusty classroom windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the restless air, each particle a tiny, glittering testament to the year's accumulated mess.
