The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Katherine Hayes's sensible black pumps as she leaned precariously over the railing.  Below, the grimy alley of Bleecker Street teemed with the nocturnal life of Greenwich Village â€“ a symphony of overflowing trash cans, the hiss of escaping steam, and the muffled shouts of a late-night argument in fractured Spanish.  The air hung thick with the smell of roasting chestnuts and something vaguely unpleasant that Amelia suspected was a mixture of exhaust fumes and desperation.  She wasn't sure which was more potent.  The flickering neon sign of "Luigi's Pizza & More" cast a lurid glow on the overflowing dumpster, illuminating the crumpled flyer advertising a "Psychic Readings - $20" that seemed strangely appropriate given the case she was currently wrestling with.  This wasn't just another late-night review of a contract; this was a legal labyrinth that threatened to swallow her whole.
