The salon, nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic quarter of Prague, was a charming chaos of antique mirrors, mismatched armchairs upholstered in velvet the colour of spilled wine, and the constant hum of a vintage hairdryer. Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the street outside, creating an intimate, almost conspiratorial atmosphere within.
