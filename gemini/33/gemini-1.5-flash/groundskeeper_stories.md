The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a recalcitrant oak branch, its leaves clinging stubbornly to their brittle stems.  Elias, groundskeeper for the sprawling, gothic Blackwood Manor, wasn't known for his patience, but even his usual stoicism was wearing thin under the relentless assault of the elements.  Blackwood Manor itself hunkered low against the horizon, a brooding silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Its stone walls, stained the colour of dried blood by centuries of rain and wind, seemed to breathe a chill into the very air.  The manicured lawns, usually a source of pride for Elias, were now a sodden, wind-battered mess, littered with fallen leaves that crunched like broken bones beneath his heavy boots.  He could practically taste the damp earth and decaying vegetation on the wind.  This wasn't just a job; it was a battle against the encroaching winter, and Elias Thorne, with his calloused hands and weary heart, was on the front lines.
