The November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Jean Holloway’s beat-up Ford Focus, a relentless percussion accompanying the even more relentless drumming in her head.  The wipers fought a losing battle against the deluge, smearing the already limited visibility into an impressionistic blur of grey and black.  Amelia, a probation officer with the City of Oakhaven’s perpetually underfunded Department of Corrections, sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm.  Her battered briefcase, overflowing with case files thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, lay forgotten on the passenger seat.  She was parked, illegally, across the street from a crumbling Victorian mansion that had seen better centuries – much better centuries –  its once proud gables now shrouded in ivy, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the tempest. This was the home of her latest client, Silas Blackwood, a man whose charm was as potent as the poison he’d nearly used to end his wife’s life.  And Amelia had a sinking feeling this visit wouldn't be pleasant.
