The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate of the wolf enclosure shut.  Snow, thick and relentless, clung to her worn parka, already weighted down by the bucket of raw meat she’d just delivered.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine, damp earth, and something wilder, something primal – the unmistakable musk of the grey wolves who regarded her with amber eyes from the shadowy depths of their winter habitat.  This wasn't your typical petting zoo; the Northwood Sanctuary, nestled deep within the frosted embrace of the Cascade Mountains, housed creatures far removed from the comforting familiarity of a domestic cat or dog.  Here, Amelia tended to the forgotten, the injured, the majestic beasts rescued from poachers, neglect, or the harsh realities of a changing world.  The sanctuary, a sprawling complex of interconnected enclosures and weathered wooden buildings, was her kingdom, a testament to her quiet dedication and unwavering love for the animals in her care. Tonight, however, even Amelia felt the weight of the impending blizzard pressing down, a premonition of the challenges that lay ahead.
