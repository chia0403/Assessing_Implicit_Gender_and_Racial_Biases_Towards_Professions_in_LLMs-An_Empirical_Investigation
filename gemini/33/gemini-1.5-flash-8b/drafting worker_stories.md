The fluorescent hum of the drafting room, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound that rivaled the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Blackwood's mechanical pencil against the tracing paper.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead lights, danced in the air, swirling around the meticulously rendered blueprints spread across her drafting table.  Amelia, a drafting worker for the burgeoning construction firm, "Apex Builders," was immersed in her task, her brow furrowed in concentration. The air, thick with the smell of graphite and stale coffee, clung to the room like a second skin.  A long row of similar drafting tables stretched before her, each one a miniature universe of lines and angles, each a tiny piece of a vast, future cityscape.  Sunlight, weak and pale, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting long, distorted shadows that mirrored the complex curves of the blueprints.

Outside, the city of Zenith, a sprawling metropolis built upon the bones of the old world, was already awakening.  A symphony of sirens, horns, and distant construction machinery formed a constant backdrop to the otherwise contained world of the drafting room.  Amelia, focused on her work, was oblivious to the cacophony of the outside world.  The city's pulse beat in the very air she breathed, its energy transferred into the lines she was drawing.
