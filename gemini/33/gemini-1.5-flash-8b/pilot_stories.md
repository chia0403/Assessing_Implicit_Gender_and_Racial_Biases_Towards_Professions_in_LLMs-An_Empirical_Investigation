The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's flight suit.  The cockpit of the "Stardust," a single-engine biplane painstakingly restored from a forgotten era, trembled beneath her.  Above, the Alaskan sky, a canvas of bruised purple and bruised grey, threatened to swallow the plane whole.  Amy, her knuckles white around the control stick, wrestled with the unruly currents of the Aleutian jet stream.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Shishaldin volcano, shrouded in a perpetual mist, loomed like ancient, slumbering giants.  This was no ordinary flight; it was a mission of desperation, a gamble against time and the unforgiving wilderness.  The radio crackled with static, a ghostly echo of her growing unease. Amy pressed her lips together, her focus unwavering as the plane shuddered, buffeted by wind gusts that tested the very limits of her skill and resolve.  10,000 feet.  Approaching the designated coordinates: the remote, windswept island of Kiska.
