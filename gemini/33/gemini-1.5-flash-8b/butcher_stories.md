The chill of the November air, sharp and biting, snaked through the gaps in the clapboard walls of the butcher shop, "The Cleaver's Cut."  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty"  Finkle, a man whose weathered hands spoke volumes of years spent wielding cleavers and carving hams, meticulously shaped a leg of lamb.  Sweat beaded on his brow, not from exertion alone, but from the lingering, almost tangible aroma of rosemary and garlic that hung heavy in the air.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-streaked windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished butcher block, highlighting the glistening crimson juice that clung to the knife.  The shop itself was a testament to the passage of time.  Grease-stained floors, gleaming copper pots, and sawdust-coated shelves spoke of countless hours spent tending to the needs of the town's hungry mouths.  A gentle, rhythmic clinking of metal against bone accompanied the faint rasp of Barty's breath as he worked.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that stood guard over the little village of Oakhaven creaked in the wind, echoing the quiet solitude that had settled over the shop.
