The biting London wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the cobbled alley.  Gaslight flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows that mirrored the turmoil in her stomach.  It was nearly midnight, and the air, already thick with the scent of coal smoke and brewing desperation, was punctuated by the rhythmic thump-thump of a nearby heart – a heart, she knew, pounding with the same frantic rhythm in her own chest.

The setting was the heart of Victorian London, a city choking on its own industrial might.  Dust motes danced in the feeble glow of gaslight illuminating the narrow alleyways that snaked between the towering warehouses and grand houses of the West End.  The air vibrated with the sounds of the city: the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the distant wail of a street urchin, and the occasional drunken roar from a nearby pub.  Amelia, a theatrical director with a reputation for pushing the boundaries of dramatic expression, had been working on her latest production, a darkly poetic tragedy entitled "The Shadow of the Loom," – a piece that had captured the city's anxieties and aspirations.  She had fallen hopelessly, and tragically, in love with the leading actor, a man she knew she might never have. Tonight, though, felt different. Tonight, everything felt dangerously on the brink.
