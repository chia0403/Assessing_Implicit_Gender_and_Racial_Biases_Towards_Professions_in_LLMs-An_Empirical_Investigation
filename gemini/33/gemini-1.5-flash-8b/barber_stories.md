The scent of freshly-cut hair, mingled with the faint aroma of sandalwood incense and the slightly acrid tang of sweat, hung heavy in the air of "The Clipper's Cut," a small barbershop tucked away on a cobbled side street of Old Port, Alexandria.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating a faded poster advertising the annual Seafarers' Ball.  Elias Thorne, a barber with hands as steady as the tide and eyes that held the wisdom of countless whispered stories, meticulously trimmed the unruly beard of a weathered mariner, his breath puffing white clouds in the close space.  The clang of a ship's bell from the harbor echoed in the tiny shop, a constant, rhythmic pulse against the hum of conversation. Elias, despite the rhythmic snip-snip of his clippers, found his mind elsewhere, lost in the hazy memories of a summer voyage he'd taken years ago.
