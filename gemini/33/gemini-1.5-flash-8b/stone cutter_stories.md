The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Cinder Mountains, clawing at Elias Thorne's roughspun tunic.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around his boots, clinging to the worn leather as if trying to smother the fragile embers of the day.  The air, thin and acrid with the smell of volcanic ash, tasted like burnt toast and forgotten dreams.  High above, the jagged peaks of the mountain range pierced the bruised sky, a skeletal hand reaching for a dawn that never quite arrived.  Elias, a stone cutter renowned for his precise, almost poetic, work, stood at the precipice of the mountain overlooking a vast, desolate valley, the land scarred and etched by time and fire.  His weathered hands, calloused and cracked from years of wielding the chisel, clutched the rough-hewn handle of his hammer.  The valley stretched below, a sea of grey and brown, punctuated only by the occasional, stunted pine, their needles like brittle, frozen tears. His workshop, a small, cavernous space carved from the mountainside, housed nothing but the raw material of his craft: grey granite, scarred and whispering tales of epochs past. Elias knew his calling: to coax beauty from the earth, to bring order from chaos.  But today, a different kind of chaos threatened to engulf him.
