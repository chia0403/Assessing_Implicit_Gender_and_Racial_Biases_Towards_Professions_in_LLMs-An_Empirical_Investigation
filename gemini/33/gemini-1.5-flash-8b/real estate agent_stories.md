The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Grey clouds, the color of bruised plums, hung low over the sprawling, yet oddly desolate, hills of Oakhaven.  The historic Victorian homes, once boasting a proud façade of weathered clapboard and meticulously manicured gardens, now looked as if they were holding their breath, awaiting a spring thaw that might never come.  Amy, a real estate agent with a relentless optimism that often bordered on delusion, shivered but kept a practiced smile plastered on her face.  This wasn't the ideal autumnal setting for a potential buyer's tour, but then again, nothing ever was in Oakhaven.  Her worn leather boots crunched on the gravel path leading to the towering, skeletal frame of "Whisperwind Manor," a sprawling gothic monstrosity that had been on the market for three years, a testament to the peculiar tastes (and perhaps the failing fortunes) of its previous owners.  Amy had been assigned the property as her new flagship listing, an almost impossible sell that held the key to her success, or failure, depending on how it played out.  The silence of the windswept valley amplified the unspoken questions hanging in the air – could she finally find a buyer for Whisperwind Manor, or would it forever remain a whisper in the annals of Oakhaven's real estate woes?
