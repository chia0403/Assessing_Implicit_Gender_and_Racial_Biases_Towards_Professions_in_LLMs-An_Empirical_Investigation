Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi, a forensic psychologist with sharp eyes and a voice like polished steel.  The sterile, fluorescent lights of the precinct buzzed, their harsh glare highlighting the sweat beading on the suspect's forehead.  He was a young man, barely twenty, his eyes haunted by a fear that seemed to absorb the meager light around him.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air, a heavy blanket suffocating the room.  

Izzy, hunched over her notepad, traced the faint lines of a fractured timeline.  The case, officially dubbed "The Nightingale Incident," was a macabre dance of a disturbed mind, a cruel imitation of a childhood trauma, and a carefully crafted façade.  She'd been called in to assess the suspect, a young architect named Ethan Blackwood, not for murder, but for a series of disturbing acts, culminating in the deliberate mutilation of the model town he was commissioned to build. Each meticulously carved and miniature detail – a house, a park, even a small, perfectly formed fountain – bore the horrifying evidence of a twisted, escalating anger.

The setting:  The gritty, rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven, a sprawling suburb just outside the urban sprawl.  High-rise apartment buildings, their balconies choked with weeds, peered down on crumbling Victorian houses, each with their secrets and shadowed histories.  A tangible sense of unease hung over the place, a constant hum beneath the relentless city noise, particularly palpable along the desolate stretch of Elmwood Avenue where the incident occurred.  The Blackwood family's estate, a grand, imposing house with a dark, impenetrable facade, stood sentinel at the end of the street, like a silent observer of the city's simmering anxieties.
