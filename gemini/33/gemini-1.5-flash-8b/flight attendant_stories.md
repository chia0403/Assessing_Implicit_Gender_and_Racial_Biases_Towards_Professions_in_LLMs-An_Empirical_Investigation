Not the stomach-dropping terror of a turbulent flight, but the prickly anxiety that came with a new route, a new destination, a new set of faces.  The boarding call was a distant murmur now, swallowed by the cavernous interior of the Airbus A380, a cathedral of polished aluminum and gleaming chrome.  She traced a fingertip along the cool surface of the overhead compartment, her breath fogging the window.

Outside, the sprawling metropolis of  New Alexandria shimmered beneath a bruised purple sky.  The sprawling concrete jungle, a masterpiece of architectural grandeur, was outlined in a haze of smog, almost choking the magnificent city lights.  Tonight, the A380 was carrying more than just passengers across the starlit gulf â€“ it carried Amy's unspoken anxieties, her quiet hopes, and her quiet determination to overcome the whispers of doubt that clung to her like the perfume of exotic flowers.  She was on the inaugural flight to a new, uncharted territory in the world, and her fingers, tracing the smooth metal, felt the weight of expectation as much as the weight of the plane.
