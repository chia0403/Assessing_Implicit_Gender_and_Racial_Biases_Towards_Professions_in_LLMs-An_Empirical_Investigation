The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Spoon" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the dark circles beneath her eyes.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm pounding in her chest.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia, a singer with a voice as clear and powerful as a mountain spring, hunched against the chipped Formica counter, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee.  The bar, a forgotten relic of a bygone era, was almost empty, save for a lone figure hunched over a bottle of something brown in the far corner.  The faint melody of a bluesy saxophone drifted from a nearby juke joint, a mournful counterpoint to the relentless downpour outside.  This was the heart of Havenwood, a town clinging to the tattered remnants of its former glory, a town where dreams, like the rain-slicked streets, were often washed away.
