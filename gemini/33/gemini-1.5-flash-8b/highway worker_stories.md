The cracked pavement and faded paint stretched into the horizon, a testament to the vastness of the desert and the relentless passage of time.  The air itself felt thin and dry, a mirror image of the emptiness she sometimes felt inside. Her name, though a simple one, held a weight, a history etched into the cracks of the highway itself.
