The antiseptic tang of chlorhexidine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Grace Blackwood, but today, it seemed to cling with an unwelcome intensity.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the frosted glass of the examination room, painted dancing shadows on the polished stainless steel surfaces.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with eyes the colour of warm honey and hands surprisingly gentle despite their meticulous dexterity, felt a prickle of unease.  The patient, a quiet woman named Mrs. Eleanor Vance, sat stiffly in the chair, her gaze fixed on a chipped teacup resting on the tray table.  Amelia had noticed the chipped teacup before; a small detail, easily overlooked, but somehow it seemed to weigh down the room.

The setting was Dr. Alistair Finch's dental practice, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Oakhaven, a town steeped in the quiet melancholy of a bygone era.  Victorian-era architecture, softened with time and ivy, surrounded the building, hinting at stories whispered in the shadows of the towering trees. Oakhaven was known for its quaint shops and cobbled lanes, but it also held a secret history, a past that clung to its residents like the lingering aroma of old books.
