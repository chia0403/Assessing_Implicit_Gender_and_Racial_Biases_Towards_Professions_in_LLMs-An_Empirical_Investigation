Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the community centre, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Blackwood's head.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely floral, hung heavy in the small, sun-dappled room.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows.  This wasn't the pristine, brightly lit therapy room she was accustomed to. This was the 'Hopeful Hands' community centre, a collection of repurposed classrooms and workshops on the outskirts of the sprawling, poverty-stricken city of Veridian.  Amelia, an occupational therapist with a meticulous approach to rehabilitation, found herself wrestling with a knot of frustration and a growing sense of unease. The rhythmic, persistent pounding of the rain was a soundtrack to her increasingly complicated case.  It was a case that stretched beyond the physical limitations, a tale of broken dreams and persistent hopelessness, and she was suddenly not so certain she possessed the tools to mend it.
