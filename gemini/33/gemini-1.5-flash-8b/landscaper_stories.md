The biting wind whipped Amelia “Em”  Evergreen’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Grey clouds, bruised and threatening, hung low over the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor, obscuring the already dim light.  Autumn leaves, once vibrant hues of crimson and gold, were now a soggy, muted brown, scattered across the overgrown lawn like confetti after a damp celebration. Em, a landscaper with hands weathered and strong, knelt amidst the debris, tracing the outline of a decaying rose bush with a calloused finger.  Blackwood Manor.  A name whispered with a mixture of dread and intrigue in the sleepy village of Ashwood.  For Em, it was more than just a job. It was a puzzle, a twisted tapestry of neglected beauty and looming secrets.

The setting: Ashwood, a picturesque English village nestled in the shadow of the rolling hills.  Autumn had painted the landscape in a somber palette of muted browns and greys, a stark contrast to the vibrant colors of the summer that had preceded it.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, clung to everything.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic-style mansion draped in shadows, dominated the horizon, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the surrounding gloom. The grounds, once a testament to meticulous upkeep, were now a testament to neglect, choked with overgrown shrubs and tangled vines.  A palpable sense of melancholy hung heavy in the air, a silent omen of the mysteries hidden within its walls.
