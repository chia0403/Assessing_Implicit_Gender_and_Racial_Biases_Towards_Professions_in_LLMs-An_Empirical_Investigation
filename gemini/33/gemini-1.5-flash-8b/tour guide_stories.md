The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Yorkshire Moors.  Below, the village of Grimstone huddled like a forgotten shawl against the relentless onslaught of the November storm.  Rain, thick and cold, plastered the cobblestones of the narrow, winding lane leading to the ancient, ivy-clad manor house, the very heart of the tour she was leading.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for history that bordered on obsession, adjusted her oversized wool scarf, tucking it further up her neck.  Today, she was tasked with navigating a group of tourists – a rather boisterous bunch of American retirees – through the haunted, whispering halls of Oakhaven Manor.  Their itinerary included the notorious 'Whispering Gallery,'  rumored to hold the echoes of forgotten tragedies, and the 'Sunken Room,' where a long-ago mistress had reportedly met an untimely end.  Amelia knew her challenge wasn't just in presenting the facts, but in keeping her charges from straying too far down the path of their own, wildly imagined, versions of Grimstone’s grim history.
