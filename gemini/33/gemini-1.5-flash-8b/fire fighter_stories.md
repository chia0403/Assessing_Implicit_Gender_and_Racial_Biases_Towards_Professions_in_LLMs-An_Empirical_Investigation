The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the fire station.  Snow, thick and relentless, coated everything in a layer of pristine white, obscuring the already muted industrial landscape of the forgotten town of Ashwood.  Inside, the flickering fluorescent lights of the station cast long, dancing shadows on the worn Formica tables.  Amelia "Em"  Harding, a seasoned firefighter with a scar that snaked across her left eyebrow like a forgotten lightning bolt, stirred a mug of lukewarm coffee, the steam barely visible in the frigid air.  The rhythmic clang of the station's alarm system, usually a comforting, predictable drumbeat, now sounded more like a frantic, desperate tattoo against the backdrop of the blizzard.  The town was nestled in a valley, the jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains shrouded in a blanket of white, making the storm seem all the more intense, all the more isolating.  This wasn't just a typical winter storm; the wind carried a peculiar, almost metallic tang, a smell that prickled the back of Em's neck and sent a shiver of unease down her spine.
