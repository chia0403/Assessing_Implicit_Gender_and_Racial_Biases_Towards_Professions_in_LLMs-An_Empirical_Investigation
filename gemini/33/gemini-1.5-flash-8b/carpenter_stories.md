The small, ramshackle town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills, clung to the valley floor like a stubborn vine, its houses huddled together for warmth against the encroaching winter.  Silas, his face etched with the lines of a life lived in the raw beauty and brutal honesty of the mountains, wrestled with a particularly stubborn knot in the wood.
