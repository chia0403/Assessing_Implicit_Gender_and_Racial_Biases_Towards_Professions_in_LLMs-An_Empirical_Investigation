The fluorescent lights of "Hairitage," buzzing with the low hum of conditioning machines and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears, illuminated Amelia Nightingale's meticulous hands.  She was a cosmetologist, not just a stylist, a sculptor of sculpted hair, a painter of vibrant hues.  Each strand, each curl, each hidden follicle, was a canvas, and Amelia, with her years of practice and fervent dedication, was the artist.  This Wednesday afternoon, however, the usual symphony of salon chatter was drowned out by a low, persistent thrumming, an almost imperceptible vibration that seemed to emanate from deep within the walls of the historic building that housed Hairitage.  

Amelia, perched on a stool in the back section of the salon, meticulously painted the ends of a client's hair with a rich, burgundy shade. The scent of lavender and rosemary, a familiar balm to her, hung heavy in the air, battling with the subtle, metallic undertone that had begun to permeate the otherwise comforting salon atmosphere.  This wasn't just an ordinary salon; it was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the heart of the old city, just below the towering gothic spires of St. Jude's Cathedral.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the ancient stained-glass windows above, cast a kaleidoscope of color on the dusty floorboards, illuminating the meticulously organized shelves laden with hair products and the faded floral wallpaper that seemed to sigh with the weight of decades.  Amelia, her name a whispered tribute to the elegant past of the salon, felt the vibration grow stronger, a rhythmic pulse that echoed in the hollow spaces of the building, and a cold dread began to set in.
