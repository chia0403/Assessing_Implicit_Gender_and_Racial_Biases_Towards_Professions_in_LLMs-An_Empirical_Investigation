The chipped paint on the walls of Miss Eleanor Vance's second-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary hummed with a low, persistent energy, a constant thrumming beneath the cheerful chaos.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, cast long, dancing shadows across rows of meticulously organized desks, each one a miniature fortress of colorful drawings, half-finished projects, and the ubiquitous remnants of sticky notes.  Today, however, the air felt thicker, charged with an almost tangible anticipation.  A new student, a quiet girl with eyes the color of stormy seas, sat perched on the edge of her assigned seat, clutching a worn teddy bear.  Her name was Elara Blackwood, and Miss Vance, with her spectacles perched precariously on her nose and a faint tremor in her usually steady hand, knew this day would be different.
