The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Market Square.  The air, thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp earth, hung heavy.  Barnaby "Barbs" Butterfield, a wiry plumber with grease smudged across his cheeks and a perpetually worried furrow in his brow, shivered despite the humid night.  His worn leather apron, a testament to countless leaky pipes and stubborn clogs, was plastered to his back.  He checked his watch, the cheap plastic thing feeling strangely heavy in his clammy hand.  Eight o'clock.  The clock tower's chime echoed across the square, a mournful reminder of the time slipping away.  Tonight was a critical appointment.  He was tasked with fixing the plumbing at the esteemed Grand Duchess's opulent townhouse, a job that, if botched, could very well ruin his fledgling reputation and leave him scrambling for the scraps of work that even a struggling plumbing business like his could muster.
