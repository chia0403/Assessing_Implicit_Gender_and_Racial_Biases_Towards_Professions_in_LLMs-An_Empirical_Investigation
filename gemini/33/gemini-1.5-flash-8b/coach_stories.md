The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the frozen expanse of the hockey rink.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending frost, hung heavy over the small town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains.  Snow, a pristine, almost ethereal white, blanketed the surrounding peaks, mirroring the stillness that settled over the Havenwood High hockey team.  Today was their final practice before the championship game, a game that felt more like a looming mountain, both daunting and exhilarating.  Amelia, Havenwood High's head coach for the past five seasons, knew the pressure was immense.  Not just for her players, but for the entire town.  Their championship run was the talk of the region; whispered in taverns and debated in coffee shops, a symbol of Havenwood's improbable resurgence.  And yet, Amelia felt a profound sense of calm amidst the storm brewing in the frigid air.  She adjusted her worn hockey coach's jacket, its faded red a testament to countless practices and games, and walked towards the bench, a determined glint in her eyes.
