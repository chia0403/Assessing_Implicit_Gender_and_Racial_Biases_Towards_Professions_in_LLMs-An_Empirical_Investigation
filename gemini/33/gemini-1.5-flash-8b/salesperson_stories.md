The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bin Bonanza," a sprawling warehouse crammed with the detritus of a thousand broken dreams.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the rhythmic hum of the refrigerator units lining one wall, their contents – mostly expired yogurt and questionable-looking deli meat – a silent testament to the store's... unique inventory.  This was the domain of  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a salesperson with a penchant for the improbable and a surprisingly effective knack for turning lemons into lemonade, or, in this case, fluorescent-lit, slightly-stale yogurt into a profitable venture.  Barty, with his perpetually rumpled linen suit and a smile that never quite reached his eyes, stood before a display of dusty, cracked porcelain figurines.  Each one depicted a different, slightly grotesque, scene of domestic bliss – a family arguing over a bowl of mashed potatoes, a cat wearing a tiny top hat, a miniature orchestra playing a discordant tune. He knew, with the certainty of a seasoned gambler, that these were waiting to be unearthed from the bargain bin purgatory and resold to someone, somewhere, who would find them... perfect.
