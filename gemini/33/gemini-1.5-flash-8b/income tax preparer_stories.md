The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Time Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic typing and rustling papers that filled the small, cluttered office.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless barrage of paperwork on Amelia "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's desk.

Her small office, barely large enough for a single desk and a cramped filing cabinet, felt like a pressure cooker.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  A single potted fern, struggling to survive in the corner, seemed the only living thing in the entire space.  This was her life, this fluorescent-lit purgatory of numbers and deductions, and, as the deadline loomed, Amy knew it was only going to get worse.
