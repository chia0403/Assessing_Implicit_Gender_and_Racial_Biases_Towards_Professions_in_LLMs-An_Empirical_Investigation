The chipped paint of the "Little Explorers" daycare centre peeled like sunburnt skin in the harsh Queensland sun.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon light filtering through the stained-glass windows depicting whimsical forest creatures.  A faint, sickly-sweet scent of playdough and old coffee lingered in the air, a familiar aroma to 10-year-old  Amelia "Milly"  Everett, a child care worker at the heart of the chaos.  Milly, her denim overalls stained with crayon and a half-eaten sandwich wedged between her teeth,  surveyed the scene.  Three-year-olds shrieked with laughter as they wrestled over a discarded teddy bear, a toddler clung to her leg sobbing quietly, and a pair of pre-schoolers meticulously sculpted a miniature mountain range from play sand.  It was, as always, a symphony of noise and activity, a symphony she had learned to both love and dread.
