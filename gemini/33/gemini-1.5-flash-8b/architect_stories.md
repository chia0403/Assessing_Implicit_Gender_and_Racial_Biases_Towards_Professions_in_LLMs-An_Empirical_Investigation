The biting wind whipped Amelia Cavendish’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the old mill.  Dust motes danced in the pale, winter sun, illuminating shards of broken glass and rusted metal scattered across the cobblestones.  Amelia, Architect Amelia Cavendish, felt a familiar prickle of inspiration – a sharp, almost painful awareness of potential, buried beneath the rubble of the past.  This forgotten corner of the Weeping Glade, a village steeped in the whispering gloom of the ancient Blackwood Forest, held a secret, she knew it.  A secret whispered not only on the wind, but resonated deep within the very earth itself.  It was a secret she, and only she, was destined to uncover.

The setting is a bleak, windswept corner of the Weeping Glade, a village nestled at the edge of the Blackwood Forest in the foothills of the Cinder Peaks. The old mill, once a vibrant symbol of industry, now stands as a skeletal ruin, its stone walls scarred by time and weather.  Cobblestone paths lead through the sparse, frost-covered vegetation, and a persistent, icy wind whips through the skeletal branches of the surrounding trees, carrying whispers of long-forgotten tales. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, a smell that both invigorates and chills the soul.  Shadows stretch long and menacing in the late afternoon sun, accentuating the melancholic atmosphere of the place.
