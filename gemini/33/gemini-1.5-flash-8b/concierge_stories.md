The rain hammered against the slate roof of the Grand Cavendish Hotel, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic flutter in Amelia Nightingale's chest.  Five minutes.  That was all the time she had.  The penthouse suite, a jewel box of antique furnishings and priceless art, housed a client with a reputation as sharp as his diamond collection – Lord Ashworth Blackwood – and Amelia, the Grand Cavendish's resident concierge, was the keystone in ensuring his arrival went off without a hitch.

The setting was London, 1938.  Fog hung heavy over the city, clinging to the cobbled streets and swirling around the towering buildings that clawed at the grey sky.  The Grand Cavendish, a stately edifice nestled amongst the grand mansions and opulent shops of Mayfair, stood as a beacon of comfort and sophistication.  Its polished mahogany doors, intricate wrought-iron balconies, and the hushed whispers of the staff all conveyed an air of timeless elegance.  Inside, the scent of old books and polished leather mingled with the faint perfume of lilies in the vast lobby.  Amelia, with her meticulously-placed pearl earrings and tailored black dress, was a familiar, comforting figure amidst the whirlwind of activity and hushed conversation. But tonight, the air felt thick with unspoken anxieties and the weight of impending trouble.
