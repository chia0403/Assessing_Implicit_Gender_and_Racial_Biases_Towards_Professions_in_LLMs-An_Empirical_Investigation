The fluorescent lights of Mr. Alistair Finch's classroom hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the weariness settling in his bones.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a half-eaten granola bar and a stray pencil stub on the worn oak desk.  Alistair, a history teacher at Eastbrook High, stared at the overflowing stack of student essays, each a miniature testament to the creative (and often questionable) interpretations of the American Revolution.

The setting was the cramped, echoing history classroom of Eastbrook High School, a sprawling institution on the edge of a town that had seen better days.  The school, built in the 1960s, had witnessed generations of students come and go, each leaving their own mark, some visible, some hidden beneath layers of chipped paint and faded posters. The air itself seemed to hold a faint scent of old textbooks and despair, punctuated by the occasional whiff of stale coffee from the teacher's lounge, a place Alistair avoided on most days.  Outside, the muted sounds of traffic and distant sirens mingled with the chirping crickets, a familiar soundtrack to the mundane realities of his existence.
