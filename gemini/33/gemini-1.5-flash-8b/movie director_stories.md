The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded, milky yellow from decades of lukewarm water, reflected the flickering fluorescent light above.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm drumming in Amelia "Maisie" Finch’s head.  Maisie Finch, director of the acclaimed, yet notoriously demanding, independent film "Echoes of the Void," stared at the water swirling in the basin, a miniature tempest mirroring the swirling chaos in her mind.  She’d arrived at the isolated mountain town of Havenwood, population 273 (as per the quaintly outdated tourist brochure clutched in her hand), just three days prior,  with a crew depleted by illness and a script stubbornly refusing to coalesce.  Her meticulously planned, visually stunning epic was unraveling, each misplaced comma in the dialogue threatening to send the entire project spiralling into the abyss.  The biting wind, tasting of pine needles and impending doom, whipped around the small, almost forgotten, Victorian town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, a stark counterpoint to the vibrant, colourful world she envisioned on the screen.  Havenwood, with its crooked sidewalks and cobbled streets, felt like a living, breathing anachronism, a time capsule holding onto a past she was desperate to escape, but also strangely drawn to.
