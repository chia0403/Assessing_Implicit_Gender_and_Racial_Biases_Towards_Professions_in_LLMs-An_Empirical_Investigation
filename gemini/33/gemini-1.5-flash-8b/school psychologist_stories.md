Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community center, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless anxieties gnawing at Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and something vaguely sweet, like overripe fruit, hung heavy in the air.

This was the 'Hope Haven' community center, a makeshift shelter for displaced families, a far cry from the sophisticated, sterile environment of her usual practice.  Tonight, amidst the hushed whispers of children huddled around flickering fluorescent lights, she was tasked with assessing twelve-year-old Leo Ramirez, a boy whose haunted eyes mirrored the storm outside.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered tables, highlighting the stark contrast between the community center's desperate need and the quiet professional detachment Dr. Vance desperately tried to maintain.
