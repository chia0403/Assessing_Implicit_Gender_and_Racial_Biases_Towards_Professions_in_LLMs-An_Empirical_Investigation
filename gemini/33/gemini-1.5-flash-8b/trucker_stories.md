The chipped paint on the cab of the "Ironclad" – a rust-eaten but surprisingly sturdy Kenworth – reflected the sickly yellow of the late afternoon sun.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Route 66, swirling the fine red dirt into the already hazy air.  It was a landscape of endless plains and stubborn, thorny mesquite, a world that mirrored the weariness settling in Amelia "Amy"  Stone, the trucker.  Amy, 38, with eyes the color of storm clouds and a voice that could rumble through the loudest engine, gripped the steering wheel, the rhythmic thrum of the diesel a lullaby in the oppressive heat.  She was headed towards Winslow, Arizona, a town whispered about in trucker circles, a place said to hold secrets as ancient as the desert itself.  This wasn't just another delivery, this was a pickup.  A pickup shrouded in rumors and danger. Inside the refrigerated trailer, nestled amongst layers of thick ice, lay a mysterious cargo, a cargo with a past she couldn't quite fathom.  The wind howled a mournful song across the desolation, and Amy felt a chill creep down her spine, a premonition as unsettling as the silence that hung heavy in the truck's cab.
