The wind, a relentless, whispering coyote, whipped across the cracked earth of the Jornada del Muerto, tasting the dust and spitting it back into the parched landscape.  Sunrise, a bruised purple smudge against the horizon, offered little solace to Elias Thorne, a man hardened by the unforgiving desert and the equally unforgiving demands of the Lost Valley Ranch.  He squinted, his gaze tracing the faint tracks snaking across the parched grass, tracks that were undeniably fresh, and undeniably not his own.  The ranch, his inheritance from his grandfather, a man who’d carved this life from the very heart of the desert, was a testament to resilience.  But even resilience had its limits.  Something felt… off.


**Setting:**  The Lost Valley Ranch, situated in the desolate Jornada del Muerto desert of New Mexico.  The landscape is stark and unforgiving, a vast expanse of cracked earth, scrubby mesquite trees, and the occasional, desperately clinging saguaro.  The air, thick with the scent of dust and the distant, melancholy cry of the wind.  The ranch itself is a collection of weathered buildings, built to endure the brutal elements, with a well-worn, corrugated iron fence marking its boundaries.
