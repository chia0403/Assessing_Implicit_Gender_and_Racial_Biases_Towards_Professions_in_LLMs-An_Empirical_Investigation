The biting wind, a relentless claw, ripped at Elias Thorne's threadbare jacket.  He squinted against the swirling snow, the jagged peaks of the Cascade Range a blurry, grey-white tapestry against the bruised sky.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of pine and the acrid scent of thawing earth, hung heavy in his lungs.  He was alone, as always, on this unforgiving stretch of the old logging road, a rutted, icy ribbon snaking through the skeletal remains of the forest.  This was the heart of the Washington wilderness, a place where the ancient trees still whispered secrets to the wind, and the only company a man could find was the echoing silence of the mountains.  Elias Thorne, seasoned logger, solitary soul, knew this place as intimately as the grain of the timber he felled.  He knew the precise angle of the sun's low rays as they illuminated the frosted needles, the subtle shift in the wind that heralded a coming storm, and the precise rhythm of his own ragged breathing as he wrestled the heavy snowdrifts from the path.  This was his domain.  This was where he belonged.
