The crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, snaked through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the derelict manor house.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a swirling pattern of chipped paint and cobwebs.  This was no glamorous photoshoot, no glossy magazine spread.  This was Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s latest project, and it was, to put it mildly, a challenge.

Amelia Blackwood, a young interior decorator with a penchant for the dramatic and a portfolio overflowing with opulent transformations, found herself wrestling with the sheer, oppressive stillness of Blackwood Manor.  The house, steeped in generations of the Blackwood family's melancholic history, exuded a palpable sense of abandonment.  Forged in the image of her great-aunt, a renowned (and eccentric) decorator, Amelia had inherited the house and its ghostly secrets. Her goal? To breathe new life into the crumbling walls, to coax the spirit of the manor back to something vibrant, while also acknowledging its deeply rooted past.  The challenge was immense, the house, as vast and imposing as a forgotten dream.  The first step was just to get inside.
