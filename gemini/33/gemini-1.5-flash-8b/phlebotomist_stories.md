The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, almost comforting, drone.  Amelia Nightingale, phlebotomist extraordinaire (or so she liked to think), meticulously arranged a collection of blood tubes in the designated slots.  Each tube, a tiny, sterile vessel holding a potential universe of information, awaited its patient.  Outside, the city thrummed with a cacophony of sirens and car horns, a stark contrast to the sterile quiet of the laboratory, the only sound the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's sterile gloves against the stainless steel counter.

Amelia, a woman of twenty-eight with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a perpetually tired smile, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.  Today was "flu season," which meant the patient overflow in the blood donation clinic had reached a fever pitch.  Sheâ€™d seen a hundred different faces, a hundred different anxieties, in the past few hours alone, all hoping for some form of relief, but rarely knowing how much of a burden their own blood might carry.

The setting: a bustling, city-centre blood donation clinic.  Rows of sterile white examination cubicles, each a small, contained universe of needles, vials, and worried faces.  The metallic tang of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a counterpoint to the faint scent of antiseptic and lingering coffee from the breakroom.  The clinic, tucked away on a busy street corner, was a testament to the relentless cycle of life, a place where the unseen and vital flowed ceaselessly.
