The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated warehouse, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia “Ace”  Montgomery’s temples.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and stale beer, clung to her like a second skin.  Ace, a private investigator with a reputation as sharp as her wit and a nose for trouble as keen as a hawk's, cursed under her breath, tugging at the damp collar of her trench coat.  She traced the chipped paint on the wall with a nicotine-stained finger, a familiar, frustrating pattern.  This was the back alley, or what was left of it, of the once-bustling port city of Havenwood, a place where secrets festered like rats in the shadows.

The year was 1938. The city itself was a tapestry woven from steel and brick, reflecting the harsh light of a perpetually overcast sky.  Havenwood thrived on its maritime history, though the grandeur of the docks had been gradually eroded by the relentless encroachment of the rising tide of industrialization.  Rusty ship hulls lay abandoned in the harbor, their skeletal frames a stark reminder of times past.  Dusty streets, lined with boarded-up shops and dimly lit cafes, whispered stories of the city's underbelly – a place where illicit dealings flourished and shadows stretched long into the night.  Ace, armed with her trench coat, a worn copy of “The Art of War” and a battered leather-bound notebook, was determined to navigate its labyrinthine darkness.
