The fluorescent lights of the ER hummed, a relentless, white noise that clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a second skin.  The rhythmic beep-beep-beep of heart monitors, punctuated by the jarring cries of patients and the hurried pronouncements of nurses, was her soundtrack.  Tonight, the soundtrack was particularly frantic.  Outside, a torrential downpour hammered against the hospital windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within the emergency room.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Eleanorâ€™s own pulse.

Eleanor Vance, a seasoned Emergency Medical Care technician, stood hunched over a gurney, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The patient, a young man named Leo, lay still, his face pale beneath the harsh glare of the overhead lights.  A shallow, ragged breath escaped his lips.  The air in the room hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, a scent Eleanor knew all too well.  Around them, the room buzzed with activity.  A flurry of footsteps and frantic whispers, the rhythmic clack of stethoscopes, the low, guttural tones of hushed conversations.  The entire scene was a chaotic symphony of sound and motion, a testament to the constant battle between life and death that raged within the sterile confines of the emergency room.
