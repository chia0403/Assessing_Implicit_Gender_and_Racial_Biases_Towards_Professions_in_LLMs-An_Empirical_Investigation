The air, thick with the smell of coal smoke and fermenting compost, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive weight of the recent research findings.  Her office, tucked away in the dilapidated science wing of the University of Veridian, was a repository of half-empty coffee cups, scribbled notes, and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt sugar from countless late-night caffeine-fueled experiments.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a half-eaten sandwich on her cluttered desk and a flickering fluorescent light that cast long, skeletal shadows across the room.  The Valley, a place where industry met the edge of the forgotten, held a peculiar fascination for her, a fascination she suspected was inextricably bound to her research into the valley's unusually high mineral content.
