The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High Guidance Department hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the swirling anxieties of teenagers.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the relentless rhythm of Amelia Blackwood’s thoughts.  Amelia, a guidance counselor with seven years under her belt and a heart that felt perpetually wrung out, stared at the overflowing stack of student files on her desk.  Each file, a miniature universe of hopes, fears, and unspoken struggles, seemed to mock her with its silent, contained drama.  Outside, the autumn leaves, once vibrant hues of crimson and gold, were now sodden and lifeless, mirroring the pervasive feeling of despair that clung to the air in the small, windowless office.  The smell of stale coffee, a familiar comfort, hung heavy in the air, mixed with the faint scent of antiseptic and something indefinably… lost.  It was a Tuesday, like any other Tuesday, yet today felt particularly oppressive.  The persistent drone of the rain, the relentless pressure of her job, the gnawing sense of inadequacy... all conspired to create a suffocating atmosphere.
