The biting wind whipped through the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, stinging Amelia Blackwood, Judge of the Crown Court, in the face.  Snow, a fine, swirling powder, clung to the eaves of the half-timbered houses, painting the already melancholic town in shades of grey.  The year was 1888.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Cotswolds, was a place where the past clung to the present like mist to the valley floor.  A place where whispers carried the weight of ancient grudges and secrets whispered across generations.  Amelia, her dark cloak pulled tight around her, hurried towards the courthouse, a squat, grey building that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it.  Within its shadowed walls, cases of theft, adultery, and, occasionally, murder, awaited her judgment. Today, however, a particularly perplexing case was set to unfold.  A case involving a missing heiress, a locked room, and a web of suspicious acquaintances.  The air, already heavy with foreboding, grew thicker as she approached, an unsettling stillness settling over the town.  The case of Miss Elara Ashworth had become, in the space of a week, Oakhaven's obsession.
