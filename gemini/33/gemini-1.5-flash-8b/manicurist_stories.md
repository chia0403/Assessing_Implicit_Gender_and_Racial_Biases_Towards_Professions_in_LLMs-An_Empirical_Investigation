The scent of lilies and something faintly metallic, perhaps old copper, clung to the air in Anya Petrova’s manicuring salon, "Anya's Polished Paws."  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty rose-colored curtains, painted long, theatrical shadows across the polished mahogany table where Anya perched, a miniature, almost fragile, tornado of motion.  Her name, whispered on the hushed breath of her clients, meant something different in each of their mouths.  Some heard a gentle firmness, others a playful energy, and a few a hidden sadness, a secret that only her manicured fingers seemed to know.  Anya, a woman of 32 with a cascade of raven black hair that always seemed to resist the pull of gravity and a glint of mischief in her hazel eyes, was currently working on a set of emerald green nails, each meticulously painted with tiny, intricate gold flowers.  The salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Prague, was a miniature world of hushed tones and soft, tinkling music.  Antique mirrors reflected the subtle details of the room, from the ornate gilded frame of the antique clock on the wall to the delicate lace doilies scattered over the velvet cushions of the client chairs.  The scent of baking bread wafted from a nearby bakery, a comforting counterpoint to the gentle squeak of the salon’s worn-out floorboards.
