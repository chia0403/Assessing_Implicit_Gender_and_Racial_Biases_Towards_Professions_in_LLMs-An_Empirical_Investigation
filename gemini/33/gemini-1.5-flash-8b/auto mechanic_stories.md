The greasy haze hung heavy in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny garage tucked between a dilapidated diner and a perpetually-empty storefront.  Fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sickly yellow glow on the jumbled collection of tools, parts, and half-finished vehicles that cluttered the space.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty"  Crane, a man who could coax life from the most stubborn engine, a master of the intricate dance between metal and fire.  Barty, with his calloused hands and a perpetually tired frown, was currently wrestling with a sputtering vintage motorbike, its paint faded to the colour of an old bruise.  The rhythmic clanging of the wrench against metal was punctuated by the distant honking of a taxi and the mournful sigh of the old air compressor.  Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the dusty street, turning the air into a suffocating blanket.  Barty's brow was slick with sweat, but he didn't seem to notice.  His mind was entirely focused on the whirring, sputtering beast before him.  This bike, he knew, held the key to a mystery that stretched far beyond the confines of Rusty Wrench.
