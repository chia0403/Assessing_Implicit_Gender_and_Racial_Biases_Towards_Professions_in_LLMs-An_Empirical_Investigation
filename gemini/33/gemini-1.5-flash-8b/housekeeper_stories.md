The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floors of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb's ethereal glow, swirled in the still air.  Agnes Blackwood, her starched apron immaculate despite the day's grime, surveyed the sprawling drawing-room.  The scent of lavender, a constant companion in her life, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the faint, musty odour of neglect that clung to the room, a silent testament to the absent Lord Blackwood.  Agnes, though a seasoned housekeeper for the Blackwood family for over twenty years, felt a knot tighten in her stomach.  Today was different.  This wasn't simply another dusting and tidying session; a whisper of something profoundly unsettling echoed through the halls of the manor, threatening to shatter the carefully constructed facade of normalcy.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a grand, yet decaying, Victorian estate nestled deep within the whispering woods of the English countryside.  The house, once the envy of the village, was now shrouded in a silent sorrow, the grandeur of its architecture muted by a lingering sense of decay and abandonment. The biting winter air permeated even the warmest rooms, the fireplace crackling feebly in an attempt to keep the chill at bay.  The wind howled through the ancient oaks surrounding the manor, their gnarled branches scratching at the windows like restless ghosts.
