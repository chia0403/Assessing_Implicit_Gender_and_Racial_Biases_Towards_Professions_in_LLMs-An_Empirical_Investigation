The chipped paint on the gazebo's railing mirrored the chipped paint on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's fingernails.  He stared out at the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate that seemed to swallow the surrounding countryside whole.  The meticulously sculpted hedges, each a miniature, verdant wall, pressed in on him, their emerald perfection mocking the scrapes and bruises that dotted Barty's calloused hands.  Today, however, even the relentless, sun-baked perfection of Blackwood Manor felt strangely oppressive.  A thick, humid air hung heavy, laden with the scent of overgrown honeysuckle and something else… something metallic, acrid, that clung to the back of his throat.  He’d been tending the gardens for Lord Ashworth since he was a boy, a lifetime of precise trimming and meticulous weeding, but this particular day felt different.  Different and… unnerving.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a grand estate nestled in the heart of the Hampshire countryside, England.  The estate sprawled across acres of meticulously maintained lawns, bordered by towering hedges and sculpted trees.  Ancient oaks, their branches intertwined like skeletal fingers, cast long shadows across the sprawling gardens.  Hidden pathways wound through the estate, leading to secluded rose gardens, hidden grottoes, and a secluded, formal courtyard.  A heavy, almost oppressive, silence, broken only by the occasional chirping of crickets and the rustling of leaves, clung to the air.  Barty, despite the oppressive heat, felt the chill creep up his spine.  The air felt thick and stagnant, like something was about to happen.  This was not the usual quiet of a summer's day.
