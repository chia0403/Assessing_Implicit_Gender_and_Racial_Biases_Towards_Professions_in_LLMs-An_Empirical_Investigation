The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s crimson coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the pale, November light filtering through the grimy arches.  Rain, a relentless grey curtain, had plastered the cobblestones into a treacherous slick.  London, 1888.

She was a lawyer, yes, but tonight, she wasn't just arguing cases; she was navigating a labyrinth of secrets, a city that whispered truths and lies in equal measure.

Her destination: the dimly lit office of Mr. Silas Finch, a notoriously reclusive solicitor famed for his sharp wit and even sharper dealings.  The faint scent of aged paper and pipe tobacco clung to the air, a scent that always seemed to settle in Amelia's nostrils, a signal of impending danger and intrigue.  She had come for a favour, a favor that would put her firmly in the crosshairs of a case unlike any she had encountered before, a case that was more than just a legal battle.
