The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" grocery store hummed, a relentless, almost oppressive drone that echoed the steady rhythm of Amelia Hayes's life.  Amelia, a 27-year-old cashier with eyes the color of faded denim and a perpetually tired smile, scanned another carton of eggs.  The barcode was stubbornly refusing to cooperate, its black lines blurring into a meaningless squiggle under her fingertip.  Outside, the early autumn air, crisp and tinged with the scent of fallen leaves, offered a stark contrast to the sterile interior of the store.  Inside, the aisles stretched out like a labyrinth, the fluorescent lights creating a washed-out palette of beige and grey, mirroring the muted tones of Amelia's own existence.  This was her third shift of the day, and the quiet hum of the refrigerators and the occasional clatter of shopping carts were the only sounds that broke the almost painful silence.  The store, a sprawling, slightly depressing behemoth, was nestled in the heart of a small town, its faded facade a testament to time and the ever-shifting tides of consumerism.
