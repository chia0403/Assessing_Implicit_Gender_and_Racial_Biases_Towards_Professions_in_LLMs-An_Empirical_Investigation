The chipped Formica countertop reflected the fluorescent hum of the office, a sterile, pale light that seemed to suck the colour from everything.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of the third-floor office, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic thump-thump of Amelia Penelope Featherstone’s weary fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a secretary at the prestigious yet somewhat dilapidated law firm of Grimshaw & Grimshaw, felt a familiar knot tightening in her chest.  Another Monday. Another mountain of legal documents. Another case with the potential to consume her soul.

The office, a monument to beige and faded floral wallpaper, smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Rows of identical beige desks lined the room, each cluttered with a chaotic array of folders, pens, and half-empty mugs.  Sunlight, when it dared to pierce the gloom, painted fleeting rainbows on the dust motes dancing in the air.  A single, wilting potted fern stood sentinel in the corner, a silent testament to the office’s forgotten green spaces.  Amelia, perched at her desk, the only splash of vibrant colour in the room (in her vibrant fuchsia dress), felt utterly alone, even though the office buzzed with a low hum of activity.  The other secretaries were occupied with their own quiet battles, their own mountains to climb.
