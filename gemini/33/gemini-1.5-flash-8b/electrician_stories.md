The flickering fluorescent hum of the factory floor vibrated through Elias Thorne's boots, a constant, low-thrumming counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of metal on metal.  He gripped the insulated handle of his screwdriver, knuckles white, as he wrestled with a stubborn junction box.  Dust motes, tiny specks of gritty brown, danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt sugar, a familiar, slightly nauseating scent of late-night industrial repairs. Elias,  a wiry man with tired eyes and calloused hands, cursed under his breath.  It was the third junction box this shift he'd been fighting.

The setting was the sprawling, concrete behemoth of the "Ironclad Industries" factory complex, nestled deep within the rust-belt city of Ashport.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the relentless percussion of the factory's machinery.  Inside, the cavernous space echoed with the roar of machinery and the distant shrieks of the automated conveyors.  Piles of raw metal, gleaming under the pallid fluorescent lights, towered like frozen waves.  Each clang and grind was a metronome counting down the minutes until Elias's shift ended.  Elias knew the rhythmic clang was a symphony of doom, a song that foretold the possibility of disaster, the sort he often had to avert, one faulty wire or blown fuse at a time.
