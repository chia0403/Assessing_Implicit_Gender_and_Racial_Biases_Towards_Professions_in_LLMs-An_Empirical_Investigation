The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the cobbled alleyways and swirling around the tiny, almost invisible bakery tucked between a butcher shop and a bustling apothecary.  Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of "The Golden Crust," a name whispered more than shouted in the quiet, winding streets of Veridia.  Inside, Amelia Evangeline Dubois, a baker with eyes the colour of burnt caramel and hands perpetually flour-dusted, kneaded a dough ball the size of a small pumpkin.  Each rhythmic press of her knuckles echoed in the cavernous silence of the nearly empty shop, a symphony played out beneath the flickering gaslight.  The scent of woodsmoke, a familiar counterpoint to the yeasty fragrance, drifted in from the narrow passageway, signaling the approach of the night watch.  Veridia, a city blanketed in perpetual twilight and shrouded in ancient, unspoken mysteries, held its breath.  The night was young, and Amelia's dough felt alive.
