The flickering neon sign of "Radio Rex" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley, highlighting the chipped paint and rusted metal of the building.  Inside, Elias Thorne, Radio Technician extraordinaire, a man whose hands seemed to possess a unique understanding of wires and circuits, knelt before a towering stack of vintage radios, their walnut cases gleaming faintly in the dim light.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate tangle of wires connecting the instruments.  Elias, with his perpetually rumpled tweed jacket and perpetually inquisitive brow, traced a faulty connection with a delicate touch, his breath fogging in the cold air.  He was haunted by the faint, almost inaudible, static that pulsed through the air, a persistent whisper that echoed the city's own anxieties.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof was the only other sound, a constant counterpoint to the faint hum of the radios.
