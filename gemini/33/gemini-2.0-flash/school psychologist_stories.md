Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a school psychologist:

**Opening:**

The air in Room 104 crackled with the barely suppressed energy of a caged hummingbird. Tiffany Johnson, a fifth-grader with pigtails that seemed permanently magnetized to her face, was currently staring at a point approximately three inches to the left of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's left ear. Ellie had learned, over years of practice, to interpret such non-verbal cues. Tiffany was stalling. Big time.

"So, Tiffany," Ellie said, her voice a carefully calibrated blend of warmth and professional detachment, "you mentioned on the form about having some trouble… focusing in class?"

Tiffany's gaze flickered down, tracing the worn pattern of the rug in Ellie's office. It depicted various vaguely educational images: a friendly-looking bookworm reading under a tree, a smiling globe showing all seven continents (though Ellie suspected it was geographically inaccurate), and a suspiciously cheerful-looking atom.

"Yeah," Tiffany mumbled, her voice barely audible. "I… uh… get distracted."

"Distracted by what?" Ellie prompted gently, leaning forward slightly. She knew this was the key. Unlocking the distraction could unlock everything else.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Northwood Elementary School**, a sprawling, single-story building located in the quiet, almost idyllic, suburb of **Maple Creek, Wisconsin**. Maple Creek is a town known for its excellent schools, pristine parks, and a general sense of wholesome, if slightly stifling, tranquility. The school itself is typical of the region: brick exterior, long corridors lined with colorful student artwork, and the faint but persistent aroma of floor wax and cafeteria lunches.

**Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's office** is located near the main office, a small, windowless room painted a calming shade of sage green. Over the years, Ellie has tried to make it a welcoming space. There's a comfortable armchair, a small collection of stress-relief toys (Slinkies, squishy balls, a miniature zen garden), and a bookshelf filled with age-appropriate books about feelings and coping strategies. Pictures drawn by former students, thanking her for her help, are carefully taped to the walls. Despite its efforts at hominess, the office still retains a faint clinical feel, a subtle reminder of its purpose. The walls are thick, soundproofed, and though Ellie appreciates the privacy this allows, she often feels a bit cut off from the hustle and bustle of the school outside.
