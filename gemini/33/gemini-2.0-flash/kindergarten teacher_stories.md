The air in Room 1A hung thick with the aroma of Elmer’s glue and questionable cafeteria pizza. Rain lashed against the large, brightly-painted windows of Sunny Meadows Elementary, blurring the already chaotic scene inside. Little boots, usually lined up neatly by the door, lay scattered like fallen leaves. Temper tantrums, fueled by sugar crashes and thwarted nap times, echoed across the room. And in the middle of it all, stood Miss Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a calming presence amidst the storm.

Sunny Meadows Elementary wasn’t exactly the most glamorous place in the world. Situated on the outskirts of the quiet town of Willow Creek, it was a single-story brick building, its façade showing the wear and tear of decades of energetic children. The playground, usually a riot of laughter and activity, was currently deserted, the swings swaying mournfully in the wind. But inside, Amelia had transformed her classroom into a haven of colour and creativity. Construction paper snowflakes, slightly mangled but undeniably heartfelt, adorned the ceiling. Finger-painted masterpieces, depicting everything from fantastical unicorns to oddly-shaped family portraits, lined the walls. It was a space built for wonder, for exploration, and, most importantly, for allowing five-year-olds to be five-year-olds.

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, knelt beside a sniffling little boy named Leo. He was clutching a crumpled drawing of a rainbow, his lower lip trembling. “What’s wrong, sweetie?” she asked, her voice a soothing balm against the kindergarten chaos.
