Okay, here's a story opening, including the full name of our salesperson protagonist and a vividly described setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of damp wool and desperation hung thick in the air of the Leeds Indoor Market. Rain lashed against the glass roof, turning the daylight a murky grey. Agatha Penhaligon, her smile stretched taut like a too-tight elastic band, adjusted the collar of her tweed suit. It was her "serious business" suit, reserved for days when she needed to project an image of unwavering competence, and God, did she need it today. The market was a battlefield of discount fabrics, wilted produce, and dreams gone slightly sour, and Agatha, sales representative for "Evergreen Earthenware," was desperately trying not to become another casualty.

She straightened the display of her company's signature speckled mugs - the 'Farmer's Hearth Collection' they were calling them - and forced herself to meet the eye of a woman haggling over a pound of bruised tomatoes. "Beautiful morning, isn't it?" Agatha chirped, her voice betraying none of the internal panic churning in her stomach. "Just the kind of day that calls for a nice, hot cuppa in one of our lovely mugs. They retain heat better than anything on the market, you know."

The tomato woman, bless her soul, barely glanced at Agatha before resuming her negotiations with the fruit vendor. Agatha sighed inwardly. Another day, another mountain of mugs to shift, and another creeping doubt that sheâ€™d ever escape the soul-crushing confines of the Leeds Indoor Market.
