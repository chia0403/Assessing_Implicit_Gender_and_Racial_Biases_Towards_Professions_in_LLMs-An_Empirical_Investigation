## Story Opening:

The insistent shrill of the landline cut through the pre-dawn quiet of Judge Eleanor Abigail Thorne's home. She groaned, burying her head further into the goose-down pillow, a futile attempt to silence the relentless ringing. The luminous green digits of her bedside clock glared at her - 5:17 AM. Who would be calling at this hour?

Another ring. Eleanor sighed, resigning herself to the inevitable. Grabbing her reading glasses from the nightstand, she fumbled for the receiver, her voice thick with sleep. "Thorne residence."

A frantic voice, laced with fear, crackled through the line. "Judge Thorne, it's Sheriff Brody! We've got a situation... bad one. You need to come to the Olsen farm, just outside of Havenwood. There's been a... a double homicide."

Eleanor was instantly awake, the remnants of sleep washed away by a cold wave of dread. "Sheriff, what exactly has happened?"

"I can't say too much over the phone, Ma'am. Just... come quick. And bring your gavel."

## Setting:

Eleanor Abigail Thorne lived in the small, picturesque town of Havenwood, nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else, where the local diner served the best blueberry pancakes this side of the Mississippi, and where the annual Maple Syrup Festival was the highlight of the year. Her house, a charming two-story Victorian painted a muted sage green with cream-colored trim, sat on a quiet, tree-lined street just a few blocks from the town square. It was a house filled with the scent of old books and beeswax polish, a testament to her life-long love of history and order.

However, beneath the quaint facade of Havenwood lurked a quiet darkness, secrets whispered in hushed tones in the local tavern, and a simmering resentment that had been brewing for generations between the established families and the more recent, often more affluent, newcomers. Eleanor, as the judge of Havenwood County for the past fifteen years, had seen it all - petty squabbles, land disputes, and the occasional domestic disturbance. But nothing, she suspected, could have prepared her for what awaited her at the Olsen farm.
