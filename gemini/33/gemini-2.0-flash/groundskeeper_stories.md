The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's weathered face as he trudged along the cliffside path, the rhythmic crash of the waves a familiar counterpoint to the squeak of his well-worn wheelbarrow. He paused, gripping the handles, and surveyed his domain: the grounds of Blackwood Manor, a crumbling behemoth of gothic architecture that clung precariously to the jagged Cornish coastline.

The year was 1928. Blackwood Manor, built in the late 1700s, was a testament to a bygone era of opulent estates and eccentric landowners. Now, however, it was largely deserted, save for the elderly Lady Blackwood, a recluse lost in the labyrinthine halls, and Elias, the sole caretaker tasked with keeping the encroaching wilderness at bay.

The wind whipped through the skeletal remains of the rose garden, scattering fallen petals like crimson snow. Elias sighed, a plume of white mist hanging in the crisp autumn air. He had spent the last ten years of his life wrestling with this unruly garden, a constant battle against the relentless forces of nature and the lingering scent of decay. It was a lonely existence, but a peaceful one, broken only by the mournful cry of the gulls and the occasional, unsettling creaks and groans emanating from the ancient house.

He hoisted his shovel, the worn wood smooth beneath his calloused hands. Today's task was clearing the fallen leaves from the east terrace, a daunting task considering the relentless gale. But Elias Thorne was nothing if not persistent. He was a man of the land, a silent guardian against the encroaching wild, and Blackwood Manor, in all its decaying glory, was his charge.
