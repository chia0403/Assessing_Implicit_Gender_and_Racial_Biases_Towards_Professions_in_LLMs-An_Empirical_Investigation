## Story Opening:

The air in the drafting room hung thick with the scent of graphite, old blueprints, and the faint, almost metallic tang of Amelia Grace Thorne's anxiety. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune against the grimy windows of the Montgomery Steelworks building. Amelia, her fingers stained a permanent shade of grey from years of meticulous line work, leaned closer to the blueprint spread across her drafting table, the dim glow of the gooseneck lamp illuminating the furrow in her brow. She ran a calloused fingertip over the detailed rendering of a new support beam, a nagging feeling prickling at the back of her neck. Something wasn't right. The specifications, dictated by the notoriously impatient Chief Engineer, Mr. Abernathy, seemedâ€¦ off. Dangerously so.

## Setting:

The story opens in the sprawling, perpetually-overheated drafting room of the Montgomery Steelworks, located in the heart of Chicago's South Side in 1938. The room is a cacophony of organized chaos. Rows of large, tilted drafting tables dominate the space, each adorned with an array of tools: T-squares, triangles, compasses, and a scattering of sharpened pencils, meticulously arranged. Rolled blueprints, secured with rubber bands, lean precariously against the legs of the tables, threatening to topple over. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-caked windows, forcing the use of harsh, artificial lighting. The air is thick with the sounds of rhythmic pencil strokes, muttered calculations, and the occasional, frustrated sigh. It's a room filled with the meticulous minds responsible for the backbone of the city, but also one teetering on the edge of obsolescence, threatened by the looming advent of new technologies and changing industrial demands. Outside, the gritty, industrial landscape of Chicago stretches as far as the eye can see, a testament to the city's relentless ambition and unwavering reliance on the steel produced within these very walls.
