Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a massage therapist named Amelia Rose Cartwright:

**Setting:**

The small, eclectic town of Port Blossom nestled along the rugged Oregon coast. The year is early October, and the air carries the sharp tang of salt and the earthy scent of damp pine needles. Port Blossom is a haven for artists, retirees, and those seeking a slower pace of life. Its main street is lined with charming boutiques, antique stores, and surprisingly good seafood restaurants. Amelia's practice, "Kneaded Harmony," occupies a cozy space above "The Salty Siren," a local bookstore known for its grumpy owner and surprisingly insightful selection of nautical fiction. From her treatment room windows, she can see the turbulent gray-blue expanse of the Pacific, often shrouded in a misty haze. The sounds of foghorns and the cries of gulls are a constant, comforting soundtrack.

**Story Opening:**

Amelia Rose Cartwright could feel the tension radiating off her client, Mrs. Eleanor Abernathy, like heat from a furnace. Amelia’s fingers, usually adept at coaxing knots from muscle and worry from mind, met with unyielding resistance along Mrs. Abernathy’s shoulder blades. She gently increased the pressure, kneading deeper into the tight muscles. "Tell me, Eleanor," Amelia said, her voice soothing and even, like the ebb and flow of the tide, "what's been weighing you down today?" The only reply was a sharp intake of breath and the faintest sniffle. Amelia knew Mrs. Abernathy wouldn't offer up her troubles easily, but she also knew that sometimes, the physical release of a good massage could unlock the emotional dam that was holding everything back. The foghorn bellowed outside, a mournful sound that seemed to echo the unspoken burdens in the room.
