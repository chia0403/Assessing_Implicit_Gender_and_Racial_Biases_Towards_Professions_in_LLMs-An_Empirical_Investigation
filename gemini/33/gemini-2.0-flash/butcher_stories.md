## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Arthur & Sons Family Meats" chimed a cheerful, almost mocking, melody as the morning’s first customer stumbled in. Arthur Penhaligon, a man whose broad frame and perpetually flour-dusted apron spoke of years spent wielding cleavers and wrestling primal cuts, barely glanced up from the task at hand. The rhythmic *thwack* of his cleaver against the thick chopping block was the soundtrack to his life, and frankly, it was more engaging than most conversations. Today, he was breaking down a side of pork, the cool morning air tinged with the scent of rosemary and something faintly metallic. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his meaty hand, leaving a streak of white against his tanned skin. Another chop, clean and precise. He could almost feel the bone surrender beneath the blade. Almost. Then, the customer cleared their throat, a thin, hesitant sound that barely registered above the hum of the refrigeration units. Arthur sighed inwardly. Another day, another parade of indecisive shoppers and demanding housewives. He reluctantly steeled himself, forcing a smile onto his face that felt as practiced and artificial as a plastic ham. “Morning!” he boomed, his voice resonating through the shop like a foghorn. “What can I get for you?”

**Setting:**

The year is 1958. Arthur & Sons Family Meats is nestled in the heart of the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The shop itself is a testament to bygone days. The walls are painted a faded, almost sickly, shade of mint green, the paint peeling in places, revealing the raw brick underneath. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the neatly arranged displays of sausages, hams, and cuts of beef, all meticulously labelled in Arthur's precise, if slightly old-fashioned, hand.

The floor is covered in worn linoleum, a swirling pattern of brown and beige that is perpetually slick with sawdust and rendered fat. A large, refrigerated display case dominates the center of the shop, showcasing the day's offerings: plump chickens, marbled steaks, and various cuts of pork, all arranged with an almost artistic flair. Behind the counter, a large chalkboard displays the daily specials in bold, chalky letters. Above it, a faded photograph depicts a younger Arthur, standing proudly beside his father, both clad in pristine white aprons, beaming at the camera. The air hangs heavy with the mingled scents of fresh meat, spices, and the faint, lingering aroma of sawdust, a scent that Arthur finds comforting, even after all these years. Outside, the sounds of gulls crying and the distant clang of fishing boats create a constant, almost hypnotic, background hum to the butcher's daily routine.
