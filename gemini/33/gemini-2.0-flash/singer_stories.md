The sickly sweet smell of cheap hairspray and desperation hung heavy in the air backstage at The Neon Dream. It was a Tuesday, Amateur Night, and the place buzzed with nervous energy – a frantic, low-humming chord of ambition and fear.

Seraphina Bluebell Carter, twenty-two years old and armed with a voice that could melt glaciers, had been dreaming of this night for as long as she could remember. The Neon Dream, a dive bar tucked away in the grittier part of Sunset Strip, wasn’t exactly Carnegie Hall, but it was a start. It was a platform. It was a chance. It was also packed with a collection of jaded bartenders, drunk tourists, and industry hopefuls who’d seen it all before, all of whom were perfectly capable of tearing your dreams to shreds with a single, bored yawn.
