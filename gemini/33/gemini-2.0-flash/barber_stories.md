The bell above the door of "Arthur's Razor's Edge" chimed a cheerful, almost mocking, melody as the biting November wind rushed in. Arthur Bartholomew Higgins, proprietor and master barber of the establishment, sighed, a puff of warm air momentarily fogging the mirror reflecting his own increasingly weary face. Outside, Havenwood, Massachusetts was succumbing to the pre-Christmas gloom. Strings of twinkling lights, already hung across Main Street, were fighting a losing battle against the premature darkness. The skeletal branches of the elm trees, usually a comforting, stately presence, now clawed at the sky like desperate, gnarled fingers.

Inside, however, Arthur’s barbershop was a sanctuary. Warm, lamplit, and smelling faintly of bay rum and lavender shaving cream, it was a haven against the encroaching winter. Three well-worn leather chairs sat facing the mirror, each angled just so to catch the best light. A perpetually lit coal fire crackled merrily in the corner, casting dancing shadows across the walls adorned with framed photographs of dapper gentlemen sporting mustaches of impressive variety. The air was thick with the comforting murmur of old timers rehashing local gossip and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Arthur's trusty shears. For sixty years, Arthur’s Razor’s Edge had been more than just a place to get a haircut; it was the heart of Havenwood, a place where secrets were shared, deals were brokered, and friendships were forged. And today, Arthur had a feeling, was going to be a particularly interesting day.
