## Story Opening and Setting

The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the sweet, artificial scent of apple-scented hand sanitizer, clinging to everything in Mrs. Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne's second-grade classroom like a desperate, germ-fighting ghost. Outside, the autumn wind rattled the old, single-paned windows of Crestwood Elementary, a brick building that had witnessed generations of runny noses and forgotten lunchboxes. Inside, however, a different kind of storm was brewing.

Eleanor, normally a bastion of patience and gentle encouragement, felt a tremor of exasperation dance behind her eyes. Today was Monday, which was usually chaotic enough, but someone – *someone* – had decided it was a good idea to replace the alphabet carpet with a hideous, paisley-printed monstrosity over the weekend. The resulting uproar was louder than a squirrel trapped in a garbage can.

"But Mrs. Hawthorne," a small voice wailed from the tangled mess of limbs that had become the "reading corner", "the 'A' is hiding! I can't find the 'A'!"

Eleanor sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. She loved her job, she really did. She loved the bright eyes, the unbridled enthusiasm, even the occasional projectile vomit (okay, maybe not *that*). But days like this, days where the universe seemed determined to test her sanity with floral patterns and misplaced vowels, made her wonder if a quiet life as a goat farmer wouldn't be preferable after all. Still, she plastered a smile on her face, a practiced maneuver honed over seven years of teaching, and waded into the paisley morass. "Alright, class," she said, her voice ringing with a forced cheerfulness that even she didn't quite believe. "Let's find that 'A'!"
