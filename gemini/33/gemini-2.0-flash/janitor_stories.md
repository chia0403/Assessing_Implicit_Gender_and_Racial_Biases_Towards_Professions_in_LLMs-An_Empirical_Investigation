The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the slow dance of dust motes in the air. Ebenezer Fitzwilliam Pruitt, his grey hair escaping the confines of his faded blue cap like rebellious wisps of smoke, sighed and swirled the mop in the grimy water of his bucket. It was 2:17 AM, a time when the bustling heart of the Metropolitan Museum of Art was supposed to be still, silent, and steeped in the slumber of art history. But Ebenezer knew better. The silence wasn't always silent. The stillness often shifted. And art...well, art had its own way of staying awake.

Heâ€™d been the night janitor for the Met for thirty-seven years, enough time to memorize the echoing architecture, the subtle drafts that snaked through the galleries, and the precise location of every single squeaky tile in the Egyptian wing. Tonight, he was in the European Paintings, specifically the wing dedicated to the Impressionists. Monet's water lilies glimmered faintly in the darkness, Degas' dancers held their poised stillness, and Renoir's rosy-cheeked figures seemed to almost breathe in the cool, conditioned air. Ebenezer preferred this wing. Unlike the grim solemnity of the Medieval collection or the boisterous energy of the Renaissance masters, the Impressionists offered a quiet, contemplative solace, a fleeting moment of beauty snatched from the relentless march of time. He just hoped tonight, like most nights, they would stay put. Because when the art started moving, Ebenezer Fitzwilliam Pruitt knew, his night was about to get a whole lot longer.
