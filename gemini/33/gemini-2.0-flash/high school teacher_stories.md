## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Christine Davies' mounting frustration. It was Friday afternoon, the bell had rung ten minutes ago, and the last of her AP English students had thankfully fled the classroom. Amelia, however, remained rooted to her desk, a mountain of essays threatening to bury her alive. Each paper held the potential to unlock a student's brilliance, a hidden spark of creativity she could ignite. Instead, she was faced with a repetitive landscape of predictable arguments, recycled phrases, and grammar that would make Shakespeare weep. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, the familiar scent of old paper and lavender hand sanitizer clinging to her. This year, more than ever, she felt like a gardener tending to wilted plants, struggling to coax life back into their parched roots. Today, though, she was starting to feel a little wilted herself.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Northwood High School**, a sprawling, brick building nestled in the quiet, affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. The school is generally considered to be "good" â€“ high test scores, well-funded programs, and involved parents. However, beneath the veneer of success lies a pressure-cooker environment for the students, and a breeding ground for burnout for the teachers. Amelia's classroom, Room 207, is a fairly typical high school classroom. Posters of classic literary figures adorn the walls, competing for space with student artwork and motivational quotes that Amelia half-believes herself. A dusty bookshelf overflows with dog-eared paperbacks, evidence of Amelia's passion for literature. The room is generally well-organized, though today, the overflowing inbox on her desk and the scattered essays betray the chaos brewing beneath the surface. Sunlight streams in through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a subtle reminder of the passage of time and the relentless march towards the weekend. Beyond the windows, the manicured lawns of the school are visible, a testament to Oakhaven's pristine image, an image that often masks the complexities and anxieties hidden within its young residents.
