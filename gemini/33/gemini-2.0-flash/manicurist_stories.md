## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Polished Perfection" tinkled, a delicate, silver sound that barely registered over the thrum of Diana Ross singing "I'm Coming Out" from the salon's ancient sound system.  It was a song Beatrice Penelope Hawthorne knew intimately, having heard it approximately 3,742 times within these very walls.  Not that she minded. The song was an anthem, a burst of celebratory energy that mirrored the bubbling excitement she herself felt, even on a Monday afternoon with a lukewarm coffee and a looming appointment with Mrs. Abernathy, whose talons resembled less fingernails and more miniature, varnished shovels.

Beatrice, perched on her ergonomic stool, peered over the mountain of nail polish bottles that threatened to spill from the shelves behind her station. Sunlight streamed through the large, frosted windows, painting the dusty air gold. She was adding a final, iridescent coat to a pair of shimmering, turquoise nails, her tongue poking out slightly from the corner of her mouth in concentration.  Her client, a young woman named Chloe, was glued to her phone, presumably documenting her soon-to-be Instagram-worthy manicure.  Beatrice didn't mind the lack of conversation.  In fact, sometimes she preferred the quiet. It gave her space to think, to plan, to dream of the day she'd finally escape this small-town existence and open her own, truly *glamorous* salon.

## Setting:

The "Polished Perfection" salon was tucked away on the quieter side of Elm Street, in the heart of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else’s business, where the biggest excitement of the week was the Friday night bingo at the VFW hall, and where beige was considered a bold color choice.  The salon itself reflected this… restrained… aesthetic.  

Owned for the last forty years by the stoic, gray-haired Mrs. Elsie Periwinkle, "Polished Perfection" was a monument to the past. The walls were a faded shade of pale pink, the chairs were upholstered in a vinyl that cracked with age, and the air perpetually smelled of acetone and potpourri.  A framed photograph of Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning poodle, Fluffy, hung prominently above the reception desk, its beady eyes seeming to judge every client who dared to enter. Despite its dated decor, "Polished Perfection" was a local institution, a haven for women seeking perfectly manicured nails and a quiet escape from the humdrum realities of Harmony Creek life.
