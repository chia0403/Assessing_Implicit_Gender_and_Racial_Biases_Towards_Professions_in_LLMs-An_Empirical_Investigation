Okay, here's a story opening and setting, keeping in mind the main character is an editor:

**Opening and Setting:**

The air in "Book Nook Books," a name that both embraced and mocked its cramped, labyrinthine interior, was perpetually thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering ghost of Virginia Woolf's pipe tobacco (or so Amelia declared, much to the amusement of her colleagues). Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to avalanche at the slightest provocation. Sunlight, perpetually filtered through dust-caked windows and towering shelves, cast the office in a perpetually amber glow.

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, Senior Acquisitions Editor, sighed, running a hand through her unruly auburn hair. Outside, the early morning bustle of London's Bloomsbury district was already reaching a fever pitch, but inside, the Book Nook, things moved at a more leisurely, almost anachronistic pace. On her desk, a manuscript, a particularly thick tome entitled "The Celestial Cartographer," leered at her. It had arrived two weeks ago, accompanied by a query letter so riddled with typos it had made Ameliaâ€™s eye twitch. Now, fortified by a mug of lukewarm Earl Grey, she braced herself to plunge into its depths, armed with her trusty red pen and the unwavering conviction that even the roughest draft held a glimmer of potential. Today, she was determined to find it in "The Celestial Cartographer," or at least figure out if the author understood the basic concept of punctuation.
