Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a dietician as the main character:

**Opening:**

The acrid smell of burnt almonds clung to Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's crisp white lab coat, a testament to another failed "healthy snack" demonstration at the Sunny Meadows Assisted Living Facility. Eleanor sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. She'd thought a simple almond brittle sweetened with agave and a touch of sea salt would be a hit. Instead, it seemed Mrs. Higgins had confused the oven settings, resulting in something closer to charcoal than confectionery.

Eleanor scraped the blackened shards into the bin with a grimace. It was days like this she questioned her life choices. Was this truly the pinnacle of her nutritional expertise? Rescuing the geriatric population of Sunny Meadows from the ravages of institutional desserts?

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in and around **Sunny Meadows Assisted Living Facility** in the small, somewhat sleepy town of Meadow Creek, Oregon. Sunny Meadows is a sprawling, single-story building with a faded yellow exterior and an oddly cheerful, if somewhat sterile, interior. The rooms are a mix of private and semi-private, all furnished with identical floral bedspreads and medical-grade recliners.

There's a communal dining hall, perpetually smelling of either lukewarm gravy or industrial-strength disinfectant, depending on the time of day. Eleanor has a small, cramped office tucked away near the kitchen, filled with laminated posters of healthy food pyramids and motivational quotes about the power of vegetables. Outside, a meticulously manicured rose garden provides a splash of color, though Eleanor often suspects the roses are fed more chemicals than sunlight.

The town of Meadow Creek itself is a picture postcard of rural tranquility. But behind the charming facade of antique shops and farmers' markets lies a quiet desperation, a feeling of being forgotten and left behind. Many of the residents are older, and the younger generation has largely moved away, seeking opportunities elsewhere. This sense of isolation often permeates Eleanor's work, adding another layer of complexity to her already challenging job.
