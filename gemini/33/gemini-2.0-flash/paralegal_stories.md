The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune in Amelia Rose Thornton's ears, a sound she'd grown so accustomed to she barely registered it anymore. It was 7:17 PM on a Thursday, and the sprawling, open-plan office of Harrison, Davies & Bloom, a prestigious, albeit soulless, corporate law firm in downtown Chicago, was mercifully quiet. Most of the lawyers had already fled to their Gold Coast brownstones or their lakefront condos, leaving Amelia and a handful of other dedicated (or perhaps simply exhausted) paralegals to clean up the mess.

Amelia sat hunched over a mountain of documents related to the Peterson & Sons merger, her fingers stained with ink from the constant handling of antiquated paper files. The glow of her dual monitors illuminated her face, highlighting the fine lines of fatigue around her bright blue eyes. Outside, the city was a tapestry of glittering lights and the distant rumble of traffic, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic, climate-controlled environment of the 27th floor. The scent of stale coffee and lemon-scented cleaning products hung heavy in the air, a testament to the long day that was finally, grudgingly, coming to an end. Tonight, however, promised no reprieve. Mr. Davies, notorious for his unreasonable demands and even more unreasonable expectations, had requested a summary of all environmental regulations pertinent to Peterson & Sons by 9:00 AM sharp. Amelia stifled a sigh. It looked like another all-nighter in the making.
