The fluorescent lights of the "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation of 2 AM. Behind the counter, Eleanor Beatrice Finch stifled a yawn, adjusting her name tag for the tenth time that hour. The plastic rectangle, adorned with a cartoon squirrel holding a shopping bag, declared her "Employee of the Month," a bitter irony given the fact that her only competition was a perpetually hungover high school student named Kevin.

Outside, the rain hammered against the windows, blurring the neon signs into an abstract, pulsating mess. The only sound besides the hum and the rain was the rhythmic *thunk* of the lottery ticket machine as Eleanor automatically printed out another batch, hoping against hope that tonight, just maybe, someone would win big and she wouldn't have to spend another night counting pennies and selling stale doughnuts to truck drivers. The smell of cheap coffee and regret hung heavy in the air, a potent perfume of late nights and lost dreams that was as much a part of the Quick Stop Mart as the sticky floor and the blinking "Out of Order" sign on the slushie machine. Tonight, the universe felt particularly bleak, a vast, unforgiving expanse of empty shelves and flickering lights.
