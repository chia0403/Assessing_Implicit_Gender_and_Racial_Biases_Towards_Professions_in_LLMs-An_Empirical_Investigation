The wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains, whipping tumbleweeds against the weathered clapboard siding of the barn. Dust devils danced in the distance, mimicking the restless energy churning within Jedediah "Jed" Tanner. He leaned against the chipped porch railing, the setting sun painting long, crimson streaks across his tanned face, etching deeper lines around his eyes â€“ lines forged by sun, worry, and the endless expanse of the Montana sky.

His ranch, the "Broken Spur," was more than just land and livestock; it was a legacy, a promise whispered from his grandfather, a grit-and-gumption kind of dream. But the dream felt fragile tonight. The creek had run dry, the cattle were thin, and the bank was sniffing around like vultures eyeing a dying carcass. Jed tugged the brim of his worn Stetson lower, shielding his eyes from the blinding glare. He could almost taste the dust, the dry earth crumbling under his boots, a constant reminder of the drought tightening its grip on everything he held dear. Tonight, more than any other, the vast, unforgiving beauty of the Big Sky country felt more like a threat than a comfort. He feared that soon, the Broken Spur would be broken for good.
