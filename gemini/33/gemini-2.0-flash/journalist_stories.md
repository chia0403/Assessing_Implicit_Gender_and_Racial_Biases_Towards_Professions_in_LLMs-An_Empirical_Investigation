The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Hayes's hands, a small comfort against the bone-chilling damp that seeped into everything in Port Lament, Maine. The sky, the color of a bruised plum, pressed low against the ramshackle buildings clustered around the harbor, swallowing the last vestiges of afternoon light. Amelia, a journalist for the Portland Press Herald, had arrived that morning, drawn by a whispered rumour and a half-hearted promise from her editor: "Small town, big story potential. Go see what stinks, Amelia."

Port Lament stank of brine, fish guts, and secrets. The air, heavy with the scent of decay, hung over the town like a shroud. Houses painted in faded shades of seafoam green and weathered grey stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the relentless ocean. Fishing boats, battered and scarred, bobbed listlessly in the harbor, their masts swaying in a mournful rhythm. The few souls Amelia had encountered so far were tight-lipped and wary, their faces etched with a shared history she couldn't yet decipher. She perched on a rickety stool in "The Salty Gull," the only diner in town, nursing her tepid coffee and watching the grey waves crash against the seawall, wondering if she'd made a terrible mistake. This was a place where the tide seemed to wash away hope, leaving behind only salt and despair.
