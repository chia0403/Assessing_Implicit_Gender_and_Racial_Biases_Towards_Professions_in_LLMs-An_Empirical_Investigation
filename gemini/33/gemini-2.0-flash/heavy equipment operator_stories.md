The morning air in Calcite, Nevada tasted of dust and diesel, a familiar concoction that usually invigorated Johnathan "Jack" Riley. Today, though, it only amplified the ache in his lower back and the dull throb behind his temples. He squinted against the rising sun, a molten orb painting the vast, ochre landscape in hues of orange and rose. The sprawling open-pit mine, a man-made canyon gouged into the earth, looked almost beautiful from this vantage point, the orderly terraces and winding haul roads resembling a bizarre, alien city.

Jack was perched atop the cab of his Komatsu PC2000-8 hydraulic excavator, a monstrous machine that dwarfed everything around it. It was his throne, his domain, his partner in the relentless task of extracting the precious lithium ore from the hard-packed earth. Calcite, a town built on the promise of lithium riches, was a motley collection of prefabricated houses, a dusty main street lined with a diner, a hardware store, and a saloon that roared to life after the last shift. Beyond that, only the vast, unforgiving desert stretched in every direction, promising isolation and hardship.

He took a swig of lukewarm coffee from his thermos, the bitter liquid doing little to cut through the lingering fatigue. Today was going to be a long one, another twelve-hour shift wrestling with the earth, coaxing it to yield its bounty, and fighting the nagging feeling that this whole place was built on a foundation as unstable as the shifting sands of the Nevada desert.
