**Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance. It masked the more subtle aromas of liniment, stale sweat, and the quiet desperation that permeated the rehabilitation wing of St. Jude's. Ellie paused just inside the doorway of room 312, the clipboard clutched in her hand a shield against the emotional onslaught that was about to begin. Today was Mrs. Gable's first day back after surgery, and Ellie knew the woman was terrified.

**Setting:**

The rehabilitation wing of St. Jude's Hospital, located in the quiet, unassuming town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The wing itself is a long, narrow corridor, painted a soothing but ultimately sterile pale green. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the heavily-tinted windows, casting a muted light on the linoleum floor. On either side of the hallway are rooms, each sparsely furnished with a hospital bed, a small table, a vinyl-covered armchair, and a generic print of a landscape that offers little real solace. The air hums with the low thrum of the ventilation system and the beeping of medical equipment, punctuated by the occasional murmur of conversation or the groan of a patient pushing their limits. Despite the attempt at creating a healing environment, the overall atmosphere is one of quiet resilience in the face of pain and uncertainty.
