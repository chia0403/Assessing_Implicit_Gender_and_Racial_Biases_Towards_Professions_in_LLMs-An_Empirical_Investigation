The sterile chill of the operating room was a familiar comfort to Dr. Alistair Humphrey Thorne. He’d spent half his life bathed in its unforgiving light, the antiseptic smell clinging to him like a second skin. Tonight, however, the familiar ambiance did little to quell the tension knotting his shoulders. He adjusted the loops of his magnifying surgical glasses, the magnified view of the arterial anastomosis swimming into focus. Sweat beaded on his forehead, prickling beneath his surgical cap.

The setting was the Cardiothoracic Operating Theatre of St. Jude's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, at 11:47 PM. The hum of the heart-lung machine filled the room, a mechanical heartbeat substituting for the one lying still and vulnerable beneath Alistair's skilled hands. Emergency generator lights cast long, harsh shadows that danced around the stainless steel surfaces, reflecting in the anxious eyes of his scrub nurse, Maria, and the stoic face of Dr. Chen, the anesthesiologist. The digital monitor flashed a steady stream of numbers – blood pressure, oxygen saturation, core temperature – each a silent testament to the delicate balance Alistair was striving to maintain. He had to be perfect. One slip, one hesitation, and a young life would be extinguished before his very eyes.
