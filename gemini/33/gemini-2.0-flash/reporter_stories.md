## The Story Opening:

The insistent shrill of the telephone ripped Amelia Hayes from a troubled slumber. She fumbled for the receiver on her bedside table, the digital clock glowing 3:17 AM in a menacing red. Groaning, she managed a raspy, “Hayes.”

A breathless voice crackled through the line, “Amelia, it’s Marcus. You need to get down to the docks. Pier 47. Something… something big is happening. The Coast Guard has everything locked down. They’re saying nothing, but I saw… I saw a body, Amelia. A body in the water.”

Marcus hung up before she could even formulate a question, leaving Amelia with the buzzing silence of a disconnected line and the chilling image he had painted in her mind. A body. Pier 47. The biggest story she’d had in months, maybe years, was unfolding just a few miles away.

## The Setting:

**Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.** The air is thick with the salty tang of the Atlantic and a biting, pre-dawn chill. The city, nestled on the eastern coast of Canada, is a blend of historic charm and modern industry. Its cobblestone streets wind past centuries-old buildings, now home to trendy cafes and boutiques. The sprawling Halifax Harbour, a vital port for centuries, hums with the activity of fishing boats, cargo ships, and ferries, even in the dead of night.

**More Specifically:** The story opens in Amelia Hayes' small, cluttered apartment overlooking Citadel Hill, offering a panoramic view of the city and the distant, glimmering lights of the harbor. The apartment is functional rather than stylish, reflecting Amelia's dedication to her career and her lack of concern for domesticity. Empty coffee mugs litter her desk, alongside stacks of newspapers, notebooks overflowing with scribbled notes, and a half-eaten takeout container. The walls are covered in clippings, photographs, and maps, all connected by a web of red string - a visual representation of her current investigations and past triumphs.
