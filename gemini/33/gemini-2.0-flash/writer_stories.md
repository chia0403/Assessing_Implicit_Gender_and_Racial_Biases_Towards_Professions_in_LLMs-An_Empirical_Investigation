The clatter of keys was a steady, comforting rhythm against the backdrop of the Cornish coastline. Eleanor Astrid Vance, a novelist with a penchant for melancholy heroines and windswept landscapes, hunched over her laptop, the screen reflecting in her perpetually tired eyes. Salt spray, carried on the fierce gusts that buffeted the small cottage, occasionally splattered against the windowpane, momentarily blurring the view of the turbulent Atlantic Ocean.

Eleanor's writing space was a converted attic bedroom, a low-ceilinged haven of organized chaos. Books, stacked in precarious towers, lined the walls, threatening to spill onto the threadbare Persian rug that anchored the room. Empty teacups, casualties of late-night writing sprints, littered the desk alongside crumpled drafts and scattered pens. A half-eaten scone lay abandoned on a chipped china plate, crumbs clinging to the corner of her lips.

Outside, the rugged beauty of Cornwall stretched out before her: jagged cliffs plunging into the churning sea, heather-covered moors rolling inland, and tiny fishing villages clinging to the coastline like stubborn barnacles. It was a landscape that both inspired and intimidated her, a place where beauty and brutality coexisted in perfect, dramatic harmony. And it was here, in this isolated sanctuary, that Eleanor was desperately trying to wrestle her next novel into submission, a story about a woman haunted by the ghosts of the past, a story that felt unnervingly close to her own.
