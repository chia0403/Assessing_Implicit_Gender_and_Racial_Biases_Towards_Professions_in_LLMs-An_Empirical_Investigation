The lukewarm, artificial air of "Paradise Found Travel" barely stirred the postcards tacked haphazardly to the corkboard: sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins. Ironically, the only thing found in this particular paradise, on this particularly gloomy Tuesday morning, was ennui. Eleanor Abigail Finch, whose dreams of jet-setting across the globe had been slowly suffocated by spreadsheets and demanding clientele, sighed and swirled the lukewarm coffee in her chipped "I <3 Cancun" mug. Outside, a persistent drizzle blurred the already drab landscape of downtown Harmony Falls, Ohio. The town, perpetually stuck in a state of quaint, unadventurous normalcy, mirrored Eleanor's own life a little too closely. She dreamt of exotic spices and bustling marketplaces, but Harmony Falls offered only the faint aroma of Mrs. Higgins' pot roast wafting from down the street and the rhythmic drone of the municipal bus route. And right now, that bus was screeching to a halt outside her window, promising...well, probably another beige-clad tourist wanting a weekend getaway to Cedar Point. Eleanor adjusted her sensible cardigan, plastered on a smile, and prepared to face the day. Maybe, just maybe, someone would walk through that door with a ticket to somewhere truly exciting, and Eleanor Abigail Finch could live vicariously through their adventure, just for a little while.
