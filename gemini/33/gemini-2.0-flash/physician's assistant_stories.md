Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character who's a physician's assistant:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the Urgent Care clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the endless parade of coughs, sniffles, and anxieties that flowed through its doors. Abigail Marie "Abby" Carter, PA-C, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, the cold metal a familiar comfort against her skin. It was a Tuesday evening, nearing the tail end of her shift, but in this purgatory of illness, time had lost all meaning. The waiting room was blessedly quiet for the moment, a brief lull before the next wave of after-school sports injuries and late-night emergencies inevitably crashed upon them. Abby took a long sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter liquid doing little to combat the weariness creeping into her bones. She knew she should be charting, updating patient files, and generally preparing for the handoff to the night shift. But something about the sudden stillness felt… ominous. A pregnant pause before a storm.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the "Rapid Relief Urgent Care" clinic, located in the bustling, slightly rundown suburb of Oakwood Heights, just outside of a major metropolitan city. The clinic itself is a brightly lit, sterile environment, designed for efficiency rather than comfort. The walls are painted a pale, antiseptic green, punctuated by generic prints of landscapes and inspirational quotes. A reception desk, manned by a perpetually stressed receptionist named Brenda, dominates the entrance. Beyond that lies a cramped waiting room filled with uncomfortable plastic chairs and a flickering television that’s always tuned to daytime television. Several examination rooms, each equipped with an exam table, blood pressure cuff, and various medical instruments, branch off from a narrow hallway. The air is thick with the scent of disinfectant and the faint, lingering aroma of hand sanitizer. Outside, Oakwood Heights is a mix of aging strip malls, cookie-cutter houses, and small, independent businesses struggling to survive. It's a community with its own distinct character, shaped by its proximity to the city and its own share of economic hardship.
