The biting wind whipped off the icy expanse of Lake Superior, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled with the stubborn latches on the generator housing. He cursed under his breath, the metal protesting against the cold with a high-pitched whine. Elias, an electrician with calloused hands and a perpetually worried crease etched between his brow, was not built for winter. He was more comfortable in a sweltering attic, rewiring a pre-war fixture, than battling the elements on the unforgiving shores of Northern Minnesota.

The setting was Split Rock Lighthouse, a stoic sentinel perched on a towering cliff overlooking the churning grey water. It was January, deep in the throes of a brutal Northwoods winter. The lighthouse, usually a beacon of warmth and guidance, had fallen victim to a power outage the previous night. While the backup generator had kicked in, its sputtering coughs and uneven hum suggested it wouldn't hold for long. Elias, contracted by the Minnesota Historical Society, was the only electrician within a hundred miles willing (or perhaps foolish enough) to brave the treacherous roads to fix it.

He could just make out the faint outline of the lightkeeper's house nestled at the base of the tower, a wisp of smoke curling from its chimney. The wind howled like a hungry wolf, and the spray from the crashing waves threatened to coat everything in a layer of ice. Elias just hoped he could get the generator running before the darkness swallowed Split Rock whole.
