## Story Opening:

The air in the interrogation room was thick with the scent of stale coffee and unspoken threats. A single fluorescent light flickered overhead, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the tension clinging to the walls. Dr. Evelyn Reed, forensic psychologist, leaned back in her chair, her gaze unwavering as she observed the man across from her. He fidgeted, his hands twisting in his lap like captured birds, a nervous tic that belied the brutal efficiency described in the police reports. She knew the key to unlocking his secrets wasn't brute force, but a subtle shift in the power dynamic, a calculated dismantling of the carefully constructed façade. She took a slow, deliberate sip of her lukewarm coffee, letting the silence hang heavy between them. “Mr. Davies,” she began, her voice a low, calming murmur, “Let’s talk about the missing children.”

## Setting:

The setting for this opening scene is the austere, functionally furnished interrogation room of the **Metropolitan Police Department's Behavioral Sciences Unit** in **London, England**. The building itself is a sprawling, brutalist concrete structure located in the heart of the city, a monument to law and order. The interrogation room, specifically, is small and windowless, designed to be psychologically isolating. The walls are painted a drab, institutional beige, and the only decorations are a small, wall-mounted clock and a barely visible scratch where someone, likely a previous suspect, had desperately tried to carve their name. The room contains a steel table bolted to the floor, two hard, metal chairs for the interrogators, and a softer, more ergonomic chair for the suspect. A one-way mirror, cleverly disguised as a panel in the wall, allows for observation and recording of the session. The atmosphere is sterile, almost antiseptic, a deliberate attempt to create an environment conducive to breaking down resistance.
