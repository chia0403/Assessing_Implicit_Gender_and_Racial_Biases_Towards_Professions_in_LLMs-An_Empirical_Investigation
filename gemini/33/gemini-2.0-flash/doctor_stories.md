Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a doctor as the main character:

**Setting:**

The biting Atlantic wind whipped around the craggy cliffs of Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands. A relentless grey sea gnawed at the island's ancient stone walls, a constant reminder of the island's precarious hold on existence. Houses, small and white-washed, huddled together for warmth, their colourful doors – a defiant splash of cheer against the bleak landscape – often adorned with hand-painted shamrocks or crosses. The air was thick with the scent of peat smoke and salt spray. It was early morning, the sun a pale, watery disc barely breaking through the heavy cloud cover.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” O’Connell pressed a steaming mug of tea to her numb fingers, watching the ferry struggle against the choppy waves in the distance. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the already limited view from her clinic window. Inside, the waiting room was a small, brightly painted haven, lined with faded posters about the dangers of smoking and the benefits of a healthy diet – hopelessly optimistic sentiments, she often thought, considering the lives of hardship most of her patients endured.  A low hum of traditional Irish music emanated from a small radio perched on the counter. Ellie took a deep breath, steeling herself for the day ahead.  Another bout of the flu was sweeping across the island, and old Mrs. Feeney had promised to bring in a "terribly distressed" seagull she'd found near Dún Aonghasa. Just another Tuesday on Inishmore, then. The clang of the ferry horn cut through the morning stillness, signaling the arrival of supplies, tourists, and, no doubt, more ailments needing her attention.
