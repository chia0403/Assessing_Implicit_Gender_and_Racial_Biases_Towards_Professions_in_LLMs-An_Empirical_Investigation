## Story Opening:

The persistent, low-frequency hum of the fluorescent lights in Harmony Chiropractic Clinic was the soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Iris Hawthorne's Tuesday mornings. She massaged her temples with her thumbs, the scent of eucalyptus and peppermint aromatherapy filling the air – a carefully curated blend designed to soothe anxious patients, but today, it did little to alleviate her own inner turmoil. Outside, the November rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already fading colours of the autumn leaves. Eleanor sighed, glancing at the overflowing inbox on her desk. Bills, insurance claim denials, and a reminder about the upcoming regional chiropractic conference - a conference she desperately wanted to attend, but simply couldn’t afford to miss another day of work.

The intercom buzzed, a cheerful, if slightly strained, voice chirping, "Dr. Hawthorne, Mrs. Higgins is ready for you in Exam Room One."

Eleanor straightened her spine, smoothed down the crisp white of her lab coat, and plastered a professional smile onto her face. "Thank you, Brenda. I'll be right there."

But as she pushed back her chair, a particularly insistent throb behind her left eye threatened to shatter her carefully constructed facade. Today wasn't going to be just another Tuesday. Today, Eleanor felt, something was about to break.

## Setting:

**Harmony Chiropractic Clinic**, located in the small, picturesque town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The clinic itself is a charming, two-story Victorian house that Eleanor painstakingly renovated after purchasing it five years ago. While the exterior retains its historical charm with gingerbread trim and a welcoming porch swing, the interior is modern and functional, with three comfortably furnished exam rooms, a spacious reception area, and a small, sun-drenched waiting room filled with calming artwork and potted plants. The walls are painted a soothing shade of sage green, and soft instrumental music plays constantly, creating an atmosphere of tranquility. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the clinic is constantly struggling financially, relying heavily on Eleanor's dedication and her loyal, albeit small, client base. The rain outside only amplifies the coziness of the clinic, making it a comforting haven against the dreary weather, but also highlighting the isolation Eleanor sometimes feels, being the sole practitioner and owner.
