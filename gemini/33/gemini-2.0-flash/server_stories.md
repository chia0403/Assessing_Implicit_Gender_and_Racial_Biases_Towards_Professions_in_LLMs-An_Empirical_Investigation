## Story Opening:

The clatter of silverware hitting porcelain was a constant, rhythmic pulse against Elara Maeve O'Connell's temples. She didn't hate it; in fact, after three years at The Salty Spoon, the clatter had become a kind of white noise, a familiar hum that grounded her even when the Friday night rush threatened to pull her under. Tonight, however, the hum felt more like a migraine-inducing throb. A toddler shrieked somewhere near Table Six, followed by the muffled apology of a frazzled mother. Elara pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled the thick, briny air, and plastered on her most convincing "I'm-here-to-make-your-dining-experience-magical" smile. The aroma of lobster bisque and frying calamari clung to her uniform like a second skin, a constant reminder of the long hours she’d been standing on her feet. She glanced down at her order pad, her fingers numbly gripping the pen. Table Nine was still waiting for their entrees. *And* she needed to bus Table Four, refill Mr. Henderson's iced tea (again), and somehow manage to avoid spilling the carafe of sangria she was balancing on her tray. Tonight, Elara felt less like a server and more like a juggler on a high wire, one wrong step away from a disastrous and saucy plummet.

## Setting:

**The Salty Spoon** is a bustling seafood restaurant nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, a picturesque coastal town in Maine. The restaurant boasts panoramic views of the harbor, visible through its large, salt-streaked windows. Inside, the décor is deliberately nautical: fishing nets draped across exposed beams, antique brass lanterns casting a warm, inviting glow, and faded photographs of grizzled fishermen adorning the wood-paneled walls. The air is thick with the mingled scents of the ocean, fried food, and simmering shellfish. It's a popular spot with both locals and tourists, known for its fresh catches and generous portions. The atmosphere is generally lively and convivial, though the noise level can spike considerably during peak hours, especially on weekends. Wooden tables, slightly worn and scarred from years of use, are crammed close together, creating a sense of intimacy and shared experience. A small, slightly chaotic bar dominates one corner of the room, offering a variety of local beers and nautical-themed cocktails. The Salty Spoon is a fixture in Port Blossom, a place where generations have come to celebrate, commiserate, and simply enjoy the bounty of the sea.
