Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guard named:

**Main Character:** Alistair Thorne

**Setting:**

The Citadel of Veridian Crest perched precariously on the edge of the Whisperwind Cliffs. The wind, a constant, mournful sigh, whipped around its ancient stone walls, carrying the scent of salt and the cries of unseen seabirds. The Citadel wasn't known for its beauty. It was a practical, imposing structure, built to withstand sieges and the relentless erosion of the harsh coastal weather. Its grey stones were etched with the history of a thousand battles, the grim faces of gargoyles glowering down at the churning sea below. Inside, the Citadel was a maze of dimly lit corridors, echoing with the tramp of boots and the clang of steel. Braziers flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that made every corner seem to harbor secrets. The main courtyard was a vast, open space, often shrouded in mist, where recruits drilled and supplies were stockpiled.

**Story Opening:**

Alistair Thorne shifted his weight, the leather of his worn boots creaking softly against the damp stone floor. He hated night duty on the West Wall. The wind, sharp as a shard of ice, clawed at any exposed skin, and the endless, black expanse of the sea was a breeding ground for uneasy thoughts. Tonight, the moon was hidden behind a veil of thick, swirling clouds, leaving the world below shrouded in an inky darkness. He gripped the cold metal of his halberd, its familiar weight a small comfort in the oppressive stillness. For twelve long years, Alistair had stood guard on these very walls, a silent sentinel against threats both real and imagined. He knew every crack in the stone, every gust of wind that promised rain, every unsettling creak of the Citadel's ancient foundations. He told himself it was just the wind tonight, playing tricks on his ears, but a prickling unease crawled up his spine. A different kind of sound. Not the mournful sigh of the wind, but somethingâ€¦ lower. More guttural. It was barely audible, a tremor in the darkness, but Alistair knew it was there. And it was coming from the sea.
