## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the window of the dimly lit office, each drop a mournful drumbeat echoing the hollow ache in Arthur Reginald Finch’s chest. He took another swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste failing to chase away the stale aroma of cigarette smoke and regret that clung to the room like a stubborn ghost. He hadn’t seen a decent case in weeks, just the usual dregs: cheating spouses with too much money and too little imagination, missing cats that were probably already feasting in a nearby alley.

The flickering neon sign outside, spelling out “Finch Investigations” in a perpetually optimistic, but increasingly delusional, glow, hummed a discordant tune. He stubbed out his cigarette, the dwindling pile in the ashtray a testament to another day wasted, another bill unpaid. Just as he was about to succumb to the siren song of another round of solitaire, a knock echoed from the hallway outside. A hesitant, almost apologetic knock. He straightened in his creaky chair, a flicker of something akin to hope sparking in his weary eyes. Maybe, just maybe, the rain was washing away the bad luck.

## Setting:

Arthur Reginald Finch’s office occupied a cramped, second-floor space above a dusty antique shop on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. The walls were painted a drab, institutional green, peeling in places and exposing patches of faded wallpaper adorned with a floral pattern that had seen better days, probably sometime in the 1950s. A stained Persian rug, more threadbare than opulent, covered most of the linoleum floor, doing little to muffle the sounds of the city seeping in.

The furniture consisted of a battered oak desk littered with case files, unpaid bills, and half-eaten sandwiches, a mismatched collection of chairs that looked salvaged from a flea market, and a towering bookshelf overflowing with dog-eared paperbacks, ranging from Dashiell Hammett to dusty volumes on obscure historical events. The only splash of color came from a framed, slightly yellowed photograph of Arthur himself, younger and sporting a full head of hair, shaking hands with the mayor at some forgotten charity event. It was a relic from a bygone era, a reminder of the fleeting moments of success that seemed increasingly distant. A small, perpetually dusty ficus plant in the corner, named Bartholomew, served as Arthur's only companion and a silent witness to his quiet descent into mediocrity.
