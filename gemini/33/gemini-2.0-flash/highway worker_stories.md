Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our highway worker:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of hot asphalt clung to the pre-dawn air like a stubborn burr. Silas James Miller, a man built like a rusted Ford F-250, stretched, his joints popping a symphony of creaks and groans that mirrored the sound of heavy machinery warming up in the distance. The first sliver of dawn was just starting to paint the horizon a bruised purple, highlighting the endless, gray ribbon of Interstate 40 stretching eastward. Silas spat a stream of tobacco juice onto the shoulder, already scarred with the ghosts of countless spills and near misses. He’d seen more than his share of both in his thirty years with the Department of Transportation. Today, though, felt different. There was a stillness to the air, a quiet expectancy that had nothing to do with the usual calm before the morning rush. He felt it prickling at the back of his neck, a silent alarm he couldn’t quite place. Maybe it was just the coffee jitters. Maybe it was something else entirely.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a rural stretch of Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. It's primarily focused on a two-mile section undergoing repaving, where Silas and his crew are working.

**Detailed elements of the setting:**

*   **The Interstate:** A major east-west artery, constantly busy with tractor-trailers, RVs, and cars full of vacationers. The section being repaired is in relatively poor condition, riddled with cracks and potholes.
*   **The Landscape:** Rolling hills covered in dry, golden prairie grass surround the highway. Patches of scrub oak and stunted cedar trees cling to the steeper slopes. In the distance, mesas rise like ancient sentinels, their flat tops catching the first rays of sunlight.
*   **The DOT Work Zone:** A flurry of orange cones, flashing lights, and heavy machinery. The air is thick with the smell of asphalt, diesel fumes, and dust. Dump trucks lumber back and forth, while the rhythmic roar of the paving machine dominates the soundscape.
*   **Silas's Pickup:** An old, dented, and faded red Ford F-250, meticulously maintained and packed with tools, spare parts, and a thermos of strong black coffee. It’s his mobile command center and sanctuary.
*   **The Time:** The story begins just before sunrise in late summer/early autumn, meaning the days are still hot but the nights are starting to cool. The landscape is tinged with the browns and golds of approaching autumn.
*   **A Local Roadside Diner:** The Double Diamond Diner. A small, family-run diner is a few miles off of the interstate.
*   **Weather:** The climate is dry and prone to extremes, with hot summers and cold winters. Dust devils are a common sight, swirling across the open plains. Unexpected thunderstorms can roll in quickly, bringing torrential rain and flash floods.

This setting should provide a solid foundation for your story! Good luck!
