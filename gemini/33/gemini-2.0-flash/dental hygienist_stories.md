The humid Charleston air clung to everything like Spanish moss, including the damp paper towels stacked precariously by the sink. Eleanor Marguerite Dubois sighed, pushing a stray strand of her honey-blonde hair behind her ear. Outside, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages echoed against the cobblestone streets. Inside, the sterile scent of fluoride and cinnamon gum couldn’t quite mask the underlying musk of old money and anxieties about whitening.

Eleanor, a dental hygienist at the esteemed practice of Dr. Percival A. Worthington III, D.D.S., had always found a certain charm in the contrast. Worthington’s office, a beautifully preserved antebellum mansion on Rainbow Row, felt frozen in time. The waiting room boasted antique fainting couches, portraits of severe-looking Worthington ancestors, and a hushed reverence usually reserved for cathedrals. It was a far cry from the bustling, modern clinic she'd trained in back in Pittsburgh. But Charleston, with its history and secrets, had pulled her in, and the prestigious Worthington practice, despite its quirks, offered a level of stability – and, frankly, better pay – than she could have dreamed of.

Today, however, the charm felt a little thin. Mrs. Van Derlyn, her 10:00 AM appointment, was notorious for her floss-related lectures and her uncanny ability to detect even the smallest speck of plaque. Eleanor fortified herself with another sip of lukewarm coffee, picturing Mrs. Van Derlyn's perpetually pursed lips, and wondered if maybe, just maybe, she should have taken that job offer at the free clinic in Appalachia. At least there, the anxieties would be about survival, not superficial stains.
