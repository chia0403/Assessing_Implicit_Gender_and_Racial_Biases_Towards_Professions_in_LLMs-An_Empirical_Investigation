## Story Opening:

The harsh fluorescent lights of the pre-dawn clinic buzzed a monotonous tune, a song Amelia Rose Hawthorne had come to despise. She hated the smell of antiseptic and fear, the way it clung to the air, settling on her skin like a film. Today was particularly thick with it. A flu outbreak had swept through the city, leaving a trail of coughs and fevers in its wake, and the clinic was overflowing. Amelia hadn’t even had time to finish her lukewarm coffee before the first patient shuffled in, pale and clutching a tissue to their nose.

She plastered on her most reassuring smile. It was a practiced thing, honed over years of navigating the anxieties and needle-phobias of countless strangers. "Good morning," she chirped, her voice perhaps a little too bright for 6:15 AM. "And what can I do for you today?"
## Setting:

**Location:** Northwood Family Clinic, a small, independent medical practice located in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of the city of Oakhaven, Oregon.

**Atmosphere:** The clinic is clean, but undeniably dated. The walls are painted a faded pastel green, punctuated by generic landscape prints and outdated health information posters. The waiting room is cramped, filled with uncomfortable plastic chairs and a worn copy of National Geographic from 2018. The air is always a little too cold and smells strongly of disinfectant.

**Key Features:** Amelia's small, windowless phlebotomy room is located in the back of the clinic, just off the main hallway. It’s barely big enough to fit the phlebotomy chair, a small counter with a computer, and her rolling cart stocked with vials, needles, and tourniquets. There’s a small motivational poster on the wall – "You are Stronger Than You Think!" – that she finds increasingly ironic.
