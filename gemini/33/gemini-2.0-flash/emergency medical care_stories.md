## Story Opening:

The siren's wail was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Anya Petrova, but tonight, it felt like a discordant scream. Rain lashed against the ambulance windshield, blurring the already-dim city lights into streaks of neon misery. Anya gripped the steering wheel tighter, the familiar adrenaline thrumming in her veins. Her phone buzzed, displaying the dispatcher's hurried text: *MVA. Multiple victims. I-95 Southbound. Mass casualty incident likely.*

Anya cursed under her breath, her stomach twisting. MVA meant motor vehicle accident, and 'mass casualty incident' meant chaos, pain, and the agonizing reality of triage. She glanced at her partner, paramedic Ben Carter, whose usually cheerful face was set in a grim line. He met her gaze, his eyes mirroring the grim understanding that settled over them.

"Hold on tight, Ben," Anya said, her voice tight, "This is going to be a long night."

## Setting:

**Primary Setting:** The story opens inside a fully-equipped, but slightly worn, ambulance belonging to the Northwood County Emergency Medical Services. It's a stormy night in late October, with heavy rain and strong winds battering the coastal city of Northwood, Connecticut. The ambulance's interior is illuminated by the flickering dashboard lights and the occasional flash of lightning.

**Secondary Setting (Implied):** The story is heading towards a multi-vehicle accident on Interstate 95, a major highway known for its heavy traffic and treacherous conditions, particularly during inclement weather. The incident is located south of Northwood, likely within a few miles, suggested by the urgency of the call and Anya's immediate response.
