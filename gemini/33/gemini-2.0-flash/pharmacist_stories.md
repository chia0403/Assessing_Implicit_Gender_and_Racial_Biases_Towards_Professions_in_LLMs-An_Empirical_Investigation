The bell above the door to "O’Malley's Apothecary and General Goods" tinkled a hesitant greeting, its delicate chime swallowed almost immediately by the roar of the wind howling through the streets of Havenwood. Outside, the November sky was the bruised purple of an overripe plum, spitting out stinging sleet that hammered against the shop's frosted windows. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting scents of chamomile, clove, and something faintly medicinal - the ghost of Lydia O’Malley’s latest concoction.

Lydia herself, Dr. Lydia Eleanor O’Malley, PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the esteemed Harvard University and Havenwood’s only pharmacist for the past fifteen years, didn't even bother looking up. She was hunched over the long, worn wooden counter, meticulously measuring out powdered aconite root onto a small scale, the lamplight reflecting off the lenses of her spectacles and illuminating the fine lines etched around her mouth. The apothecary, her legacy from her late grandfather, Patrick O'Malley, was her sanctuary, a chaotic yet comforting haven against the often-uncomfortable truths she knew about the world and the people within it. She knew every creak in the floorboards, every label on the rows of meticulously organized (and some not so meticulously organized) bottles lining the shelves, and every ailment plaguing the good people of Havenwood. And, tonight, judging by the force of the wind and the urgency in the hesitant chime of the bell, she had a feeling that ailment was going to be more than just the common cold.
