The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, clawing at the thin nylon of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's jacket.

Even the yellow glow emanating from the dimly lit diner felt like a desperate, futile attempt to ward off the encroaching cold. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and stale grease, a smell Izzy had come to associate with long nights and frustrating cases.

The clock above the counter ticked with a maddening rhythm, each second a hammer blow to Izzyâ€™s already frayed nerves. It was 3:17 AM, and the only other patrons were a grizzled trucker nursing a cup of joe and a couple huddled in a booth, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a phone screen. Izzy, seated alone in a vinyl booth near the window, stared out at the deserted street, the rhythmic flash of a broken neon sign painting the scene in strobing streaks of red and blue. The coffee tasted like dishwater, but she gulped it down anyway, hoping it would jumpstart her flagging brain. She was supposed to be home, tucked under a warm blanket, but a murder on the Near North Side had other plans for her. A murder that felt, in its brutal simplicity, disturbingly familiar.
