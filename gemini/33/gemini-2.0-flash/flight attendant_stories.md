The stale air of the Boeing 777 was nothing new to Amelia Rose Kensington. For twelve years, it had been her peculiar brand of oxygen, a mixture of recycled sighs, simmering anxiety, and the faint, metallic tang of jet fuel. She smoothed down the lapels of her crisp, navy uniform, the familiar gesture a calming ritual before the boarding chaos began. Outside, the Miami sun beat down mercilessly on the tarmac, shimmering off the polished fuselage and promising a humid, subtropical onslaught for those passengers venturing beyond the air-conditioned confines of the gate.

Amelia wasn't fond of Miami. The relentless heat clung to her skin like a damp shroud, and the vibrant, often chaotic energy of the city grated on her meticulously organized sensibilities. Give her Seattle, with its soft, misty rains and cozy coffee shops, any day. But today, Miami was just a departure point, the starting line for a sixteen-hour trek across the Atlantic to Dubai. And even though she'd flown the route dozens of times, a small knot of anticipation always tightened in her stomach as the first passengers began to trickle through the doorway, each one a story waiting to unfold at 30,000 feet.
