## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Tax Solutions & More!" buzzed with a nervous energy that mirrored the frantic tapping of Amelia Sarah Davies' foot. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a scorned lover, pelting the frosted window with sleet, a perfect metaphor for the IRS breathing down everyone's neck. It was March 15th, the unofficial panic button day before the looming April deadline, and Amelia hadn't taken a proper lunch break in what felt like a fiscal year.

She squinted at the spreadsheet flickering on her monitor, the numbers swimming before her tired eyes like minnows in a murky pond. Another deduction form, another convoluted expense report. Another desperate plea from a small business owner teetering on the brink. Amelia ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, a few strands escaping to frame her face. She’d started the day with meticulous precision, a warrior armed with a calculator and a stack of legal forms. Now, she felt more like a taxidermied deer caught in the headlights of a semi-truck. The phone rang, its shrill jingle a piercing assault on her already frayed nerves. She hesitated, willing it to stop, but it persisted, a relentless reminder of her calling: to wrestle the beast that was the US tax code into submission.

## Setting:

**Tax Solutions & More!** was nestled in a modest, brick building on a somewhat-down-on-its-luck street in the Avondale neighborhood of Chicago. The storefront was painted a cheerful (but slightly peeling) shade of sunshine yellow, a stark contrast to the gray, gritty reality surrounding it. Inside, the atmosphere was a blend of sterile functionality and haphazard comfort.

The main waiting area was cramped, furnished with mismatched chairs salvaged from various garage sales. A wilting spider plant sat precariously on a wobbly end table next to a stack of dog-eared magazines, mostly outdated issues of *Better Homes & Gardens* and *National Geographic*. A buzzing, ancient coffee machine dispensed lukewarm, questionable brew in chipped ceramic mugs.

Behind the counter, a wall of filing cabinets loomed, crammed with manila folders bursting with financial histories. Amelia's small office, one of three, was tucked away in the back. It was a haven of organized chaos: stacks of receipts teetered on the edge of her desk, alongside carefully labelled boxes overflowing with tax documents from years past. A framed, slightly crooked certificate proclaiming her Enrolled Agent status hung on the wall, a testament to years of hard work and countless hours spent deciphering tax law. A small window looked out onto a bleak alleyway, offering a view of overflowing dumpsters and the occasional scurrying rat – a fitting backdrop to the stressful realities of her profession.
