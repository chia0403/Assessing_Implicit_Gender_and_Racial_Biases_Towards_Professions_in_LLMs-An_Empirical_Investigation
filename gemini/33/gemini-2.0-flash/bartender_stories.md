## The Opening:

The salt-rimmed glass slipped through Elias Thorne's fingers, catching a glint of the dim, amber light that permeated The Mariner's Knot. He swore under his breath, the sound swallowed by the mournful wail of a foghorn emanating from the nearby harbor. Damn the perpetual dampness. It clung to everything in Port Blossom like a lovesick barnacle, especially the glassware. He scrubbed at the stubborn smudge, the familiar rhythm a soothing counterpoint to the growing unease that had been gnawing at him all day.

He glanced at the empty stool at the far end of the bar, the one perpetually warmed by Old Man Hemlock. Hemlock hadn't missed a sunset whiskey in thirty years, not even when his arthritis flared up like a wildfire. His absence today felt like a missing chord in a familiar melody, a subtle discord that vibrated through the very foundations of The Mariner's Knot.

Then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Elias straightened, wiping his hands on his already damp apron, forcing a smile to his lips. Another story looking for a place to land. Another night in Port Blossom, where the secrets were as thick as the fog rolling off the bay.

## The Setting:

**The Mariner's Knot:** A dive bar nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine, a coastal town clinging stubbornly to its fishing roots while slowly succumbing to the lure of tourist dollars. The bar itself is old, weathered like driftwood. Salt-crusted ropes hang haphazardly from the low, beamed ceiling, alongside faded nautical charts and taxidermied fish with vacant, glassy eyes. The air smells perpetually of brine, stale beer, and a faint hint of pipe tobacco.

**Port Blossom, Maine:** A place where the ocean dictates the rhythm of life. The air is thick with the scent of salt and pine. Weather-beaten houses, painted in shades of grey and navy blue, line narrow, winding streets. The harbor is always bustling with fishing boats, their hulls scarred with years of hard labor, and the occasional yacht gleaming with money and privilege. The town is steeped in history, whispers of smugglers and forgotten sea captains clinging to its every corner. It's a place of breathtaking beauty and unsettling secrets, where the past is always just beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed.
