The relentless Florida sun beat down on Mildred McMillan's shoulders as she surveyed the scene. The azure sky, usually a calming backdrop to her day, felt accusingly bright. "Just another Tuesday," she muttered, adjusting her sensible linen blazer. Except, Tuesdays didn't usually involve a pontoon boat, half-submerged in the murky waters of the St. Johns River, its striped awning looking more like a distressed jellyfish than shade.

Mildred, a seasoned insurance agent with All-Risk Assurance for the past fifteen years, knew this particular stretch of the river well. It was a mix of upscale waterfront properties and older, more lived-in bungalows, all vying for a piece of the serene, albeit gator-infested, paradise. The air hung thick with the scent of humidity, sunscreen, and something vaguely fishy. Spanish moss draped from ancient oak trees along the bank, casting long, eerie shadows that danced on the water's surface.

This wasn't her first rodeo with boat insurance claims, not by a long shot. But something about the angle of the sunken vessel, the unnaturally still water around it, and the unsettling lack of any panicked calls before the incident, prickled the back of Mildred's neck. This wasn't just carelessness; this felt...off.
