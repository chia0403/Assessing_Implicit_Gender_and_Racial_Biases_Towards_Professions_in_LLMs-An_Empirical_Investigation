The tremor started in Arthur Penhaligon's left thumb, a tiny, almost imperceptible twitch. He ignored it. Just caffeine withdrawal, he told himself, reaching for the lukewarm, half-empty cup beside his keyboard. Outside, the pre-dawn New York City skyline bled from obsidian to a bruised violet, the nascent light barely piercing the perpetual smog clinging to the city. He took a large gulp of the coffee, the bitter liquid doing little to quell the anxiety gnawing at his gut. The tremor intensified, now a noticeable flutter threatening to knock over the pen precariously balanced on the edge of his desk. Today was going to be a bloodbath. He could feel it in his bones, a low hum of impending doom that had haunted his sleep for the last three nights.

A triple monitor setup glowed with charts and graphs, a digital Rosetta Stone only Arthur truly understood. Motivational posters, relics from various corporate wellness initiatives, hung askew on the beige walls, a constant reminder of the aspirational heights he hadn’t yet reached. The air, thick with stale coffee and the faint metallic tang of desperation, vibrated with the low hum of the trading floor just beyond the glass partition, a constant, pulsating heartbeat of greed and fear.
