Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist named Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, thick and honeyed, slanted through the dusty Venetian blinds of Eleanor Vance's office. The building, a converted brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined street in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, held a mix of therapists, lawyers specializing in family law, and a single, fiercely independent acupuncturist. The air inside was perpetually hushed, a sanctuary from the city's relentless cacophony. Eleanor's office, in particular, was designed for calm: muted green walls, a worn but comfortable armchair upholstered in a botanical print, and a small, bubbling fountain in the corner that gurgled like a sleepy stream. Bookshelves overflowed with volumes on trauma, cognitive behavioral therapy, and, tucked away on the bottom shelf, a surprising collection of vintage detective novels.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist of forty-two years, watched Mrs. Davidoff's manicured nails tap a restless rhythm against her designer handbag. Outside, a siren wailed, briefly piercing the office's tranquility before fading back into the city's background noise.

"So, Mrs. Davidoff," Eleanor said gently, adjusting her wire-rimmed glasses. "Tell me again why you feel you can't possibly attend your daughter's wedding."

Mrs. Davidoff stopped tapping, her perfectly sculpted eyebrows furrowing. "Eleanor, darling," she said, her voice a breathy whisper. "You simply don't understand. The flowersâ€¦ the *flowers* are the wrong shade of pink. Not even close. They're practically salmon. Salmon! And you know what salmon symbolizes, don't you? Illness. Decay. It's a sign, Eleanor, a terrible, terrible sign." She dabbed at the corner of her eyes with a silk scarf. "I can't possibly subject myself to such a blatant omen. It would ruin everything."

Eleanor suppressed a sigh. This was Mrs. Davidoff's seventh crisis this month, and the third involving allegedly offensive floral arrangements. A more cynical therapist might see it as mere manipulation. Eleanor, however, saw a desperate woman clinging to the familiar structure of anxiety in a life spiraling out of her control. She steepled her fingers, took a deep breath, and prepared to navigate the treacherous waters of floral symbolism and the impending doom of a salmon-colored omen. This was, after all, just another Tuesday.
