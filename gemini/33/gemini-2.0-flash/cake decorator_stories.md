## Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Esme Beatrice Willowbrook hummed along to the tinny melody escaping the ancient radio perched precariously on a stack of flour sacks. She wasn't particularly fond of polka music, but it was the only station that came in clearly in the back of "A Piece of Cake," and frankly, she needed the distraction. The buttercream, bless its sugary heart, was proving particularly stubborn this morning, refusing to hold the delicate swirls she envisioned for Mrs. Henderson's Golden Anniversary cake. A bead of sweat trickled down Esme's temple, clinging to a stray wisp of auburn hair that had escaped her bandana. She squinted at the offending pastry bag, her lips pursed in a way that suggested a serious battle of wills was about to commence. Just then, the bell above the shop's door jingled, a cheerful sound that sliced through the polka and momentarily broke Esme's concentration.

**Setting:**

"A Piece of Cake" was a haven of sugary delights tucked away on Primrose Lane in the small, impossibly charming town of Havenwood. It was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, and the local gossip spread faster than a freshly frosted cupcake. The shop itself was a symphony of pastel hues: pale pink walls adorned with framed, slightly faded photographs of past creations; mint green display cases overflowing with cookies, scones, and miniature cheesecakes; and sunshine yellow countertops worn smooth with years of flour and sugary spills. The air always smelled of vanilla, cinnamon, and something indefinablyâ€¦ comforting. In the back, Esme's domain was a whirlwind of stainless steel bowls, pastry bags of every conceivable size, and stacks upon stacks of cake pans. From the front window, one could see the rolling green hills surrounding Havenwood, dotted with grazing sheep and the occasional antique tractor. It was a picture-perfect scene, almost too good to be true, a place where, for a brief moment, the world seemed a little bit sweeter, thanks to Esme and "A Piece of Cake."
