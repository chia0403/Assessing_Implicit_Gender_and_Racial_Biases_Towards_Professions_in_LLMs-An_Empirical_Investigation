## Story Opening & Setting:

The scent of lavender and lemon pledge hung thick in the air, a cloying perfume that did little to mask the stale, lingering aroma of old money and fading dreams. Mrs. Eloise Plumtree, all five foot two of her wrapped in a sensible floral apron, sighed and continued her Sisyphean task of dusting the miniature porcelain figurines that lined the mantelpiece. Each cherubic face and gilded wing had to be treated with reverence, a task that felt increasingly ridiculous considering the layer of dust, thick as a shroud, that seemed to coat everything else in the grand, decaying Victorian mansion.

The setting was Oakhaven Manor, nestled deep within the overgrown estate grounds of Blackwood Creek, Massachusetts. Once the pride of a shipping magnate, it was now the inherited burden of the reclusive and eccentric Miss Abigail Blackwood, who rarely emerged from her upstairs study and communicated almost exclusively through handwritten notes slipped under the housekeeper's door. The house itself was a gothic monstrosity of turrets, stained glass, and echoing hallways, filled with portraits of stern-faced ancestors and furniture so heavy it felt permanently anchored to the past. The grand ballroom, unused for decades, held a melancholic silence that pressed down on Eloise like a physical weight. Oakhaven Manor was a place where time felt stagnant, where the echoes of forgotten parties and unspoken secrets lingered in the shadows, and Eloise, the unassuming housekeeper, was its only witness.
