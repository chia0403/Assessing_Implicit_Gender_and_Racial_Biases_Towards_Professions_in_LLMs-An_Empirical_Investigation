The fluorescent lights of McKinley High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the window of her cramped office, blurring the already faded view of the football field.  Eleanor, whose perfectly coiffed auburn hair seemed to defy the damp air, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm tea against her teeth.  Scattered across her desk were college pamphlets promising sun-drenched campuses and futures brighter than the overcast Ohio sky currently on offer.  October in Ashtabula was always like this: grey, wet, and tinged with the melancholy of fading summer dreams. This year, however, the melancholy felt heavier, clinging to the hallways like the scent of stale pizza from the cafeteria.  Eleanor had a feeling this wasn't just the usual pre-winter blues; something else was unsettling the students of McKinley High, something lurking beneath the surface of standardized tests and college applications.
