Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's consulting room, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The opulent, yet tastefully understated office, located on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the heart of Georgetown, usually brought her a sense of calm. Tonight, however, the scent of jasmine from the diffuser and the soothing hum of the white noise machine did little to quell the unease tightening in her chest.  Her last client, a senator’s wife obsessed with kale smoothies and activated almonds, had left twenty minutes ago, but the woman's dismissive wave and patronizing tone still prickled at Eleanor. It wasn’t the first time a client had treated her prescribed nutritional plan as a frivolous suggestion rather than a path to genuine well-being.  Eleanor, who held a PhD in Nutritional Biochemistry and had dedicated her life to the intricate dance between food and health, found the casual disregard infuriating.  Beyond the windows, the already darkening November sky was bleeding into a premature night, reflecting the growing shadows of doubt that were beginning to creep into Eleanor's usually unwavering faith in her chosen profession.
