The bell above the door of "Nailed It," jingled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the thunderstorm raging outside. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and turning the street into a shimmering, black river.  Inside, the salon was a haven of warm peach walls, the air thick with the scent of acetone and something vaguely floral.  Eleanor Vance, her burgundy bob perfectly coiffed, sighed and glanced at the clock. 7:53 pm. Almost closing time, and not a soul in sight except for Mrs. Higgins, who was snoring softly under the UV lamp, her newly gelled nails gleaming like iridescent beetles. Eleanor hoped the downpour wouldn't discourage her last appointment, a new client whoâ€™d booked a full set of acrylics. She'd meticulously laid out her best brushes, the tiny pots of glitter and iridescent powders shimmering under the warm glow of the salon lamps, ready to create a masterpiece.
