The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday evening.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating endlessly on the metal rollers. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, leaned against the counter, chewing on the end of a pen.  The Quick Stop, perched on the edge of Highway 17 just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Virginia, was rarely busy this late, especially not on a weeknight like this.  The only other person in the store was a trucker, hunched over a cup of instant ramen at a sticky table in the corner. He looked like he hadnâ€™t slept in days.  The digital clock above the lottery tickets blinked 11:57 pm. Three minutes until she could lock up and escape the sterile, brightly lit purgatory that was her current reality.
