The bell above the door to "Petal & Plume" tinkled merrily, announcing a customer just as Elara Thistlewick pricked her thumb on a rose thorn.  Crimson welled, a stark contrast to the creamy blush of the 'Patience' rose she was preparing for Mrs. Henderson's anniversary bouquet.  Elara sucked on her thumb, wincing.  Outside, the late April air in the small town of Oakhaven, Oregon hung heavy with the scent of rain and blooming dogwood.  Petal & Plume, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a bustling bakery, was a riot of color and fragrance.  Buckets overflowing with tulips, lilies, and hyacinths lined the walls, their vibrant hues echoing the brightly painted shelves stacked with vintage watering cans and gardening books. Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the intricate web of macrame plant hangers Elara had painstakingly crafted.
