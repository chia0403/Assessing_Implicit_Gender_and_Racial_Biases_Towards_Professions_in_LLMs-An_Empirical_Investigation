The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the dashboard to a temperature only lizards could love. Dust devils danced across the shimmering asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," living up to its name.  Inside,  Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, her knuckles permanently stained with grease and road grime.  The air conditioning in the rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," had given up the ghost somewhere around Fallon, leaving Bea to swelter in the desert heat. Her only companions were the endless highway stretching out before her, the mournful wail of country music on the radio, and the eighteen wheels rolling beneath her, carrying a load of frozen pizzas bound for Ely.  The digital clock on the dash blinked 1:17 PM, a stark reminder that she was still hours away from her destination and a cold shower.  But Bea didn't mind much.  The loneliness, the vastness, the hum of the engine â€“ it was all home to her.
