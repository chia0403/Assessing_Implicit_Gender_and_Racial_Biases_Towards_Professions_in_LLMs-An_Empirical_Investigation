The only other sound was the incessant drip, drip, drip of a leak in the ceiling, forming a steadily growing puddle in the chipped porcelain wastebasket beneath it.  It was 7:17 pm on a Friday night, and Amelia was supposed to be at happy hour with her best friend, Chloe.  Instead, she was hunting for a misplaced semicolon in a sixty-page motion for summary judgment, a document as thrilling as watching paint dry, and twice as tedious. This, she thought with a sigh, was not how she’d envisioned her legal career unfolding.
