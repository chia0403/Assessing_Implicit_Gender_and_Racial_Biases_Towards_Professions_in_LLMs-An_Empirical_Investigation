The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of snow and diesel from the idling freighters.  Inside the perpetually dim waiting room of the Mercy Clinic, flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped linoleum floor.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, PA-C, shivered despite her thick fleece jacket, rubbing her hands together as she watched the clock tick towards 7:00 AM. Another Monday morning in the trenches of Chicago's South Side, and already the waiting room was half-full, a tapestry of coughs, sniffles, and weary faces.  Amy braced herself. It was going to be a long one.
