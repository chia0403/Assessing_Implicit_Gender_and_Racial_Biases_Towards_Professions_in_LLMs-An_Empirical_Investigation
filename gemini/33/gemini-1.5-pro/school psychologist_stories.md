The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the frost-covered quad of Ashwood Preparatory Academy.  Gargoyles perched on the gothic stone buildings seemed to sneer down at her, their granite lips curled into expressions of perpetual disdain. Dead leaves skittered across the flagstone paths like fleeing rodents, and the towering oaks that ringed the campus creaked and groaned, their bare branches clawing at the steely grey sky.
