The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&L Architectural firm buzzed in Amelia Hayes' ears, a constant, irritating companion to the whisper of her pencil gliding across the vellum.  It was a Thursday in late October, the kind of day where the sun seemed hesitant to fully commit, leaving the Chicago sky a bruised, purplish-grey. Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking the churning grey waters of Lake Michigan, each drop a tiny, percussive note against the glass. Amelia, hunched over her drafting table in a corner cubicle, barely registered the tempest outside. Her entire world was contained within the precise lines and angles of the blueprint before her, a sprawling estate nestled in the fictional hills of a video game world.  Each stroke of her 0.5mm lead brought the sprawling digital mansion to life, from the meticulously rendered balustrades on the balconies to the intricate mosaic patterns on the courtyard floor.  This wasn't the gleaming skyscrapers or sleek, modern homes sheâ€™d envisioned designing when she graduated.  No, Amelia Hayes, architectural prodigy, was currently drawing pixelated shrubbery for a fantasy RPG called "Kingdoms of Eldoria."
