The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital west wing cast long, skeletal shadows across the freshly-mopped linoleum floor.  Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, leaned against the handle of his industrial mop bucket, letting the silence soak in. It was 3:17 AM, the quietest hour in the bustling hospital, a time when even the ghosts seemed to be sleeping.

The air smelled faintly of disinfectant and something else, something subtly metallic, that Elias couldn't quite place.  He pushed himself off the bucket, the wheels squeaking softly in protest, and moved towards the darkened operating rooms, a single key jangling on his belt. Tonight, his routine cleaning held a strange, unsettling edge.
