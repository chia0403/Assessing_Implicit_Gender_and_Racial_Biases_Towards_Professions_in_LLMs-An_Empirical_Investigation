Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Reyes's apartment, blurring the already fading London skyline into a watercolour of greys and oranges. The Shard, usually a piercing spear of glass, was now a ghostly apparition, swallowed by the swirling mist. Inside, the minimalist space, a testament to Amelia's architectural sensibilities, felt sterile and cold. Polished concrete floors reflected the flickering light of a single designer lamp, highlighting the stark white walls and the almost unsettling lack of clutter. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, stared out at the storm, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hand. The rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the ceramic echoed the relentless drumming of the rain, a counterpoint to the disquiet gnawing at her. This was the third night in a row she’d found herself unable to sleep, haunted by the blueprints spread across her drafting table – blueprints for a building that threatened to shatter her carefully constructed world.
