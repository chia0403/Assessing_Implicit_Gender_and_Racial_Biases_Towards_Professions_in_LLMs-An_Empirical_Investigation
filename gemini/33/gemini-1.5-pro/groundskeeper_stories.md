The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his tweed cap and rustling the browning leaves clinging precariously to the ancient oak trees.  Frost crunched beneath his worn leather boots as he traversed the sprawling grounds of Eventide Manor, a gothic monstrosity that hunched against the bruised, twilight sky like a slumbering gargoyle.  Built of grey stone that seemed to absorb the very light around it, the manor exuded an air of melancholy, a perpetual autumn even in the height of summer.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every twist of its ivy-choked pathways, every hidden nook in its sprawling gardens, and every creak and groan of its aging timbers. He felt a peculiar kinship with the place, a shared sense of quiet resilience in the face of time's relentless march. This evening, however, a different kind of chill hung in the air, something beyond the usual November bite. It settled deep in his bones, a premonition of something unsettling to come.
