The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the second-story window of Elias Finch's tailoring shop.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the panes, illuminating bolts of fabric in vibrant hues of emerald, sapphire, and ruby.  Elias, perched on his stool, a half-finished waistcoat draped over his lap, meticulously stitched a row of pearl buttons onto a midnight-blue velvet collar.  His shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a somewhat dubious apothecary on Candlewick Lane, in the heart of the perpetually fog-shrouded city of Aethelburg, was a haven of quiet amidst the urban clamor.  Scissors, needles, and thimbles lay scattered across his worn workbench, a testament to his meticulous craft.  The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, linen, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Peabody's cinnamon rolls from next door.  This was Elias's world, a world of precise measurements, intricate patterns, and the quiet satisfaction of transforming raw materials into garments of exquisite beauty.  But the calm of his sanctuary was about to be shattered.
