The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a din that usually faded into the background noise for Elias Thorne, but tonight it felt like an angry drummer keeping time with his churning thoughts. The Mug, nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, Oregon, was a haven for fishermen, lumberjacks, and the occasional lost tourist, drawn in by the promise of cheap beer and Elias’s famously strong hand with a whiskey sour.  The air inside was thick with the scent of brine, sawdust, and stale cigarette smoke, a comforting blend that usually settled Elias’s nerves. But tonight, even the familiar aroma couldn't quell the unease twisting in his gut.  The wind howled outside, rattling the single, grime-streaked window overlooking the deserted marina, and Elias rubbed the back of his tattooed hand across his weathered face, a flicker of worry lighting his hazel eyes.  It was almost midnight, well past closing time, but Elias found himself lingering, wiping down the sticky mahogany bartop for the tenth time, unable to shake the feeling that something was about to happen.
