The flickering neon sign of "A1 Tax Prep," casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked asphalt, was the only bright spot on Elm Street. Inside, Amelia Pearl Hawthorne, CPA, hunched over a mountain of 1040s, her brow furrowed in a mix of concentration and caffeine-induced anxiety.  April 14th loomed like a guillotine, and the stale air of her cramped office was thick with the scent of cheap coffee, desperation, and the faint, lingering aroma of a client’s questionable perfume.  Port Blossom, Oregon, a town whose main industries were fishing and forgetting, didn’t exactly attract high-rolling clientele. Amelia mostly dealt with fishermen who spoke primarily in grunts and deductions, retirees clinging to fixed incomes, and the occasional bewildered tourist who’d somehow ended up owing the state of Oregon a significant chunk of their vacation fund.  This year, however, felt different.  A strange tension hung in the air, a palpable sense of unease that went beyond the usual tax-season frenzy.
