The rusted pipe groaned like a grumpy badger woken from a long nap.  A trickle, then a steady stream, then a gushing torrent erupted from the elbow joint, spraying frigid water across Agnes Periwinkle's face.  Agnes, her wren-like frame swallowed by an oversized pair of dungarees, sputtered and swore under her breath, a string of surprisingly colorful metaphors for a woman who usually reserved her creative language for particularly stubborn drain clogs.  This, however, was no ordinary clog.  This was the plumbing equivalent of a declaration of war.

The basement of the old Victorian on Hemlock Lane was a dim, subterranean world lit by a single bare bulb that swung precariously from a rafter.  Dust motes danced in the watery light, illuminating cobwebs thick as shrouds and a jumble of discarded furniture draped in ghostly white sheets.  The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of old pipes. This wasn't Agnes's usual sort of job – fixing leaky faucets in suburban kitchens and unclogging toilets in tidy bathrooms.  This was…different.  This felt ancient, and a little bit unsettling.
