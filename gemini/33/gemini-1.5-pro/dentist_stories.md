The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled street, her breath clouding the air in front of her.  The wrought-iron streetlamps of Port Blossom, Maine, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swaying branches of the ancient elms lining the harbor.  The salty tang of the sea mingled with the sweet, decaying scent of fallen leaves, a peculiar perfume that always signaled the arrival of late autumn in this quaint, seaside town.  Eleanor clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the instruments within clinking softly, a familiar lullaby against the backdrop of the restless ocean.  Tonight, her last patient was waiting, and the thought of the warm fire in her waiting room, and a steaming cup of tea afterwards, spurred her onward.  The shingle above the door of her practice, "Vance Family Dentistry, Est. 1910," creaked gently in the wind, a welcoming sound that had greeted generations of Port Blossom residents with both apprehension and relief.  The light spilling from the frosted glass windows painted a warm rectangle on the otherwise darkening street, a beacon against the encroaching gloom.
