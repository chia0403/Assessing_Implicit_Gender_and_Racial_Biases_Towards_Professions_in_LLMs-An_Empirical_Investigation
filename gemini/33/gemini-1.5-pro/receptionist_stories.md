The insistent chirping of the intercom sliced through the stagnant air of the waiting room, a jarring counterpoint to the soothing strains of panpipe music tinkling from hidden speakers.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag pinned precisely to the lapel of her crisp navy blazer, sighed and pressed the button.  “Good morning, Dr. Albright’s office, this is Eleanor speaking. How may I help you?”

The waiting room of Albright, Pettigrew, and Chastain Dermatology, nestled in a converted Victorian on a tree-lined street in Savannah, Georgia, exuded an air of faded Southern grandeur.  Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting magnolias and hummingbirds, cast kaleidoscopic patterns across the worn Persian rug.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and the overly sweet potpourri Eleanor meticulously refreshed every Monday morning.  Antique furniture, upholstered in a floral chintz that had seen better days, offered seating for the patients, although most preferred to stand, flipping through outdated copies of Southern Living, nervously avoiding eye contact.
