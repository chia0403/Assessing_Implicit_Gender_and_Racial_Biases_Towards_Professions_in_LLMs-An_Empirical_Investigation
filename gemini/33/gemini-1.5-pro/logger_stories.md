The biting pre-dawn chill gnawed at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's exposed cheeks, turning them a raw, stinging red.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he trudged across the logging camp clearing towards the mess hall, the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke thick in the air.  Camp Hemlock, nestled deep within the Klamath Mountains of northern California, was a rough-hewn collection of canvas tents, corrugated iron sheds, and hastily built wooden cabins, all clinging precariously to the steep mountainside like a bird's nest in a gale. Towering Douglas firs, their tops lost in the swirling mist, formed a dense, watchful ring around the camp, their silence broken only by the mournful hoot of an owl and the distant rumble of the Eel River carving its path through the valley below.  Winter had arrived early this year, painting the landscape in shades of grey and white, and promising a hard season ahead for the men who wrestled their living from the ancient forest.
