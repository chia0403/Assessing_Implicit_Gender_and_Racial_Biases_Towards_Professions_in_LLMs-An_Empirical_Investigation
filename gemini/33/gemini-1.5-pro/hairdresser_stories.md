The aroma of burnt sugar and coconut clung to the air in Clementine's Curl Up & Dye, a cozy salon tucked between Mrs. Higgins' perpetually dusty antique shop and Mr. O'Malley's boisterous Irish pub on Sycamore Street.  Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the reflection of Evangeline "Evie" Rose Hawthorne, the salon's owner and sole stylist.  Evie, a whirlwind of fiery red curls and freckled energy, hummed along to a Motown classic as she swept up clipped ends of blonde hair.  The late afternoon lull had settled in, a welcome respite after a morning rush of prom updos and root touch-ups.  The only other occupant of the salon was a wilting peace lily in the corner, its drooping leaves mirroring Evieâ€™s own slight weariness.  Little did she know, the quiet was about to be shattered.
