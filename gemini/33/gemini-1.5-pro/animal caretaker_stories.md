The biting November wind whipped across the salt-laced cliffs, carrying the raucous cries of gulls and the distant, mournful bellow of a foghorn.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the marine mammal rescue center, a lonely sentinel perched on the edge of the world. Inside, Amelia "Milly"  Corvus, her hands chapped raw from the cold and seawater, hunched over a stainless steel tub, patiently coaxing a shivering harbor seal pup to swallow a syringe full of electrolytes. The pup, barely a week old and abandoned by its mother, whimpered softly, its large, dark eyes fixed trustingly on Milly’s face.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long shadows across the concrete floor, highlighting the peeling paint and the faded posters of dolphins leaping through turquoise waves – a stark contrast to the grey, turbulent reality outside.  The scent of fish, antiseptic, and damp wool permeated the air, a familiar comfort to Milly, a smell that meant home.
