The wind, sharp and insistent as a chisel, whipped across the high plateau, carrying the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of snow.  Beneath the bruised purple sky, the village of Whisperstone clung to the mountainside like a lichen patch. Its houses, built from the very rock they inhabited, huddled together for warmth, their slate roofs slick with a glaze of ice. Here, in the shadow of Mount Cinderfall, Elias Thorne, his fingers rough and calloused as granite, earned his living.  He was a stone cutter, his life measured in the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel, in the slow, patient unveiling of the beauty hidden within the heart of the mountain. This morning, however, the rhythm was broken. A strange stillness had settled over Whisperstone, a silence deeper than the usual hush before a winter storm.  Elias, standing at the mouth of his workshop – a cave carved into the cliff face, its entrance framed by a lintel of intricately carved ravens – felt a prickle of unease crawl down his spine.  Something was different. Something was wrong.
