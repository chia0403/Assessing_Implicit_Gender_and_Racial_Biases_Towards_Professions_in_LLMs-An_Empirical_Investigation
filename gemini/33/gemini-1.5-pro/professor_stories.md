The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, tugging at the edges of his tweed jacket as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles, slick with rain, leered down from the medieval stonework, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oak in the center of the quad rattled like dry bones.  Alistair clutched a stack of essays close to his chest, their weight a small comfort against the pervasive chill.  The buttery lights spilling from the windows of the surrounding buildings offered a promise of warmth and the comforting aroma of old books, a stark contrast to the unsettling sense of foreboding that clung to the damp air.  This evening, however, the sanctuary of his study held no appeal.  Alistair was late, and the reason for his tardiness was far more disconcerting than a forgotten lecture.  He was on his way to a meeting, a clandestine meeting, in the shadowed depths of the Bodleian Library, and the contents of the anonymous note crumpled in his pocket weighed heavier than any stack of student papers.
