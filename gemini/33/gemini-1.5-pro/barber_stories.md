The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, almost theatrical glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Grimshaw Alley. It was the kind of alley where cats convened clandestine meetings, and the only other businesses were a purveyor of dubious antiques and a fortune teller who claimed to speak fluent Etruscan.  Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose face resembled a kindly walnut, stood in the doorway of his shop, watching the downpour turn the alley into a shimmering black canal.  He wore a pristine white barberâ€™s coat, despite the hour being well past midnight, and a single, meticulously sculpted eyebrow arched above the rim of his spectacles.  Inside, the single lamp above his barber chair illuminated a collection of gleaming cut-throat razors, silver-handled brushes, and tonics in bottles of every conceivable size and hue.  Tonight, however, Finnian wasn't expecting any customers. Tonight, he was waiting for something else entirely.
