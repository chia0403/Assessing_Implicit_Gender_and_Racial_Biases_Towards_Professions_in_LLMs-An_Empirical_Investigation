Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions.  Eleanor Vance, a pharmaceutical sales representative for Hemlock Pharmaceuticals, hunched deeper into her booth, the vinyl clinging uncomfortably to her crisp navy suit. She stirred her lukewarm coffee, the clatter of her spoon a stark counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Her sample case, gleaming black and emblazoned with the Hemlock logo, sat on the seat beside her, a silent testament to the dayâ€™s fruitless calls on doctors across the sprawling, rain-soaked expanse of rural Indiana.  It was nearly 7 pm, and Eleanor was miles off schedule, her carefully planned route derailed by a flash flood that had transformed a backcountry road into a raging brown river. The diner, a lone beacon in the gloom, was her only refuge.  She was due in Indianapolis by morning for a crucial meeting, a meeting that could make or break her career, but outside, the storm showed no sign of abating.
