The clatter of pots and pans was Evelyn Rose Hawthorne's morning symphony.  The pre-dawn light, a pale lavender filtering through the grimy windows of the Salty Spoon Diner, illuminated motes of flour dancing in the air.  Evelyn, her auburn hair tucked haphazardly beneath a stained white bandana, hummed along to the rhythmic sizzle of bacon on the flattop. The Salty Spoon, nestled between a pawn shop and a laundromat on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Arizona, wasn't glamorous, but it was Evelyn's kingdom.  Here, amidst the cracked vinyl booths and perpetually sticky counter, she ruled with a spatula and a generous dash of salt, feeding the souls of truckers, cowboys, and the occasional lost wanderer who stumbled upon this unlikely oasis. The air hung thick with the scent of coffee, frying potatoes, and something indefinably comforting â€“ the aroma of home, even if it was a slightly greasy, slightly dusty one.
