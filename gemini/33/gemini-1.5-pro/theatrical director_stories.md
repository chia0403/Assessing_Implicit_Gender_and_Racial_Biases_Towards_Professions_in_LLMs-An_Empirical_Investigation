The chipped paint on the proscenium arch of the Rialto Theatre seemed to sigh every time the wind rattled the ancient building.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from Shakespeare, blurring the already faded images of star-crossed lovers and vengeful kings. Inside, the only illumination came from a single bare bulb dangling precariously over the stage, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the dust motes.  This was the kingdom of Elias Thorne, a man whose passion for theatre burned brighter than any spotlight, even in a place as dilapidated as this.  He paced the worn boards, the script of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" clutched in his hand like a lifeline, a furrow etched deep between his dark brows. The first rehearsal was tomorrow, and the reality of staging Shakespeare in a theatre on the verge of collapse was finally sinking in.  The air smelled of damp wood and forgotten dreams, a fitting aroma for a production that felt both exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.
