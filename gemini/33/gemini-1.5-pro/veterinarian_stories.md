The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic and sending a shiver down the spine of a particularly anxious tabby perched on the examination table.  The clinic, nestled between a perpetually closed fish and chips shop and Mrs. O'Malley's overflowing second-hand bookstore, was the only splash of cheerful yellow on the otherwise grey, granite-built main street of Port Blossom, Newfoundland.  Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of antiseptic, wet dog fur, and the faint, lingering aroma of the cinnamon rolls Elias had baked that morning.  Snow dusted the window panes, obscuring the view of the churning, iron-grey sea beyond, but the rhythmic crash of waves against the harbour wall provided a constant, almost hypnotic backdrop to the morning's consultations.
