Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Hayes’ small office, blurring the lights of downtown Portland into impressionistic streaks of gold and crimson.  The rhythmic tapping, usually a soothing soundtrack to her client consultations, felt oppressive tonight. Amelia Dubois-Hayes, Registered Dietitian, tapped her pen against her worn notepad, the faint *click-click-click* counterpointing the downpour.  Her last appointment, a perpetually stressed marketing executive named Mr. Henderson, had cancelled last minute, leaving Amelia with an unexpected hour of quiet before closing up her practice, “Nourish Well,” for the night.  The small, brightly coloured office, tucked away above a bustling Italian deli, usually hummed with the energy of Amelia’s passion for healthy living. Tonight, however, the air hung heavy with the scent of oregano from downstairs and the lingering aroma of Mr. Henderson’s habitual peppermint tea.  A single lamp illuminated the diplomas and nutrition charts adorning the wall, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering streetlights outside.
