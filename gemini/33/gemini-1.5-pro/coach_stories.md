The biting November wind whipped around Coach Amelia Josephine “Amy Jo” Bellweather, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She squinted against the swirling snowflakes, her breath clouding the air as she surveyed the ramshackle ice rink nestled at the bottom of Widowmaker Hill in the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, Vermont.  The rink, a testament to the town’s dwindling resources and unwavering hockey spirit, was little more than a frozen-over pond bordered by uneven planks of wood, a single, flickering floodlight casting long, skeletal shadows across the cracked ice.  The bleachers, haphazardly constructed from salvaged lumber, were empty save for a lone, shivering squirrel huddled beneath a threadbare blanket. Amy Jo tightened the drawstrings on her faded Hollow Creek Huskies jacket, a familiar knot forming in her stomach.  This wasn’t exactly the glorious return to coaching she'd envisioned.
