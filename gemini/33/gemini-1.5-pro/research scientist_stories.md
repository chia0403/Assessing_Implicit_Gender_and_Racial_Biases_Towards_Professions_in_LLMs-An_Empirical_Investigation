The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  Ice crystals, fine as diamond dust, glittered in the perpetual twilight that cloaked the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This desolate landscape, the closest thing Earth had to Mars, was Evelyn's laboratory. For the past six months, she'd been stationed at the newly established  Lake Vida Research Station, a cluster of prefabricated modules huddled against the flank of the Transantarctic Mountains.  Her mission: to study the extremophile microbes thriving in the super-salty, subglacial Lake Vida, a hidden world sealed beneath twenty meters of ice for potentially millions of years.  This wasn't just about understanding life in extreme environments; Evelyn believed the secrets locked within the lake held clues to the very origins of life on Earth, and perhaps, the possibility of life beyond.  But something unexpected had surfaced, something far more significant than ancient microbes. And it wasn't waiting patiently beneath the ice.
