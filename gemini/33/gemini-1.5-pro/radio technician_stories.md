The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the Shetland Islands Broadcasting station and stinging Elias Thorne’s cheeks.  Sleet, half-frozen rain, plastered his thick wool coat as he trudged across the windswept moor towards the squat, grey building.  The only light for miles, a flickering fluorescent bulb in the reception area, cast a sickly yellow glow onto the desolate landscape. November in Skerries was brutal, and tonight, it felt especially so. The generator was acting up again, a persistent, throbbing hum that was bleeding into the normally crisp signal broadcasting across the archipelago. Elias, the station's sole radio technician, had been summoned from a rare night of warmth and whisky by a panicked call from Maggie, the late-night DJ whose soothing voice was usually the only comfort against the howling gales.  Tonight, however, even Maggie sounded frayed.  The interference was getting worse, she’d said, almost a shriek, and there was a storm brewing.  A big one.
