Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of Edinburgh's brooding sky. The city, usually cloaked in a romantic mist, tonight wore a more sinister shroud.  Gargoyles perched on the medieval buildings seemed to leer down at the slick, cobbled streets below, their stony faces reflecting the flickering gaslight. Inside, Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, traced the outline of a particularly gruesome crime scene photo spread across her antique desk.  The victim, a renowned historian, lay sprawled amidst scattered manuscripts, a single, obsidian raven feather resting upon his chest. The chilling tableau, set against the backdrop of a centuries-old library, was the third such murder in as many months, and Eleanor, Edinburgh's leading forensic psychologist, felt the familiar prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  This wasn't just a killer; it was a statement. A dark, macabre performance orchestrated with a theatrical flair that hinted at a mind as twisted as the city's narrow, winding closes.
