The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia "Ana" Volkov as she stood perched precariously on a crumbling stone wall overlooking the churning Irish Sea. Grey clouds, heavy with unshed rain, scudded low across the sky, mirroring the turbulent emotions brewing within her.  Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry, Ireland. A place most tourists saw as a postcard-perfect haven of rolling green hills and charming pubs. For Ana, it was the setting for her cinematic resurrection â€“ or perhaps her final, spectacular downfall.  "The Banshee's Lament," her ambitious comeback film after a five-year hiatus, was finally in pre-production.  The budget was tight, the local crew was skeptical, and the lead actress was already threatening to walk if she didn't get a bigger trailer.  But the rugged, windswept beauty of the location was exactly what Ana had envisioned.  This desolate, dramatic landscape held the key to unlocking the dark, Celtic folklore at the heart of her story.  And Ana, despite the gnawing doubt in her gut, was determined to capture it all on film.
