The biting wind whipped across the tarmac, stinging Amelia "Mia" Reyes's cheeks and tugging at the edges of her flight suit.  Above, the Alaskan sky bled bruised purples and angry oranges, a breathtaking but ominous canvas foreshadowing the approaching winter storm. Mia adjusted her headset, the cold metal a shock against her ear, and ran a gloved hand over the nose of her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver.  Lake Hood Seaplane Base, a chaotic ballet of buzzing floatplanes and seasoned bush pilots, stretched out behind her.  The smell of aviation fuel mingled with the crisp scent of pine and the faint, fishy tang of Cook Inlet.  Tonight's flight to the remote fishing village of Ninilchik was essential, carrying vital medical supplies that wouldn't survive the impending blizzard.  Mia glanced at her watch.  Sunset was less than an hour away, and the first flakes of snow were already beginning to fall.  Time to go.
