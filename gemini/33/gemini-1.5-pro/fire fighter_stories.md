The smell of burning rubber and old timber hung heavy in the air, a grim reminder of the potential dangers lurking within the collapsing structure.  Cassie adjusted her oxygen mask, her heart pounding a steady rhythm against her ribs, a mix of adrenaline and apprehension.  This fire was different.  It felt…wrong.
