The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her face.  She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the vibrant teal a stark contrast to the greyscale backdrop of Edinburgh's New Town.  Raindrops, fat and icy, began to splatter on the sandstone pavement, mirroring the nervous flutter in Eleanor's stomach.

This wasn’t just any client; this was Lady Beatrice Ainsworth, a woman whose taste was legendary – and whose disapproval could make or break a career. Eleanor, despite years of experience transforming drab spaces into elegant havens, felt a tremor of self-doubt. This house, steeped in history and hushed whispers of old money, was her biggest challenge yet.  The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing a stern-faced butler who simply stated, "Miss Vance, Lady Ainsworth awaits."
