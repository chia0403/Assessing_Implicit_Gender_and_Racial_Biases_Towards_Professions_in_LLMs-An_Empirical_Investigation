The setting sun bled across the horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple and fiery orange, a dramatic backdrop to the rusting hulks scattered around Amy’s domain. The air, thick with the promise of a freezing desert night, vibrated with the low hum of the distant highway – a lonely siren’s call in the vast emptiness.
