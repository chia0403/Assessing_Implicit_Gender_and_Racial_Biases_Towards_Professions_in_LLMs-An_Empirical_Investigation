The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the windows of "Bisque & Bones," a tiny, stubbornly independent restaurant clinging to the edge of Seattle's Ballard neighborhood.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of simmering shellfish and woodsmoke, a comforting counterpoint to the gray, churning waters outside.  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun escaping from beneath a stained bandana, surveyed her kingdom.  Copper pots gleamed, knives honed to a razor’s edge hung in perfect symmetry, and the day's catch – Dungeness crab, fat mussels, and glistening silver salmon – lay nestled in beds of ice, waiting for Izzy’s transformative touch.  Tonight was the first night of "Crab Fest," Bisque & Bones' annual celebration of the local crustacean, and Izzy, despite the usual pre-service jitters, felt a thrill of anticipation.  This was her chance to prove, once again, that her little restaurant, nestled between a laundromat and a vape shop, was a culinary gem.
