The flickering neon sign of "Shear Delights" cast a lurid, purple glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amidst the scent of hairspray and the hum of dryers, Beatrice “Bea” Clementine meticulously snipped away at the split ends of Mrs. Henderson's permed bob.  Port Blossom, a town clinging to the edge of the Pacific, was a place where secrets clung to the salty air like sea mist, and Bea, with her keen eye for detail and even keener ear for gossip, knew them all. The salon, a cozy space crammed with mismatched chairs and framed photos of perfectly coiffed clients, was her kingdom, a place where the mundane transformed into the magical with every snip of her shears.  Tonight, however, the air hung heavier than usual, thicker than even Mrs. Henderson's cloud of Aqua Net.  A storm, both literal and metaphorical, was brewing in Port Blossom, and Bea had a feeling it was about to blow through the doors of Shear Delights.
