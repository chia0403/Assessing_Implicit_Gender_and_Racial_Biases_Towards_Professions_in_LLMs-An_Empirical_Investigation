The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, whistling a lonely tune through the skeletal branches of the cottonwood trees lining the median.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling grit and dried tumbleweeds like miniature tornadoes.  The sun, a pale disc in the hazy sky, offered little warmth against the early November chill.  Ezekiel "Zeke" Butterfield, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka and thick work gloves, leaned against the tailgate of his orange Department of Transportation pickup truck, watching the traffic whiz by in a blur of steel and glass.  Mile marker 147 blinked stoically in the distance, a lonely sentinel in this vast, windswept landscape of western Nebraska.  Zeke's breath plumed out in white puffs, dissipating quickly in the dry air. He took a long swig of lukewarm coffee from his thermos, the bitter brew offering a fleeting moment of comfort against the gnawing cold.  Today's task was a simple one: replace the damaged reflectors along a two-mile stretch of the highway.  Simple, yes, but also monotonous and exposed, leaving him feeling as isolated and insignificant as the discarded fast-food wrappers tumbling across the barren landscape.  He sighed, knowing that this was just another day in the solitary life of a highway worker.
