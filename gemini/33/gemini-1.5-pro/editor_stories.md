Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Hayes's head.  The only light in the cramped, book-lined space came from a battered desk lamp, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering flame of a nearly extinguished candle.  Amelia, a freelance editor with a reputation for polishing even the roughest of literary diamonds, hunched over a manuscript, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air in the converted attic room, which served as both her office and living space, was thick with the scent of old paper, printer ink, and the faintest hint of woodsmoke drifting down from the chimney. Outside, the wind howled through the eaves of the ancient, rambling farmhouse she rented on the outskirts of the isolated village of Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the misty valleys of the Welsh countryside.  It was late November, a time when the sun rarely showed its face and the long nights were punctuated by the mournful cries of owls and the rustling of unseen creatures in the surrounding woods.  This solitude was usually a comfort to Amelia, a haven for her work, but tonight, a sense of unease prickled at the edges of her awareness, a feeling as persistent and chilling as the draft that snaked through the gaps in the floorboards.
