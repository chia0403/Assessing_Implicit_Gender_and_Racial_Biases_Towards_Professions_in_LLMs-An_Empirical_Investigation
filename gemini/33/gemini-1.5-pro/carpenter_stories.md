The scent of pine shavings and sawdust hung thick in the air, mingling with the crisp autumn breeze that whistled through the half-constructed timber frame.  Elijah Birch, his calloused hands resting on the head of a freshly hammered oak beam, surveyed his work with a critical eye. The skeleton of the barn, destined to house the prize-winning Clydesdales of Old Man Hemlock, rose against the backdrop of the Vermont mountains, their peaks already dusted with the first snow of the season.  The valley below, a patchwork of crimson and gold maples interspersed with the deep evergreen of the pines, sprawled out like a hand-woven tapestry.  Elijah, a man as sturdy and weathered as the wood he worked with, felt a familiar sense of satisfaction.  He wasn't just building a barn; he was building a legacy, piece by meticulously crafted piece. But the tranquility of the mountainside held a deceptive calm.  A raven, perched on the highest beam, let out a series of sharp caws, a sound that echoed unnaturally loud in the stillness, making the hairs on the back of Elijah's neck prickle.  Something felt wrong.
