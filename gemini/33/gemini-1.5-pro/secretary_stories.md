The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys filled the otherwise silent office of Grimshaw & Sons Import-Export.  Eleanor Vance, her fingers flying across the keys with a practiced ease, barely registered the sound.  Outside, the fog hung heavy over London, muffling the usual cacophony of the city.  A single gas lamp, perched on a wrought iron stand beside Eleanor’s desk, cast a warm circle of light, illuminating the neat stacks of paper and the gleaming mahogany surface. The year was 1947, and post-war austerity still gripped the nation, a chill that seeped into the very bones of the once-grand building.  The opulent furnishings, now slightly threadbare, spoke of a bygone era, a time of prosperity that Eleanor herself had only glimpsed as a child.  A faint scent of pipe tobacco lingered in the air, a ghostly reminder of Mr. Grimshaw Senior, who had passed away just months before the war began, leaving his two sons to navigate the turbulent waters of a world on the brink of collapse.  Tonight, however, the office held a different kind of stillness, a heavy, expectant silence that pricked at Eleanor’s skin.  She had been asked to stay late, an unusual request, and the reason remained shrouded in mystery.
