The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he hurried across the near-deserted parking lot of the North Shore Rehabilitation Center.  The setting sun painted the sky in bruised hues of purple and orange, reflecting in the icy puddles at his feet.  It was late January in Evanston, Illinois, and the kind of cold that seeped into your bones no matter how many layers you wore. Elias, however, barely noticed.  His mind was already inside, with his last patient of the day:  a stubborn, fiercely independent woman named Mrs. Petrov who was recovering from a hip replacement. She was making progress, albeit slowly, and Elias was determined to coax her into taking a few more steps than she had the day before. The fluorescent lights of the clinic beckoned, promising warmth and the quiet hum of therapeutic machinery, a soundtrack to Elias’s dedicated, often painstaking work.  Inside, the smell of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of the mint tea Mrs. Petrov always brought with her, a small comfort in the face of pain and the arduous journey back to mobility.
