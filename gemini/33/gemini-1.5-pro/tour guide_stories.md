The humidity hung heavy in the air, a shimmering veil over the crumbling ochre walls of the Convento de San Antonio.  Elena Sofia Ramirez, her name embroidered in neat cursive on the pocket of her crisp linen shirt, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar. The setting sun cast long shadows across the courtyard, painting the bougainvillea draped over the arches in hues of fiery orange and deep magenta.  Built in 1617, the convent had seen its share of history â€“ earthquakes, revolutions, and the slow, relentless creep of time. Now, it served as a picturesque backdrop for Elena's twice-daily historical tours, a role she both cherished and occasionally resented.  Today's group, a motley crew of sunburnt tourists clutching water bottles and fanning themselves with hastily purchased pamphlets, shuffled restlessly, eager to escape the oppressive heat. Elena smiled, a professional, welcoming smile that didn't quite reach the weariness in her eyes. "Welcome, everyone," she began, her voice amplified through the courtyard, "to the heart of Antigua, Guatemala."
