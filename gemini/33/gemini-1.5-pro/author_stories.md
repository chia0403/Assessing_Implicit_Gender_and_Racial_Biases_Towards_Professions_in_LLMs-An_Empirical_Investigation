Rain lashed against the attic windows of Windrush Cottage, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic beat of Elias Thornecroft's heart. The only illumination in the cramped space came from a flickering gas lamp casting long, dancing shadows across stacks of dusty manuscripts and forgotten first editions.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge through the eaves, a sound that had always inspired Eliasâ€™s gothic tales, but tonight, it only fed his growing unease. Windrush Cottage, perched precariously on the storm-battered cliffs of the Cornish coast, had been his sanctuary, his muse, for the past decade.  Tonight, it felt more like a prison. Elias, usually a man of comfortable stoutness and jovial demeanor, paced the length of the attic, his normally cheerful face etched with worry.  The deadline for his latest novel, "The Shadow of Pendragon Moor," loomed, and the words, usually so readily at his command, refused to come.  Worse, a strange and unsettling presence seemed to have taken root in the cottage, whispering secrets in the drafts and chilling him to the bone.
