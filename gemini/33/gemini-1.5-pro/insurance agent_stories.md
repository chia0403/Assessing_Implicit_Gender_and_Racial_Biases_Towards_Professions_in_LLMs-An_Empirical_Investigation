The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's hands as she stared out the window of her cramped office.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already dreary view of downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Neon signs reflected in the slick streets, painting the asphalt in lurid hues of pink and green.  Amyâ€™s office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery, wasn't glamorous, but it was hers.  The scent of stale coffee and old paperwork hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to the threadbare carpet and the peeling floral wallpaper.  It was a Monday morning in March, the kind that promised little but overflowing gutters and the persistent drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet somewhere in the building. And for Amy, it promised another week of chasing down overdue premiums and explaining the intricacies of liability coverage to bewildered clients.
