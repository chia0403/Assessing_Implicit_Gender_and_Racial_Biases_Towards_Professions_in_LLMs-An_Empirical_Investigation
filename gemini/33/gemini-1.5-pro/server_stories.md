The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Reyes's hands as she leaned against the greasy back counter of the Galaxy Diner.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy, otherworldly glow.  It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift, and the only other occupants of the diner were a snoring trucker slumped over a congealed plate of scrambled eggs and a moth desperately flirting with the flickering overhead fluorescent lights. The Galaxy, a relic of a bygone era of chrome and vinyl, sat lonely on the edge of Highway 17, just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Nevada.  The air hung thick with the mingled scent of stale coffee, frying bacon grease (from earlier), and the faint, metallic tang of the approaching storm.  Amy sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain. Another slow night.  Just the way she liked it.  Or at least, thatâ€™s what she told herself.
