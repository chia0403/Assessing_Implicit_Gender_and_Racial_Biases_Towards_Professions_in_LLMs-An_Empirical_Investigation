The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic arches looming above him like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Rain, half-frozen and stinging, lashed against his face, plastering strands of dark hair to his forehead. He clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, the weight of the day’s surgeries pressing down on him like the lead apron he’d shed only an hour earlier. The antiquated clock tower chimed six times, each clang echoing through the hollow space, a stark reminder that he was late. Not for a surgery, thankfully, but for a meeting – one he suspected would determine not only the future of St. Jude's, a hospital clinging precariously to its historical legacy in the heart of Edinburgh, but perhaps his own future as well.
