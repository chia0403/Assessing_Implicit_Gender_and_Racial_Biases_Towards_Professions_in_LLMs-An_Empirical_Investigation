The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped at Abigail Rose McAlisterâ€™s thick wool coat as she surveyed the eastern fence line of the Rocking R Ranch. The sky, a bruised purple, bled into the snow-dusted peaks of the Absaroka Mountains, which loomed like slumbering giants in the distance.  Twenty thousand acres of Wyoming wilderness stretched out before her, a tapestry woven with the muted greens and browns of late autumn.  The Rocking R, nestled in the valley carved by the icy Rush Creek, had been in Abigail's family for five generations, a legacy etched in weathered wood and calloused hands. This evening, however, a sense of unease prickled beneath Abigail's skin, a feeling as raw and unsettling as the wind that gnawed at the exposed wood of the barn. Something felt wrong.  The quiet was too quiet, even for a November evening.
