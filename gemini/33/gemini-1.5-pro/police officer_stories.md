The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, purple glow over Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz as she stood on the rain-slicked corner of Bleecker and Mercer in Manhattan.  The November air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and burnt coffee, bit at her exposed skin. Izzy pulled her worn leather jacket tighter around her, the collar scratching against the stubble of her two-day-old beard.  Above, the sky was a bruised purple, mirroring the colour of the diner sign, and a relentless drizzle threatened to turn into a full-blown downpour any second. The call had come in just fifteen minutes ago: a possible homicide at the dilapidated tenement building halfway down the block, its chipped paint and boarded-up windows a testament to years of neglect.  Izzy took a deep breath, the cityâ€™s symphony of sirens and car horns a familiar soundtrack to her unease, and started towards the scene, her boots echoing on the wet pavement. This part of the West Village, usually buzzing with late-night revelers, was eerily quiet tonight, adding another layer of disquiet to the already unsettling situation.
