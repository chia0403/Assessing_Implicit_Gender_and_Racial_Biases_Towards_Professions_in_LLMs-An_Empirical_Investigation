Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Jasper "Jazz" Blackwood's office, a counterpoint to the erratic rhythm of his tapping fingers on the worn oak desk.  Neon signs from the street below bled through the grimy window, painting streaks of lurid green and pink across the peeling wallpaper.  His office, perched precariously above a 24-hour laundromat on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City, usually smelled of stale coffee and desperation.  Tonight, however, a cloying sweetness, almost like overripe jasmine, mingled with the familiar aromas, a disconcerting perfume on the otherwise gritty air.  Jazz, a man whose rumpled trench coat and five o'clock shadow were as much a part of him as his sharp grey eyes, swirled the last of his lukewarm whiskey, the ice clinking a mournful tune against the glass.  He had a bad feeling about this case, and the jasmine scent only made it worse.
