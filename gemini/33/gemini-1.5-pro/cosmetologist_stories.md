The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois like a damp towel.  The scent of saltwater taffy mingled with exhaust fumes and the faint, metallic tang of impending rain. Gigi, her name tag pinned crookedly to her crisp white uniform, surveyed the chaotic scene unfolding before her inside "Curl Up & Dye," a pastel-pink salon nestled between a dilapidated surf shop and a perpetually busy laundromat on Clearwater Beach's main drag. It was Spring Break, and the salon, usually a haven of tranquil hair transformations, was currently more akin to a beauty brawl.  Teenage girls with sunburnt shoulders and tangled, chlorine-green hair jostled for appointments, their mothers, sporting visors and exasperated sighs, trailed close behind.  A toddler with a head full of rainbow-colored braids wailed inconsolably in the corner, while a radio blared an aggressively cheerful pop song. Gigi took a deep breath, adjusted her grip on her shears, and plastered a professional smile on her face.  This was going to be a long day.
