The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the creaking of the old Victorian house it occupied.  Located on the windswept, sparsely populated edge of Port Blossom, Oregon, the clinic clung precariously to a bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Pacific.  The salt spray carried on the wind constantly assaulted the peeling paint and rusted window frames, giving the impression that the building itself, like some of Elias’s patients, was in desperate need of an adjustment.  Inside, the waiting room, lit by a single Tiffany lamp casting watery shadows, was empty save for a wilting peace lily and the faint aroma of eucalyptus oil.  Elias, a tall, wiry man with greying hair pulled back into a ponytail, stared out at the storm, his knuckles white against the chipped porcelain of his mug. He’d been expecting a new patient, a Mrs. Agatha Cavendish, but the weather had clearly conspired against her arrival.  He hoped she hadn’t gotten lost on the notoriously treacherous coastal road.
