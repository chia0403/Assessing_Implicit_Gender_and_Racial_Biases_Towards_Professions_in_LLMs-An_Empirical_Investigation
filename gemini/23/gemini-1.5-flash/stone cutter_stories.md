The rasp of granite against steel sang a lonely tune across the windswept moor.  The air, thick with the scent of heather and the sharp tang of sea salt, whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face.  Elias, a man carved by the same relentless forces that shaped the granite he worked, stood hunched over his half-finished masterpiece – a towering Celtic cross destined for the windswept graveyard overlooking the churning Atlantic.  The grey light of a November dawn barely illuminated the rough-hewn stone, yet Elias’s eyes, the colour of a stormy sea, saw every detail, every imperfection, every potential flaw in the cold, unforgiving material.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, a fitting soundtrack to the solitary life he’d chosen, a life as hard and unyielding as the stone itself.
