The chipped paint of the "Guidance" sign above Ms. Eleanor Vance's door seemed to mirror the cracks in the foundation of Northwood High.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the perpetually soggy football field, mirroring the relentless drizzle of teenage anxieties that poured into her office daily.  The air inside, however, was surprisingly dry, smelling faintly of stale coffee and the lingering scent of desperation â€“ a familiar aroma to Eleanor, who had spent the last fifteen years navigating the turbulent emotional seas of adolescence.  Today, however, felt different. A heavy silence hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner, each second a hammer blow against the fragile calm.  Eleanor sat behind her cluttered desk, a half-eaten granola bar abandoned beside a stack of college brochures, her gaze fixed on a single, unopened envelope bearing a stark black seal.  The storm outside was nothing compared to the tempest brewing inside.
