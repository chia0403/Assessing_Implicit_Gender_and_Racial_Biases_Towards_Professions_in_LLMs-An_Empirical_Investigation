The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's day.  Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though few dared to use it in the hallowed halls of Sterling & Steele), sat perched on her throne – a surprisingly uncomfortable ergonomic chair – behind a polished mahogany desk that seemed to emanate an air of stuffy legal importance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stillness of the otherwise immaculate reception area.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the hum, rattling the skyscraper's windows and promising a brutal winter.  The scent of expensive leather and old paper hung heavy in the air, a perfume uniquely Sterling & Steele.  Today, however, a new, unfamiliar aroma competed for dominance – the sickly sweet tang of impending litigation.
