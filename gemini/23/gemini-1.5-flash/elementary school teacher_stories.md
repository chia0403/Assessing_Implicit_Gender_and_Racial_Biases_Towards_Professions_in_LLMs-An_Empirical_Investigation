The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor like a gentle, melancholic snow.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak October sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 2B at McKinley Elementary, danced in the still air.  The scent of old paper, chalk, and something vaguely resembling burnt popcorn hung heavy, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, who had breathed it in for the past fifteen years.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient window frames â€“ a fitting soundtrack to the unsettling quiet that had settled over her usually boisterous classroom.  The usual cacophony of giggling children and the rhythmic scratch of pencils on paper was absent. Today, an unnerving stillness reigned, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall, its chimes sounding eerily close, like a slow, deliberate countdown.
