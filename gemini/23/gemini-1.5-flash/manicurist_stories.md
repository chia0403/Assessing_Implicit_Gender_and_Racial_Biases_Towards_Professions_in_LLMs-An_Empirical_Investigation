The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather like a second skin.  Sera, owner and sole operator of "The Polished Petal," a tiny nail salon nestled between a laundromat and a butcher shop on Bleecker Street, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic whir of her electric file. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already hazy view of the bustling New York City street.  Inside, however, it was a haven of calm; a miniature oasis of pastel colours and softly lit corners, where the frantic energy of the city outside seemed to melt away.  Tonight, though, the usual peace was shattered by an unnerving silence.  Normally, the gentle chatter of clients, the soft clinking of tools, and the rhythmic rasp of the file would create a soothing background hum. Tonight, only the relentless drumming of the rain filled the space, a discordant soundtrack to the creeping unease that had settled in Sera's stomach.
