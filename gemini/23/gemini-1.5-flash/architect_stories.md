The salt spray stung Amelia Stoneâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She squinted, the late afternoon sun glinting off the chaotic jumble of scaffolding and half-finished timber that was, in its nascent state, the new Seaglass Hotel.  Perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse, the building looked less like a haven of luxury and more like a defiant monument to human ambition clinging to the very edge of the world.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, howled around Amelia, tugging at her charcoal-grey overcoat and whipping her dark hair across her eyes.  Below, the jagged rocks clawed at the turbulent waves, a constant reminder of the brutal beauty of this isolated Cornish coastline.  The air smelled of brine, seaweed, and the faint, metallic tang of impending rain.  This was Amelia's masterpiece, her legacy, and tonight, it was threatening to crumble around her.
