The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway, whipping her already-tangled auburn hair across her face.  It stung her cheeks, a familiar discomfort she barely registered anymore.  She hunched deeper into her parka, the thick fabric offering little respite from the relentless chill that permeated everything at McMurdo Station.  The vast, desolate landscape stretched before her â€“ a stark, white expanse broken only by the jagged peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains, their icy teeth clawing at the bruised, twilight sky.  This was Evelyn's fifth year at the station, five years dedicated to a research project that had consumed her every waking thought, a project that, if successful, could rewrite the very history of life on Earth.  The air itself seemed to crackle with the weight of her ambition, a silent counterpoint to the wind's desolate song.
