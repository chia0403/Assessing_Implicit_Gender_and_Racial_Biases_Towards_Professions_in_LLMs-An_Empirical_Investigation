The scent of lavender and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill October wind rattling the windowpanes of  "Stitches & Dreams," Aurelia Josephine Hawthorne's small but perfectly organized dressmaking shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy glass, danced in the shafts of light that sliced through the gloom of the tiny back room, where bolts of silk, velvet, and brocade stood like silent sentinels guarding Aurelia's carefully curated collection.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the ancient port town of Seabrook were slick with rain, the cries of gulls a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Aurelia's sewing machine, a faithful companion humming a steady beat in the otherwise quiet shop.
