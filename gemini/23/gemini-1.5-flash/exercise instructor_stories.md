The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders as she adjusted the mirrored sunglasses perched atop her head.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the glistening sheen on the polished chrome handlebars of her stationary bike.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sunscreen, chlorine, and the faintly metallic tang of exertion – the usual bouquet of the exclusive Ocean Breeze Fitness Club.  Amelia, a woman whose sculpted physique spoke volumes about her dedication to fitness, surveyed her class. Twenty-five faces, flushed and determined, stared back at her from beneath visors and sweatbands, a sea of lycra and resolve.  The rhythmic whirring of the exercise bikes formed a hypnotic soundtrack to the gentle lapping of waves against the club’s expansive ocean-view windows.  Today’s session, Amelia knew, would be a scorcher – both literally and figuratively.
