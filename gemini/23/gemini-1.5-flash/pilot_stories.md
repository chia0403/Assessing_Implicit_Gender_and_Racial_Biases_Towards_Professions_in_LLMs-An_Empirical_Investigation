The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s battered Cessna 185, the whine of the engine a counterpoint to the storm’s fury.

Evie gripped the yoke, knuckles bone-white, her gaze fixed on the instruments, a tiny flickering beacon of defiance against the overwhelming power of nature.  The radio crackled with static – a futile attempt at connection in this desolate, unforgiving wilderness, a landscape she knew intimately yet still held in awe, and sometimes, in fear.  Tonight, the fear was a tangible weight in her chest, heavier even than the ice forming on the wings.  Her mission: a mercy flight to a remote trapping cabin, a gamble against the odds in a tempest that threatened to swallow her whole.
