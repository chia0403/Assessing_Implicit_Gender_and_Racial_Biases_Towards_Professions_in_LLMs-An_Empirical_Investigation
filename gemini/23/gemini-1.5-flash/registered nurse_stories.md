The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  Grey skies wept a relentless drizzle, mirroring the melancholic mood that had settled over the small coastal town of Seabrook since the storm had swept through three days prior.  Seabrook General Hospital, a low-slung brick building perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic, loomed ahead, its windows reflecting the stormy sky like a fractured mirror.  Inside, Amelia, a registered nurse with ten years of experience etched onto her tired but determined face, knew the storm's aftermath had only just begun.  The electricity was flickering intermittently, the backup generator groaning under the strain, and the lingering smell of salt and sea spray hung heavy in the air, mingling with the antiseptic tang of the hospital itself.  Tonight, Amelia suspected, would be a long one.
