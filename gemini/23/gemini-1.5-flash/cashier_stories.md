The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Thursday evening.  Amelia, all sharp angles and nervous energy contained within a too-tight, ill-fitting uniform, stared blankly at the rotating display of brightly coloured candy bars.  Outside, the relentless Texas summer clung to the asphalt, baking the air thick and heavy with the scent of exhaust fumes and overripe mangoes.  The only breeze came from the erratic blasts of the store's ancient air conditioner, which wheezed and coughed like a dying dog every few minutes, threatening to send the already wilting sunflowers in the window box into complete collapse.  The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of another customer, and Amelia straightened, forcing a smile onto her face that felt as cracked and dry as the desert outside.  She already knew, with a weary certainty, this was going to be a long night.
