The air hung thick and sweet in the "Sugarplum Sweet Shoppe," a riot of sugary scents that clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above rows upon rows of pastel-colored sprinkles, glistening edible pearls, and miniature chocolate figurines – Amelia's kingdom, her canvas, her happy place.

Amelia, her flour-dusted apron stained with a rainbow of buttercream, hummed along to the tinny radio playing holiday jingles, a tiny, almost imperceptible frown etching itself onto her brow as she meticulously piped a delicate rose onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  The bride's demands – a cascade of ivory roses, interspersed with forget-me-nots, all perfectly symmetrical – were proving a challenge, even for Amelia, renowned throughout the town of Willow Creek for her unparalleled cake artistry.
