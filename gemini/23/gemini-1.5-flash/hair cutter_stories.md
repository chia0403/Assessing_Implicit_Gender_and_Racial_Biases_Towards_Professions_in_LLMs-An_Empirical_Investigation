The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne truly appreciated.  It was the signature aroma of her salon, “Shear Genius,” nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  Gas lamps flickered outside, casting a warm, honeyed glow on the rain-slicked brick walls and the overflowing window boxes brimming with vibrant fuchsia impatiens. Inside, the salon was a haven of controlled chaos:  the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Mia's shears competing with the low hum of the hairdryer and the cheerful chatter of her two assistants, preparing for the evening rush.  The antique mahogany chairs gleamed under the soft light, polished to a mirror sheen by years of dedicated service, each bearing silent witness to countless transformations, whispered confidences, and the occasional tear shed over a bad breakup or a disastrous perm.  Tonight, however, the air crackled with a different kind of energy, a palpable anticipation that hung heavier than the humidity clinging to the Charleston night.
