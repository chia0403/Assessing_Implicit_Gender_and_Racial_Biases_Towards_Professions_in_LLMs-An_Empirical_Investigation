The recycled air hung thick and stale, smelling faintly of old coffee and desperation.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a veteran flight attendant with eyes the color of a stormy Atlantic and a weariness etched into the corners of her mouth, adjusted the tiny, almost comically inadequate safety demonstration card clutched in her hand.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Reykjavik was a bruised purple, the faintest suggestion of the aurora borealis flickering on the horizon – a spectacle Amelia rarely had the luxury of appreciating anymore.  She was perched on a jump seat in the near-empty cabin of Icelandair flight FI612, bound for Keflavík International Airport, the scent of impending doom – or at least a very bumpy landing – clinging to the air almost as strongly as the recycled coffee.  This was her 37th transatlantic flight this year, and the familiar knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  She was starting to think the comforting routine of pre-flight checks was only delaying the inevitable: another turbulent flight, another screaming baby, another surly passenger demanding a free upgrade. Tonight, however, something felt different.  The silence was unnerving, too deep, too heavy.
