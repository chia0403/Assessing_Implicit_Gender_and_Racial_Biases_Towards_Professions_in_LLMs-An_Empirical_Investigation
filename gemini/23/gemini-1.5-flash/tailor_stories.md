The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  His shop, tucked away on a cobbled lane barely wide enough for a cart, was a sanctuary of hushed industry.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated panes of the single window, cast long shadows across bolts of rich velvet, shimmering silk, and homespun linen stacked neatly against the walls.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliasâ€™s shears punctuated the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady beat to the life he had carefully constructed within these four walls.  Outside, the autumn wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the loose stones of the lane and promising a harsh winter to come.  But inside, amongst the warmth of the crackling fire and the comforting weight of his work, Elias felt a quiet contentment.  He hummed a forgotten ballad as he carefully measured a length of emerald green brocade, his nimble fingers already envisioning the magnificent coat it would soon become.
