The acrid bite of smoke stung Lieutenant Ava Roslyn’s eyes, a familiar discomfort she’d grown accustomed to over her thirteen years with the San Francisco Fire Department.  The pre-dawn sky, usually a canvas of bruised purples and oranges over the Golden Gate, was choked with a thick, grey haze, illuminated only by the furious orange maw of the blaze tearing through the Victorian-era row houses on Lombard Street.  The air vibrated with the roar of the inferno, a cacophony of crackling timber and the hiss of pressurized water, punctuated by the sharp clang of axes and the barked commands of her fellow firefighters.  The smell – a nauseating cocktail of burning wood, melting plastic, and something sickeningly sweet that Ava suspected was a neighbour’s prized collection of antique perfumes – threatened to overwhelm even her seasoned senses.  This wasn't just another fire; this was a monster, fueled by a relentless wind that whipped the flames into a frenzy, threatening to consume the entire block.
