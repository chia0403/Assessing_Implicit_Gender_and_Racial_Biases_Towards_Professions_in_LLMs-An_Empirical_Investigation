The fluorescent lights of Amelia Hernandez’s tiny office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of her storefront on the edge of downtown San Antonio, blurring the already faded Fiesta posters plastered haphazardly across the glass.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, printer ink, and the lingering scent of desperation – a familiar aroma in the final weeks before the tax deadline.  Amelia, a meticulous woman whose perfectly coiffed auburn bun never seemed to stray a hair, sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose.  Another mountain of paperwork loomed on her desk, a chaotic jumble of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts, each one a potential minefield of deductions, credits, and the ever-present risk of an IRS audit.  This year, however, felt different; a particular chill hung in the air, heavier than the pre-deadline pressure.  Something about the next file, waiting patiently – or perhaps impatiently – in its manila envelope, felt… ominous.
