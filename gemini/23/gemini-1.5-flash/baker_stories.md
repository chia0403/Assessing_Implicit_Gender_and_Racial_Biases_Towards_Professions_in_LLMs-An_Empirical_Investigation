The pre-dawn chill clung to Aurelia “Rella” Blackwood’s apron like a stubborn ghost.  It wasn’t the kind of chill that bit, but rather a pervasive dampness that seeped into your bones, mirroring the greyness that clung to the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven.  Rella shivered, not entirely from the cold, but from the nervous energy that thrummed beneath her skin like the yeast bubbling in her sourdough starter.  Oakhaven, nestled in a valley perpetually shrouded in mist, was a town steeped in ancient traditions, where the scent of woodsmoke and baking bread were as commonplace as the whispering wind through the gnarled oak trees that gave the village its name. Today, however, the familiar comfort of her routine felt overshadowed by a looming shadow: the annual Oakhaven Baking Competition.  The prize?  A coveted spot at the prestigious Royal Baker's Guild in London, a dream Rella had held close since she was a child, kneading dough beside her grandmother in this very bakery.
