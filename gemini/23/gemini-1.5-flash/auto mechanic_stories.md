The wrench slipped, a metallic shriek echoing in the cavernous belly of the garage, a sound swallowed almost instantly by the thick, greasy air hanging heavy with the scent of burnt oil and ozone.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the weak light.  This wasn't some gleaming, modern repair shop; this was Silas "Sil" Blackwood's sanctuary, a cluttered testament to years spent wrestling with temperamental engines and stubborn bolts.  Tools – wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers of every imaginable size and shape – lay scattered across every available surface: workbenches, overflowing toolboxes, even precarious stacks on top of discarded tires.  Sil, his hands stained a perpetual shade of motor oil, wrestled with the recalcitrant engine block of a vintage Mustang, his brow furrowed in concentration, a low hum of frustration rumbling in his chest.  The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline, sweat, and a faint hint of coffee long gone cold.
