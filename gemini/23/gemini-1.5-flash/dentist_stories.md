The sterile scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Eleanor Vance, DDS.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her practice, blurring the already twilight cityscape of Seattle.  The city lights, usually a dazzling spectacle reflected in the polished chrome of her instruments, were muted tonight, diffused by the grey curtain of a November storm.  Inside, however, the only illumination came from the cool, clinical glow of her operatory lights, focusing on the empty dental chair.  Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain. Another late night. Another cancelled appointment.  She rubbed the fatigue from her eyes, the reflection of the overhead light momentarily blinding her.  The silence, broken only by the relentless patter of rain, felt oppressive.  It was a silence that usually hummed with the whir of drills and the low murmur of anxious patients, a silence that tonight felt heavy with an unspoken dread.
