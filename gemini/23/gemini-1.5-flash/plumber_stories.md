The biting November wind whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's ankles as he wrestled a recalcitrant drainpipe back into place.  Frozen fingers, numb from the near-zero temperatures, fumbled with the wrench, the metal biting into his already chapped skin.  Barty swore, a low rumble barely audible above the shriek of the wind howling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak dominating the small, neglected churchyard of St. Jude's in the sleepy village of Ashworth.  The church itself, a crumbling Gothic masterpiece, loomed behind him, its grey stone stained dark with the relentless assault of centuries of rain and wind.  The only light came from the flickering gas lamp on the corner of the cobbled lane, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like the very pipes Barty was battling.  This wasn't the glamorous side of plumbing, that was for sure.  But the rent was due, and Mrs. Periwinkle's perpetually blocked drains were paying the bills â€“ at least for now.
