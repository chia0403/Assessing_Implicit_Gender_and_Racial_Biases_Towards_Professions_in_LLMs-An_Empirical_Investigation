The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, owner and sole proprietor of Thorne's Traditional Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating the faded red and gold striped wallpaper that had witnessed countless haircuts, whispered secrets, and the slow, inexorable march of time.  Elias, a man whose hands were as steady as the razor he wielded, sat perched on a worn leather stool, his reflection a ghostly counterpoint to the vibrant colours of a vintage barber pole spinning lazily outside. The shop itself was a time capsule, a relic of a bygone era nestled incongruously on the bustling, modern street corner of Bleecker and Mercer.  The hum of traffic outside was a distant roar, muted by the thick, comforting silence within.
