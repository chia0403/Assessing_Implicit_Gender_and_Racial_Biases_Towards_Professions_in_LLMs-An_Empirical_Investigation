The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Hernandez’s hand, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise unremarkable diner called “The Rusty Spoon.”  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the clatter of cutlery and the low thrum of conversation, all filtered through the greasy haze clinging to the air like a second skin. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew, wiped down the already-clean counter with a practiced hand, the rag smelling faintly of bleach and burnt coffee.  Outside, the neon sign flickering intermittently cast an anemic glow on the rain-slicked street, hinting at the dreary November evening settling over Harmony Creek, a town whose charm had long since rusted away like the spoon in its name.
