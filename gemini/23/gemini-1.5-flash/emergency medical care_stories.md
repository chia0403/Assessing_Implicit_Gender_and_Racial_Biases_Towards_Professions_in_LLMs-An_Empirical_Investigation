The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of the salt marshes, whipping Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s already damp hair across her face.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks lining the coastline provided a counterpoint to the frantic beeping of her EMT radio, a relentless pulse in the otherwise quiet night.  Amy, shivering despite her thermal layers, pulled her parka tighter, the salt spray stinging her cheeks.  The battered Ford Explorer, its emergency lights flashing intermittently against the inky blackness, swayed precariously on the rutted track, each pothole a jarring reminder of the urgency of the call.  Ahead, the skeletal branches of dead cypress trees clawed at the bruised purple sky, their silhouettes stark against the fading light, a grim welcome to the isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, where Amy knew all too well that help often arrived too late.
