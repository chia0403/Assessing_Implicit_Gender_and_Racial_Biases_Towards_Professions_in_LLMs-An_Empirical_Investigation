The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Orkney Islands, stinging Dr. Ailsa MacLeod’s cheeks as she wrestled the battered Land Rover up a treacherous, sheep-tracked incline.  Rain, thick and grey as a shroud, lashed against the windscreen, blurring the already indistinct landscape.  Below, the churning North Sea gnawed at the craggy coastline, its roar a constant, mournful undertone to the desolate beauty of the scene.  Ailsa, her thick, dark braid whipping wildly in the wind, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white.  The emergency call had come in just an hour ago – a stricken seal pup, somewhere along this unforgiving stretch of coast.  The late afternoon light was already fading fast, painting the sky in bruised purples and angry greys, and Ailsa knew time was of the essence.  She hadn’t encountered many seal pups this far north, and certainly not this late in the season. This was more than just a vet call; it felt like a race against the encroaching darkness, and perhaps, against something far more sinister.
