The flickering neon sign of the "Byte Me" diner cast a lurid green glow on the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma to Elias Thorne, a computer programmer whose life felt less like a cyberpunk fantasy and more like a never-ending bug hunt.  Elias, at the age of thirty-two, was hunched over a chipped Formica table, his fingers flying across the keyboard of his battered laptop, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap a counterpoint to the low hum of the diner's ancient refrigerator and the mournful wail of a passing hovercar siren.  His dark hair, perpetually escaping its messy bun, fell over his forehead, obscuring the tired lines etched around his usually sharp, intelligent eyes. Tonight, however, those eyes held a flicker of something else entirely â€“ not just exhaustion, but a burgeoning sense of unease. The rain outside intensified, mirroring the storm brewing within him.
