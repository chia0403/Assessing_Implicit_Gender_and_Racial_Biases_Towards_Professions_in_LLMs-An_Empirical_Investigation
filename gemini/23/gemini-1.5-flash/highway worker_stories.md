The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes and tugging at the brim of his orange hardhat.  He squinted against the pre-dawn gloom, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant grey.  The asphalt ribbon of Highway 17 snaked endlessly before him, a black scar across the desolate landscape of the New Mexico desert.  Giant saguaro cacti stood like silent sentinels, their skeletal arms reaching towards a sky still devoid of the sun's warmth.  Elias, a man carved from the very grit of this unforgiving land, shivered less from the cold and more from the gnawing emptiness in his stomach â€“ a feeling far more pervasive than the chill morning air.  The rumble of his heavy machinery, a distant growl, was the only sound louder than the relentless wind whistling through the sparse mesquite bushes.  Today was another day patching potholes, another day battling the unforgiving sun and the even more unforgiving memories that clung to him like the dust clinging to his worn boots.
