The brass nameplate gleamed under the crystal chandelier: *Augustus "Gus" Finch, Concierge*.  Gus, however, was not admiring his own polished image.  He was hunched over a chipped porcelain teacup, the lukewarm Earl Grey doing little to soothe the icy dread gripping his stomach. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Bellagio Towers, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Neo-Veridia into a shimmering, neon-drenched watercolor.  The opulent lobby, usually a hive of meticulously dressed guests and scurrying staff, was eerily silent, the only sounds the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the insistent hum of the buildingâ€™s advanced climate control system.  Tonight, the Bellagio felt less like a five-star haven and more like the eye of a storm.
