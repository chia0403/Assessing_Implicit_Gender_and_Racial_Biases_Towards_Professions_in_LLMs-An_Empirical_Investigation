The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He squinted, the late afternoon sun a fiery orb sinking behind the jagged teeth of the Skellig Michael cliffs, painting the churning grey sea in streaks of blood orange and bruised purple.  Elias, a man whose life was etched in the lines around his sea-worn eyes and the calloused skin of his hands, adjusted the worn leather strap of his Hasselblad 500C/M.  The camera, a faithful companion for twenty years, felt as much a part of him as his own heartbeat.  He was perched precariously on a windswept outcrop, the wind howling a mournful ballad around him, the only witness to the raw, untamed beauty of the Irish coast. Tonight, he wasn't just capturing a landscape; he was chasing a fleeting moment of magic, a ghost in the storm.
