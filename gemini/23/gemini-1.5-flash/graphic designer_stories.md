The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, drying ink, and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt coffee from her earlier, desperate attempt at caffeine-fueled inspiration.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, promising a long, bleak night.  This was it: the deadline for the prestigious Blackwood & Sons whisky campaign, and she was utterly, hopelessly stuck.
