The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas onto the easel.  Salt spray, thick as sea mist, clung to everything, even the worn wooden planks of her makeshift studio perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.
