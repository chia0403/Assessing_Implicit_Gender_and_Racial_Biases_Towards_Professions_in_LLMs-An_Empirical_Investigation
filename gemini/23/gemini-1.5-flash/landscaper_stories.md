The relentless Texas sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s neck, turning the sweat on his brow to a shimmering, salty film.  He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, the scent of sun-baked earth and honeysuckle clinging to the air like a persistent perfume.  Around him, the sprawling estate of Mrs. Vandergelt, a riot of overgrown bougainvillea and neglected rose bushes, clawed at the sky.  Elias, owner and sole operator of Thorne Landscaping, surveyed his kingdom – or rather, his battlefield – with a mixture of weariness and grim determination.  This wasn't just a landscaping job; it was a reclamation project, a battle against nature's tenacious grip and Mrs. Vandergelt's years of benign neglect.  The cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost mocking soundtrack to his labors.
