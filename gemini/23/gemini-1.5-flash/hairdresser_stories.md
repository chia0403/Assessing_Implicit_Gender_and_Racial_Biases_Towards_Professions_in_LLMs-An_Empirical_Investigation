The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Rella” Nightingale.  Rella, owner and sole operator of "Shear Perfection," perched precariously on a wobbly stool, her fingers expertly weaving through a cascade of fiery red hair.  The salon itself was a charming anachronism nestled amongst the gleaming chrome and glass skyscrapers of downtown Zenith City.  Built in the 1920s, Shear Perfection retained its original hardwood floors, stained-glass windows depicting whimsical fairies, and a surprisingly sturdy, if slightly faded, velvet chaise longue where clients could relax before their appointments. Outside, the city roared with the cacophony of traffic and construction, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost meditative atmosphere within the salon’s walls. Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Rella's client, a notoriously difficult socialite known for her sharp tongue and even sharper cheekbones.
