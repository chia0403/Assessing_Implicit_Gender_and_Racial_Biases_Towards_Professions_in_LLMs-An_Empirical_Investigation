Rain lashed against the leaded windows, a relentless counterpoint to the frantic drumming of her fingers against her leather-bound portfolio.  The house, shrouded in gloom despite the afternoon light attempting to pierce the storm clouds, was her latest challenge, a testament to the fact that even the most stubbornly unfashionable homes could be transformed, given the right dose of Rella Davenport’s magic.
