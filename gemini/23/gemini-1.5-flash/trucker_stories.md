The biting Montana wind howled a mournful symphony around Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's rig, rattling the windows of his battered Kenworth like skeletal fingers on a tombstone.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, plastered itself to the cab, obscuring the already fading twilight.  Zeke, his breath misting in the frigid air, wrestled with the stubborn latch on his thermos, the metallic clang a jarring counterpoint to the rhythmic drone of the diesel engine.  He was stranded, miles from anywhere, on a stretch of Highway 200 known locally as Devil's Backbone â€“ a name that, tonight, felt chillingly appropriate.  The only light visible for miles emanated from the flickering glow of his dashboard and the distant, menacing twinkle of a lone star battling its way through the swirling snow.
