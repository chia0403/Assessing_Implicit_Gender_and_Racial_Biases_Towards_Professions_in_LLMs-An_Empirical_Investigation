The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from its tangled mooring on the weathered wooden dock.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the craggy coastline of Port Blossom, Maine.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Eleanor, her usually crisp white lab coat now damp and smelling faintly of fish, shivered despite the late summer warmth.  Port Blossom, with its picturesque charm and fiercely independent spirit, was a far cry from the sterile, modern clinics she was used to, but the island's isolation was precisely why she'd come here â€“ a self-imposed exile to heal both her patients and herself.
