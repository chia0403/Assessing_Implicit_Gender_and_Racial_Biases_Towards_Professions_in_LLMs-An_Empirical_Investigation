The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's exposed neck, stinging the raw chapped skin.  He tugged his threadbare scarf higher, the wool doing little to combat the icy breath of the North Sea that rolled in from the jagged cliffs bordering the construction site.

He adjusted the hard hat perched precariously on his already wind-tossed hair, the rhythmic clang of steel on steel a constant soundtrack to his existence.  This wasn't just a job; it was a battle fought one rivet, one beam, one precarious step at a time against the unforgiving elements and the ever-present threat of the churning sea below.
