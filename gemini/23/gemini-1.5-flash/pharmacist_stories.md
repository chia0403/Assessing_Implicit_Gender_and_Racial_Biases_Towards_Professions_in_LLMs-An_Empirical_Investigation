The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar, depicting a ludicrously cheerful cherub wrestling a serpent, felt cool beneath Dr. Elara Vance's fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering gas lamp above, danced in the thick, cloying air of her shop, "Vance's Remedies," a haven of sweetly pungent herbs and the faintly metallic tang of tinctures.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the building, a rhythmic percussion against the creaking floorboards beneath her worn leather boots.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the encroaching industrial age, were slick and deserted.  Inside, the only sound beyond the storm was the gentle hiss of a simmering concoction bubbling on the back burner, a fragrant brew of chamomile and something decidedly less benign â€“ nightshade, Elara suspected, though she wouldn't reveal her exact formula to just anyone.
