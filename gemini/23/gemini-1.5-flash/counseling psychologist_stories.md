The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room seemed to sigh in the afternoon sun.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, frantic stars, danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the grimy window.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and something subtly floral – a desperate attempt at cheer, Eleanor thought, that only served to highlight the underlying antiseptic tang of the room.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – a low, throbbing hum of traffic and distant sirens – pulsed against the stillness within.  Eleanor, however, wasn't listening.  She was lost in the intricate web of her own thoughts, a familiar labyrinth of case notes, ethical dilemmas, and the gnawing weight of unspoken anxieties that clung to her like the dust motes to the air.  Her neat, mahogany desk, usually a symbol of order, felt more like a battlefield littered with the casualties of other people’s lives.  The next patient was due any minute, and despite years of experience, a familiar tremor of anticipation – a mixture of dread and purpose – settled in her stomach.
