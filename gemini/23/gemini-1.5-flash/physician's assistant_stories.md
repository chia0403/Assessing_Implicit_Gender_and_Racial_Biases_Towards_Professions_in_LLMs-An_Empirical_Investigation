The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s hair across her face as she hurried down the slick cobblestone street.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts, usually comforting, did little to dispel the gnawing anxiety twisting in her gut.  Rain, a relentless, sideways torrent, plastered her already damp lab coat to her skin.  Amelia, a physician’s assistant at the renowned but perpetually understaffed St. Jude’s Medical Center in the historic port city of Galway, Ireland, tugged her collar higher, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  The gaslights flickered weakly against the backdrop of the brooding, grey sky, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms around the ancient buildings.  Tonight, however, the shadows felt less whimsical and more menacing, mirroring the unease that had settled deep within her.  The emergency call had been cryptic, the patient’s description vague, yet the urgency in the doctor’s voice had sent a shiver down her spine.  This wasn't just another late-night call-out; this felt different.  This felt… dangerous.
