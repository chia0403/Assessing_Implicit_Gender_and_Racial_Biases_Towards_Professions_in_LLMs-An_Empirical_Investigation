The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic.  Perched on the craggy cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, the clinic, a converted lighthouse keeper's cottage, was the only sign of civilization for miles along the desolate Newfoundland coastline.  Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of antiseptic and woodsmoke. Shadows danced on the whitewashed walls, cast by the flickering flames in the old iron stove.  Elias, his hands still chapped despite the thick wool gloves, stared out at the approaching blizzard. He knew it wouldn't be long before the first frantic call came in â€“ a lamb trapped in a snowdrift, a cow struggling to calve in the freezing barn. This was life on the edge of the world, where even the gentlest creatures fought a constant battle against the elements, and Elias Thorne, their solitary guardian, stood ready to answer their call.
