Cassie, clad in a sharp, charcoal-grey pantsuit, stood with her back to the view, her hands clasped behind her, knuckles white.  The silence in the room was broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the faint hum of the advanced security system that guarded her secrets, secrets that were now threatening to spill out and shatter everything she had built.
