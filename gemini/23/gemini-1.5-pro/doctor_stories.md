The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and carrying the faint, salty tang of seaweed.  Greystones, a small fishing village nestled precariously between the brooding cliffs of the Yorkshire coast and the unforgiving ocean, was shrouded in a perpetual mist that seemed to seep into the very bones of its inhabitants. Inside, a single lamp illuminated the worn, leather-topped desk where Elias sat, the flickering light casting long shadows that danced across the anatomical charts adorning the walls.  His stethoscope, cool against his starched white shirt, swung gently as he leaned back in his chair, the rhythmic creak a familiar counterpoint to the ceaseless roar of the waves outside.  This evening, the only other sound was the scratching of his pen against paper as he meticulously recorded the details of his last patient, a fisherman with a hand mangled in a net.  It was a typical Tuesday in Greystones â€“ bleak, unforgiving, and punctuated by the quiet suffering of its hardy people.  But tonight, something felt different.  A tension hung in the air, thicker than the sea mist, a premonition of something unsettling on the horizon.
