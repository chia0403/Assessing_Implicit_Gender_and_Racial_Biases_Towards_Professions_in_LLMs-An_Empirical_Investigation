The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom door, a vibrant yet faded sunflower yellow, perfectly mirrored the state of perpetual optimism she carried within her.  Room 2B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled amongst whispering pines in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, was her kingdom.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty window panes and dappled by the leaves outside, danced across miniature tables and chairs, illuminating construction paper castles and crayon masterpieces taped to the walls. The air hummed with the quiet anticipation of a new school year, a low thrum vibrating through the stacks of brightly colored storybooks and the bins overflowing with glitter glue and pom-poms.  This morning, however, the usual cheerful buzz was replaced by an unusual stillness.  Mrs. Ainsworth, perched on the edge of a tiny chair, felt it too, a prickle of unease at the nape of her neck, like the quiet before a summer thunderstorm.
