The biting wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Eva" Moreau's flight suit as she prepped her aircraft, the crimson and gold stripes of the Icarus Aviation logo gleaming under the harsh desert sun.  Jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountain range clawed at the sapphire sky, casting long, ominous shadows across the desolate airstrip carved into the Arizona sand.  Eva adjusted her goggles, the cracked leather warm against her cheek. This wasn't her usual run – ferrying wealthy tourists over the Grand Canyon – this was a clandestine cargo flight, and the heavy crate marked "FRAGILE – HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE" chained to the floor of her vintage De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver floatplane radiated an unnerving aura of mystery.  The air shimmered with heat, distorting the horizon and amplifying the silence that hung heavy over the deserted landscape.  Only the faint buzz of cicadas and the distant whine of the approaching jeep broke the stillness, signaling the arrival of her enigmatic client.  Eva took a deep breath, the dry desert air tasting of dust and anticipation.  This was going to be a long night.
