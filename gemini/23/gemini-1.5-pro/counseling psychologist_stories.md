The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her newest patient.  Her office, nestled on the third floor of a converted brownstone in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, usually felt like a sanctuary.  Dark wood bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with well-worn volumes on psychology, philosophy, and classic literature. A plush, emerald green velvet chaise lounge sat opposite her worn leather armchair, bathed in the warm glow of a brass reading lamp.  But today, the usually comforting space felt charged, the air thick with unspoken anxieties.  Outside, the late October wind howled, whipping the crimson and gold leaves into a frenzied dance.  It was the kind of day that made even the most stoic Bostonians crave a cup of hot clam chowder and the comforting crackle of a fireplace. Dr. Vance, however, had a feeling this session would offer anything but comfort.
