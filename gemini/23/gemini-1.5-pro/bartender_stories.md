The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually soothed Elias Thorne. Tonight, however, it only amplified the throbbing in his temples.  Neon signs advertising long-defunct breweries flickered intermittently in the grimy windows, casting a sickly green glow across the empty bar.  Elias, his name embroidered in faded gold thread on his black vest, wiped down the sticky mahogany counter with a practiced hand, the silence broken only by the clinking of ice in his glass and the relentless drumming of the storm. Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light filtering down from a bare bulb hanging precariously above the cash register.  Salt Creek, Oregon, population 487 (and dwindling), wasn't exactly known for its nightlife, even on a Friday. But tonight, the desolation felt heavier than usual, clinging to Elias like the damp sea air that permeated everything in this forgotten coastal town.
