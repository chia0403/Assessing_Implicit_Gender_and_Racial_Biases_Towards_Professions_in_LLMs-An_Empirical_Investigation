The biting November wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vance's coat as she hurried across the frost-covered parking lot of Ashwood High.  The skeletal branches of the towering oaks lining the drive clawed at the overcast sky, their leaves a forgotten carpet of brittle brown and red beneath her feet.  Ashwood, a sprawling brick structure built in the 1950s, loomed before her, its windows reflecting the bleak, grey landscape.  Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed and teenage energy vibrated, a stark contrast to the desolate scene outside. Eleanor, her breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, clutched her thermos of lukewarm coffee tighter, steeling herself for the day ahead. It was already shaping up to be one of *those* Mondays, beginning with an early morning call from a distraught parent and a frantic email from the principal about a student exhibiting concerning behavior.  The warmth offered by the brick walls seemed miles away, and Eleanor knew, with a sinking feeling, that the chill in the air was more than just meteorological.
