The scent of aged paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Eleanor Vance, the head librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, inhaled deeply each morning as she unlocked the heavy oak doors.

October had arrived, painting the surrounding hillsides in vibrant shades of crimson and gold, and a restless wind whistled through the eaves, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and the promise of an early frost. Eleanor, with her spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose and a thick cardigan draped over her shoulders, shivered slightly, a premonition of the long, quiet winter ahead settling upon her like the mountain mist.
