The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he crossed the cobbled courtyard of Oakhaven Manor.  Gargoyles perched on the parapets leered down at him, their granite faces softened by a dusting of early snow.  Built in 1789, the manor now served as a rehabilitation center, nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts.  Its ivy-choked stone walls, mullioned windows, and imposing oak door hinted at a history far grander – and perhaps darker – than its current purpose suggested. Elias, his breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, adjusted the strap of his leather messenger bag and pulled his scarf tighter around his neck.  He was already late for his first patient, the enigmatic Mrs. Eleanor Vance, and a prickle of unease, beyond the usual pre-appointment jitters, settled in his stomach. He’d been working at Oakhaven for only three months, but the place held an atmosphere that couldn't be explained by its age alone. It was a quiet, watchful atmosphere, as if the very stones themselves held secrets.  And Elias had the growing suspicion that Mrs. Vance was at the center of them.
