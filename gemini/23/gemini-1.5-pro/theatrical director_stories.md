The peeling paint of the Grand Majestic Theatre whispered secrets of forgotten applause and bygone divas. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating a chipped cherub clinging precariously to the proscenium arch. The air, thick with the smell of stale greasepaint and mothballed velvet, hung heavy as a shroud. This was Anastasia “Ana” Valentina Petrova's inheritance, a crumbling monument to a theatrical past, and her latest, potentially greatest, challenge.  Nestled in the heart of the once-vibrant, now-shabby port town of Port Blossom, Maine, the Grand Majestic hadn't seen a paying audience in over a decade.  But Ana, clutching a dog-eared copy of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and a lukewarm coffee in mismatched mittens, saw not decay, but potential.  She saw not ghosts, but a waiting audience.
