The flickering neon sign of "Clementine's Clips and Cuts" buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, Clementine “ Clem” Hawthorne, her name stitched in faded cursive on a burgundy smock, swept up the remnants of Mrs. Henderson’s perm.  Port Blossom, a once-bustling fishing town, was now a collection of weathered clapboard houses and struggling businesses clinging to the edge of the Pacific like barnacles on a forgotten hull. The salty air hung heavy, thick with the smell of brine and the faint, metallic tang of rust.  Clem, with her close-cropped auburn hair and a permanent smudge of hair dye behind her ear, sighed, watching the rain cascade down Main Street.  This wasn't the life she'd envisioned, but it was the one she had, and tonight, it felt particularly bleak.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival, and Clem, forcing a smile onto her face, called out, “Be right with you!”
