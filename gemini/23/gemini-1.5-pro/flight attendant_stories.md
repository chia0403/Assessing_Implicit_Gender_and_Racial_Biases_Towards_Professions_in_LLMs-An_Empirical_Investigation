The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the occasional gurgle of the beverage cart.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, her navy blue uniform crisp despite the twelve-hour flight from Tokyo Narita, smoothed a stray strand of hair back into her meticulously crafted chignon.

Mia glanced at the slumbering passengers, their faces illuminated by the dim cabin lights, and felt a familiar pang of loneliness.  Another landing, another transient connection in a life perpetually in transit. This time, however, a prickle of anticipation, an unfamiliar flutter in her chest, accompanied the usual weariness. Something felt different about this arrival.
