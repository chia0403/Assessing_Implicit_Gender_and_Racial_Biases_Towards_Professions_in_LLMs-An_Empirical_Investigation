Rain lashed against the gothic arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's Edinburgh office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his mind. The gas lamps, hissing softly, cast long, dancing shadows across the mahogany desk piled high with case files.  Each one represented a shattered mind, a twisted psyche Elias had painstakingly pieced back together, like a macabre jigsaw puzzle.  Outside, the wind howled down the narrow, cobbled streets of the Old Town, a mournful soundtrack to the city's dark secrets.  It was late November, 1888, a month already etched in infamy thanks to the ghastly Whitechapel murders. While the terror gripping London felt a world away, a chilling unease had settled over Edinburgh too.  A different kind of darkness stirred in the ancient city, one that even Elias, with all his experience probing the criminal mind, found deeply unsettling. Tonight, a new case file lay open before him, the ink still glistening. The name scrawled across the top –  "The Deacon Brodie Murders" – promised a descent into the deepest recesses of human depravity.
