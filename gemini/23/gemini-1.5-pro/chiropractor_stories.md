The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty, turquoise-painted door of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic.  Dust devils danced across the deserted main street of Harmony Springs, a town clinging stubbornly to life amidst the sprawling Joshua Tree forests and shimmering heat haze.  Inside, the air hung thick and still, cooled only by a wheezing, wall-mounted air conditioner that fought a losing battle against the desert's furnace. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the tiny vertebrae of Mrs. Gable's chihuahua, Pepito, a creature who viewed the world with perpetual suspicion from beneath a cloud of fluffy white fur.  The rhythmic *click-pop* of Pepito's recalcitrant joints echoed in the otherwise silent office, punctuated only by the sporadic whir of the struggling air conditioner and Mrs. Gable's nervous humming. Outside, a lone tumbleweed bounced against the clinic's window, a harbinger of the strange events about to unfold.
