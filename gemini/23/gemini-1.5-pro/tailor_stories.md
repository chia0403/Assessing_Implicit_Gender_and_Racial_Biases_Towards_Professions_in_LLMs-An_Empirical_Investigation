The gaslight above hissed softly, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames in the small hearth. Outside, the cobbled streets of Hollow Creek, a town perpetually shrouded in mist and whispers, were slick with a recent rain. It was the kind of evening that burrowed deep into your bones, a prelude to the long, dark winter that clung to the valley like a shroud.  Elias, however, found a peculiar comfort in the chill. It suited the quiet rhythm of his work, the precise movements of needle and thread, the steady beat of his heart against the backdrop of the whispering wind. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the edge of his awareness, a sense of anticipation that had nothing to do with the impending frost.
