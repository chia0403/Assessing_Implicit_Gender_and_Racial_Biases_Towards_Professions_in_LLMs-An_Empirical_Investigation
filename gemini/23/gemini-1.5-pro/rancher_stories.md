The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Montana plains, biting at Amelia Hayesâ€™s chapped lips. The late November sun, a watery disc low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the lone cottonwood tree that stood sentinel over the Hayes family ranch.  Barbed wire fences, strung taut as piano strings, stretched across the undulating landscape, marking the boundaries of the sprawling Two Rivers Ranch.  Generations of Hayeses had carved a living from this unforgiving land, and Amelia, her thick work boots planted firmly in the frozen ground, felt the weight of that legacy pressing down on her shoulders like the gathering storm clouds overhead.  The lowing of cattle drifted from the south pasture, a mournful sound that mirrored the unease churning in her gut. This winter, something felt different. Something felt wrong.
