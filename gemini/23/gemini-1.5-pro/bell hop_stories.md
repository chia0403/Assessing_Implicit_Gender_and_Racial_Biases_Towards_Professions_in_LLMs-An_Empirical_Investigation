The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air into the stifling July heat as Elias Thorne, all of nineteen years old and dressed in a crisp, though slightly too-large, burgundy uniform, adjusted his pillbox hat.  Sunlight, fractured by the bevelled glass of the entrance, cast kaleidoscopic patterns across the opulent lobby.  Marble floors gleamed beneath crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of wealthy patrons mingled with the gentle clinking of ice in crystal glasses from the Peacock Bar tucked discreetly to one side. The air itself hummed with an almost palpable sense of old money and hushed secrets, a world Elias, with his scuffed shoes and threadbare dreams, could only observe from the periphery.  He stood by the imposing mahogany front desk, the brass luggage cart gleaming beside him like a loyal steed, awaiting the next arrival and the chance to earn a few precious coins. The Grand Majestic, perched on the edge of the glittering Athenian Riviera, was a universe away from the dusty, sun-baked streets where Elias had spent his childhood, and every shift felt like a precarious balancing act between aspiration and reality.
