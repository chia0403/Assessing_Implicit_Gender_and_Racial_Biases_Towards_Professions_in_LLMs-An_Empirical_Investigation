The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Klondike, stinging Rosalind "Rosie" Petrov's cheeks despite the layers of fleece and wool she wore beneath her worn Carhartt jacket.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised snow.  Towering above her, the partially assembled steel skeleton of the Yukon Gold Mine's new processing plant groaned against the gusts, a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the rapidly darkening horizon. Rosie, perched precariously in the cab of her Komatsu D575A-3 Super Dozer – the biggest beast on the site and her undisputed throne – squinted at the swaying structure.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down her spine.  This project was already six months behind schedule, plagued by equipment failures, permit snafus, and now, this infernal early winter.  If they didn't pour the foundations before the ground froze solid, they could kiss goodbye to another season, and Rosie, along with the rest of the crew, could kiss goodbye to their bonuses.
