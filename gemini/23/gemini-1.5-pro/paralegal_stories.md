Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grimshaw Building, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Philadelphia.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, a familiar aroma to Amelia Grace Holloway.  She hunched deeper into her worn office chair, the flickering fluorescent light above casting long shadows across her desk, which was currently buried under a mountain of depositions related to the Peterson vs. City of Brotherly Love case. Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious (and notoriously demanding) law firm of Miller, Davies, and Sterling, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and sighed. This was the third consecutive weekend she'd sacrificed to this case, and the mountain of paperwork seemed only to grow higher.  A low rumble of thunder echoed through the otherwise deserted office, mirroring the growing unease in Amelia's stomach. This case was different.  Something about it feltâ€¦ wrong.
