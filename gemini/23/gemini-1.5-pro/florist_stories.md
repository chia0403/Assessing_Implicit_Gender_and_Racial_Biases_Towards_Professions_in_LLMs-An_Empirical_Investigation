The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a discordant melody, the two notes slightly out of tune, just like Elara Thistlewick preferred them.  It was a quirky welcome to her equally quirky flower shop, nestled between a laundromat with perpetually flickering neon and a pawn shop showcasing dusty treasures in its window.  Rain hammered against the large storefront window, blurring the view of the grey, cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and Elara's signature blend of lavender and bergamot she used in her homemade potpourri.  Elara, her auburn braid draped over her shoulder like a thick vine, was hunched over a bucket, meticulously arranging a bouquet of midnight blue roses, their velvety petals shimmering under the warm glow of the overhead lamps.  She hummed a melancholic tune, oblivious to the growing puddle forming by the leaky corner of the shop, her mind preoccupied with the anonymous order for a dozen such rare blooms.  It wasn't the flowers themselves that bothered her, but the accompanying card: a single, stark white envelope containing nothing but a single, dried, crimson poppy.
