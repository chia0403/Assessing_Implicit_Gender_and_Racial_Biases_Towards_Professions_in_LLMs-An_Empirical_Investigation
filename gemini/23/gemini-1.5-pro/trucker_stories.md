The dashboard clock glowed 3:17 AM, a sickly green illuminating the weary face of Darlene "Dar" McMillan.  Rain lashed against the windshield of her Peterbilt 389, blurring the already indistinct lines of the two-lane blacktop cutting through the Missouri Breaks.  The wind, a howling banshee ripping through the canyons, buffeted the rig, making Dar grip the steering wheel tighter.  She was halfway between Kansas City and Denver, a stretch of desolate highway she knew like the back of her hand, but tonight, even the familiar felt alien, draped in a thick fog that seemed to swallow the beams of her high beams whole.  The only sound besides the storm was the low rumble of the eighteen wheels eating up the miles and Johnny Cash's gravelly voice crackling from the CB radio, a small comfort in the oppressive darkness.  The air inside the cab was thick with the smell of stale coffee and diesel, a scent Dar usually found comforting, but tonight, it felt heavy, pregnant with a sense of unease.
