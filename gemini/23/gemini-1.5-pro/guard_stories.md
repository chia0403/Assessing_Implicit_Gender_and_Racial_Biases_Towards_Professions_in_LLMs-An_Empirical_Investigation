The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick woolen cloak, stinging his exposed cheeks with icy needles. He stamped his feet, the rhythmic thud a small rebellion against the encroaching numbness. Above him, the obsidian ramparts of Blackwind Keep clawed at the bruised, pre-dawn sky, their jagged silhouettes stark against the swirling snow. Elias, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused from years of gripping sword hilts and hauling stone, patrolled the western battlements.  From this dizzying height, he could see the sprawling, snow-dusted plains of the Northmarch stretching out before him, a vast, desolate expanse punctuated by the skeletal fingers of dead trees.  The only sound, apart from the wind's mournful howl, was the occasional crackle of ice forming in the gutters of the keep. Tonight, the last night of the long winter, was eerily quiet. Too quiet.  Elias gripped the hilt of his longsword, a familiar comfort against the prickling unease that crawled up his spine. Something was wrong.
