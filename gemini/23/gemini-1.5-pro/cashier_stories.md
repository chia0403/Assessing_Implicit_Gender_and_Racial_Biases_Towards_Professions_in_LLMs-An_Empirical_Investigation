The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over Aisling O'Malley and the overflowing aisles of discount groceries.  It was 2:17 AM on a Tuesday, the kind of hour that swallowed sound and stretched time into a thin, brittle sheet.  Outside, the only sign of life in the desolate strip mall was the intermittent rumble of a distant garbage truck and the sporadic chirp of crickets bravely defying the encroaching concrete.  Aisling, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, leaned against the chipped Formica counter, idly watching the security camera monitor display a grainy, black-and-white image of empty shelves. The air hung heavy with the mingled scent of stale coffee, artificial pineapple air freshener, and a faint, underlying whiff of something vaguely rotten coming from the back cooler.  She'd been working the graveyard shift for six months now, and the quiet was starting to feel less like peace and more like a suffocating blanket.
