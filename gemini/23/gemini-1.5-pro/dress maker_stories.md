The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the attic window of Mademoiselle Eléonore Bisset's workshop. Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale November sunlight that sliced through the grimy panes, illuminating the chaos within.  Rolls of silk and satin, in hues ranging from the deepest emerald to the palest blush, lay draped over chairs and piled haphazardly on tables.  Half-finished gowns, suspended from a rickety clothes rack, swayed gently in the breeze that snaked its way through a cracked pane.  Paris, in the year 1888, was a whirlwind of change and innovation, yet within this small, cluttered haven above the bustling Rue de Rivoli, Eléonore Bisset reigned supreme, her needle and thread her scepter and her scissors her sword. The faint scent of lavender and woodsmoke mingled with the sharp tang of iron from her pressing tools, creating a perfume unique to her domain.
