The sun beat down on Elias Vance's neon-orange vest, the asphalt shimmering like water in the distance. Heat radiated up from the road, blurring the edges of the scrubby Arizona desert that stretched out on either side of Highway 89.  Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, swirling red dirt against the cloudless, turquoise sky. Elias, sweat beading on his forehead and darkening the brim of his worn baseball cap, adjusted his grip on the jackhammer. The rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* echoed across the empty highway, a lonely percussion against the backdrop of cicadas and the distant whine of a semi-truck.  A mile back, a bright orange "Road Work Ahead" sign warned drivers of the lane closure, but on this scorching Tuesday morning, it seemed Elias had the entire stretch of highway to himself.  This desolate stretch, just south of Prescott, was his domain for the week â€“ his task, to break up a section of cracked pavement, preparing it for resurfacing.  And Elias, a man of routine and quiet contemplation, found a strange sort of peace in the solitude and the physicality of the work.
