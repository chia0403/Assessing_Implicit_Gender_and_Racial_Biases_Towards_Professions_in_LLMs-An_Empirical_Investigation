Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alexandra “Alex” Ramirez’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her cramped space above O’Malley’s Pub on Bleecker Street, usually smelling faintly of stale beer and roasted peanuts, was tonight saturated with the cloying sweetness of cheap lilies.  They sat in a chipped vase on her desk, a condolence offering from Mrs. Rosenblatt downstairs, whose ginger cat, Mr. Whiskers, Alex had successfully located last week (he'd been napping in the butcher shop’s delivery van). The lilies did little to brighten the gloom.  November in Greenwich Village had a way of clinging to the shadows, and the year 1948, for Alex, had been particularly long on shadows and short on sunshine. The flickering neon sign of the Emerald City burlesque club across the street cast an eerie green glow on the water streaming down the windowpane, distorting the reflection of her own tired face.  A fresh case – or even a stale one – would be a welcome distraction.  The insistent jangle of the telephone, like a startled cry in the night, cut through the silence.
