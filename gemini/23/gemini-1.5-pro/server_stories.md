The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, otherworldly glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled aromas of stale coffee, frying onions, and desperation.  Amelia “Amy” Rosario wiped down the sticky Formica countertop, her reflection staring back at her, pale and tired beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.  It was 3:17 am, the slowest hour of the slowest shift of the week, and the only other occupants of the diner were a truck driver nursing a lukewarm cup of joe and a pair of teenagers huddled in a booth, whispering conspiratorially over a shared plate of fries.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the Starlight, a lonely beacon in the vast, desolate expanse of the Nevada desert. Amy sighed, the sound swallowed by the low hum of the refrigerator.  Tonight felt different.  Heavier.  Like something was about to happen.
