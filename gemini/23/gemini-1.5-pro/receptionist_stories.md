Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the glass doors and sending shivers down the spines of the impeccably dressed consultants who hurried past.  It was November, the kind of biting cold that seeped into your bones and stayed there, a constant reminder of winter's long, unforgiving reign. But inside, the temperature was perpetually set to a balmy, artificial spring, a climate as controlled and predictable as the smiles plastered on the faces of everyone who walked through the door.  This was Amy’s kingdom, a kingdom of ringing phones, scheduled appointments, and the constant, low-level thrum of corporate ambition. And today, something felt different.
