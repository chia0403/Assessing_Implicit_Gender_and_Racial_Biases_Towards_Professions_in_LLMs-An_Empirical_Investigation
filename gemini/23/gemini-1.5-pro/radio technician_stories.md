The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" buzzed a lonely tune against the backdrop of a bruised, pre-dawn sky.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, swirling past the boarded-up gas station and the dilapidated motel where tumbleweeds gathered like gossiping neighbors.  This was Harmony Springs, Nevada, population 148 (and dwindling), a town where even the tumbleweeds seemed weary. Inside a small, corrugated iron shed behind the diner, illuminated by a single bare bulb swaying gently from a frayed wire, Elias Vance meticulously soldered a connection on a vintage vacuum tube radio.  The air smelled of ozone and stale coffee, a familiar comfort to Elias. Outside, the Nevada desert waited, vast and unforgiving, but inside this shed, Elias's world was a symphony of crackling static and the promise of a distant voice breaking through.
