The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet. Outside, the October wind whipped fallen leaves against the large, single-pane windows of Ashwood High, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst the browning oaks and maples of rural Vermont. Elias, his breath fogging slightly in the cool air, sipped lukewarm coffee from a chipped mug that read "World's Okayest Teacher," a gift from a particularly sarcastic graduating class.  He surveyed the room: desks arranged in neat rows, a periodic table tacked above the chalkboard, a wilting Venus flytrap on his windowsill. Ashwood was a quiet place, a town where change came slowly, if at all. But Elias had a feeling this year was going to be different.  A crumpled, anonymous note sat on his desk, a single sentence scrawled in messy handwriting: "They're watching you."
