The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, making the already faded awning above "Nourish & Flourish" snap and groan like a disgruntled stomach.  Raindrops, fat and icy, splattered against the large storefront window, blurring the colourful displays of quinoa, chia seeds, and locally sourced honey within.  Eleanor, her auburn braid tucked into the collar of her forest-green coat, sighed and rubbed her gloved hands together.  Pinewood Creek, Oregon, was picturesque, nestled between towering pines and the rushing waters of the eponymous creek, but its charm often felt overshadowed by the relentlessly grey skies and pervasive dampness that clung to everything from October to May.  This particular Tuesday morning, with the temperature hovering just above freezing and the first real snowfall of the season threatening, even Eleanor's usually unwavering optimism was beginning to feel the chill.  Business had been slow, the farmers' market had been cancelled due to the weather, and her latest blog post on the benefits of fermented foods had received a surprisingly hostile response from an online community dedicated to the consumption of exclusively beige-coloured carbohydrates.  It was shaping up to be a long, and likely soggy, day.
