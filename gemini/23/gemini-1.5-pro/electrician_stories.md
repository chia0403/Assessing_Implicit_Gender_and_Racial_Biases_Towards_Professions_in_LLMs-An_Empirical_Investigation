The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal scaffolding of the half-finished skyscraper, whistling a mournful tune that resonated deep in Elias Vance's bones.  Fifty stories above the glittering sprawl of Chicago, Elias, bundled in a thick parka and insulated work boots, clung to a steel beam, the icy metal biting through his gloves.  He squinted against the swirling snow, the city lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of hazy color.  Below him, the miniature yellow cabs crawled along the gridded streets like industrious ants, oblivious to the precarious dance Elias performed high above.  He was tracing a fault in the buildingâ€™s electrical system, a ghost in the wiring that was causing intermittent blackouts in the lower floors, and tonight, with a blizzard threatening to shut down the city, finding and fixing it was his sole, chillingly literal, focus. The wind howled louder, and a fresh wave of snow stung his face.  "Just gotta find the damn short," he muttered, his breath clouding the air, "before I become one."
