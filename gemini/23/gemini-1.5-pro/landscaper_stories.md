The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Ramirez’s dark braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Haverford’s prize-winning rose bushes.  Frost crunched under her worn work boots, the sound oddly satisfying against the mournful rustle of dried leaves. Grey clouds scudded low across the sky above the sprawling, Victorian-era estate that perched on a bluff overlooking the churning steel-grey waters of the Puget Sound.  Here, in the affluent enclave of Bainbridge Island, Washington, winter arrived not with a gentle snowfall, but with a raw, bone-chilling damp that seeped into everything, turning the vibrant gardens of summer into muted landscapes of browns and greys. Mia tugged her fleece tighter, already planning the protective burlap she'd need to wrap around the delicate hydrangeas huddled near the house.  This was the hardest part of her job, watching the vibrant life she’d nurtured all spring and summer slowly succumb to the inevitable grip of the Pacific Northwest winter.  But there was a certain beauty in it too, a quiet promise of renewal hidden beneath the frost-kissed earth.
