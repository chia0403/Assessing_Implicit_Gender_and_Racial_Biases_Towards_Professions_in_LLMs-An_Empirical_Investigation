The rusty chime above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue-rinse perm could rival a Pomeranian in both volume and texture. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, owner and sole stylist of the salon, plastered a welcoming smile on her face, though her fingers throbbed from wrestling with Mrs. Periwinkle's unruly curls just moments before. Shear Perfection was nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop on Elm Street, the main drag of Harmony Creek, a town so small the population sign doubled as a welcome banner. The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of hairspray and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby river, a constant backdrop to Amelia's life.  The pale pink walls, adorned with framed photos of elaborate updos and gravity-defying bobs, were a testament to her dedication, even if her clientele leaned more towards sensible trims and predictable perms. This Tuesday morning, much like any other in Harmony Creek, promised the usual quiet routine â€“ or so Amelia thought.
