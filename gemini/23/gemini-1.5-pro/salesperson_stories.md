Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a shimmering smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions, a fragrance Amelia Hayes, Senior Sales Representative for Barstow & Blake Office Solutions, usually found comforting. Not today. Today, the smell mingled with the metallic tang of anxiety churning in her stomach.  She clutched her lukewarm coffee, the chipped ceramic warming her numb fingers. Across from her, a half-eaten plate of scrambled eggs sat congealing, a testament to her dwindling appetite.  She’d been sitting in this vinyl booth for an hour, staring out at the deluge and the deserted stretch of highway that constituted the main drag of Harmony Creek, Nevada. Population: 487.  Her biggest sales pitch yet, and it was all riding on convincing the notoriously tight-fisted Mayor Mildred McMillan to ditch her town’s ancient typewriters and embrace the gleaming efficiency of Barstow & Blake's latest multi-function printers.
