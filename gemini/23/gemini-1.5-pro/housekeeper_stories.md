The biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive, whipping Amelia Reyes's thick, dark braid against her cheek.  Greystone Manor loomed before her, a gothic monstrosity of weathered stone and leaded glass, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  The salt spray, flung high by the wind, stung Amelia's eyes as she wrestled the heavy oak front door open, the iron hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the cavernous hall was dimly lit, the only illumination coming from a flickering gas lamp on a small table beside a suit of armour that seemed to watch her every move.  A chill deeper than the coastal wind permeated the air, clinging to the heavy velvet drapes and the threadbare Persian rugs, a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature and everything to do with the secrets held within Greystone's walls.  Amelia, armed with her cleaning supplies and a stoicism born of years spent in the service of the wealthy and eccentric, stepped inside, the door echoing shut behind her like the clang of a prison gate.
