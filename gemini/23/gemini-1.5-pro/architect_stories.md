Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the glittering Tokyo skyline into a shimmering, impressionistic painting.  Thirty-two stories above the relentless pulse of Shinjuku, Elias, his dark hair falling onto his forehead, traced the outline of a skyscraper on a condensation-fogged pane. The building, a sleek, twisting helix of steel and glass, existed only in his mind, a phantom against the backdrop of the real city.  His apartment, minimalist and meticulously organized, reflected the precision of his architectural vision.  Every object, from the Eames lounge chair to the precisely angled bonsai tree, had its designated place.  Tonight, however, a chaotic scatter of blueprints and scale models littered the surfaces, testament to a deadline looming closer than the storm clouds outside. The air thrummed with the low hum of the city and the nervous energy emanating from Elias himself.  He was just days away from presenting his design for the Tokyo Metropolitan Innovation Center, a project that could either catapult his career into the stratosphere or send it crashing down to earth.
