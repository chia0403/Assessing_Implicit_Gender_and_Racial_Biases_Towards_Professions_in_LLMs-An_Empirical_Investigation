The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed’s parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  The McMurdo Station’s cluster of squat, brightly colored buildings offered little respite from the relentless gale.  Beyond the station, the vast, white expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched to the horizon, an unbroken panorama of snow and ice under a perpetually twilight sky. Evelyn shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The data she'd just received from the automated deep ice core drill site, designated "Borealis-7," was unlike anything she'd encountered in her ten years of glaciological research.  It hinted at something buried deep within the ancient ice, something that shouldn’t be there, something that resonated with a strange, almost… otherworldly energy signature.  And that, more than the subzero temperatures, chilled her to the bone.
