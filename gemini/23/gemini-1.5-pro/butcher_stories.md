The biting wind whipped down Cobble Lane, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and something faintly metallic, something Elias Thorne, the butcher of Hollow Creek, recognized intimately as the tang of fresh blood.  Hollow Creek itself wasn't much – a cluster of granite houses huddled against the flank of Mount Cinder, perpetually shrouded in a thin, grey mist that seemed to seep from the mountain's dark heart.  Elias’s shop, "Thorne Meats," was sandwiched between a perpetually shuttered apothecary and a bakery that only opened on Tuesdays and Thursdays, its crooked sign creaking rhythmically in the wind like a mournful sigh. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of sawdust, aging beef, and the faint, sweet odor of the pine needles Elias scattered across the floor to absorb the inevitable spills.  The cleaver, honed to a razor’s edge, glinted dully in the single gas lamp that hung above the butcher block, casting long, dancing shadows across the room.  It was a Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Peabody would soon be by for her weekly order of lamb chops, and Elias, his thick apron already smeared crimson, was preparing for her arrival. But something about the wind that morning, the way it howled down from the mountain, told him this Tuesday would be different.
