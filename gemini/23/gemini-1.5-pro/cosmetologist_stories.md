The pungent aroma of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Eloise "Ellie" Cartwright like glitter to a drag queen.  Ellie, in her signature black apron splattered with bleach and dye, surveyed her domain: "Curl Up & Dye," a small but vibrant salon nestled between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty fortune teller's shop on the bustling, slightly-seedy Clementine Street. The late afternoon sun streamed through the large front window, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the rainbow spray of a hundred hair product bottles. Outside, the perpetually gridlocked traffic of Los Angeles honked and grumbled, a soundtrack to Ellie's life for the past ten years.  Today, however, the usual city symphony was punctuated by a different kind of noise - a rhythmic, almost metallic tapping coming from the alleyway behind the salon.  Ellie, mid-snip on Mrs. Henderson’s poodle-like perm, paused, her brow furrowing beneath her perfectly arched, self-applied microbladed eyebrows.  Something about that tapping… it just didn't sound right.
