The biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the pines, whipping snow into frenzied swirls around Elijah Jedediah Blackwood.  His breath plumed out, a fleeting ghost against the iron-grey sky.  Towering above him, the ancient Douglas firs of the Cascade Mountains stood sentinel, their frosted needles shimmering like a million tiny shards of ice. Elijah, his calloused hands tucked deep into the pockets of his thick wool coat, surveyed the stand of timber marked for felling. This section of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, nestled deep in the southwestern corner of Washington State, had been his domain for the past twenty years. He knew the rhythm of these woods, the creak of the ponderosas in the wind, the rustle of a deer mouse in the undergrowth, the very scent of the damp earth beneath the snow.  But this winter felt different.  A heavy silence hung in the air, broken only by the mournful cry of a distant raven, a harbinger, Elijah couldn't help but think, of something unsettling to come.
