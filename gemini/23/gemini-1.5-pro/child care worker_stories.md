The air in the Bumblebrook Daycare center smelled perpetually of microwaved macaroni and cheese and faint diaper cream.  Sunlight, filtered through the smudged fingerprinted windows, illuminated a chaos of brightly colored plastic toys scattered across the well-worn carpet.  Eliza June Kensington, with her perpetually frazzled bun and a nametag slightly askew, surveyed the scene with a mixture of weary fondness and mild apprehension. It was Tuesday, which meant finger painting, a guaranteed recipe for disaster even with the copious amounts of newspaper she'd laid down.  The four-year-olds, affectionately known in Eliza's head as "The Tiny Tornadoes," were currently engaged in a shrieking competition that seemed to be escalating exponentially.  Outside, a spring rain tapped gently against the glass, a soothing counterpoint to the cacophony within.  Bumblebrook, nestled in the sleepy, tree-lined outskirts of Willow Creek, usually offered a tranquil setting, but the peace rarely penetrated the daycare walls, especially not on Tuesdays.
