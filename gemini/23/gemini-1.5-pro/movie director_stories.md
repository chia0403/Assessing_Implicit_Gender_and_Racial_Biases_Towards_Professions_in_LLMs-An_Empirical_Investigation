The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, plastering Elara Reyes-Cruz's thick black hair across her face.  She ignored it, her gaze fixed on the ferry churning its way towards Bainbridge Island, a churning white wake trailing behind it like a frothy, dissolving dream. Elara, wrapped in a worn fishermanâ€™s sweater several sizes too big, stood at the edge of the dilapidated ferry terminal on the Seattle side, the rusted metal groaning beneath her feet. This wasn't the glamorous premiere she was used to; no red carpets, flashing cameras, or air kisses from industry darlings. This was the gritty, salt-laced reality of her next project, a far cry from the sun-drenched romantic comedies that had made her name. The ferry, a lumbering beast of steel and grime, represented her voyage into uncharted territory - a psychological thriller set amidst the whispering pines and shrouded secrets of a remote island community.  This was Elara's chance to prove she was more than just a purveyor of happily-ever-afters. This was her chance to finally tell *her* story.
