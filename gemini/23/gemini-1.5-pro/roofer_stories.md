It was called Whisperwood Manor, and it perched precariously atop the highest hill in Oakhaven, a town clinging to the rugged coastline of Maine like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  The salty air, usually crisp and invigorating, hung heavy and thick, promising a thunderstorm later in the day.  Elias squinted at the roiling clouds gathering on the horizon, then back at the sprawling roof stretching out before him like a vast, undulating black sea.  He had a feeling this job, and this house, held more secrets than just leaky shingles.
