The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation Research and Development wing buzzed like trapped insects, their sickly glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Elijah Vance, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his cleaning cart down the deserted hallway.  It was 3:17 AM, the quietest hour in the building, a time when the hum of advanced technology slumbered and the secrets whispered within these walls held their breath.  Outside, a thin sliver of moon hung in the inky sky above the sprawling Zenith campus, nestled deep in the California redwoods.  The air, filtered and recycled endlessly, carried the faint metallic tang of ozone and something else…something Elijah couldn’t quite place, something almost…sweet.
