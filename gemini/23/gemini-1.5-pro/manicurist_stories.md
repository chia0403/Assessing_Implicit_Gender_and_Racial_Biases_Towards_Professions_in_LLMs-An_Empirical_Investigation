The bell above the door to "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed psychic's shop, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose gossip traveled faster than her motorized scooter.  Elara Celeste Dubois, whose own perfectly manicured hands moved with balletic grace as she buffed a client's nails, plastered a welcoming smile on her face. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, hazy shadows across the cracked pavement of Bleaker Street, illuminating the swirling dust motes in the humid New Orleans air.  The scent of jasmine from the overflowing window boxes across the street mingled with the sharp chemical tang of acetone, creating a strangely comforting aroma that was uniquely Elara's.  This tiny salon, with its peeling flamingo-pink wallpaper and mismatched furniture, was her kingdom, and she ruled it with a gentle, yet iron-clad, hand. Little did she know, the jingle of that bell heralded more than just Mrs. Henderson's weekly appointment; it heralded the arrival of a secret that would shatter the carefully constructed calm of Elara's world.
