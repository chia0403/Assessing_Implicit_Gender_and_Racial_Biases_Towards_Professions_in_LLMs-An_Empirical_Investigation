The biting November wind whipped across the sprawling grounds of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, stinging Amelia Hayes's cheeks and turning her fingers numb inside her worn leather gloves.  Frost crunched beneath her boots as she trudged past the wolf enclosure, the resident pack’s howls echoing through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks. Oakhaven, nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills of western North Carolina, was a refuge for animals injured or displaced by human encroachment. Amelia, Oakhaven’s sole animal caretaker, had always felt a profound connection to this place, to its wild heart beating beneath a thin veil of civilization. This morning, however, a different kind of chill ran down her spine, colder than any winter wind.  A thick fog clung to the valley, obscuring the familiar sunrise and casting an unsettling pall over the sanctuary.  It was the silence that truly unnerved her.  The usual cacophony of morning greetings – the chattering squirrels, the raucous crows, even the grumpy grumbles of Bartholomew, the resident black bear – was conspicuously absent.  Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
