The insistent London drizzle seemed to mirror the steady drip of anxiety in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's chest.  Her Shoreditch flat, usually a vibrant explosion of colour and half-finished projects, felt oppressive this morning.  Empty coffee cups littered the reclaimed wood table, testaments to a sleepless night wrestling with a particularly demanding client â€“ the notoriously fickle owner of a chain of organic dog groomers.  Amy, clad in paint-splattered overalls and thick-rimmed glasses perched precariously on her nose, stared at the glowing screen of her iMac.  The cursor blinked mockingly beside the half-formed logo, a fluffy poodle silhouette that currently looked more like a deranged cloud. Outside, the grey dawn bled into the brick walls of the former textile factory, painting the large, steel-framed windows a dull pewter.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of rain against the glass was the only sound besides the low hum of the computer and the faint, almost imperceptible, ticking of a vintage clock her grandmother had left her.  It was 7:03 am, and Amy already felt utterly defeated.
