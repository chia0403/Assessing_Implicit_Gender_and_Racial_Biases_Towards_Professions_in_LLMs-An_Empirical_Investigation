Rain lashed against the window of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Grey clouds pressed down on the small town of Havenwood, Oregon, a place usually brimming with the vibrant greens and blues of the Pacific Northwest, but today, even the evergreens seemed to droop under the weight of the downpour. Amy, a Registered Dietitian with a penchant for floral print dresses and a no-nonsense approach to nutrition, tapped a pen against her cluttered desk, a stack of patient files threatening to topple over.  The aroma of damp wool and stale coffee hung in the air, a far cry from the usual cheerful scent of lemon verbena she kept in a diffuser.  Something was off in Havenwood, and it wasn't just the weather.  People were getting sick, a strange lethargy coupled with unusual cravings sweeping through the town like the pervasive damp.  And Amy, with her deep understanding of the connection between food and well-being, was determined to get to the bottom of it.
