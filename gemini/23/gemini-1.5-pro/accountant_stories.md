The chipped porcelain mug, stained a permanent shade of beige from countless cups of instant coffee, warmed Amelia Grace Holloway's hand as a damp November drizzle lashed against the window of her tiny office.  Located above O'Malley's Pub on Elm Street, the single room barely qualified as an office.  Cramped, cluttered with overflowing filing cabinets and precarious stacks of ledgers, it offered a panoramic view of the perpetually grey skies above the equally grey town of Hollow Creek, Pennsylvania. Amelia, a Certified Public Accountant with a penchant for cardigans and a deep-seated dislike for surprises, surveyed the mess with a sigh. Tax season was looming, and the scent of stale beer wafting up through the floorboards was doing little to inspire her.  This year, more than any other, Hollow Creek seemed determined to cling to its reputation as the most uneventful town in the state.  Little did Amelia know, that was about to change.
