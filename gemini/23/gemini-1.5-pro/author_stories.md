Rain lashed against the attic window, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia Hawthorne's typewriter.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light thrown by a battered desk lamp, illuminating the cramped space under the eaves of her Cornish cottage.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose panes and whipping the ivy against the stone walls.  The cottage, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, felt miles from civilization, a fitting sanctuary for a writer wrestling with her latest novel.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The deadline loomed, a menacing shadow stretching across the already chaotic landscape of her manuscript.  This book, her fifth, was meant to be her magnum opus, a sprawling historical fiction epic set during the Cornish tin mining boom.  But the words, usually so readily available, felt trapped, buried beneath layers of self-doubt and the oppressive weight of expectation.
