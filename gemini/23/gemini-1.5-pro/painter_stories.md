The salt spray stung Eliza Jane Cartwright’s face, a familiar welcome. Her easel, lashed precariously to the jagged cliff face with ropes pilfered from a nearby fishing boat, wobbled precariously in the wind.  Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Celtic Sea crashed against the black, basalt cliffs of Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands.  May on the island was a fickle mistress; one moment bathed in sunshine, the next shrouded in a misty drizzle that turned the distant Twelve Bens into ghostly silhouettes. Eliza, bundled in a thick Aran sweater despite the supposed approach of summer, dipped her brush into a vibrant cadmium yellow, her intent gaze fixed on the single, wind-battered hawthorn tree clinging to life on a distant promontory. This tree, a solitary sentinel against the vastness of the Atlantic, was her current obsession, its resilience a mirror to her own. She'd been coming to Inishmore for five years, seeking solace and inspiration in its rugged beauty, and each year the island held her tighter in its grasp.  This year, she felt, was different. This year, she wouldn’t just paint the island. She would become part of it.
