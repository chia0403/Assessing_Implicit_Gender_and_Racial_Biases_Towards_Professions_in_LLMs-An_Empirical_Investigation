The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, stinging Amelia Reyes’s cheeks and turning her breath into fleeting clouds.  She hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, the collar scratching against the viewfinder of her Leica M6, which was nestled securely against her eye.  Below her, the jagged cliffs of Skerryvore, the tallest lighthouse in Scotland, plunged into a churning, iron-grey sea. Gannets wheeled overhead, their piercing cries echoing across the desolate landscape. Amelia, perched precariously on a narrow ledge halfway down the cliff face, ignored the biting wind, the screaming birds, and the dizzying drop.  Her entire world was contained within the small, rectangular frame of her camera lens, searching for the perfect composition – the perfect balance of light, texture, and raw, untamed beauty. This isolated, windswept outpost, miles from the nearest town, was her canvas, and the storm brewing on the horizon was her inspiration.
