The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on freshly waxed linoleum.  Room 3B of Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, Vermont, was a riot of color. Construction paper creations clung precariously to every available surface, from the bulletin board showcasing “Our Amazing Insect Habitats” to the ceiling, where a mobile of hand-painted planets perpetually spun.  Outside, the first fat snowflakes of November began to drift lazily down, dusting the vibrant hues of autumn leaves with a pristine white, heralding the long, cozy winter ahead.  But inside, a storm of a different sort was brewing, one that had nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with a missing class hamster named Captain Nibbles.
