The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Kiss*, a rickety but charming ferry chugging its way towards Isla Mujeres. The turquoise Caribbean shimmered under the relentless Mexican sun, a stark contrast to the brooding grey skies Mia had left behind in Seattle just two days prior. Isla Mujeres, a small island just off the coast of Cancun, was a world away from her usual drizzle-soaked routine.  Here, the air vibrated with the buzz of cicadas and the scent of hibiscus, and the vibrant colours of the buildings lining the approaching shoreline seemed to pulse with a life of their own.  Mia adjusted the brim of her straw hat, a nervous flutter in her stomach.  This was her first solo tour group since getting certified, and the pressure to deliver a "magical experience," as her agency's brochure promised, was immense.  She gripped the laminated itinerary in her hand, the list of activities a tangible reminder of the expectations weighing on her.  The *Mermaid's Kiss* lurched against the dock, the idyllic scene suddenly punctured by the clamor of disembarking passengers.  Mia took a deep breath, plastered a bright smile on her face, and turned to greet her group.
