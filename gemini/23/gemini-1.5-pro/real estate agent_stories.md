Rain lashed against the bay window of Penelope "Penny" Ramirez's office, blurring the usually pristine view of the San Francisco skyline.  The Golden Gate Bridge, typically a majestic rust-colored arc against the cerulean sky, was now swallowed by a churning grey mist. Inside, Pennyâ€™s office, usually a bright and welcoming space with crisp white walls and strategically placed succulents, felt oppressive. The scent of stale coffee mingled with the damp wool of her raincoat, hanging forlornly on the coat stand.  A half-eaten container of Pad Thai sat on her desk, a testament to a lunch hastily consumed between back-to-back viewings.  This relentless November rain had put a damper on the usually bustling San Francisco real estate market, and Penny, despite her normally unflappable optimism, was starting to feel the chill.  This week, she hadn't closed a single deal, and the persistent drip, drip, drip from a leak in the ceiling was beginning to fray her nerves.  She was just about to call it a day when the office door swung open, ushering in a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in shadows.
