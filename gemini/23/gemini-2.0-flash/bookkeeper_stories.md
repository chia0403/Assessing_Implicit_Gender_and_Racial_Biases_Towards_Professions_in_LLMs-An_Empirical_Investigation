## Opening:

Agnes Plumtree adjusted her spectacles, the chain catching momentarily on the stack of invoices threatening to topple from her desk. Sunlight, struggling through the grime-coated window of Spittleworth & Sons Shipping, illuminated a dust mote swirling in the air like a miniature ballerina. She sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic clatter of Mr. Finch, the office clerk, typing away on his ancient Remington. Another Monday, another mountain of debt, another potential aneurysm.

Agnes traced a finger down the column of numbers, her brow furrowed in concentration. She knew these figures intimately; the precise cost of tea chests bound for Calcutta, the exorbitant port fees in Rotterdam, the suspiciously high expense claims of Captain Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw. This particular invoice, however, refused to add up. Three shillings and sixpence were missing. Three shillings and sixpence! It was a pittance, barely enough to buy a loaf of bread, but Agnes Plumtree, Head Bookkeeper of Spittleworth & Sons, would rather face a rabid badger than let a discrepancy like that go unaddressed. Three shillings and sixpence, and the fragile order of the universe teetered on the brink of collapse.

## Setting:

The year is 1888, and Spittleworth & Sons Shipping occupied a narrow, four-story building in the heart of London's bustling East End docklands. The air was thick with the scent of brine, coal smoke, and spices from distant lands. Inside, the office was a testament to Victorian industry, albeit a rather neglected one. Stained mahogany desks were crammed haphazardly together, piled high with ledgers, quill pens, and half-eaten biscuits. Maps of the world, yellowed and peeling, adorned the walls, depicting empires yet to crumble. The floorboards creaked underfoot, a symphony of complaints accompanying every movement. Gas lamps cast a flickering, unreliable light, painting the scene in a perpetual state of twilight. It was a place of relentless activity, of deals brokered and fortunes made (and sometimes lost), all meticulously tracked and balanced by the meticulous hand of Agnes Plumtree.
