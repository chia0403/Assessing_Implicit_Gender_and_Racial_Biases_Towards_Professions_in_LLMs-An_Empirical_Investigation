Okay, here's a story opening, establishing the setting and introducing our forensic psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The stale air of the interrogation room hung heavy, a miasma of cheap coffee and simmering desperation. Fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony, reflecting off the steel table bolted to the floor and the single, mirrored window that whispered secrets to the observation room beyond. Dr. Alistair James Faulkner, his tie loosened and the sleeves of his tailored suit rolled up, leaned forward, his gaze unwavering. Across from him, a young man with haunted eyes and trembling hands chewed nervously on his fingernails, the rhythmic gnawing a counterpoint to the hum of the lights.

"Tell me again, Mr. Peterson," Alistair said, his voice calm and measured, a soothing balm in the oppressive atmosphere. "Tell me about the voices."

**Setting:**

The story's primary setting is the *Cold Spring Correctional Facility*, a maximum-security prison located in a remote, windswept region of upstate New York. The prison itself is a fortress of grey concrete and razor wire, a place designed to contain and isolate. Within Cold Spring, the narrative will focus on the small, sterile office of the forensic psychology department, the claustrophobic interrogation rooms, and the stark, echoing corridors that connect them. Occasional scenes will also take place outside the prison walls, perhaps at crime scenes or Alistair's own home â€“ a stark contrast to the grim reality he faces daily.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Dr. Alistair James Faulkner
*   **Profession:** Forensic Psychologist (Specializing in violent offenders and malingering)
*   **Brief Description:** Alistair is in his late 30s, intelligent, and intensely analytical. He has a sharp mind honed by years of experience and a quiet empathy that allows him to connect with even the most hardened criminals. While dedicated to his work, he carries a subtle weariness beneath his professional demeanor, hinting at the emotional toll his profession exacts. He is meticulous and observant, always searching for the truth beneath the surface, even when it is deeply buried.
