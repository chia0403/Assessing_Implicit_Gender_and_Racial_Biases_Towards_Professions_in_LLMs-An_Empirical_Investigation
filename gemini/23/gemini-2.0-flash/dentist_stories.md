The sterile scent of mint and despair hung heavy in the air of Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, a smell she'd long grown numb to. Sunlight, already weak in late November, struggled to penetrate the frosted glass of the bay window overlooking Chestnut Street. Outside, a light dusting of snow clung to the bare branches of the sycamore trees, mirroring the chill that had settled deep within Amelia's bones. She hadn't seen a patient in nearly two hours.

Hawthorne Dental, her late father's practice, had been her refuge, her responsibility, and now, increasingly, her prison. The old building, with its creaking floorboards and slightly-too-loud radiators, had a charm that appealed to some, but it also carried the weight of generations of Hawthornes bending over open mouths. Amelia had initially embraced the legacy, but lately, the gleam had worn thin.

She sighed, pushing away the half-finished crossword puzzle she'd been attempting and staring at the framed portrait of her father above the reception desk. A warm, reassuring smile beamed out from the photograph, a smile that seemed to mock her current discontent. He’d loved this place, loved the meticulous art of oral hygiene, loved the connection he forged with each patient. Amelia, however, found herself increasingly drawn to the blank canvas she saw in their smiles, the stories unspoken behind the perfect (or imperfect) rows of teeth. She just didn’t know what to do with it.
