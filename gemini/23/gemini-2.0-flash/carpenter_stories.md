The scent of pine and sawdust clung to Arthur Penhaligon like a second skin, a fragrant armor against the sharp January wind whistling through the gaps in the corrugated iron roof of his workshop. He blew on his gloved hands, the movement stirring up a flurry of golden motes dancing in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows.

The rhythmic crash of waves against the harbour wall provided a constant, melancholy soundtrack to Arthurâ€™s work. He hadn't always heard it this clearly. The silence between the crashes used to be filled with the clatter and clang of his chisels, the whine of his saw, the rhythmic thumping of his hammer. Now, it was mostly just the sea.
