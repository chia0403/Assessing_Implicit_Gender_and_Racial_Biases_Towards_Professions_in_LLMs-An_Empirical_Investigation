## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The flash popped, momentarily blinding Margaret "Maggie" Bellwether as she crouched lower, her finger hovering over the shutter.  The old woman, her face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and hardship, barely blinked. She kept her eyes fixed on the horizon, a hawk-like gaze that seemed to pierce the shimmering heat rising off the vast, cracked earth.  Maggie adjusted the focus, trying to capture the precise blend of stoicism and quiet dignity that radiated from the woman.  This wasn't just a portrait; it was a testament. A testament to survival in a land that seemed determined to swallow you whole.

**Setting:**

Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of Redemption Gulch, a ghost town clinging precariously to life in the high desert of Nevada.  The buildings, bleached bone-white by the relentless sun, leaned against each other like weary travelers, their windows vacant eyes staring out at the nothingness.  The air crackled with a dry heat that sucked the moisture from your skin, leaving it tight and stinging. The only sounds were the mournful wail of the wind whistling through broken window panes and the occasional metallic clang of a rusted windmill stubbornly trying to coax water from the barren ground.  The sun, a relentless overlord, ruled Redemption Gulch, and everyone here, from the struggling ranchers to the occasional tourist brave enough to venture off the highway, lived at its mercy.
