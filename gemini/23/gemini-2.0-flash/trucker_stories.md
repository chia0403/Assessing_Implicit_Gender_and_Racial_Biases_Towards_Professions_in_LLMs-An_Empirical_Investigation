The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy with the smell of diesel and damp asphalt. A lone coyote howled in the distance, its mournful cry swallowed by the rumble of idling engines in the desolate truck stop parking lot outside Tucumcari, New Mexico. **Arthur "Artie" Reginald Peterson**, a man built like a brick outhouse with a perpetual five o'clock shadow etched onto his weathered face, squinted at the rising sun, a pale, anemic glow struggling to pierce the hazy horizon. He took a long drag from his lukewarm coffee, the bitter liquid doing little to ward off the bone-deep chill that clung to him.

Artie was perched on the hood of his rig, a beat-up Kenworth W900 he affectionately called "Betsy," its chrome gleaming dully under a layer of grime. The truck stop, "Big Bob's Bites & Brake Repairs," was a haven for weary travelers: a greasy spoon diner, a perpetually overflowing dump bin, and a mechanic shop that sounded like a dentist's torture chamber. Betsy was loaded with a shipment of Yakima apples bound for Austin, Texas â€“ a relatively easy haul, a welcome change from the oversized loads and cross-country sprints he'd been pulling lately.

Artie took another sip of his coffee, the silence broken only by the drone of the nearby interstate. He felt a knot of unease tightening in his stomach, a feeling he hadn't shaken since picking up this particular load. Maybe it was the sheer isolation of the route, or maybe it was just the lingering memory of the last time he was in Texas, a memory he preferred to keep buried deep in the Texas dirt. Whatever it was, Artie Reginald Peterson had a feeling this trip wasn't going to be as easy as it looked.
