**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt toast clung stubbornly to the air, a stark counterpoint to the pristine, steel-and-glass landscape outside Abigail Hawthorne’s apartment window. Another morning, another casualty in the relentless war against the snooze button. Abigail groaned, the sound swallowed by the plush depths of her Egyptian cotton sheets. She knew she should get up. The weekly meeting with the board of directors was looming, and the figures she needed to present weren't exactly singing a harmonious tune. Still, the siren call of inertia was strong, fueled by the meager three hours of sleep she'd managed to steal.

**Setting:**

Abigail Hawthorne's minimalist apartment perched high on the 47th floor of the Zenith Tower in downtown Neo-Manhattan. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the sprawling metropolis, a glittering tapestry of neon and steel that stretched to the hazy horizon. Inside, the décor was a carefully curated collection of modern art and sleek, functional furniture. Stark white walls provided a blank canvas for the vibrant hues of an original Rothko print and a minimalist sculpture that resembled a coiled spring. The kitchen, visible from the open-plan living area, was a testament to efficiency, gleaming with stainless steel appliances and devoid of clutter, save for the offending toaster currently emitting faint wisps of smoke. Everything in the apartment spoke of success, control, and a life meticulously designed. Except, perhaps, for the lingering scent of burnt toast, a small but persistent crack in the facade of perfection.
