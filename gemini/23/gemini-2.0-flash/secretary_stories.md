The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Finch hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the daily grind that Beatrice Eleanor Higgins knew intimately. They flickered above her head, reflecting off the meticulously polished surface of her mahogany desk, a desk that felt less like a workspace and more like a battleground. It was 8:57 AM, and the tension in the air was already thick enough to spread on toast. Beatrice, or Bea as she was usually called (though never by Mr. Sterling himself), meticulously straightened the already perfect stack of files labeled "URGENT," a futile attempt to regain some semblance of control before the day truly began. Outside the panoramic windows of the 27th floor, the city of Chicago was already a swirling vortex of horns and hurried footsteps, a stark contrast to the controlled chaos she anticipated within these walls. Sterling & Finch, a prestigious, if somewhat cutthroat, law firm, was a place where dreams were forged and broken in equal measure, and Beatrice Higgins was right in the thick of it, armed with her steno pad, her impeccable typing skills, and a healthy dose of cynicism earned through five long years of loyal, albeit underappreciated, service.
