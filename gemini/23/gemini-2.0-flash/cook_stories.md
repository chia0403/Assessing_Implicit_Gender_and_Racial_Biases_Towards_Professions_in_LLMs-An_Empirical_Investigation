The acrid tang of burnt garlic hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the delicate perfume of simmering saffron rice that should have been dominating the kitchen.  Madeline Evangeline Dubois, known to most as Maddie, frantically waved a tea towel, trying to dispel the smoke clinging stubbornly to her hair.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore was a constant, almost comforting counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of culinary disaster currently unfolding before her.

Maddie was the head cook, and for all intents and purposes, the entire kitchen staff, at "The Gull's Rest," a charming but perpetually understaffed inn perched precariously on the cliffside overlooking the tempestuous Cornish coast. The inn itself was a jumble of whitewashed stone and crooked timbers, weathered by centuries of salty winds.  Inside, it was a haven of warm, honeyed light and crackling fireplaces, furnished with mismatched antiques and the comforting scent of beeswax.  The kitchen, however, was another story. It was a cramped space, dominated by a temperamental old Aga oven and a collection of pots and pans that had seen better days.  Tonight, it was also the scene of her humiliation.  Lady Beatrice Ashworth, a notoriously demanding food critic with a reputation for tearing establishments apart with a single, well-placed phrase, was due to arrive in less than an hour. And Maddie, with the garlic blackening in the pan and the saffron rice threatening to turn to mush, felt the weight of the entire inn resting squarely on her flour-dusted shoulders.
