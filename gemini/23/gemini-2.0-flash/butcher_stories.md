## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and blood, a perfume that clung to Arthur Bartholomew Finch like a second skin, was particularly potent this morning. He took a deep, appreciative breath, the cool air stinging his nostrils with the sharpness of hanging beef and the earthy musk of freshly-cut wood. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, barely hinting at the promise of a new day. Inside, Finch & Son, Butchers, was a beacon of warm, oily lamplight, casting long, dancing shadows across the rows of glistening sausages and the hulking carcasses suspended from gleaming hooks.

Arthur Bartholomew Finch, proprietor, chief butcher, and legacy incarnate, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. A stray wisp of hay clung to a particularly plump pork belly. He flicked it away with a grunt, his thick, calloused fingers leaving a temporary indentation in the fat. He’d been at it since he was knee-high to a cleaver, learning the trade at his father's side, and his grandfather's before that. He knew every cut, every marbling pattern, every scent and texture, as intimately as he knew the lines etched into his own weathered face.

But today, the familiar comfort of his butcher shop felt…off. A tremor of unease, unfamiliar and unwelcome, prickled at the back of his neck. He chalked it up to the approaching market day frenzy. The townsfolk of Oakhaven were always ravenous on market days, and the weight of expectation, the pressure to provide the finest, freshest cuts, always bore down on him like a lead apron. Still, the unease lingered, a phantom bone stuck in his throat.

## Setting:

**Finch & Son, Butchers, Oakhaven, a quaint and somewhat isolated village nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, England. Late 1880s.**

The shop itself is a low-slung building with a half-timbered facade, its age evident in the bowing of the beams and the uneven flagstone floor. The front windows are fogged with condensation, offering only a blurry glimpse of the street outside. Inside, it's a sensory overload: the aforementioned smells of meat and sawdust mix with the metallic tang of iron and the sweet, almost cloying aroma of the spiced rubs Arthur uses.

Along one wall runs a long, marble counter, stained in places with years of use and meticulously cleaned each evening. Behind it, a vast array of knives, cleavers, and saws hang on hooks, their blades reflecting the lamplight in a menacing gleam. Hanging from the rafters are rows upon rows of cured meats, sausages, and various cuts of beef, pork, and lamb, carefully tagged and arranged. A large meat grinder sits in the corner, its handle gleaming with constant polishing. The back room houses a cold storage area, powered by ice harvested from the nearby river during the winter months, and a smaller space for slaughtering the animals, though Arthur prefers to source his meat from the surrounding farms whenever possible.

Oakhaven itself is a village steeped in tradition and superstition, a place where the old ways die hard. The surrounding Dales are rugged and unforgiving, isolating the villagers and fostering a close-knit, and sometimes suspicious, community. The air is often thick with mist, clinging to the stone buildings and creating an atmosphere of both beauty and unease.
