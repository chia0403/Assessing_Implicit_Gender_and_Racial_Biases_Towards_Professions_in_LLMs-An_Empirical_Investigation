## The Story Opening:

The first rays of dawn, the color of bruised peaches, kissed the dew-laden grass of Ravenswood Cemetery. Angus MacMillan, his breath misting in the crisp morning air, leaned heavily on his trusty spade. A persistent ache throbbed in his lower back, a familiar complaint after a long winter of battling snow and stubborn roots. But the ache was a comfort in a way, a reminder that he was still here, still moving, still capable. He surveyed his domain, the silent city of stone and green, and frowned.

A rogue wind had been at work during the night, scattering fallen leaves like confetti across the meticulously raked paths. A low branch on the ancient weeping willow near the mausoleum of the Blackwood family had snapped, its brittle end dangling precariously. Angus sighed, a weary sound that was swallowed by the stillness of Ravenswood. He was, as always, the first to witness its minor catastrophes, the first to tend to its wounds. He straightened, adjusted the worn tweed cap perched atop his head, and muttered, "Right then, let's get to it."

## The Setting:

**Ravenswood Cemetery** sits on a gentle hill overlooking the sprawling city of Atheria. It's a sprawling, Victorian-era necropolis, a place of winding paths, towering monuments, and ancient trees that seem to whisper secrets to the wind. The air is perpetually damp, thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the faintest hint of lavender, left behind by grieving visitors.

The cemetery is a labyrinth of marble and granite, a testament to lives lived and lost. Mausoleums stand like silent sentinels, their stained-glass windows depicting scenes of biblical grandeur. Elaborately carved headstones mark the final resting places of Atheria's prominent families, their inscriptions faded by time and weather.

Interspersed among the grand memorials are simpler plots, marked by weathered wooden crosses or small, unassuming stone markers. These are the graves of the ordinary citizens, the forgotten souls who now rest in the shadow of the wealthy and powerful.

Despite its mournful purpose, Ravenswood possesses a haunting beauty. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the moss-covered stones. Birds sing in the branches, their melodies a counterpoint to the somber atmosphere. Foxes and squirrels dart through the undergrowth, oblivious to the solemnity of the place.

For Angus MacMillan, Ravenswood is more than just a cemetery; it's his home, his sanctuary, his life's work. He knows every path, every grave, every tree. He is the keeper of its secrets, the guardian of its peace. And in a way, he is as much a part of Ravenswood as the stones themselves.
