The smell of stale coffee and quiet desperation hung thick in the air of the Community Corrections Center of San Bernardino County. Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the linoleum floor worn smooth by countless shuffling feet. Desperate, shuffling feet like those belonging to Reginald "Reggie" Dupree, just released on parole after serving three years for aggravated assault, and currently pacing outside the office door of one Ms. Eleanor Ainsworth, Probation Officer.

Eleanor Ainsworth, fresh out of her psychology degree and even fresher into the realities of the job, took a deep breath and adjusted her glasses. The air conditioning wheezed weakly, doing little to combat the sweltering California heat that baked against the concrete walls. Her office was small, crammed with a secondhand desk, a chipped filing cabinet overflowing with case files, and a whiteboard covered in a chaotic scrawl of appointments and reminders. On the wall, a motivational poster featuring a sunrise over a field of daisies offered a bleakly ironic counterpoint to the grittiness of her daily life. It was Thursday, the day she met with the parolees released that week, and Reggie Dupree was first on her list. This was it. The real work. Time to see if all those textbooks and lectures meant a damn thing.
