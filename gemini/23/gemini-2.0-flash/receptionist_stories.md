## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The stark, minimalist lobby of "Echelon Analytics," a gleaming skyscraper that pierced the perpetually overcast Seattle sky. The walls were a sterile white, punctuated by a single, abstract sculpture resembling a shattered circuit board. The air hummed with the low thrum of the building's ventilation system and the distant tapping of keyboards echoing from the floors above. Outside, a relentless drizzle blurred the city into a watercolor painting of grey and green.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne sighed, the sound barely audible over the muted jazz playlist piped into the Echelon Analytics lobby. Another morning, another deluge. She glanced at the clock mounted above the sleek, reception desk crafted from polished concrete: 7:57 AM. Still early. Too early for Mr. Finch's daily tirade about the cost of printer paper, too early for the barrage of anxious calls from potential investors.

Eleanor straightened the meticulously arranged succulents on her desk for the tenth time.  Each leaf was perfectly aligned, a tiny bastion of order against the impending chaos of the day. She was a master of order, a conductor of calm in a world that seemed increasingly determined to unravel.  A skill she'd perfected in her four years at Echelon, a company whose mission was to predict the future, but whose present, Eleanor often thought, was remarkably predictable.

Suddenly, the double glass doors whispered open and a figure, drenched to the bone and looking like a drowned rat, stumbled inside, shaking off droplets like a soggy Saint Bernard. Eleanor's heart sank. This was going to be one of *those* days.
