## Story Opening:

The air in the drafting office hung thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and the metallic tang of grinding pencils. Sunlight, weak and watery even at midday, filtered through the grimy windows of the Empire Ironworks building, casting long shadows across Amelia Jane Fairbanks' drafting table. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, chewed on the end of her pencil, the graphite leaving a faint grey smudge on her upper lip. She traced a delicate line on the blueprint, the meticulous detail a stark contrast to the roaring clamor that perpetually emanated from the foundry below. Today's project was a particularly challenging one: a new support beam design for the upcoming expansion. Amelia knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that if this beam wasn't perfect, people would get hurt. And she, Amelia Jane Fairbanks, would be responsible.

## Setting:

The year is 1938. The location is the sprawling, smoke-choked city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a heartland of American industry. Specifically, Amelia works in the drafting office of Empire Ironworks, a grimy, red-brick building nestled precariously close to the Monongahela River. The drafting office itself is a long, narrow room on the second floor, its walls painted a faded, institutional green. Rows of large drafting tables, each cluttered with blueprints, pencils, rulers, and other tools of the trade, fill the space. The windows, though offering a glimpse of the bustling cityscape, are perpetually coated in a layer of soot and grime. The sounds of the foundry – the clanging of hammers, the hiss of steam, the rumble of heavy machinery – permeate every corner of the building, a constant reminder of the raw power and inherent dangers of the ironworking trade. It's a place of relentless noise, grit, and unwavering dedication to the creation of steel, the backbone of a nation poised on the brink of war.
