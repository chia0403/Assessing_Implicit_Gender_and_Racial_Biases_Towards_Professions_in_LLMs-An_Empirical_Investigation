The stale scent of wintergreen and fluoride hung in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Rose Albright as she unlocked the door to Bright Smiles Dental on Elm Street. Outside, the February wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the frosted windows. Inside, the linoleum, meticulously polished to a blinding shine, reflected the weak morning light.

Bright Smiles wasn’t exactly Eleanor’s dream office. Dr. Krill, her boss, was a man who believed in quantity over quality, often scheduling back-to-back appointments with barely enough time for a quick sanitizing wipe-down between patients. The chairs were a faded seafoam green, relics from a bygone era, and the posters plastered on the walls – cheerful cartoon teeth brandishing toothbrushes – were more likely to induce nightmares in the children than inspire good oral hygiene. Still, it was a job. And after graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in Dental Hygiene, a job was precisely what Eleanor needed.

Eleanor hung her coat, a sensible, practical, and decidedly unfashionable parka, on the rickety coat rack by the reception desk. The beige walls seemed to absorb all the light, leaving the waiting area in a perpetual state of twilight. She sighed, flipping on the overhead fluorescent lights which buzzed and flickered for a moment before settling into their monotonous hum. Time to face another day of plaque, tartar, and the endless chorus of "but I *do* floss regularly!" from patients who clearly didn't. Today's schedule was a beast: Mrs. Henderson, who somehow managed to accumulate enough buildup to rival the Grand Canyon despite claiming to use a water pick three times a day; little Timmy Johnson, notorious for biting anything that came near his mouth; and, worst of all, Mr. Silas Blackwood, a notoriously chatty and slightly creepy old man who always tried to hold her hand.

Eleanor took a deep breath. At least she had her music. Slipping on her headphones, she cranked up her "Early Morning Energy Boost" playlist, hoping that the relentless cheerfulness of ABBA would somehow inoculate her against the day ahead. Bright Smiles Dental on Elm Street: where dreams went to die, one tooth cleaning at a time. Or, at least, that’s how Eleanor Rose Albright felt some days.
