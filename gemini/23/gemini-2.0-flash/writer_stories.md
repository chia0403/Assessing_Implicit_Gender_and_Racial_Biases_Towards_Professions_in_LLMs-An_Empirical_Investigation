The chipped porcelain mug, stained a permanent shade of Earl Grey brown, warmed Elias Thorne’s hands as he stared out the rain-streaked window. October had bled into November in a mournful, grey wash over the Scottish Highlands, painting the loch below his cottage the color of bruised plums. This was the kind of weather that bred inspiration, or so he told himself. More often, it bred a relentless ache in his bones and a deep-seated suspicion that he'd chosen the wrong career, the wrong life, and possibly even the wrong continent.

Elias Thorne, bestselling author of the *The Raven's Shadow* fantasy series, was currently suffering from a monumental case of writer's block. The deadline for the fourth and final installment, *The Raven's Light*, loomed like a particularly unpleasant gargoyle. He’d tried everything: hiking through the heather-covered hills, copious amounts of whisky, even attempting to converse with the surly sheep that grazed on the common land. All to no avail. His manuscript remained a desolate wasteland of half-formed sentences and abandoned plot threads.

The cottage itself, "Cnoc na h-Iolaire" – Eagle Hill in Gaelic – was a traditional stone structure, stubbornly clinging to the hillside. Inside, it was a chaotic mix of rustic charm and Elias's own peculiar brand of organized chaos. Bookshelves overflowing with everything from Tolkien to Terry Pratchett lined the walls. Maps of fictional realms were pinned haphazardly beside faded postcards. And everywhere, everywhere, there were notebooks filled with scribbled notes, discarded ideas, and the occasional doodle of a particularly grumpy-looking raven. The air, thick with the scent of damp wool and old paper, felt both comforting and suffocating. He needed a breakthrough, a spark, something to ignite the dying embers of his imagination, or *The Raven's Light* would remain forever in the darkness.
