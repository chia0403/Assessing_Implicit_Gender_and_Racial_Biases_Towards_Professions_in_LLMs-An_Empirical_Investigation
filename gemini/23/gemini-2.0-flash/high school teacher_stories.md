The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ancient projector lulled half the class of seventeen-year-olds into a near-comatose state. Outside, the October sky threatened a deluge, mirroring the turbulent feeling churning in the gut of Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Finch, AP English teacher at Northwood High. On the screen, a grainy image of a young Marlon Brando smoldered. She knew the scene by heart, the simmering rage in Stanley Kowalski’s eyes a sharp contrast to the weary apathy radiating from her students.

Northwood High, nestled in the sleepy, perpetually-grey town of Ashwood, Oregon, was a monument to fading glory. Built in the 1950s, the brick building groaned under the weight of peeling paint and outdated textbooks. Funding cuts had ravaged the arts and humanities programs, leaving Eleanor feeling like a lone knight battling a dragon with a rusty spoon. The air, thick with the scent of floor wax and lukewarm cafeteria pizza, held a pervasive aroma of quiet desperation, a feeling Eleanor knew all too well. Her life, like the school, felt…stagnant.

She’d arrived at Northwood fresh out of college, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to ignite a passion for literature in the minds of the youth. Fifteen years later, she was mostly just trying to survive the endless parent-teacher conferences, the standardized testing pressures, and the slow, soul-crushing realization that most of her students cared more about their TikTok feed than Tennessee Williams.
