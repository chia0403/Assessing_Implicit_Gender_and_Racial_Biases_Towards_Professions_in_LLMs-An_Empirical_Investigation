The clang of steel against steel was a familiar song to Arthur "Art" Kowalski. He inhaled, the scent of concrete dust and diesel fuel a peculiar perfume that clung to his clothes and settled in his lungs. Up here, on the skeletal frame of what would eventually be the thirtieth floor of the new Pinnacle Tower, the world stretched out like a rumpled, grey blanket. The sky, a bruised violet in the early morning light, was just starting to show cracks of dawn, painting the edges of the skyscrapers with a fiery orange.

Art wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the gritty residue leaving a streak across his forehead. He tightened the bolt he'd been working on, the rhythmic ratcheting a steady counterpoint to the drone of the city waking below. Below him, the sprawling metropolis of Steelhaven, a city built on industry and ambition, pulsed with life. Yellow cabs, like swarms of angry bees, buzzed through the arteries of the streets, their headlights cutting through the pre-dawn gloom. He could almost smell the coffee brewing in the greasy spoons on Elm Street and hear the rhythmic thump of the subway rumbling beneath his steel-toed boots.

This particular construction site was wedged between the established financial district and the burgeoning tech hub, a physical testament to Steelhaven’s constant growth. The Pinnacle Tower, a sleek, modern monstrosity of glass and steel, was destined to be the tallest building in the city, a symbol of power and progress. Art, ironically, felt none of that power. He just felt the ache in his back, the sting of the wind against his calloused hands, and the gnawing emptiness in his stomach. Another day, another floor closer to the sky. Another dollar closer to… well, he wasn’t quite sure what anymore.
