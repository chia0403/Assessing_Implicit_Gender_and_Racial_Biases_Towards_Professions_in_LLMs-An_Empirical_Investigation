The air in the Starlight Theatre reeked of dust, old costumes, and ambition, a familiar scent that usually invigorated Arthur Benedict Davenport. Tonight, however, the aroma felt oppressive, clinging to him like a particularly persistent stage fog. He slumped in one of the plush, crimson seats, usually reserved for opening night patrons, his gaze fixed on the empty stage.

The Starlight, a grand, though slightly faded, Art Deco palace nestled in the heart of Providence, Rhode Island, had been Arthurâ€™s sanctuary, his canvas, his battlefield for the past fifteen years. Its gilded proscenium arch, depicting scenes from classic plays, felt less celebratory tonight and more like a mocking reminder of past glories. The theatre itself had seen better days, the velvet curtains frayed at the edges and the once-gleaming chandelier now dulled with grime. But its acoustics were impeccable, and its history was rich, breathing with the ghosts of countless performances and forgotten dreams.

Arthur sighed, running a hand through his already dishevelled silver hair. He was, at fifty-seven, feeling every one of those years, the weight of them pressing down on him like a poorly constructed set piece. The opening of "King Lear" was just three weeks away, and the play, much like Arthur himself, felt on the verge of collapse.
