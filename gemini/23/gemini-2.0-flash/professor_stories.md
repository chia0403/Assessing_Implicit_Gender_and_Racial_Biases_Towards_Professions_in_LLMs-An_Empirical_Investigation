## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The musty, parchment-scented air hung heavy in Professor Alistair Humphrey Blackwood's study, a familiar blanket of academic comfort. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful dirge around the ancient spires of St. Augustine's University, rattling the leaded glass windows of his office. He barely registered it. Lost in the labyrinthine logic of a particularly dense passage from the *De Occulta Philosophia*, Alistair tapped the stem of his worn briar pipe against his teeth, a low, rhythmic click that punctuated the silence like a nervous heartbeat. He’d been wrestling with Agrippa’s assertion of elemental spirits for weeks, and the elusive meaning danced just beyond his grasp, tantalizing and infuriating in equal measure. He pulled a well-worn copy of the *Key of Solomon* closer, its pages brittle and foxed with age. This was it. This had to be the key. Or, at least, a damn good starting point.
 
**Setting:**

The year is 1928. St. Augustine's University, a gothic behemoth steeped in tradition and shrouded in ivy, sits perched on a windswept hill overlooking the sleepy coastal town of Blackwood, England. The university is renowned for its rigorous academic standards, particularly in the fields of Classics and History. Professor Blackwood's study, located on the third floor of the Old Humanities Building, is a chaotic yet meticulously organized sanctuary. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves overflow with ancient texts, maps, and arcane tomes. Scattered across his mahogany desk are stacks of research papers, quill pens, inkwells, and various oddities: a fossilized ammonite, a tarnished silver locket, and a curious collection of dried herbs. The room is dimly lit by a single desk lamp, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to breathe life into the countless faces staring out from the spines of the books. The overall atmosphere is one of scholarly dedication, bordering on obsession, and a palpable sense of secrets hidden within the university's ancient stones.
