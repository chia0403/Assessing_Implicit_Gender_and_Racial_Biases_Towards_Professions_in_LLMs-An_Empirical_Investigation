The stale scent of instant coffee and simmering anxiety clung to the air in the guidance counselor's office like a stubborn perfume. Dust motes danced in the weak November sunlight that filtered through the blinds, casting stripes across the worn, blue carpet. A half-eaten apple sat, browning, next to a precarious stack of college pamphlets on the corner of the desk.

This was the domain of Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, Guidance Counselor, a woman whose soothing voice and empathetic eyes had guided countless teenagers through the turbulent waters of adolescence. She knew every chipped tile in the bathroom down the hall, the squeaky wheel on Mr. Henderson's cart, and the precise number of motivational posters adorning the walls ("Believe in Your Dreams!" was currently mocking her from above the filing cabinet).

Eleanor, however, felt anything but motivated. She was slumped in her ergonomic chair, a cold compress pressed to her forehead, a battle raging behind her eyes. Today, the weight of every college application, every teenage drama, every parental expectation felt impossibly heavy. Today, she felt like she needed guidance more than any of the students who would undoubtedly be knocking on her door any minute now.
