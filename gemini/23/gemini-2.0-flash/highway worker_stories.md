## Story Opening:

The screech of metal against asphalt was a familiar song to Eugene “Gene” Patrick O’Connell. He barely flinched as the eighteen-wheeler roared past, its wake vibrating the orange cone he was placing with practiced ease. He straightened, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his grime-stained glove, and squinted at the heat-hazed horizon. Another scorcher. At least he’d gotten the ice water refilled in his thermos before starting this shift. He glanced at his partner, Maria, who was operating the traffic control flag a few feet away, her face hidden beneath the brim of her hardhat. He knew she felt it too – the oppressive, shimmering heat that clung to everything like a stubborn dust.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds on a seemingly endless stretch of Interstate 80, baking under the merciless July sun in the desolate plains of Wyoming. The asphalt, perpetually marked with the ghosts of tire treads, stretches as far as the eye can see, punctuated only by the occasional billboard advertising truck stops and roadside attractions. To the south, a hazy range of distant, arid mountains offers little relief from the monotony of the landscape. To the north, the terrain is equally unforgiving – a flat expanse of scrub brush and withered grass, broken only by the occasional lonely barbed-wire fence.

The work zone itself is clearly marked with a string of orange cones and flashing warning signs. The rhythmic drone of a generator powers the electronic message board that warns drivers of the ongoing road maintenance. The air hangs heavy with the smell of hot asphalt and exhaust fumes, a potent cocktail that assaults the senses with every passing vehicle. The crew’s battered pick-up truck, adorned with safety lights and the name of the highway maintenance company, sits parked on the shoulder, its tires sunk slightly into the soft asphalt. It’s a landscape of harsh beauty and brutal practicality, where the relentless sun dictates the rhythm of life and the hum of the highway is the only constant.
