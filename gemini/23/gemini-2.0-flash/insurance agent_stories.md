## Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed the palms of Bernard "Bernie" Humphrey as he stared out the rain-streaked window. It was a Tuesday, the kind of relentlessly grey Tuesday that screamed 'insurance claim' even before the phone lines lit up. He took a long, slow sip of lukewarm Earl Grey, the bitter tang doing little to cut through the pervasive gloom. Outside, Elmwood Drive looked like a watercolor painting bled out, the vibrant fall foliage now a muted, depressing brown. A robin, puffed up against the chill, hopped across the saturated lawn of Mrs. Hawthorne's prize-winning rose bushes, looking as miserable as he felt.

Bernie sighed. Tuesdays. They always brought the bizarre, the unfortunate, and the downright unbelievable. Last week, it had been a rogue swarm of honeybees that had somehow managed to dismantle a car engine. The week before? A llama, loose from a petting zoo, had taken a particular liking to a freshly painted minivan. He never knew what mayhem the day would hold.

He ran a hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, leaving it standing in even more disarray. He had a stack of paperwork threatening to topple off his desk, a voicemail box overflowing with panicked homeowners and dented-car drivers, and a nagging feeling that today’s particular brand of chaos would be even more…memorable.

## Setting:

Bernie Humphrey's office was located in a modest, single-story building on the outskirts of the small town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The building, painted a faded beige that had seen better days, housed "Humphrey & Son Insurance," though the "Son" part was more aspirational than accurate. Bernie had been running the agency himself ever since his son, David, had traded spreadsheets for surfboards and moved to California to "find himself" (and, according to Bernie's wife, "find a decent tan").

Inside, the office reflected Bernie's practical, if slightly cluttered, personality. A large oak desk dominated the space, buried under piles of policy brochures, claim forms, and half-eaten packets of stale crackers. The walls were adorned with framed diplomas from various insurance courses, a slightly out-of-date calendar featuring kittens playing with yarn, and a faded photograph of Bernie with a beaming, sun-kissed David holding a particularly impressive tuna. The air always smelled faintly of paper, old coffee, and a hint of desperation.
