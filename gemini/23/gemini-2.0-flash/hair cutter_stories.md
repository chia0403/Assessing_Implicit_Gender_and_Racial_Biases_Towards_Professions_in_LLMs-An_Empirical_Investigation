Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hair cutter:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped down Elm Street, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes that danced around ankles and chased after stray hot dog wrappers. It was mid-October in the small, perpetually damp town of Stillwater, Oregon, and the first hints of winter’s icy grip were already starting to creep into the air. Most of the businesses on Elm were closed, the only signs of life being the flickering neon sign of the "Corner Cafe" and the warm yellow glow spilling from the window of "Clippers & Curls," a small, unassuming barbershop nestled between a bakery and a taxidermist.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer.  Esmeralda "Esme" Guadalupe Rivera sighed, tucking a stray strand of her own dark, curly hair behind her ear.  She'd been staring out the window at the depressing weather, idly tracing patterns on the condensation with a fingertip.  Another Thursday evening in Stillwater, another potential client, another chance to turn someone's bad day into a slightly less bad one.

"Come on in, out of the cold!" Esme called out, already reaching for a clean barber cape. She hoped whoever it was wanted something simple. She was tired, and her hands were starting to ache from the endless parade of trims and touch-ups she'd performed all day.  She just wanted to close up shop, brew a pot of her grandmother’s chamomile tea, and curl up with a good book. But duty called. She was Esmeralda Guadalupe Rivera, after all, and Clippers & Curls was more than just a barbershop; it was a community hub, a listening ear, a place where even the most disastrous hair day could be salvaged – or at least, made a little more bearable.
