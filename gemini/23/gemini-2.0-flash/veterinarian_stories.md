The scent of disinfectant battled with the sharp tang of goat urine in the air, a familiar and oddly comforting aroma to Dr. Evelyn Grace Ainsworth. She surveyed the scene before her, a chaotic ballet of distressed bleats and flapping wings. It was a Tuesday, which, in her experience, was indistinguishable from a Monday or a Wednesday at the Ainsworth Veterinary Clinic, the only vet practice for a twenty-mile radius in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley.

Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windows of the converted barn, cast long shadows across the packed earth floor. Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning Nubian goat, Buttercup, was in the throes of a difficult labor, its flanks heaving with each strained push. Simultaneously, a frantic Mr. Peterson cradled a bloodied rooster, Henny Penny, whose puffed-up chest was decorated with the irate pecks of its barnyard rivals. And in the corner, nestled in a cardboard box lined with a threadbare blanket, whimpered a litter of newborn kittens, their tiny bodies shivering from a sudden chill.

This was Evelynâ€™s world: a patchwork of mud-caked overalls, frayed stethoscopes, and the unwavering trust of the local farmers who relied on her expertise to keep their livelihoods, and often their companions, healthy and thriving. She pulled on her well-worn gloves, the leather softened by years of use, and squared her shoulders. Another day, another menagerie of maladies to conquer. First, Buttercup. Then Henny Penny. And finally, those shivering kittens. She just hoped she had enough cat milk replacer left. This was going to be a long one.
