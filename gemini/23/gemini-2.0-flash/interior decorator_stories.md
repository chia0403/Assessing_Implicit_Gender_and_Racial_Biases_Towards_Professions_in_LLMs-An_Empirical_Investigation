## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** Charleston, South Carolina, late October. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine, a deceptive sweetness masking the coming chill. Historic houses, painted in pastel hues, line the cobblestone streets, their wrought-iron balconies draped with creeping vines. In the evenings, the gas lamps flicker to life, casting a warm, romantic glow on the scene.

**Opening:**

The grand old dame was sagging like a forgotten debutante, her paint peeling, shutters askew, and a general air of despair clinging to her like Spanish moss.  She took a deep breath, the scent of jasmine warring with the pungent odor of decay emanating from within. "Alright, Lady Tradd," she said, her voice echoing in the empty street, "let's see what we can do about that."
