## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy with the promise of rain, a greasy humidity clinging to everything like desperation. Jethro Silas McKnight wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of ochre dirt in its wake. He squinted up at the scarred face of Mount Cinder, a behemoth of volcanic rock and stubborn soil that refused to yield easily to progress. The mountain, once a majestic scar on the horizon, was now a chewed-up, ravaged landscape, courtesy of the upcoming highway expansion. And courtesy, primarily, of Jethro Silas McKnight.

He adjusted his worn, baseball cap, emblazoned with the faded logo of "McKnight & Son Excavating," a legacy that now only echoed in his own weary bones. Jethro took a swig from his lukewarm water bottle, the metallic tang doing little to quench the thirst that seemed permanently lodged in his throat these days. He felt a familiar ache in his lower back, a constant reminder of the years spent wrestling tons of steel and earth. The smell of diesel and damp earth filled his nostrils, a scent that once thrilled him, now just another reminder of the long, lonely days ahead.

He glanced at the clock on the dashboard of his battered Ford F-250. 5:47 AM. Too early for this, he thought, but then, it was always too early for this.

## Setting:

The story is set in the rugged, economically depressed region of **Ash Valley, Oregon**. Mount Cinder, a dormant volcano, dominates the landscape, its slopes covered in scrub brush and stunted trees. Ash Valley is a small town, struggling to survive on dwindling logging and farming industries. The upcoming highway expansion promises to bring jobs and economic revitalization, but it also threatens the natural beauty and tranquility that some residents, like Jethro, still cling to.

The immediate setting is a **construction site on the lower slopes of Mount Cinder.** It's a chaotic scene of bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, and graders, all churning through the earth. Piles of dirt and rock are everywhere, and the air is constantly filled with dust. The site is bordered by a thin strip of trees on one side and a steep drop-off on the other, offering breathtaking, albeit unsettling, views of the valley below. A small, weather-beaten trailer serves as the site office and break room, its peeling paint a stark contrast to the shiny, new machinery surrounding it. The overall atmosphere is one of relentless progress battling against a stubborn, unforgiving landscape.
