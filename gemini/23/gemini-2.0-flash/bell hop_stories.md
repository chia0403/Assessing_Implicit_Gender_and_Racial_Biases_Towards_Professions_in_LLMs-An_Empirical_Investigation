Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of the main character, a bellhop:

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel stood sentinel against the perpetually overcast Seattle sky. Its gothic spires, draped in ivy thicker than a man’s arm, clawed towards the heavens, a silent testament to a bygone era of opulence and hushed grandeur. Inside, the lobby hummed with a muted energy - the click-clack of heels on marble, the hushed tones of conversations, the distant tinkling of a piano from the cocktail lounge. Crystal chandeliers cast a soft, golden glow upon the Persian rugs and the mahogany reception desk, where Mr. Abernathy, the perpetually stern manager, surveyed his domain with the hawk-like gaze of a seasoned general.

**Story Opening:**

Percival Bartholomew Butterfield adjusted the brim of his slightly too-small bellhop hat and forced a cheerful smile. It was a smile he'd practiced in the mirror a thousand times, a smile designed to disarm even the most travel-weary of guests. Tonight, however, it felt particularly difficult to maintain. The air in the Grand Majestic Hotel seemed thicker than usual, charged with a nervous electricity that even the soothing strains of Cole Porter from the cocktail lounge couldn't dissipate. He'd been on duty for twelve hours, lugging suitcases and ushering guests to their rooms, and his feet throbbed with a dull, persistent ache. But the ache in his feet was nothing compared to the creeping unease that had settled in his stomach ever since Mrs. Hawthorne, the hotel's resident ghost story enthusiast, had whispered about strange occurrences in the abandoned North Wing earlier that afternoon. Percival, a man who preferred the mundane realities of tips and room service requests, did his best to ignore her. Still, he found himself glancing nervously towards the ornate, brass-gated elevators, hoping, and perhaps fearing, that they wouldn't be summoned to the fabled thirteenth floor. And then, the familiar chime of the lobby’s main entrance bell shattered the uneasy silence, announcing the arrival of a new guest – a cloaked figure, shrouded in shadow and mystery, who seemed to exhale the very unease Percival was trying so hard to ignore.
