## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting December wind howled through the narrow streets of Edinburghâ€™s Old Town, swirling leaves and snatching at exposed skin. Cobblestones, slick with rain, reflected the hazy orange glow of gas lamps, painting the scene in a perpetual chiaroscuro. The air tasted of damp stone, coal smoke, and a faint hint of peat. Inside, the warmth of "The Sheep Heid Inn" offered a meager reprieve.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist whose face usually held a composure that bordered on serene, nervously chewed the inside of her cheek. The dim light of the pub struggled to penetrate the shadows that seemed to cling to her tonight, mirroring the uneasy feeling coiling in her stomach. She gripped the stem of her wine glass a little too tightly, the chill liquid doing little to soothe her rapidly drying throat. Across the worn wooden table, Detective Inspector Alasdair McGregor, a man whose weathered face told stories of countless sleepless nights and brutal realities, cleared his throat. "So, Dr. Vance," he began, his voice a low rumble that barely rose above the boisterous chatter and clinking glasses, "you're absolutely certain you can't recall anything else from the session? Anything at all that might shed some light on where he might have gone?"
