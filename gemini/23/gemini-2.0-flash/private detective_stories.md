The clatter of the rain against the corrugated iron roof of my office sounded less like nature's lullaby and more like a relentless debt collector banging on the door. It was a fitting soundtrack, really. Most of my days felt like being hounded by something, usually unpaid bills and lingering regrets. I took another swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to dispel the chill that had settled deep in my bones. Even the flickering neon sign outside â€“ "Dexter Blackwood, Investigations" - seemed to mock my profession, its sputtering light barely illuminating the grimy alleyway below.

My office, perched precariously above O'Malley's Irish Pub in the heart of the Docklands District of New Galveston, was a study in organised chaos. Piles of files teetered on the edge of my battered mahogany desk, threatening to avalanche at any moment. Cigarette burns scarred the worn leather armchair, a testament to too many sleepless nights and too much nicotine. The only splash of colour came from a faded, framed photograph of my late wife, Lily, her smile a distant beacon in the perpetual gloom.

Tonight, though, even her memory couldn't penetrate the oppressive weight of boredom that had settled upon me. New Galveston, with its gritty charm and undercurrent of simmering violence, had been unusually quiet lately. Too quiet. Just as I was about to resign myself to another night of solitaire and stale coffee, the buzzer on my door crackled to life.
