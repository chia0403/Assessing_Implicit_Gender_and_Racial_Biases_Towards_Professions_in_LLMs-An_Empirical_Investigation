The smell of oil, burnt rubber, and regret clung to the air in Benny's Garage like a stubborn ex. Outside, the August sun beat down on the faded brick building, baking the dusty lot where a graveyard of rusted-out dreams sat simmering. Inside, it was cooler, but only just. The oscillating fan, affectionately nicknamed "The Breeze Master 5000" despite its wheezing protests and minimal effect, did little to dispel the grime that coated every surface.

This was Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's kingdom, and the throne he occupied was a worn-out, vinyl-covered stool that creaked with every shift of his considerable weight. He was hunched over a carburetor, his brow furrowed in concentration, a thin sheen of sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead. Teddy Bartholomew wasn't a man who looked his 38 years. The years spent wrestling engines had aged him prematurely, etching lines around his eyes and mouth that told stories of busted knuckles, frustrating diagnostics, and the occasional triumphant victory over a particularly stubborn hunk of metal. He was a bear of a man, built more for wrestling than wrenching, but his hands, surprisingly nimble, danced across the delicate inner workings of the ancient carburetor like a seasoned conductor leading an orchestra. The clang of a dropped wrench broke the silence, and Teddy sighed, wiping his greasy hands on a rag already thick with grime. "Just another day in paradise," he muttered, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips.
