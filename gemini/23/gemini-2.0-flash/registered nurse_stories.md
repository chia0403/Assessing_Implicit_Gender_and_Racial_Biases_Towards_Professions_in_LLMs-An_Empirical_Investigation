## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the Evergreen Mercy Hospital ICU buzzed a relentless hum, a soundtrack that Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown to both resent and rely on. Tonight, the hum was a comfort, a monotonous counterpoint to the erratic beeping of monitors and the suppressed sobs emanating from behind curtained cubicles. Amelia chewed on her thumbnail, a nervous habit she’d tried to break for years, and stared at the cascading numbers on Mr. Henderson’s ventilator. His oxygen saturation was stubbornly refusing to climb above 88%, and the bronchodilators she’d administered thirty minutes ago hadn’t made a dent. Another bad night, another fight against the inevitable.

**Setting:**

Evergreen Mercy Hospital stands on the eastern edge of Havenwood, Oregon, a sprawling, brick-faced behemoth that dominates the skyline. From the outside, its manicured lawns and cheerfully painted entrance doors promise healing and hope. Inside, however, the reality is often a labyrinth of echoing corridors, worn linoleum floors, and the ever-present scent of antiseptic and fear. The Intensive Care Unit, located on the fifth floor, is the hospital’s throbbing heart, a tense and highly controlled environment where life hangs precariously in the balance. The unit is divided into individual patient cubicles separated by thick, sound-absorbing curtains. Each cubicle is a miniature world of whirring machines, IV drips, and the silent pleas of worried families. A central nurses' station, bathed in the glow of computer screens, provides a constant vantage point, allowing the nurses to monitor the vital signs and subtle changes in their patients. The walls are decorated with motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling patients and slogans about teamwork, a stark contrast to the grim reality of life and death decisions made within these walls every day. Outside, the perpetually overcast skies of the Pacific Northwest cast a somber light over the entire scene.
