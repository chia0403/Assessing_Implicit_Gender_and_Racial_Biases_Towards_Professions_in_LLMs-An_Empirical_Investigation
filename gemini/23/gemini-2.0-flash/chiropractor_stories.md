Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a chiropractor named Dr. Evelyn Maeve Thorne:

**Story Opening:**

The humid Savannah air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket woven with the scent of jasmine and decaying magnolia leaves. Dr. Evelyn Maeve Thorne wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a faint smudge of the antiseptic hand sanitizer sheâ€™d just used. She watched a palmetto bug, thicker than her thumb, scuttle across the porch of her practice, its antennae twitching nervously. Another day, another reminder that she wasn't in Colorado anymore.

"Dammit, Jiminy," she muttered, reaching for her oversized, vintage sunglasses. She was already ten minutes behind schedule, and old Mrs. Abernathy was the kind of woman who tracked time like a hawk tracked a field mouse. Evelyn sighed. Adjusting spines in the sticky Southern heat was a far cry from skiing down a mountain and popping her own back into alignment.

The bell above the door to Thorne Chiropractic jingled, announcing the arrival of her first patient. "Alright, Evelyn," she told herself, straightening her crisp linen blouse. "Show 'em what a Rocky Mountain chiropractor can do."

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **Savannah, Georgia**, specifically within a beautifully restored, yet slightly dilapidated, Victorian-era townhouse that serves as **Thorne Chiropractic**.

*   **Exterior:** The townhouse is painted a faded, but charming, shade of Charleston green. A wide, wrap-around porch is adorned with hanging ferns, rocking chairs, and a slightly crooked hand-painted sign that reads "Thorne Chiropractic - Dr. Evelyn Maeve Thorne." The paint is peeling in places, revealing layers of previous colors, and the iron railings are subtly rusting. The whole building gives off an impression of faded grandeur. A lush, overgrown garden surrounds the house, filled with azaleas, camellias, and Spanish moss draped languidly from ancient oak trees.
*   **Interior:** The waiting room is furnished with mismatched antique furniture, creating a comfortable, albeit slightly cluttered, atmosphere. Think floral-patterned armchairs, a worn Persian rug, and a mahogany side table cluttered with magazines ranging from "Southern Living" to "Spinal Research Today." The walls are painted a pale yellow and adorned with framed anatomical charts, a vintage chiropractic diploma from Evelyn's grandfather, and photographs of the Rocky Mountains (a subtle reminder of Evelyn's past life). The air smells faintly of essential oils and liniment.
*   **Treatment Room:** This room is more modern and sterile than the waiting area. A state-of-the-art chiropractic table dominates the space. There's also a computer workstation, a small library of chiropractic texts, and an area for performing physical therapy exercises. Sunlight streams through large windows, offering a view of the overgrown garden.

This setting contrasts Evelyn's "outsider" status (coming from Colorado) with the deeply rooted history and culture of Savannah. The Victorian townhouse, with its faded elegance, reflects both the beauty and the decay of the South, mirroring Evelyn's own journey of adjustment and reinvention. The contrast between the waiting room's antique charm and the treatment room's modern equipment suggests a blend of traditional values and cutting-edge techniques, mirroring Evelyn's own approach to chiropractic care.
