The aroma of microwaved popcorn and slightly burnt crayon wax hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Ms. Eloise Abigail Hawthorne as she surveyed her domain. Room 203, home to the rambunctious third grade class at Maplewood Elementary, was a kaleidoscope of construction paper crafts, spelling word charts, and the perpetual, low-level chaos that only twenty-three eight-year-olds could generate. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above desks littered with crumpled worksheets and half-eaten apples. It was Friday afternoon, the last hour of the school week, and the air thrummed with anticipation of the weekend, a feeling Eloise shared, albeit seasoned with a hint of the exhaustion that clung to her like the faint scent of Elmer's glue. The room, despite its mess, was her haven, a place where Eloise could, with varying degrees of success, nurture young minds and shepherd them, one glitter-covered project at a time, towards the vast and wonderful world beyond Maplewood's walls. But today, something feltâ€¦off. The usually energetic chatter was muted, replaced by a nervous fidgeting, and Eloise couldn't quite put her finger on the reason.
