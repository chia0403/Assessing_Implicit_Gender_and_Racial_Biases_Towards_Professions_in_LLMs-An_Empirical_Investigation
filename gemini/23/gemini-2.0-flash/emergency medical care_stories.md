## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The siren screamed, a mechanical banshee tearing through the pre-dawn quiet of Havenwood, Maryland. Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hernandez, still half-asleep, wrestled herself upright in the threadbare recliner she'd nicknamed "The Graveyard." Her neck cracked in protest. She hadn't even made it through one full episode of "Ancient Aliens" before the pager clipped to her bra had started buzzing with its insistent, life-altering summons.

Amy grabbed her worn leather jacket, already smelling faintly of disinfectant and adrenaline, and bolted out the door. The chill October air nipped at her exposed skin, and the dew-slicked pavement glistened under the amber streetlights. Another night, another life hanging precariously in the balance. Another night where she would be asked to hold back the darkness.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, Maryland, is a small, blue-collar town nestled in the rolling hills of the Piedmont region. Itâ€™s a place where the pace of life is slower, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and where the local diner, "The Crossroads," is the unofficial town hall. The town's economic heart used to beat strong with the now-shuttered textile mill, leaving many families struggling to make ends meet.

Amy works for the Havenwood County Emergency Medical Services (HCEMS), a small but dedicated team that covers a wide geographical area. Their headquarters is a modest, brick building just outside of town, equipped with two ambulances and a well-worn waiting room. The surrounding landscape is a mix of sprawling farms, dense forests, and aging suburban developments, all contributing to the unique challenges and demographics Amy faces as an emergency medical care physician. The season is late October, painting the scenery in hues of fiery red, golden yellow, and somber brown, a stark contrast to the often-desperate situations Amy encounters.
