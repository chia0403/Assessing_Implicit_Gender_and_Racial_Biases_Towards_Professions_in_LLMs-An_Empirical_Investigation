**Opening:**

The scent of formaldehyde and hairspray hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting miasma to Cordelia "Coco" Dubois. It was a Friday night, the peak of the week for "Glamorama," the tiny salon she owned in the heart of Little Havana. The neon flamingo blinking insistently outside painted the inside a sickly pink, a shade Coco swore she’d repaint, eventually. Right now, however, repainting was the least of her worries. Mrs. Rodriguez was due in ten minutes for a full face and updo – a particularly elaborate one for her niece's quinceañera – and Coco was staring blankly at a half-empty tube of crimson lipstick, feeling the familiar pangs of pre-party panic.

**Setting:**

Glamorama wasn’t fancy. It was a small, one-room storefront nestled between a bodega selling imported Cuban cigars and a brightly colored bakery overflowing with pastelitos. The walls were painted a vibrant, almost offensively cheerful turquoise that Coco had inherited from the previous tenant, a manicurist specializing in rhinestone-encrusted nail art. Two well-worn salon chairs sat facing large, brightly lit mirrors, each flanked by a chaotic assortment of combs, brushes, curling irons, and enough hairspray to single-handedly deplete the ozone layer. A small, rickety table overflowed with magazines – mostly gossip rags and bridal publications – and a chipped ceramic bowl held a meager offering of hard candies. The air conditioning unit, patched and sputtering, fought a losing battle against the Miami heat radiating off the pavement outside, adding a layer of humid discomfort to the already potent olfactory assault. Despite its flaws, Glamorama was *hers*, a haven built with late nights, sheer willpower, and a healthy dose of Coco Dubois' signature charm. It was, in its own chaotic way, perfect.
