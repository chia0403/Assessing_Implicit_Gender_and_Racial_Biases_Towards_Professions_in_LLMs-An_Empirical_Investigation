## Story Opening

The biting wind, smelling of pine and impending snow, whipped against Jedediah Silas Calhoun's face as he surveyed the felled giant. Its trunk, thick as a small car, lay groaning softly, the sound almost mournful in the stark stillness of the forest. The chainsaw, still warm in his gloved hands, sputtered its last sighs before falling silent. Jedediah ran a hand through his thick, grizzled beard, a tangle of reddish-brown that mirrored the rusty hues of the fallen treeâ€™s inner rings. He wasn't proud of what he did, not exactly. But pride was a luxury he couldn't afford anymore. He needed the money. He always needed the money.

## Setting

The story opens in the heart of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington state, late October. The area is characterized by its ancient, towering forests dominated by Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and Western hemlock. The air is perpetually damp, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and wet earth. The landscape is rugged and unforgiving, a tapestry of steep slopes, hidden ravines, and moss-draped rocks. A fine mist hangs perpetually in the air, shrouding the higher peaks in a ghostly veil. Jedediah is working on a particularly remote parcel of land, far from any established logging roads. The only sounds are the wind, the occasional squawk of a raven, and the distant, echoing roar of the river that cuts through the valley below. The season is turning, the vibrant greens of summer fading into the muted browns and oranges of autumn, a constant reminder of the encroaching winter and the hardships it promises.
