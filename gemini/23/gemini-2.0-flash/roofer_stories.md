The tar, softened by the relentless August sun, stuck to Theodore "Ted" Archibaldâ€™s boots with a satisfying *squelch* as he navigated the blistering incline of the Henderson's roof. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead, and surveyed his kingdom. The air, thick with the scent of asphalt and melting pine, shimmered above the rows of identical, sun-bleached houses that stretched out before him, like dominoes waiting to fall. This was Oakhaven, a planned community nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where meticulously manicured lawns met cookie-cutter facades, and the biggest excitement was the annual HOA meeting.

Ted, a man built like an oak himself, preferred it this way. Predictable. Quiet. He appreciated the monotony of laying shingle after shingle, the rhythmic hammer blows a comforting counterpoint to the ceaseless buzz of cicadas. He'd been roofing in Oakhaven for nearly twenty years, watching families grow and houses age. He knew the subtle shifts in the rooflines, the specific weaknesses of each house. In a way, he was as much a part of Oakhaven's infrastructure as the power lines and the plumbing. Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine, a feeling as unexpected and unsettling as finding a loose shingle on a brand new roof. He glanced at the cloudless sky, then back at the tidy rows of houses, a disquieting premonition settling in his gut. It was a feeling he hadn't experienced since... well, since *that* day, a feeling best ignored. He pulled another shingle from the stack, adjusted his safety harness, and tried to focus on the task at hand. The Hendersons were expecting a finished roof by sundown, and Ted Archibald was nothing if not a man of his word.
