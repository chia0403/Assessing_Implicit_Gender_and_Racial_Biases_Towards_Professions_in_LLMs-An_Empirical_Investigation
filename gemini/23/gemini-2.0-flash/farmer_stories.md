The biting wind, laced with the threat of early snow, whipped around Silas Ebenezer Harroway's weathered face. He braced himself against the rusted metal of the barn door, pulling it shut with a groan that echoed the ache in his old bones. Dusk was bleeding across the sprawling fields of Harroway Acres, painting the harvested stalks in hues of bruised purple and somber grey. The air smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar scent that usually brought him comfort, but tonight, it only amplified the gnawing unease in his gut. The radio crackled with static inside the drafty barn, punctuated by a disjointed weather report hinting at record low temperatures. Silas shivered, not entirely from the cold. Something was wrong. Terribly, irrevocably wrong.

**Setting:** Harroway Acres, a sprawling but somewhat dilapidated family farm nestled in the remote, Appalachian foothills of western Virginia. The farm, passed down through generations, consists of gently sloping fields, a dense patch of bordering forest, a creaking, two-story farmhouse painted a faded shade of blue, a large, red barn in need of repair, and various outbuildings including a chicken coop, a pig sty (currently empty), and a small workshop. The closest town, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it place called Harmony Creek, is about a 20-minute drive down a winding, gravel road.
