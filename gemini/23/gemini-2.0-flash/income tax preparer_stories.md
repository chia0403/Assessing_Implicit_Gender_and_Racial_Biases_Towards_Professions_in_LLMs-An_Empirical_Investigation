The flickering fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Today" cast a sickly green glow on the stacks of receipts threatening to engulf Eleanor Ainsworth's desk. It was March 12th, and the air in the small office, tucked away in a strip mall between a struggling laundromat and a permanently "going out of business" furniture store, was thick with the scent of lukewarm coffee and simmering desperation. Outside, a slushy mix of snow and grit lined the parking lot, mirroring the grime coating Eleanor's soul. She squinted at a particularly illegible invoice for "Chicken Coop Renovations" – a hefty write-off claimed by Mrs. Higgins, who insisted her chickens were “integral to her spiritual well-being.” Eleanor sighed. Only thirty-three days until April 15th. Only thirty-three days until she could reclaim her sanity, her sleep, and her faith in humanity’s basic honesty. Right now, staring down the barrel of another twelve-hour shift, she felt like she needed a tax write-off on *her own* spiritual well-being.
