The oppressive humidity hung heavy, a damp blanket clinging to everything and promising another afternoon thunderstorm. Sweat trickled down Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's spine, plastering her silk blouse to her back. She fanned herself uselessly with a glossy brochure, the image of the perfectly manicured lawn and sparkling pool mocking her discomfort.

Ellie stood on the cracked asphalt driveway of 413 Whispering Pines Lane, a house that whispered secrets more sinister than its name suggested. The 'For Sale' sign, hammered haphazardly into the overgrown verge, leaned precariously, a symbol of the neglect that had permeated the property.

Ellie, a seasoned real estate agent with over fifteen years of experience navigating the fickle Savannah market, had seen her share of fixer-uppers. But this… this felt different. The house itself was a ramshackle Victorian, painted a faded shade of lavender that peeled in grotesque strips, revealing the dark wood beneath. Vines, thick as pythons, choked the porch columns, obscuring the entrance in a green, leafy shroud.

Whispering Pines Lane itself was located on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia, a stretch of forgotten road lined with sprawling, overgrown properties. Once a prestigious address, it had slowly decayed, swallowed by the encroaching Spanish moss and the weight of time. Most of the houses were empty, their windows like vacant eyes staring out into the humid twilight, monuments to broken dreams and forgotten fortunes.

Ellie took a deep breath, steeling herself. She had a viewing in twenty minutes, and the prospective buyers, the Millers – a young couple from Ohio looking for a "project" – were notoriously picky. She just hoped the house's "rustic charm" would outweigh the undeniable sense of unease that prickled at the back of her neck. This property, inherited by a distant cousin of her firm's managing partner, was Ellie's responsibility, and selling it – or even just surviving the listing – was becoming her personal mission.
