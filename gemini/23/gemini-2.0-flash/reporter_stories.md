The stale, industrial smell of bleach and regret clung to the air like a stubborn ghost. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, her trench coat damp and clinging uncomfortably, sat perched on the edge of a chipped plastic chair, the kind designed for maximum discomfort and minimal lingering. A half-empty cup of lukewarm, suspiciously brown coffee sat forgotten on the table in front of her, condensation beading on its cardboard surface.

This was the interview room in the 12th Precinct, a place where confessions were sweated out, alibis crumbled, and careers often ended. It wasn't her usual haunt. Izzy, a reporter for the *Metro Times*, usually dealt with city council corruption and the latest artisanal bread trends, not grisly murders. But tonight, the story had found her, clawing its way into her inbox in the form of an anonymous tip: "They're covering it up. West Side Ripper is back."

Izzy shifted, the squeak of the plastic a jarring sound in the oppressive silence. Detective Harding, a man whose face looked like it had been carved from granite and weathered by a thousand disappointments, was currently pacing outside, presumably trying to decide whether she was a nuisance, a potential asset, or just a delusional busybody. Either way, she wasn't going anywhere until she got her story. The West Side Ripper. The name sent a chill down her spine, a chilling echo of a case that had haunted the city fifteen years ago, a case that had seemingly been put to rest. Was it really back? Or was someone playing a sick joke? Izzy Diaz intended to find out.
