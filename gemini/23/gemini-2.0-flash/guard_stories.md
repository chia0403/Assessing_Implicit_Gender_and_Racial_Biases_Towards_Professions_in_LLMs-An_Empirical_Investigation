The biting wind, smelling of pine and the distant, icy sea, whipped at Sergeant Alistair Griffith's heavy wool cloak. He pulled it tighter, tucking his chin deeper into the rough fabric. The Grey Stone Keep, perched precariously on the jagged cliffs of the Northwood Coast, seemed to groan under the relentless assault of the elements. It was a fortress built more for deterrence than comfort, a hulking silhouette against a perpetually overcast sky. Alistair had spent ten long years within its damp, stone walls, watching the endless, grey waves crash against the unforgiving rocks below. He knew every creak in the ancient timbers, every draft whistling through the arrow slits, every chilling whisper the wind carried on its mournful song. Tonight, however, felt different. An unnerving quiet had settled over the coast, a breathless calm before what felt like an impending storm, both literal and figurative. He shifted the weight of his halberd, his gloved hand tightening on the cold, steel haft. Tonight, Sergeant Alistair Griffith felt a prickle of unease he couldn't quite shake, a sense that the monotonous rhythm of his duty was about to be shattered.
