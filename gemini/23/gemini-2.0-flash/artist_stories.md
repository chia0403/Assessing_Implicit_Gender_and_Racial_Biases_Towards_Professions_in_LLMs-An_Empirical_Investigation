The salt spray stung Anya Petrovaâ€™s face as she wrestled her easel onto the jagged rocks overlooking the churning Atlantic.  She swore, a Russian curse bubbling under her breath, as the wind threatened to rip the canvas from its precarious perch.  This late October storm was proving a test of wills, even for someone as stubbornly determined as Anya.  

The setting was the Isle of Skye, specifically Neist Point, the westernmost point of the island.  The iconic lighthouse stood sentinel against the bruised purple sky, its beam cutting through the encroaching darkness like a defiant sword.  Gnarled heather clung tenaciously to the clifftop, whipped into a frenzy by the gale.  The air was thick with the smell of seaweed and the metallic tang of impending rain.  Anya, bundled in a thick wool coat, felt dwarfed by the raw power of the landscape, yet simultaneously energized. It was this very untamed beauty that had drawn her here, halfway across the world, searching for a new voice in her art.
