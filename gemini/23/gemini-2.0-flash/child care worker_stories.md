The fluorescent lights of the Sunshine Sprouts Daycare hummed a monotonous tune, a sound Amelia Grace Riley had long learned to tune out. It was 7:48 AM, twelve minutes before the first parent would begin trickling in, clutching a sleepy toddler or a stubbornly cheerful preschooler. Amelia, 26, was already knee-deep in the organized chaos that was her life.

Sunshine Sprouts was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a leafy, affluent suburb just outside the bustling city of Metropolis. The building itself was a converted two-story house, painted a blinding, cheerful yellow that Amelia secretly loathed. Inside, the walls were adorned with hand-painted murals of smiling animals and simplified versions of famous paintings, like a Matisse cat chasing a Van Gogh sunflower. Brightly colored rugs covered the hardwood floors, creating cozy nooks for reading and play.

The current setup was a result of Mrs. Peterson, the owner, deciding that 'cohesion' was the key to a positive environment. Amelia personally thought it was a recipe for overstimulation, but Mrs. Peterson, with her perfectly coiffed hair and a seemingly endless supply of pastel cardigans, rarely listened to Amelia's practical concerns.

Amelia stood in the “Busy Bees” room, designated for the three-year-olds, meticulously arranging a set of wooden blocks. Each block had to be precisely aligned, the colours perfectly complementing each other. It was a futile exercise, she knew. In less than an hour, the carefully constructed tower would be a scattered ruin, likely the victim of a territorial dispute over a purple giraffe. But for these few precious minutes, before the onslaught of miniature humans arrived, Amelia could impose a semblance of order on the world, a small island of peace in the coming storm.
