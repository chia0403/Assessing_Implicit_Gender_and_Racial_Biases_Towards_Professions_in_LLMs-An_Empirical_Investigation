The fluorescent lights of the Institute of Theoretical Abnormality hummed a monotonous dirge above Mr. Archibald P. Finch, echoing the low, simmering dread that perpetually clung to the place. It was 3:17 AM, and the only sound besides the lights was the rhythmic swoosh and thump of Archibald's industrial mop as he attacked a particularly stubborn patch of dried… something… on the linoleum floor of Sub-Level B, Sector Gamma.

The Institute, nestled deep beneath the rolling hills of upstate New York, wasn't just a quirky research facility. It was a vault, a containment unit, a place where reality occasionally hiccuped and scientists frantically scribbled notes while trying to glue it back together. Archibald knew better than to ask too many questions about what he cleaned. He'd learned early on that blissful ignorance was the key to a long (or at least, longer than average) career at the ITA.

Tonight, however, the air was thicker than usual, almost palpable. A strange, ozone-tinged aroma permeated the sterile environment, mingling with the faint scent of disinfectant Archibald religiously applied. And the usual muffled clicks and whirs of complex machinery were absent, replaced by an unnerving silence that pressed down on him like the weight of the earth above. He scrubbed harder, his brow furrowed. Something was definitely wrong.
