The persistent drizzle was less a rain and more a damp, clinging shroud that settled heavily over the manicured lawns of the Crestwood Estates. Elias Bartholomew Finch, his mud-caked boots sinking slightly into the newly turned earth, sighed, the puff of his breath momentarily visible in the cool, early morning air. Crestwood Estates, nestled in the affluent hills outside of Oakwood, Connecticut, was a tapestry of perfectly trimmed hedges, meticulously sculpted topiaries, and lawns so green they seemed to hum with an almost unnatural vibrancy. It was Elias's bread and butter, the source of his modest, but steady, living. But today, the usual serenity of the place felt suffocating, the manicured perfection almost mocking. He was here to oversee the final installation of the prize-winning 'Serenity' water feature in the sprawling backyard of the recently widowed Mrs. Penelope Abernathy's Tudor mansion. Mrs. Abernathy, with her mournful eyes and trembling hands, had insisted on having it completed before the first anniversary of her husband's passing. And Elias, bless his perpetually optimistic heart, was determined to deliver a little slice of serenity, even in this place that felt so steeped in quiet grief.
