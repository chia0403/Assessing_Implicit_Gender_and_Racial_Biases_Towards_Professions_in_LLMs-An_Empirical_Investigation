The cloying sweetness of honeysuckle hung thick in the humid Louisiana air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood that clung to Detective Isabella Rose Dubois' nostrils. The air shimmered above the asphalt parking lot of the Blue Moon Diner, the heat radiating off the blacktop in visible waves. A greasy smell, usually a comfort, now twisted in her stomach as she surveyed the scene. Yellow crime scene tape flapped lazily in the faint breeze, a flimsy barrier against the gawking eyes of the small town of Cypress Creek.

Inside the tape, the diner stood silent, its neon sign flickering erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across the greasy windows. The early morning light, normally painting the town in hues of gold and rose, felt muted, poisoned somehow by the violence that had occurred within. Isabella Dubois, a thirty-two-year-old veteran of the Cypress Creek Police Department, adjusted the weight of her gun on her hip, the leather holster sticking uncomfortably in the Louisiana heat. This wasn't the first time she'd seen death in Cypress Creek, but something about this felt different, deeper, a dark undercurrent rippling beneath the deceptively tranquil surface of her hometown. She just knew, deep in her gut, this was going to be more than just a simple robbery gone wrong. This was going to be trouble.
