## Story Opening:

The smell of stale cigarettes and cheap jasmine perfume hung heavy in the air, a miasma clinging to the cracked leather booths and chipped Formica tables of the "Lucky Dragon" diner. Abigail Maeve O'Connell, ace reporter for the **St. Louis Dispatch**, shivered, despite the sticky humidity clinging to the city like a second skin. She pulled her collar higher, the thin cotton of her blouse offering little protection against the unsettling chill emanating from the diner. Outside, the neon dragon above the entrance blinked erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked street. Abigail had been sitting here for over an hour, nursing a lukewarm coffee that tasted suspiciously of burnt rubber, her pen tapping a frantic rhythm against her notepad. She was beginning to regret agreeing to this meeting, even if it meant potentially breaking the biggest story of her career. The clock above the counter ticked with agonizing slowness, each second a hammer blow against her growing anxiety. Was he going to show? Or was this just another dead end, another whispered promise vanishing into the damp St. Louis night?

## Setting:

**The Lucky Dragon Diner:** Located on the outskirts of St. Louis's historic Chinatown district, the diner is a relic of a bygone era. Its exterior is adorned with a faded, neon sign depicting a smiling, albeit slightly malevolent, green dragon. Inside, the diner is dimly lit, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights and the aforementioned neon sign. Red vinyl booths line the walls, their surfaces worn and cracked. A long Formica counter stretches along one side of the room, populated by cracked mugs and mismatched silverware. The air is thick with the smells of fried food, stale coffee, and the lingering aroma of decades of cigarette smoke. The diner is frequented by a diverse clientele, ranging from late-night truckers and weary shift workers to shady characters and the occasional desperate soul seeking anonymity. It's a place of secrets and whispered conversations, a forgotten corner of the city where anything is possible.
