## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The fondant was sweating. Amelia Rose Hawthorne hated when the fondant sweated. It was a sign, a miniature, sugary premonition of everything that was about to go wrong. She dabbed at the sheen with a delicate paper towel, trying not to smudge the meticulously piped roses that already felt too fragile in the humid air. This cake, a five-tiered monstrosity adorned with cascading sugar orchids and shimmering edible pearls, was destined for the wedding of a socialite so rich she probably used diamonds as fertilizer. And Amelia, with only two hours to go before delivery, felt a distinct urge to flee to a remote mountain cabin and bake nothing but sourdough for the rest of her days.

**Setting:**

Amelia’s Haven is a small, bright, and undeniably charming bakery nestled on the corner of Primrose Lane in the picturesque coastal town of Seabreeze, Maine. Sunlight streams through the large front windows, illuminating rows of perfectly arranged cupcakes, scones, and miniature tarts. The air is thick with the comforting aromas of vanilla, cinnamon, and melting chocolate, battling valiantly against the subtle, underlying scent of panic that often clung to the back room – the chaotic realm where Amelia worked her magic. The back room itself was a symphony of organized chaos. Stainless steel counters were covered in tools: piping bags, palette knives, molds of every imaginable shape, and tubs of vibrantly colored icing. Shelves groaned under the weight of sprinkles, edible glitter, and jars filled with ingredients from far-flung corners of the world. Despite the apparent disarray, everything had its place, known only to Amelia. It was a sanctuary, a canvas, and on days like this, a pressure cooker.
