The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gobbler" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, a relentless counterpoint to the clinking of dishes and the low murmur of conversation within.  Amelia, perched on a stool at the bar, nursed a lukewarm coffee, the bitter flavour mirroring the taste of defeat settling in her stomach.  Tonight, the Golden Gobbler had been a mausoleum, not a cathedral.  Empty booths lined the walls like hollowed-out teeth, and the rhythmic thump-thump of the jukebox played out a mournful dirge.  She was Amelia Nightingale, a singer chasing a dream as fleeting as the fleeting neon glow.


The setting:  A small, dusty diner on the outskirts of a faded, forgotten mining town.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and something vaguely metallic, a lingering echo of the town's faded glory.  The town, once a vibrant hub of industry, now teetered on the brink of oblivion, its once-mighty mines silent, their shafts swallowed by the encroaching wilderness.  Amelia’s dreams, once as bright as the town's promise, now seemed as fragile as the chipped paint on the diner’s exterior.
