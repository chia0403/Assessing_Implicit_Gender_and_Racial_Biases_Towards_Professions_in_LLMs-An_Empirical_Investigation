The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous drone that Clara Beaumont found both soothing and maddening.  Today, it felt particularly oppressive, a thick, beige blanket draped over the room.  Outside, a storm raged, wind howling like a banshee and rain lashing against the windows.  Inside, the carefully curated world of stuffed animals, colourful play-dough and whispered lullabies felt fragile, threatened by the tempest brewing just beyond the glass. Clara, with her perpetually tired but determined eyes, surveyed the room.  Four-year-old Leo, his bright, almost impossibly vibrant blue eyes fixed on a stray crayon, was lost in his own miniature drama;  a tiny, cardboard castle, apparently under siege.

The daycare, situated in the heart of the sprawling, grey concrete city, was a stark contrast to the greenery promised in its brochure.  A faded mural of colourful birds perched precariously on branches struggling to break free from the greyscale paint of the brick wall, the only reminder of a world that felt distant and almost imaginary.  Its cheerful, but now slightly chipped, yellow walls were lined with countless crayon drawings and sticky handprints.  A subtle, almost imperceptible scent of baby powder and damp earth hung in the air, a constant whisper of the children who populated this place, as well as the lingering scent of fear from a late-night incident a few weeks ago.  The day was barely underway, and Clara felt the familiar weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.
