The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Takers" office hummed, a monotonous drone that punctuated the rhythmic clack-clack of Amelia Peabody's keyboard.  Filing cabinets, crammed to overflowing with tax forms, tax returns, and the occasional forgotten Christmas card, cast long shadows across the small, windowless room.  Paper, in shades of beige and off-white, littered every surface.  Amelia, a woman with a perpetually tired expression and eyes that seemed to have seen too many numbers, stared intently at the screen, tracing the outlines of a complex financial statement with a pen that had seen better days.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of the tax season.  Outside, the first snowflakes of the year were beginning to fall, painting the city in a blanket of hushed white.  Her phone buzzed, a discordant note in the otherwise silent symphony of paperwork and calculations.  It was a reminder, if any were needed, that this was just another Tuesday in the brutal reality of tax season.
