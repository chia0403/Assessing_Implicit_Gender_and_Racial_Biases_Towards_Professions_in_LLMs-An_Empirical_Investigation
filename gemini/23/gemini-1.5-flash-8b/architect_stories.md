The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, rattling the already fragile scaffolding around the new "Sky Gardens" development.  Rain, the colour of charcoal, hammered against the corrugated metal sheeting, blurring the already hazy cityscape of New Veridia.  Elias Thorne, architect and relentless perfectionist, hunched deeper into his rain-slicked trench coat, a grim satisfaction tightening in his chest.  The project, the one that had consumed him for the past five years, was finally nearing its tragic climax.

New Veridia, a city built on the razor's edge between technological marvel and decaying grandeur, clawed at the sky with its towering, glass-encased structures.  Towering above the sprawling metropolis was the monumental structure Elias was crafting:  a series of interconnected sky gardens suspended in the air,  intertwining with the existing urban landscape like a complex, skeletal vine.  These gardens, envisioned as oases of calm amid the concrete jungle, were meant to be a symbol of hope, a testament to humanity's ability to coexist with nature in the face of unavoidable environmental decay.  Yet, something about the final details gnawed at Elias, a disquiet that echoed the hollowness beneath the city’s gleaming façade.
