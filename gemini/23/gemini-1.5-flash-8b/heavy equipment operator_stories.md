The biting wind whipped across the desolate, ochre-hued landscape, stinging Amelia "Ames"  Harding's cheeks.  Dust devils danced like malevolent sprites across the cracked earth, swirling around the colossal, rust-eaten behemoth of a bulldozer she piloted.  Ames, a heavy equipment operator for the dwindling Crimson Ridge Reclamation Company, squinted against the relentless sun, its rays reflecting off the parched earth like shards of broken glass.  The year was 2242, and the once-fertile valley of Crimson Ridge now resembled a sun-baked graveyard.  Water was a precious commodity, rationed by the government, and the company was tasked with clearing the remnants of abandoned farms and processing plants.  Her bulldozer, a rusted titan named "Ironheart," grumbled and groaned, its hydraulics protesting the relentless strain of the rocky terrain.  This particular section, designated Sector 7-Omega, was notorious for its treacherous hidden sinkholes, a constant threat for any operator.  The air, thick with the smell of burnt metal and despair, hung heavy as the only sound besides Ironheart's groaning was the distant, echoing howl of a sand viper.
