The clatter of clippers, a rhythmic tattoo against the chipped Formica countertop, was the only sound that punctuated the quiet Tuesday morning in Barnaby's Barbershop.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral wallpaper, painted streaks of ochre and rose across the worn wooden floor.  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose grey hair was carefully combed back from a forehead etched with the lines of countless stories, meticulously trimmed the unruly fringe of a young man named Leo.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the sprawling, rain-swept city of Aethelgard, smelled faintly of lavender soap and stale coffee.  A chipped porcelain mug sat on the counter, its handle perpetually smudged with coffee stains, a testament to countless conversations and shared anxieties.  Outside, the muted chimes of the city clock tower echoed, a gentle reminder that time, like a well-worn pair of shears, was always moving, always cutting.
