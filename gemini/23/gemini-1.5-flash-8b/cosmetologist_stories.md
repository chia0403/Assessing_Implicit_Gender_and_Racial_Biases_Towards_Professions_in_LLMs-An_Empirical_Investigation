The flickering neon sign of "Sparkle & Shine" cast a lurid, magenta glow across the rain-slicked street, reflecting in the oily sheen of Amelia "Sparkle"  Montgomery's meticulously manicured fingernails. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and floral perfume, a symphony of smells that was, for Amelia, almost as comforting as the rhythmic hum of the hair dryers.  Tonight, however, the usual hum was muted, replaced by an unnerving silence that pressed against the vibrant colours of the salon like a damp cloth.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in a way that only a seasoned cosmetologist could adopt, surveyed the salon.  Empty chairs lined the walls, the usual chatter of clients and the clinking of tools absent.  The only sound was the gentle drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere in the back.

The salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in the burgeoning arts district of New Zenith, was a stark contrast to the bustling energy that pulsed through the city beyond.  Once a neighbourhood powerhouse, attracting a loyal following of local artists and entrepreneurs, the area had been experiencing a shift.  New developments were pushing prices up, driving out the older, creative businesses. Sparkle & Shine, Amelia's beloved haven for over a decade, felt the pressure.
