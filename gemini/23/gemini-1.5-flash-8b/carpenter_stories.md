The biting wind whipped dust devils across the cracked earth of the dusty, sun-baked town of Dustbowl Gulch.  A single, skeletal acacia tree, its branches clawing at the bruised sky, was the only landmark amidst the endless expanse of ochre and grey.

He hummed a low, mournful tune, a melody as old as the mountains that surrounded Dustbowl Gulch.  Outside, the incessant howl of the wind echoed the disquiet in his heart.
