The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderbrook.  A chill, sharper than the November air, snaked through Elara Vance's thin jacket as she wrestled a stack of chipped mugs onto a table.  Inside, the pub was a symphony of clinking glasses, muted conversation, and the rhythmic thump of a lone, melancholic piano.  The air hung thick with the scent of roasted barley and something faintly sweet, like burnt caramel. Elara, her name barely a whisper against the background noise,  had been stationed behind the counter of the Rusty Mug since the first slivers of dusk painted the sky.  Tonight, the usual Saturday night clientele was thinner than usual.  Perhaps it was the persistent drizzle, or the whispers of impending snow, or something else entirely that hung heavy in the atmosphere, an air of unspoken anxiety that made even the muted conversations seem charged.
