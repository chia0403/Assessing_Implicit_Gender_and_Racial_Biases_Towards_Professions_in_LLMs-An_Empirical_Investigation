The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School counseling office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia Hayesâ€™ fingers against the worn surface of her desk.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the window, illuminating a scattering of colorful paperclips and half-eaten granola bars.  Outside, the crisp autumn air, laden with the scent of fallen leaves, contrasted sharply with the sterile, slightly stale atmosphere inside.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Hayes, school psychologist, sighed, the sound barely audible above the whisper of the air conditioner.  Her current caseload felt like a mountain of unyielding paperwork, each student a different shade of grey, their anxieties and struggles reflected in the anxious glint of her own tired eyes.  Today's appointment was particularly daunting:  14-year-old Leo Santiago, a student whose quiet withdrawal had escalated into unsettling behaviors over the past few weeks.  Leo's file, thick with notes and referrals, sat atop the pile of papers, a silent testament to his deepening isolation.  The counseling office, a small, somewhat cramped space tucked away in the quieter wing of the high school, felt like a pressure cooker on a day like this.  Amelia knew she had to find a way to connect with Leo, to pierce through the impenetrable shell he had built around himself.
