The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, greyish-green from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, mirrored the gloom in Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, barely pierced the grime clinging to the windows of the dilapidated Victorian house, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cramped kitchen.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and something indefinably musty, a scent that clung to the house like a shroud.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist, stared at the chipped mug in her hand, the remnants of her morning coffee â€“ cold, bitter, and a fitting reflection of her current mood.  She was supposed to be celebrating.  Today was the day she was supposed to hand over the keys to the practice, to finally relinquish control of the bustling, vibrant therapy centre she'd built from the ground up.  But the house, the city, even the seemingly endless pile of paperwork on her desk all felt heavy with a different kind of weight now, a weight that had nothing to do with the physical demands of the day.  It felt like she was leaving behind a part of herself.  

The setting:  A decaying Victorian house nestled within the grey, smog-choked streets of an industrial city, the kind that clung to its past with a tenacious grip.  Brick facades were worn and weathered, their once-proud arches scarred with the marks of time.  The city was a testament to the changing tides of industry, its grandeur dulled by the relentless churn of progress.
