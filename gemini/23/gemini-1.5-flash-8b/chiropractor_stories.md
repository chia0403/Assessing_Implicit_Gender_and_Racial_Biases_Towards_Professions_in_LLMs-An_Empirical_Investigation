Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating a scattering of medical journals and half-eaten granola bars on the cluttered desk.  Amelia, a woman with a cascade of dark, unruly hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, hunched over a patient chart, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic *click-clack* of her heels against the linoleum floor echoed in the otherwise silent space, a counterpoint to the low hum of the air conditioner struggling against the oppressive heat.  Outside, the chaotic symphony of a bustling, impoverished urban neighborhood spilled over the threshold of the tiny clinic, a constant background noise that, in a strange way, had become a familiar comfort to Amelia.  This was her sanctuary, her small island of calm in a turbulent sea of human suffering, and today, a new wave threatened to crash over it.  The name scrawled in messy script on the chart - "Mr.  Emilio Rodriguez" - felt like the first drop of that impending wave.
