The fluorescent lights of the galley hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of trays being stacked and the muffled thrum of the engines outside.  Amelia "Amy"  Everett, her uniform crisp and perfectly pressed, moved with the practiced grace of a dancer navigating a crowded stage.  Her name tag, gleaming with the faint reflection of the overhead lights, read:  Amy Everett, Flight Attendant,  United Airlines.  Tonight's flight, 238, was bound for Tokyo, a city she'd dreamed of visiting since she was a child, but the familiar routine of pre-departure preparations felt like a shroud, stifling the excitement.  The air in the galley, already thick with the scent of stale coffee and lemon disinfectant, was beginning to feel suffocating.

The setting was the galley of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner,  a sleek, modern behemoth,  its interior still gleaming, but the faintest traces of yesterday's flights clung to the stainless steel surfaces and the hushed conversations in the background.  Outside, the city lights of Chicago were blurring into a hazy tapestry of orange and purple, mirroring the swirling colours of a sunset she'd missed on the ground. The smell of jet fuel hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the imminent journey, both exhilarating and terrifying.  Tiny fragments of light filtered into the galley from the windows, highlighting the rows of seats stretching endlessly into the dark interior.
