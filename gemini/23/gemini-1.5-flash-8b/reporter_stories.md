The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the greasy counter, illuminating Amelia “Amy” Cartwright, a reporter for the *Dust Bowl Gazette*.  Her worn leather jacket, stained with dried mud and the faint aroma of burnt coffee, clung to her as she hunched over a chipped mug, the steam barely enough to warm the icy chill seeping into her bones.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, whipping the skeletal branches of the lone mesquite tree into a frenzied dance.  Dust devils, the colour of rusted iron, writhed across the cracked earth, their silent roar a constant reminder of the harsh reality of the region.  Amy’s notebook lay open on the counter, filled with hastily scribbled notes about the vanishing livestock, the strange, flickering lights seen in the distance, and the whispers that followed the shadows.  The whispers were always the most unnerving.  This desolate stretch of land, once a bustling farming community, was now a graveyard of broken dreams, and Amy, armed with her worn-out notepad and a flickering hope, was determined to uncover the truth.
