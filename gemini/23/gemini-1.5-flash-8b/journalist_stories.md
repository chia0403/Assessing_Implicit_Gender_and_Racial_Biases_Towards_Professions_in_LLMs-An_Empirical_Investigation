The flickering neon sign of the "Crimson Comet Diner" cast a sickly orange glow on Amelia Kensington’s rain-slicked trench coat.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and greasy fries, clung to her like a second skin.

Amelia, a seasoned investigative journalist with a nose for trouble and a reputation for uncovering the city's hidden truths, hunched over a chipped Formica table, her gaze fixed on the swirling steam rising from her lukewarm coffee.  The diner, a relic of a bygone era, felt as if it held the city's secrets within its greasy spoons and chipped mugs.  This was her beat, the underbelly of Veridia – a place where whispers became rumors, and rumors became reality. Tonight, the whispers were thick with something sinister.
