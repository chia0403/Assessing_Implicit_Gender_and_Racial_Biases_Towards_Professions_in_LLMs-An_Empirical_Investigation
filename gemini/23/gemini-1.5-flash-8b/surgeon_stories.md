The sterile white of the operating room hummed with a low, rhythmic thrumming, a soundtrack to the precise ballet unfolding before Dr. Eleanor Vance.  Her gloved hands, steady and sure, moved with practiced grace, dissecting the intricate network of veins and arteries.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted windows, painted streaks of amber across the stainless steel table, highlighting the delicate contours of the patient's chest.  The scent of antiseptic and something faintly floral lingered in the air, a familiar perfume of the modern, high-tech hospital.

Setting:  St. Jude's Medical Center, a towering, glass-fronted behemoth nestled in the heart of bustling, perpetually rain-drenched Seattle.  Eleanor, a thoracic surgeon, worked in the intensive care surgical unit, a testament to her commitment to the difficult and often life-saving work performed in that department.  The city's constant drizzle mirrored the relentless pressure Eleanor felt, the unspoken expectations weighing heavily on her shoulders. The panoramic views of Puget Sound, often a source of quiet solace, were obscured today by a dense fog that hung like a shroud over the entire city.
