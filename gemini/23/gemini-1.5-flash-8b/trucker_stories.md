The biting wind whipped at the cab of the 18-wheeler, a relentless, icy claw scraping against the already-strained metal.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, coated the desolate landscape stretching out before Jasper "Jax"  McCarthy, a veteran trucker with calloused hands and eyes that held the weight of countless miles and sleepless nights.  The faded, neon-orange paint of his rig, the "Iron Horse," seemed to fade further into the blinding white.  He was stranded, not by accident, but by a calculated gamble gone wrong.  Heâ€™d bet on a faster route, a route that sliced through a section of the mountains notorious for its unpredictable weather, and now, hours after a sudden blizzard descended, he was trapped.  The only sound besides the wind's mournful wail was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine, struggling against the mountain's grip.  His destination, the small, remote town of Havenwood, seemed impossibly far away.

Setting: The desolate, snow-covered peaks of the Rocky Mountains, winter.  The landscape is vast, unforgiving, and a stark contrast to the small, isolated town of Havenwood nestled within the valley.  The Iron Horse, a weathered but powerful 18-wheeler, is a symbol of Jax's resilience and the challenges of the open road.
