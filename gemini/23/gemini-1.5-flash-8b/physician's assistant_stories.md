The fluorescent hum of the emergency room thrummed like a trapped hummingbird, a relentless counterpoint to the ragged breaths of the patients sprawled across the metal tables.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, Physician's Assistant at St. Jude's General Hospital, felt the familiar, unsettling pressure building in her chest.  Another night, another cascade of urgent calls, another relentless tide of human suffering.  The sterile scent of antiseptic mixed with the metallic tang of blood, a constant companion in the chaotic symphony of the ER.

The setting was a blur of activity.  A stark white room, punctuated by the urgent beeps of heart monitors, the clatter of medical equipment, and the hurried footsteps of nurses and doctors.  Beyond the fluorescent glow, the city of Zenith sprawled, a concrete jungle veiled in the early morning mist.  The night air, thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and damp earth, seemed to mirror the heavy atmosphere in the room.  A faint drizzle outside pattered against the windows, a melancholic counterpoint to the desperate pleas echoing within the walls.
