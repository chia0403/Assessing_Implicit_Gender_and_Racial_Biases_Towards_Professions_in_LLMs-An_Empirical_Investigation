The chill seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's bones, not from the November air whistling through the gaps in the cobbled alleyway, but from the pervasive, almost tangible sadness that clung to the butcher shop.  "Butterfield's Finest Cuts," the sign above the grimy, blood-splattered door proclaimed, a stark contradiction to the atmosphere within.  Barty, a man whose weathered hands seemed to have absorbed the lifeblood of countless animals, stood hunched over a stainless steel worktable.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the piles of meat – beef, pork, lamb, each with its own story of life and eventual… transformation. The aroma, a potent blend of sweet and savory, mingled with the metallic tang of the butcher's tools and the faint, persistent scent of old blood.

The setting was the shadowed heart of Oakhaven, a once-bustling market town now reduced to a whisper of its former glory.  Grey, soot-stained houses huddled close together, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the unforgiving gloom.  The only sounds besides the rhythmic thump of Barty's knife were the occasional rustle of discarded newspapers and the distant, mournful cry of a solitary crow.  This was not the opulent marketplace of old, where farmers hawked fresh produce and merchants bartered fortunes.  Now, whispers followed the shadows, stories of hardship and despair intertwining with the rhythmic thump of Barty's knife.
