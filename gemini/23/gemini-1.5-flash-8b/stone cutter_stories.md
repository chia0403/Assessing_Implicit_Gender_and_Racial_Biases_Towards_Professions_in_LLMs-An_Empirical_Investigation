The biting wind, a relentless claw, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Silvan Mountains, clawing at Elara Stonehand's exposed skin.  Dust, fine as powdered amethyst, swirled around her, obscuring the already-muted light of the late afternoon sun.  Her workshop, a cramped alcove carved into the mountainside, smelled faintly of damp earth and the sharp, metallic tang of iron.  Rough-hewn wooden benches, scarred by years of use, lined the walls, overflowing with chipped fragments of obsidian and quartz.  Sunlight, filtered through a fractured sky, painted the tools lining the rough-hewn workbench in shifting hues of gold and crimson. Elara, her face weathered but etched with a fierce determination, adjusted the massive, wedge-shaped chisel in her calloused hand.  This was her domain, her sanctuary, and her prison.  This was the only life she had ever known.
