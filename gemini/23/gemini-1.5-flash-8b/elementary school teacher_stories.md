Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom, mimicking the relentless drumming in her temples.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and mildew, clung to the worn, linoleum floor.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the gloom filtering through the dusty windows of Room 2B at Maplewood Elementary School.  A single, flickering fluorescent bulb cast long, dancing shadows across the overflowing desks, where half-finished drawings of dinosaurs and fantastical creatures lay scattered amongst stray crayons and crumpled construction paper.  Eleven-year-old Leo's artwork, usually a vibrant display of fantastical beasts, was subdued today, almost as though the colour had drained from the world along with the daylight.  Mrs. Ainsworth, a woman etched with the lines of countless years spent in the trenches of teaching, felt the familiar ache of something amiss.  The normally boisterous third grade seemed muted, subdued, even unnerved. This wasn't just a typical rainy Tuesday; this felt different, heavier, somehow fraught with unspoken anxieties.
