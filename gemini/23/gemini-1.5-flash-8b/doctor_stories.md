Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Dr. Aris Thorne's heartbeat.  The small, dusty town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Bleak Mountains, had always felt like a pressure cooker, but tonight the simmering tension threatened to boil over.  The air, already thick with the smell of pine and damp earth, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the residents.  Aris, his tweed jacket soaked through, stared out the grimy window.  The jagged peaks of the mountains, usually a comforting backdrop, seemed to press down on Havenwood like a suffocating hand.  He adjusted the worn stethoscope around his neck, the metal cold against his skin, a stark contrast to the rising heat in his chest.  He knew, deep in his bones, this was not just another routine evening.
