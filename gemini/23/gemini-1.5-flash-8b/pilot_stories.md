The biting wind, a relentless whisper of glacial ice, clawed at Amelia Petrova's flight suit.  Above, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas pierced the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple hues.  Below, the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, a chaotic river of broken ice and jagged seracs, snaked its way down towards the Everest Base Camp.  Amelia, her calloused hands gripping the controls of the single-engine, piston-powered aircraft, the "Everest Eagle," felt a tremor run through her, not from the aircraft itself, but from the sheer, terrifying isolation.  She was alone, miles above the world, a fragile speck of metal against a canvas of monumental, unforgiving nature.  The only sound, apart from the roar of the engine and the howl of the wind, was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart echoing in her ears.  The mission, a critical aerial survey of the glacier's shifting ice, hung in the balance, as precarious as the ice shards below.  The remote, unforgiving landscape held its breath, waiting for her next move.
