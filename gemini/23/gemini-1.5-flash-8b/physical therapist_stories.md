The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a monotonous drone punctuated only by the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Hayesâ€™s orthopaedic boots on the polished linoleum, felt like a relentless heartbeat.  Amelia, Physical Therapist,  slid open the door to room 207, the antiseptic smell of disinfectant a familiar comfort in the sterile space.  Sunlight, thin and pale, struggled to pierce the grime-encrusted windowpanes, casting long, skeletal shadows across the room.  Outside, the city throbbed with a life Amelia rarely felt connected to. Inside this meticulously organized space, amidst the stacks of medical journals and the silent hum of machines, lay the raw material of her work: injured bodies, fractured souls, and the quiet hope for healing.

**Setting:** A bustling, yet gritty, city known for its towering skyscrapers and hidden alleyways.  The physical therapy clinic, "Rehab Rising," is tucked away on a side street, its facade weathered but its interior impeccably clean and sterile.  The city's relentless energy contrasts with the quiet focus required within the walls of the clinic.
