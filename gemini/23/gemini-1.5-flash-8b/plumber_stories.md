The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, in a persistent, mournful drip, echoed the rhythmic thump of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's heart.  She, a petite woman with hands calloused but surprisingly swift, crouched beside a busted pipe, the cold metal seeping into her jeans.  The air, thick with the stench of mildew and desperation, clung to her like a shroud.  This wasn't the glamorous, sparkling world of high-end fixtures Amy had envisioned when she'd first hung her shingle.  Tonight, in the heart of the gritty, forgotten alleyways of New Haven, Connecticut, it was a battle against the relentless tide of unseen water.  

The setting was the autumn of 1997.  New Haven, known for its ivy-covered colonial architecture and vibrant university scene, held a darker underbelly, a labyrinth of narrow streets and cramped apartments where the city's pulse beat a different rhythm.  Rusty fire escapes snaked up brick buildings, punctuated by the occasional flickering street lamp.  The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and the sharp tang of woodsmoke from a nearby diner, and an undercurrent of fear often lingered in the shadows. This particular alley, tucked behind a row of dilapidated storefronts, felt particularly isolated, an echo chamber of the city's hidden struggles.
