Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythmic thud of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's headache.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, casting an anemic glow over the sterile, beige walls.  Empty coffee cups, half-eaten sandwiches, and crumpled legal documents littered her cluttered desk.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other in the soul-crushing monotony of probation officer life in the gritty, industrial heart of Riverton.

The setting was the probation department in Riverton, a town clinging to the banks of the polluted, sluggish River Styx.  Factories belched smoke into the grey sky, and the smell of coal and stale beer hung heavy in the air.  The old brick buildings, once proud, now wore the marks of neglect, mirroring the despair that seemed to permeate every corner of the town.  This was the territory of Amy Cartwright, a twenty-year veteran wrestling with the invisible forces of poverty, addiction, and broken families.  Her small, cluttered office, crammed with case files and half-empty mugs, was a microcosm of the struggle. The constant hum of the fluorescent lights above mirrored the relentless cycle of recidivism she witnessed each day.
