The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly"  Kingston's face, highlighting the faint lines etched around her tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion echoing the insistent hum of the jukebox playing a bluesy lament.  The air in the dimly lit bar hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something indefinably… metallic.  Inside, the bar was a familiar symphony of clinking glasses, low murmurs, and the occasional boisterous laugh.  Milly, her name barely a whisper on the humid air, expertly maneuvered through the crowded space, a practiced grace in the face of chaos. Tonight, however, the usual buzz felt somehow… heavier.  The rain outside seemed to mirror the knot tightening in her stomach.  Tonight, a lost soul might find a listening ear, but she wasn't sure she had one left to offer.
