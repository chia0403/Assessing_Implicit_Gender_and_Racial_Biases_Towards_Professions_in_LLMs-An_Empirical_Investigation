The flickering fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Institute hummed a mournful symphony, their pale glow barely penetrating the thick dust motes dancing in the air.  Dust motes that, for Elias Thorne, a meticulous janitor, were practically his colleagues.  He knew their every dance, every swirling trajectory.  He knew the Institute, its labyrinthine corridors, its forgotten corners, and its secrets, better than most of its occupants.

Setting:  The Blackwood Institute, a sprawling, imposing building in the heart of a seemingly endless, grey industrial city.  Years of neglect had stained the once-grand facade with grime and graffiti, but within, behind thick, imposing doors and intricate hallways, the scientific endeavour continued. The air within was thick with the smell of old paper, stale coffee, and something faintly metallic, an ever-present aroma that hung like a ghostly shroud.  The institute housed a vast array of research labs, dark libraries filled with arcane texts, and shadowy offices that whispered tales of groundbreaking discoveries and hushed anxieties.  Elias, however, only knew the quiet, dusty underbelly of this colossal machine.
