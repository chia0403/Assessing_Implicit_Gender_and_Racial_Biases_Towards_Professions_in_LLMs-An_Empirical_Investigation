The biting wind whipped Amelia Josephine Blackwood's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  London, 1888.  Fog, thick and grey as a shroud, clung to the cobbled streets of Fleet Street, obscuring the gaslight lamps like flickering ghosts.

Amelia, a young, sharp-featured lawyer with eyes the color of stormy seas, shivered, pulling her shawl tighter.  Her office, a cramped space above a bustling print shop, offered little solace.  The rhythmic clatter of presses and the shouts of hawkers drifting up from below were a constant, insistent soundtrack to the growing unease in her stomach.  A half-finished legal brief, meticulously written, lay discarded on her cluttered desk, a testament to the case that consumed her thoughts – a complex and bewildering estate dispute involving the mysteriously vanished Blackwood family fortune.  The case was less about money, however, and more about uncovering the truth behind the family's unsettling secrets, secrets whispered in hushed tones amongst the city’s underbelly.
