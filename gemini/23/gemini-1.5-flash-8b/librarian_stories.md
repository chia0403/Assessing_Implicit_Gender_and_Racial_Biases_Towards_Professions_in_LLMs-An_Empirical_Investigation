The chipped paint of the Dewey Decimal System sign, a faded, almost ghostly blue, seemed to hum with a low thrumming vibration as Elara Ainsworth traced the numerals with a fingertip.  The library, a sprawling Victorian mansion on the edge of Blackwood Woods, felt thick with unspoken stories, a whispered history that clung to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall windows.  Books lined the walls, stretching to a vaulted ceiling, their spines a labyrinth of leather-bound wisdom and paper-thin whispers of forgotten worlds.  The air, usually heavy with the scent of aged paper and beeswax polish, was tinged with the sharp, piney aroma of the encroaching forest.  Elara, her name echoing the quiet grace of a flowing river, was alone in the stacks, her long, braided auburn hair falling around her like a tapestry as she traced the path to the forgotten periodicals section.  This wasnâ€™t a typical Wednesday afternoon.
