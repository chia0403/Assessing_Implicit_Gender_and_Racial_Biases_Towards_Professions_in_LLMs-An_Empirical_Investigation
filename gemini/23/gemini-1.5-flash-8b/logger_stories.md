The biting wind, a relentless prairie wolf, howled across the exposed expanse of the Northern Great Plains.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, clung to the skeletal branches of the towering pines, a frosted shroud draped over the landscape.  January's icy grip pressed down on everything, a relentless reminder of the unforgiving nature of the land.  This was the domain of  Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood, a logger whose life was as stark and unforgiving as the winter itself.  Bart, with his weathered face etched with the stories of a thousand fallen trees and the constant whisper of the wind, stood at the edge of the timberline, surveying the vast forest stretching before him.  His calloused hands, stained with the deep ochre of the earth and the rich brown of pine sap, tightened around the worn leather grip of his axe.  The air, sharp and clean, tasted of pine and impending frost.  The silence, broken only by the groaning of the snow-laden trees and the rhythmic thump-thump of his own heart, was the only soundtrack to this desolate, yet majestic, landscape.
