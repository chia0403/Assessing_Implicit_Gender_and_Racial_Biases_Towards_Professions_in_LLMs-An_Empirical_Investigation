Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated shed, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Everett's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, hung heavy in the small, cluttered office.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light, illuminating chipped paint and a scattering of crumpled blueprints.  Amy, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead, hunched over a worn laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.  The deadline for the listing of the Blackwood Manor loomed, a looming shadow in the oppressive atmosphere.

This was not your typical suburban real estate listing.  The Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Hollow, had been a local legend for generations, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a place that spoke of secrets and shadows.  The house itself, a brooding Victorian monstrosity with a history shrouded in mystery, felt far removed from the bustling, sun-drenched streets of the city Amy was accustomed to.  Its sprawling façade, peeling paint and decaying ivy, seemed to absorb the light, leaving a chilling darkness in its wake.  The local gossip, often unreliable and exaggerated, spoke of unsettling noises, spectral whispers, and the lingering scent of something indefinable – something akin to fear itself.  Amy, a pragmatist at heart, knew stories were one thing, but a strong sale was another, and now, she had to find out if the whispers held more truth than just mere conjecture.
