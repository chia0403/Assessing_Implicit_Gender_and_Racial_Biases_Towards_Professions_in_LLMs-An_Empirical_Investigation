The biting wind whipped Amelia "Maisie" Cartwright's faded orange safety vest around her, stinging her cheeks and making her breath puff out in white clouds.  Sunrise, already a molten orange-gold over the jagged peaks of the distant Appalachians, painted the desolate stretch of Interstate 81 a similar hue.  Dust motes danced in the thin air, swirling around the discarded cones and scattered debris Maisie was meticulously sweeping from the shoulder of the highway.  It was a Monday morning, the kind that felt like a forgotten Tuesday after a long weekend.  The air, thick with the smell of pine and something acrid, something burnt, clung to the early morning stillness.  Maisie, a seasoned highway worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand long days, felt a familiar ache in her joints, a silent protest against the unending rhythm of her work.  This stretch of road, known locally as "The Devil's Curve," had been a graveyard for unwary drivers for years.
