The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Amelia Finch's kindergarten classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the cacophony of happy, unfettered sounds.  Crayons shrieked across paper, paint splattered with joyous abandon onto canvases, and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet echoed against the linoleum floor.  Amelia, a woman whose smile could melt glaciers, stood perched precariously on a wobbly stool, observing the chaotic symphony with a serene, practiced eye.  Today was Storytime, and the tiny, eager hands were already reaching for the brightly coloured storybooks piled neatly on the small table, their eyes gleaming with anticipation.  But beneath the surface, a subtle tremor had settled into Amelia's usually cheerful spirit. It was the sort of quiet unease that clung to the edges of a familiar comfort, a feeling that whispered of something unknown, something lurking just beyond the vibrant, colourful walls of the classroom.

The setting was the brightly painted, slightly overcrowded, but undeniably loved, kindergarten classroom at the heart of Oakwood Elementary School.  Sunlight streamed through the large window, dappling the colourful posters and alphabet charts with golden light.  The air, thick with the scent of freshly sharpened crayons and the faint, sweet perfume of children's clothes, was a testament to the warmth and energy that pulsed through this small corner of the world. The children's artwork—colourful drawings of fantastical creatures, sun-drenched landscapes, and smiling suns—hung proudly on the walls, an impromptu gallery of their imaginations.  A chipped, wooden rocking horse, a constant visitor from the children's play time, sat quietly near the story table, its painted mane dusty from countless tiny hands.  This seemingly idyllic space, though, held a secret.  A secret that was starting to gnaw at Amelia's heart.
