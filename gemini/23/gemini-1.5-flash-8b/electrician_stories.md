Sparky, 32, with grease smudged across her cheeks and a perpetually tired expression,  knew this space intimately.  It was here, amidst the skeletal remains of a bygone era, that she found a peculiar peace, a refuge from the relentless demands of her life as a licensed electrician in the bustling metropolis of New Zenith.
