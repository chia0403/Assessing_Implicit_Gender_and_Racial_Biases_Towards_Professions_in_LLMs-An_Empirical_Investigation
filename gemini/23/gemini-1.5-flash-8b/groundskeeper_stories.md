The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Em" Finch's worn coat around her legs, tugging at the faded emerald green of the overgrown ivy clinging to the crumbling stone walls of Blackwood Manor.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, carried the whisper of secrets lost to the ages.

Towering oaks, their branches skeletal against the bruised sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawns.  Broken terracotta pots lay scattered like fallen jewels, relics of a forgotten grandeur.  Em knew the history of the place, the whispered tales of a family whoâ€™d lost everything, a family whose ghosts seemed to linger in the very air.  Today, however, the manor was only a canvas, awaiting the touch of her hands to coax forth the resilience of nature.
