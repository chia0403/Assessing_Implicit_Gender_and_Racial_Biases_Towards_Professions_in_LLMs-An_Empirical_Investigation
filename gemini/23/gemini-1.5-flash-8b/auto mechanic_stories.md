The greasy smell hung thick in the air, a familiar blanket that draped over the cluttered workshop.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the array of tools and parts.  This was Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's sanctuary, his domain, his kingdom of clanking metal and whirring gears. Barty, a man perpetually stained with oil and punctuated by the calluses of a lifetime spent coaxing life back into sputtering engines, leaned against a towering stack of brake rotors.  He surveyed the mangled remains of a vintage Ford pickup, its once gleaming paint now a patchwork of faded hues.  Outside, the rhythmic chirping of cicadas and the distant rumble of passing trucks were the only sounds that punctuated the quiet hum of the shop.
