The chipped porcelain doll, Amelia Featherstone, stared accusingly from its dusty perch on the windowsill.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated panes, painted dancing patterns across the room.  Dust motes, like tiny, skittering specters, swirled around the remnants of a forgotten afternoon tea.  This was the atelier of  Seraphina  Everly, dressmaker extraordinaire, or perhaps, more accurately, dressmaker *extraordinaire* in her own estimation.  The scent of old fabric, beeswax, and something vaguely floral – possibly a stray sprig of lavender from a forgotten bouquet – hung heavy in the air.  Seraphina, a woman of forty-odd years with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a perpetually ruffled apron, sighed.  Another client had cancelled.  Another commission abandoned.  Another whisper of a dwindling reputation to contend with.


The atelier, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the sprawling, rain-soaked city of Aethelgard, was a testament to its owner's eccentric nature.  Stacks of meticulously sorted fabrics – silks as soft as moonlight, velvets the colour of twilight, brocades woven with constellations – overflowed from every available surface.  Sketches, pinned to walls that seemed to groan under the weight of centuries of dreams, depicted gowns both impossibly elegant and audaciously avant-garde.  A single, ornate sewing machine, humming quietly beneath a chipped porcelain lamp, was the only other sound.  This tiny haven, once a beacon of creative brilliance, now felt more like a mausoleum of unfulfilled potential.
