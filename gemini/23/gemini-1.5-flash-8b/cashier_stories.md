The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" convenience store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's day.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow glow, clinging to the chipped paint of the counter where she was stationed.  Empty coffee cups, overflowing with dried-up grounds, littered the sticky laminate.  Outside, the grey November sky wept a persistent drizzle, mirroring the weary weight in Amelia's chest.  She sighed, the sound swallowed by the muffled clatter of the automatic doors opening and closing.  It was a Tuesday, the worst day of the week, and the usual Tuesday crowd of bleary-eyed commuters and disgruntled parents were already filtering through the aisles.  Amelia's job, her life, felt exactly as grey and monotonous as the November sky outside.
