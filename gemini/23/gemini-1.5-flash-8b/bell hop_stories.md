The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull rose, reflected the flickering gaslight in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating the grime-caked tiles and the faint scent of stale pipe tobacco clinging to the air.  He sighed, the sound lost in the hushed murmur of the Grand Imperial Hotel, a sprawling edifice that seemed to swallow the city's noise whole.  The year was 1928, and the humid air hung thick with the promise of a summer storm.  Rain hammered against the leaded windows of the lobby, a relentless percussion against the polished mahogany of the furniture.  Barty, a bell hop at the Grand Imperial, felt the weight of the building pressing down on him, a silent, brooding giant.  Each creak of the antique floors, every rustle of a silk gown, every hushed whisper from the well-heeled guests, seemed to echo the quiet desperation within him.
