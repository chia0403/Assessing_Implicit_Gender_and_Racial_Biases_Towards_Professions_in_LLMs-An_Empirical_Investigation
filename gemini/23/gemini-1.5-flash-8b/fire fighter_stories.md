The acrid tang of smoke, a familiar companion, stung Captain Amelia Hernandez's nostrils.  She coughed, the harsh sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno raging within the three-story Victorian at 14 Elm Street.  Flames licked at the eaves, painting the already-chilled October night in hues of orange and black.  The air hung thick with the smell of burning wood and something else, something metallic, something...wrong.  This fire wasn't acting right.  It was devouring the building with an unnatural ferocity.

Setting:

14 Elm Street, a lovingly preserved but increasingly dilapidated Victorian, stood on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of the city's historic district.  Late October in the northeastern United States brought with it a crisp chill in the air, but the relentless heat radiating from the burning house felt like a cruel irony.  A thin layer of frost already coated the shrubbery, a stark contrast to the fiery spectacle unfolding before her.  Beyond the immediate chaos of the blaze, the city felt like a distant, muffled hum, the rhythmic sirens a mournful chorus against the deafening crackle of the inferno.  The historic architecture surrounding the house, with its ornate details and aging facades, seemed to stand in solemn witness to the destruction unfolding.
