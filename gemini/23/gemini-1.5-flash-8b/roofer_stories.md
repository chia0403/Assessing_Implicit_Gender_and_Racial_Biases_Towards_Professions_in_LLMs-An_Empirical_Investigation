The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's weathered face.  He squinted, the slanting grey light reflecting off the treacherous expanse of the roof, a vast, undulating sea of corrugated iron stretching before him.  Below, the city sprawled like a tapestry of twinkling lights, a stark contrast to the bleak, windswept landscape of the old industrial district where Barty worked.  This wasn't the glamorous, sun-drenched rooftops of the historic downtown districts; this was the forgotten, grimy underbelly, the forgotten corners where the cityâ€™s bones were laid bare.  Each rusted nail, each chipped piece of asphalt, whispered tales of forgotten dreams and broken promises.  Barty, a roofer for over twenty years, knew these tales well.  He'd walked this landscape with his hands, his feet, and his gaze, carrying the weight of the city's past on his shoulders, just like the ancient timbers beneath his boots.  Today, though, a new story was beginning to unfurl, and not on the roof.
