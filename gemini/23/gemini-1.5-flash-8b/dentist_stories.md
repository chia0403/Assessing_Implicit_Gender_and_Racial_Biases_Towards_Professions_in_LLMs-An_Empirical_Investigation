The fluorescent hum of the waiting room thrummed against Dr. Eleanor Vance's skin, a constant, low-level vibration that mirrored the anxiety pulsing in her veins.  It wasn't the usual pre-appointment jitters, the familiar anticipation of the drill's rhythmic song and the quiet murmur of conversations.  This was different.  This wasâ€¦heavy.  The antiseptic smell of the clinic hung thick in the air, usually a comforting blanket, now a suffocating shroud.  A single, framed watercolour painting of a storm-tossed sea hung above the reception desk, a stark contrast to the sterile white walls.  The painting, surprisingly, felt unnervingly familiar.

Setting: A small, but well-established, dental practice nestled on a quiet street in the heart of a quaint, slightly decaying, seaside town.  The town, known for its charming shops and weathered fishing boats, held a secret undercurrents of unspoken histories and whispered rumours.   A persistent, salty breeze carried the aroma of the ocean, mingling with the floral scent of the nearby gardens.  Early morning mist clung to the harbour, obscuring the silhouettes of fishing boats. The overall impression was one of both beauty and a lurking unease.
