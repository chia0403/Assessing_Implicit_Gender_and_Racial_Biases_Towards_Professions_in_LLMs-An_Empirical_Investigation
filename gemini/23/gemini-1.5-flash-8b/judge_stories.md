The biting wind whipped Amelia Stone, Judge Amelia Stone of the Third Circuit Court, across the cobblestones of Oakhaven.  Rain, slick and relentless, mirrored the gloom that clung to the ancient, timber-framed houses lining the narrow streets.  Oakhaven, a town nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Blackwood Forest, was always a somber place, but today, the air hung thick with a particular, oppressive stillness.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, felt heavy, almost suffocating.  Amelia, her dark cloak straining against the gust, hurried towards the courthouse, a squat, grey edifice that seemed to absorb the encroaching twilight.  The flickering gaslight above the entrance cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with unspoken anxieties.  Within, the hushed whispers of the town’s inhabitants – whispers about the missing Lord Ashworth and the strange occurrences plaguing the Blackwood – had already begun their relentless echo.  Her crisp black judicial robe, usually a symbol of order, felt tonight like a shroud.
