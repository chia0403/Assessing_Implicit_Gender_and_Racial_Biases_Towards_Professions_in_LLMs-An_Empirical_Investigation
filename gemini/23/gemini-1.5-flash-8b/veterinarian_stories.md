The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy shards of rain.  The sprawling, ramshackle barn, its wooden siding warped and greyed by decades of exposure to the elements, smelled faintly of damp hay and the metallic tang of blood.  Flickering candlelight danced across the cobweb-draped rafters, illuminating Amelia's determined face as she knelt beside a trembling, injured stag.  The creature, its antlers scarred and one leg awkwardly twisted, lay in a pool of its own crimson blood, its large, frightened eyes fixed on her.  This remote valley, nestled deep within the heart of the Tyrian Mountains, was Amelia's sanctuary, her battlefield, and her curse.

This wasn't a typical veterinary emergency; this was a fight for survival, one animal at a time.  The scent of pine and damp earth clung to the air, a symphony of the wild, a stark contrast to the cozy, yet equally desolate, village of Oakhaven nestled below, where the rhythmic crackling of hearth fires sounded like distant comfort.
