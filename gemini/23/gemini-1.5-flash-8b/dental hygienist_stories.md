The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Anya Petrova's gloved fingers on the polished stainless steel tray.  The scent of antiseptic, faint but persistent, hung heavy in the air, mixing with the faint, metallic tang of fear that sometimes clung to the waiting room.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, a time when the predictable ebb and flow of patients usually settled into a comfortable rhythm.  But today, something felt… off.

**Setting:**

Anya’s office, nestled in the heart of a bustling, yet slightly forgotten, section of downtown.  The street outside was a tapestry of muted colors, reflecting the subdued energy of a city at the brink of afternoon.  Rain slicked the pavement, mirroring the sheen of polished teeth she herself had so painstakingly cleaned countless times before.  Inside, the waiting room, a small space adorned with slightly faded posters of healthy smiles and pamphlets on oral hygiene, felt claustrophobic, despite being small.  The high-backed, vinyl chairs were a faded beige, their worn fabric a testament to countless hours of anxious silences and whispered conversations.
