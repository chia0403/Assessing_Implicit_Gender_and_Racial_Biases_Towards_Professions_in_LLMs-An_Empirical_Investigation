Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Hope's Haven" clinic, a dilapidated building perched precariously on the edge of the sprawling, dust-choked mining town of Emberfall.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating Dr.  Anya Petrovaâ€™s determined face.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid smell of burnt plastic. Anya, a seasoned emergency medical technician with eyes the color of storm clouds and a will forged in the fires of countless crises, adjusted her headlamp, its beam cutting through the oppressive darkness.  The clinic, normally a symphony of hushed whispers and the rhythmic beep of vital signs monitors, was tonight a cacophony of ragged breaths, desperate pleas, and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a heart struggling for life.
