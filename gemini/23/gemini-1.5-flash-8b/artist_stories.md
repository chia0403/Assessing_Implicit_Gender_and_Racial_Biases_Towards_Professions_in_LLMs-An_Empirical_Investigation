The chipped paint of the easel, a dull, sickly yellow, reflected the grey light filtering through the grimy window of Amelia Blackwood's attic studio.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight, illuminating a canvas nearly as stark as the room itself.  Amelia Blackwood, a young artist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a spirit as volatile as the weather, traced a line with a charcoal pencil, the faint whisper of the pencil tip against paper the only sound in the suffocating silence.  The attic, a forgotten realm beneath the steeply pitched roof of the Blackwood manor, had been her sanctuary for as long as she could remember, a place where the relentless rhythm of the outside world faded to a muted hum.  The faint scent of mildew and old paper hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of turpentine, a constant companion in her artistic pursuits.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a soundtrack to the tempestuous emotions simmering within her.
