The chipped porcelain sign, painted with faded sunflowers, creaked in the relentless wind.  Below it, the scent of warm yeast and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting October chill.  This was the "Golden Crust," a tiny bakery tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of the Windswept Vale, a town clinging precariously to the slopes of the Whisperwind Mountains.  Amelia Rosewell, her cheeks rosy from the bakery's warmth,  watched the swirling snow begin to fall, a silent flurry of white against the backdrop of ancient, grey stone buildings.  Amelia, a baker with hands as nimble as sparrows' wings, was already preparing for the evening rush.  The rhythmic thump of the dough-kneading machine, a relic from her great-grandmother's time, was the only sound besides the wind in the narrow alleyway.  Tonight, the air held a special tension, not just because of the approaching winter, but because the annual Winter Solstice feast was fast approaching.  Every crust, every croissant, every loaf of rye bread had to be perfect.
