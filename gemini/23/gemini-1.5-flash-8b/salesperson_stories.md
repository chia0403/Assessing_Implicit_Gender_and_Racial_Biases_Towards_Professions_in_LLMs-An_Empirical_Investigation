The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need for a Perfect Party" warehouse hummed, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's relentless rhythm.  Dust motes danced in the pale glare, illuminating rows upon rows of inflatable unicorns, oversized party hats, and novelty noisemakers.  Amelia, a whirlwind of auburn hair and perpetually caffeinated energy, navigated the labyrinthine aisles, her voice a practiced blend of cheerful enthusiasm and subtle persuasion.  Today, the target was the "Mega-Masquerade Mayhem" kit, a highly sought-after (and ridiculously priced) collection of masks and accessories for a truly extravagant soiree.  The warehouse, vast and echoing, was a landscape of potential celebrations, but today, Amelia saw only one particular prize.  And she was determined to snag it.
