The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned broadcasting station hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the static crackle emanating from Amelia Petrova's headset.  Amelia, a Radio Technician with callsign "Sparrow," adjusted the dials on a battered console, her fingers tracing the faded inscriptions beneath the glass.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating a dense network of wires and components that seemed to whisper tales of forgotten broadcasts and long-ago voices.  The station, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the sprawling city of Aethelgard, was a monument to a bygone era of radio, a relic of a time when voices carried across vast distances, unfiltered and unconstrained.  Amelia, however, felt as if she was the last custodian of a fading echo.
