The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent lights of the "Premier Financial Solutions" office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window.  Amelia "Amy" Carter, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that seemed permanently frozen in a polite, weary grimace, meticulously alphabetized the mountain of incoming mail.  A stack of "Important" memos, each with a hastily scrawled "Urgent" stamp, threatened to topple over her neatly arranged pile of paperwork.  The rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her keyboard was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, except for the occasional, almost imperceptible *clink* of a nearby coffee machine.

The office was a testament to a once-proud, now slightly dilapidated financial empire.  Beige walls, once pristine, were now stained with years of coffee spills and the faint, lingering scent of old paper.  Sun-faded floral wallpaper clung precariously to the slightly peeling paint.  Rows of identical, slightly-too-small metal desks lined the walls, each a monument to countless lost deals and forgotten deadlines.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and old, almost-forgotten anxieties, hung heavy in the room.  Amy's worn, slightly-too-big blouse, a relic from a brighter past, was her only vestige of a life that no longer matched the chipped Formica and faded dreams of the office around her.
