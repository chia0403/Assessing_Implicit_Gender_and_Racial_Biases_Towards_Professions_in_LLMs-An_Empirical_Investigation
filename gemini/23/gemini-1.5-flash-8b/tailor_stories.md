The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled alley, illuminating the chipped paint of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's tiny tailoring shop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating a meticulously arranged array of fabrics – silks the colour of twilight, velvets the hue of midnight, linens as crisp as winter snow.  Barty Butterfield, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused by years of crafting exquisite garments, were currently meticulously pinning a delicate lace trim to a shimmering crimson satin gown.  The scent of lavender and beeswax, a comforting aroma in the otherwise pungent air of the city's underbelly, hung heavy in the air.  The year is 1888.  London, a city of smoky factories and whispering secrets, was Barty’s world.  His shop, tucked away on a forgotten side street near the docks, was more than just a place of trade; it was his sanctuary, a refuge from the relentless march of time and the clamour of the outside world.
