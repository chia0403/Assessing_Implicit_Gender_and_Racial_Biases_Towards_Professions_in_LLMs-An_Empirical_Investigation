The aroma of sizzling onions and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a fragrant curtain draped over the tiny, stone-walled kitchen.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a riot of sunflowers, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  This was  Amelia  Seraphina  Delacroix's sanctuary, her domain, her kitchen.  Though the village of Oakhaven huddled beneath the looming shadow of Mount Cinder, a constant reminder of the volcano's dormant fury, the warmth emanating from the hearth and the comforting sizzle of the pan were Amelia's personal sunbeams.  For Amelia, a cook by trade and passion, the kitchen wasn't just a place of work, but a haven where flavour coaxed stories from the simplest ingredients.  Today, however, the air hummed with a different kind of energy, a tension thicker than the roasted garlic she was diligently preparing.
