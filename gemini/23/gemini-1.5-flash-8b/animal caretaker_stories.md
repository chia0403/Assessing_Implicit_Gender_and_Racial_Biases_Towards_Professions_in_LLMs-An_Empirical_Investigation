The chill of the twilight seeped into the Keeper's Quarters, clinging to the damp stone walls and the thick, woven rugs that barely muffled the rhythmic thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, usually thick with the scent of exotic spices and the softer smells of various creatures, now carried a peculiar undercurrent, a metallic tang that she couldn't quite place.  Amelia, Keeper of the Whispering Woods' menagerie, adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel, the familiar weight grounding her in the quiet solitude.

The Whispering Woods, a sprawling sanctuary nestled deep within the shadowed reaches of the Ardennes, was a place of hushed secrets and vibrant life.  Towering trees, their canopies draped in emerald twilight, shielded the enclosures where exotic birds sang their dawn songs in the fading light, where shy gazelles grazed in the velvet grass, and where massive, slumbering griffins rested in their sun-drenched grottoes.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was fractured.  A low, guttural growl, originating from deep within the Serpent's Roost, echoed through the halls, a chilling counterpoint to the whispers of the wind.  Amelia's gut clenched.  Something was terribly wrong.
