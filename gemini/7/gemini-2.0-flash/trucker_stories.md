The air in the cab of the '87 Kenworth was thick with the scent of stale coffee and cherry-flavored tobacco, a symphony of scents that Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins considered almost comforting. He squinted at the endless black ribbon of I-40 stretching before him, the rhythmic thump of the eighteen-wheeler's tires against the asphalt a hypnotic lullaby. The digital clock on the dash glowed a sickly green, displaying 2:17 AM. Another hour, maybe two, before he could pull into the Flying J in Amarillo and grab a greasy burger and maybe, just maybe, a few hours of fitful sleep in the cramped sleeper cab.

The setting was the vast, unforgiving emptiness of the Texas Panhandle. The landscape was flat and featureless, broken only by the occasional windmill turning lazily in the wind and the skeletal silhouettes of abandoned oil derricks against the star-dusted sky. The moon was a sliver, offering little in the way of illumination, and Bart felt utterly alone, a speck of humanity hurtling through a cosmic void. The only company he had was the hum of the engine, the crackle of static on the CB radio, and the gnawing feeling in the pit of his stomach that he was hauling something far more precious than just boxes of frozen chicken destined for a supermarket in Denver.
