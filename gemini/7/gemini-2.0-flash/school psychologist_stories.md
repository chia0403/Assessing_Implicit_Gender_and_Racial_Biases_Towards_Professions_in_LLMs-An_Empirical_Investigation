The oppressive August heat hung heavy in the air, thick and cloying like cheap perfume. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, her auburn hair plastered to her neck despite being pulled back in a tight bun, fumbled with her keys, the metallic tang of sweat clinging to her fingertips. She unlocked the heavy oak door of Northwood Elementary, the groan of the hinges echoing in the otherwise silent hallway. The aroma of floor wax and summer-stagnant classrooms, usually a comforting backdrop to her work, felt cloying and suffocating today.

Northwood Elementary, a red brick building built in the 1950s, sat nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a small, seemingly idyllic town in rural Pennsylvania. Its two stories housed colorful classrooms filled with the hopes and dreams of hundreds of children. But beneath the surface of cheerful murals and meticulously crafted art projects, Eleanor knew there were hidden struggles, anxieties, and traumas that often went unnoticed. Today, she wasn't here to solve problems, not yet anyway. Today was about preparation. The new school year was just around the corner, and Eleanor needed to finalize her schedule, review student files, and brace herself for the inevitable wave of new referrals.

She pushed the door open further and stepped inside, the coolness of the air conditioning offering a momentary reprieve from the oppressive heat outside. But even in the relative comfort of the deserted school, a knot of apprehension tightened in Eleanor's stomach. This year felt different. Something feltâ€¦off. And she couldn't quite put her finger on why.
