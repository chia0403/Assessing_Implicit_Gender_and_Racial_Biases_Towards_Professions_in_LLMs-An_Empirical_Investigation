The fluorescent lights of Dental Dreams beamed down on Dr. Eleanor Rose Cartwright, reflecting off the sterile chrome of her dental tools. It was a Tuesday, typically a quieter day after the Monday madness of toothaches and overdue cleanings, but even the relative calm couldn't soothe the persistent thrum of anxiety that vibrated beneath her crisp, white coat.

Eleanor was a dentist, a good one, with steady hands and a comforting bedside manner honed over ten years of practice. Sheâ€™d built Dental Dreams from the ground up, transforming a dilapidated storefront in the once-vibrant, now slightly-faded seaside town of Port Blossom into a haven for oral hygiene. Outside, the salt-laced air nipped at the windows, carrying the faint, melancholic cry of seagulls. Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged Maine coast, was a place steeped in history and whispers of old legends, a place where the sea held secrets close to its heart. Today, the sky was a bruised grey, mirroring the unsettling feeling that clung to Eleanor like seaweed to a shipwreck. She wasn't sure why, but she had the distinct, prickling sensation that something was about to change in her carefully constructed, predictably pleasant world.
