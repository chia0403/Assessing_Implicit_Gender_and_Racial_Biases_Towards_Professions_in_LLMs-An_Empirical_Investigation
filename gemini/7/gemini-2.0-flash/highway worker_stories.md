Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Delbert Ray McKinley:

**Setting:** The story opens on a sweltering July morning, deep in the heart of the Texas panhandle. The endless expanse of sun-baked asphalt stretches out like a shimmering mirage. Heat radiates off the road, distorting the horizon and baking the air. Scattered mesquite trees offer scant refuge from the relentless sun. The only sound is the droning hum of cicadas and the occasional rumble of a passing semi-truck, its horn a mournful wail swallowed by the vast emptiness. The air is thick with the smell of tar and dust, a scent as familiar as a childhood blanket to those who call this land home.

**Opening:**

Delbert Ray McKinley wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the salt stinging his eyes. He spit a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty shoulder of Highway 87, the brown stain disappearing almost instantly into the parched earth. He squinted at the shimmering heat haze rising from the asphalt. Another scorcher. Delbert, at 57, had seen more scorchers than most folks had seen birthdays. Heâ€™d spent the best part of his adult life baking under this unforgiving Texas sun, patching cracks, filling potholes, and generally keeping these arteries of commerce flowing. His skin was leathered, his hands calloused, and his eyes, once the bright blue of a summer sky, were now faded like well-worn denim. He sighed, the sound lost in the wind, and adjusted the brim of his sweat-stained "TxDOT" baseball cap. Today's task: repainting the faded lane dividers near mile marker 243. Not glamorous work, not important work in the grand scheme of things, but it was his work, and he did it damn well. He just wished he had a little more shade. And maybe a cold beer wouldn't hurt either. But first, he had to wake up Leroy, who was currently snoring peacefully in the cab of the orange maintenance truck, dreaming, no doubt, of iced tea and air conditioning.
