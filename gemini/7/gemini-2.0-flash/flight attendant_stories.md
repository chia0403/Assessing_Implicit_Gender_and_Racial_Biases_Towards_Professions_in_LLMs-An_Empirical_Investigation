Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant named Eliza Maeve Sterling:

**Setting:** A bustling gate at London Heathrow Airport, Terminal 5. It's early evening, the air thick with the sounds of announcements, rolling suitcases, and multilingual chatter. The soft, diffused lighting reflects off the polished floors, giving the impression of a grand, albeit temporary, ballroom for travelers from every corner of the globe. Beyond the glass windows, a slate-grey sky threatens rain, mirroring the subdued mood settling in after a day of hectic travel.

**Opening:**

Eliza Maeve Sterling smoothed down the crisp navy skirt of her British Airways uniform, a familiar ritual before stepping onto the aircraft. "Gate's a zoo, Lizzie," her colleague, David, muttered, adjusting his tie. "Another full flight to New York. Buckle up, it's gonna be a bumpy one."

Eliza offered a wry smile. "Aren't they all, David? Especially on a Friday evening." She glanced at the boarding pass scanner in his hand, then over at the queue snaking back towards the duty-free shops. Families, business travelers, honeymooners, solo adventurers - they all looked the same in this liminal space, a mixture of anticipation and exhaustion etched on their faces. Eliza took a deep breath, inhaling the distinct scent of overpriced coffee and jet fuel that always clung to Heathrow. It was a scent she'd grown to both love and loathe over the last seven years.

Seven years of smiles, of soothing anxieties, of navigating turbulent skies and even more turbulent passengers. Seven years of pretending everything was perfectly normal, even when the world outside the pressurized cabin felt like it was falling apart. Tonight, though, a peculiar unease tugged at the edges of her usual professional composure. It wasn't just the impending weather; it was something else, a prickling sensation that told her this flight wasn't going to be just another transatlantic crossing. Tonight, at thirty thousand feet, Eliza Maeve Sterling felt a shiver of premonition crawl down her spine. Something was different. And she had a feeling it wasn't just the in-flight movie selection.
