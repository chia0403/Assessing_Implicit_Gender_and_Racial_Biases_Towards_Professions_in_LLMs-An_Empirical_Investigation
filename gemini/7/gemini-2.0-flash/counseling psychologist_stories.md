Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist named Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Vance:

**Setting:** The story opens on a rainy Tuesday morning in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Specifically, it's set inside the cozy, somewhat cluttered office of Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Vance, located on the second floor of a historic, sea-captain's house. The room is painted a calming shade of seafoam green, and the walls are adorned with framed prints of wildflowers and the Maine coastline, interspersed with her diplomas and certifications. A worn, plush velvet couch sits facing two comfortable armchairs, creating a welcoming space for her clients. The air is thick with the scent of lavender from a diffuser Eleanor uses to create a sense of peace. Rain streaks across the large window overlooking the harbor, where lobster boats bob rhythmically despite the weather. The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of the rain against the glass underscores the quiet intimacy of the space.

**Opening:**

The grandfather clock in the corner chimed nine times, its mellow tones barely audible over the drumming rain. Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Vance, known to most simply as Eleanor, adjusted her frameless glasses and straightened the stack of patient files on her desk. She glanced at the window, a small frown etching itself onto her brow. The rain was relentless, a stark contrast to the sunshine that had graced Port Blossom only yesterday. She hoped Mrs. Hemlock, who was notoriously sensitive to weather changes, wouldn't cancel her appointment. Eleanor knew the elderly woman relied on their weekly sessions as a lifeline against the encroaching loneliness that seemed to shadow her every move since her husband passed.

A knock on the door, hesitant and soft, startled her. “Come in,” Eleanor called out, her voice warm and reassuring, the kind of voice that had soothed countless troubled souls over the years. The door creaked open, revealing a young woman, no older than twenty, clutching a bright yellow raincoat. Her face, pale and drawn, was framed by damp, dark hair. Eleanor’s practiced eye immediately registered the underlying anxiety radiating from her, a tangible tension that hummed in the small space.

"Dr. Vance?" the young woman asked, her voice barely a whisper. "I... I think I have the wrong office. I'm looking for..."

Eleanor smiled gently. "You're in the right place. Please, come in and have a seat. My name is Eleanor, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. But first," she gestured to the coat stand. "Let's get you out of that wet coat."
