## The Opening:

The scent of mildew and forgotten dreams clung to Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth like a second skin. The theatre, a crumbling Victorian relic named the Alhambra Grand, smelled distinctly of disappointment, a scent Bea knew intimately. It was a Tuesday, the day before opening night for her most ambitious, and arguably most foolish, project yet: a modern interpretation of Euripides' *The Bacchae* set in a dystopian nightclub.

She stood in the center of the stage, the single work light casting long, skeletal shadows across the faded velvet seats. Her boots echoed in the cavernous space. Bea ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, pushing stray strands of fiery red hair away from her face. The silence was deafening, broken only by the distant hum of a city that had forgotten the Alhambra existed. 

God, she was tired. The cast was exhausted, the crew was bordering on mutiny, and Bea Ainsworth, artistic director and self-proclaimed visionary, was teetering on the precipice of a complete mental breakdown. But beneath the fatigue and the gnawing fear, a spark of something tenacious still flickered. This play, this beautiful, chaotic mess, had to work. Tonight, during the final dress rehearsal, she would either witness the birth of something truly extraordinary, or she would finally admit defeat and become a librarian. The stakes, as always, felt impossibly high.
