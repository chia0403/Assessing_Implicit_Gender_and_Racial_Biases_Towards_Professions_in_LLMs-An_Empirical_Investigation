## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the pharmacy hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the end of another day. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, PharmD, sighed, adjusting the weight of her glasses on her nose. Outside, the November rain hammered against the plate glass window, blurring the neon glow of "Hawthorne's Apothecary" into a watery mess. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender hand sanitizer and a faint, underlying medicinal tang – a smell that had become as familiar to Amelia as her own breath.

She was tallying the day's receipts, the rhythmic clatter of the adding machine a comforting counterpoint to the tempest raging beyond the walls. But her focus was fractured. She kept catching herself staring at the small, handwritten note she'd found tucked beneath the cash register earlier that afternoon: *Meet me tonight. Back entrance. 9 PM. Urgent.*

Amelia didn’t recognize the handwriting. And while a healthy dose of paranoia came standard with owning a small-town pharmacy, the note had burrowed its way under her skin, planting a seed of unease that had steadily taken root throughout the day. Who would be waiting for her in the back alley on a night like this? And what could possibly be so urgent?

## Setting:

**Hawthorne's Apothecary** is a small, independent pharmacy located in the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. The town is quaint, bordering on picturesque, with a main street lined with antique shops, cozy cafes, and family-run businesses like Amelia's pharmacy, which has been in her family for three generations.

The pharmacy itself is a throwback to a simpler time. While it stocks all the modern medications and over-the-counter remedies, it retains a classic, almost old-fashioned charm. Dark wood shelves are lined with neatly arranged bottles, some still sporting the original handwritten labels. A vintage soda fountain sits unused in the corner, a relic of a bygone era. The air is always slightly cool, a welcome reprieve from the humid summer months and a stark contrast to the biting winter winds that often whip through Havenwood.

The back alley, where Amelia is to meet the mysterious note-writer, is narrow and dimly lit. Overflowing dumpsters and the greasy brick of the building walls create an oppressive atmosphere. The constant drip, drip, drip of rainwater echoing in the confined space amplifies the sense of isolation and potential danger.
