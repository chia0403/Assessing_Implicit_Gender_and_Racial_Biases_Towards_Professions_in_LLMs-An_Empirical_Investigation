The fluorescent lights of the Willow Creek Community Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's increasingly monotonous day. Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the harsh glare, making her meticulously organized office appear more cluttered than it actually was. Beatrice sighed, adjusting the oversized, sensible cardigan she always wore to ward off the arctic chill that perpetually emanated from the ancient HVAC system. Outside, the early October wind rattled the bare branches of a skeletal oak tree, mimicking the rattling unease in her stomach. Mrs. Higgins, bless her cotton socks, had just spent the last hour detailing the intricacies of her prize-winning zucchini bread recipe (a recipe drowning in butter and sugar, Beatrice knew, from her extensive experience with Mrs. Higgins' dietary history), and Beatrice could feel her resolve crumbling. She loved helping people, genuinely, but sometimes she wondered if the allure of a perfectly balanced macro count was lost on the inhabitants of Willow Creek, a town far more interested in fried dough and the annual pumpkin carving contest than in the latest research on gut health.
