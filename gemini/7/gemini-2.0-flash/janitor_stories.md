The flickering fluorescent lights of the Museum of Ancient Echoes cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished marble floor. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a man whose life was as muted and gray as the industrial mop bucket he pushed, sighed. It was 2:17 AM, and he was scheduled to be off duty seventeen minutes ago. But Professor Eldridge, bless his absent-minded heart, had once again left his coffee cup, a luridly stained ceramic monstrosity depicting a smiling pharaoh, teetering precariously on the edge of the Rosetta Stone exhibit.

The Museum of Ancient Echoes, Bart's purgatory and sanctuary, stood on the edge of the city limits. A hulking behemoth of neo-classical architecture, it housed a bewildering collection of artifacts dredged from the sands of time. From chipped Mesopotamian tablets to tarnished Roman coins, from mummified cats to, well, Professor Eldridge's coffee cup, the museum held the secrets of civilizations long past. And Bart, with his threadbare overalls and his perpetually damp mop, was its lonely guardian, its silent observer in the dead of night. He often felt, sweeping through the echoing halls, that he was the only living thing amongst a company of ghosts. Tonight, however, the ghosts feltâ€¦ closer.
