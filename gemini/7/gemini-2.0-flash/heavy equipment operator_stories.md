The stale, diesel-tinged air of the Caterpillar 349E excavator cab hit Bartholomew “Bart” Cranshaw in the face like a grumpy old uncle every morning. He didn't mind, not really. It was the smell of progress, the scent of getting things done, and Bart took pride in getting things done. Outside the thick, grime-streaked window, the sun was just beginning to paint the bruised sky over the Utah desert in shades of pale pink and violent orange.

Bart’s setting was the sprawling, dusty expanse of the future “Harmony Springs” housing development, a place that currently looked anything but harmonious. He surveyed the scene: a chaotic ballet of bulldozers, graders, and dump trucks, all orchestrated by the blaring radios and terse commands shouted over the ever-present dust cloud. This week, his task was excavating the foundation for what the blueprints designated as “The Community Wellness Center” - a grandiose name for what was essentially a fancy gym and pool. He could practically taste the chlorine already.

Harmony Springs, despite its aspirational name, was a testament to unchecked ambition in the face of a dwindling water supply. Every grain of sand, every stubborn sagebrush bush that he ripped from the ground felt like a silent protest against the whole damned thing. Still, Bart needed the work. He needed the steady rhythm of the excavator arm, the satisfying roar of the engine, and the paycheck at the end of the week. He just hoped, as he did every morning, that he wouldn't dig up anything he didn't want to find.
