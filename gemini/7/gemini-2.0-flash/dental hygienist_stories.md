The oppressive humidity clung to the humid summer air like a damp sheet as Maya Annelise Rodriguez wrestled the unruly bougainvillea branches away from the wrought-iron gate. The scent of saltwater and decaying mangoes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of the coastal Florida town sheâ€™d both adored and resented her entire life. Her floral-print scrubs stuck uncomfortably to her back, already damp with perspiration.

Maya worked as a dental hygienist at Dr. Harold Perkins' "Perkins Perfect Pearls," a small, but surprisingly modern, dental office nestled in the heart of Coral Gables, Miami. The building, a converted Mediterranean-style bungalow painted a cheerful coral, was a far cry from the sleek glass towers dominating downtown Miami. Inside, the air conditioning blasted a welcome arctic chill against the Florida heat. The walls were decorated with oversized photographs of pristine, smiling teeth (Dr. Perkins' own handiwork, of course), and the gentle murmur of Muzak barely concealed the high-pitched whine of the dental drills. Today, the air crackled with a different kind of energy, an undercurrent of anticipation and mild dread.
