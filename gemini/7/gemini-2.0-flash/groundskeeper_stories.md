The biting wind whipped around Samuel Abernathy's ankles, biting through the threadbare wool of his trousers despite the layers beneath. He hunched deeper into his patched, green overcoat, the collar pulled high to shield his weathered face. The air, thick with the promise of snow, held the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance Samuel usually found comforting, but today, it only amplified the biting chill.

He stood on the crest of a small, snow-dusted knoll, overlooking the sprawling, meticulously manicured grounds of Blackwood Manor. The Manor itself, a monstrous edifice of gray stone and gothic spires, loomed against the bruised, twilight sky, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring down at him. Blackwood Manor wasn't just a house; it was a monument to generations of wealth and eccentricity, a place where secrets clung to the ivy-covered walls like stubborn vines. Samuel had been its groundskeeper for twenty-three years, and in those years, he'd learned that the Manor held far more than just neatly trimmed hedges and perfectly placed rose bushes. It held a darkness, a lingering unease that prickled the skin and whispered on the wind. And tonight, that darkness felt particularly palpable.
