The scent of lilies, a funeral dirge played out in floral notes, clung to Amelia Rose Thorne like a shroud. Not that she minded, exactly. Lilies paid the bills, and in a town like Havenwood, bills were perpetually hovering, vulture-like, just above your head. Amelia, however, preferred to see them as symbols of resurrection, of new beginnings blooming from decay. It was a perspective that helped her get through the less cheerful aspects of her profession.

Havenwood itself was a study in contrasts. Perched precariously on the edge of the Misty Mountains, it boasted stunning views of jagged peaks and whispering forests, but the charm was paper-thin. Beneath the picturesque veneer of antique shops and bed-and-breakfasts lay a town steeped in secrets, a place where whispers carried more weight than pronouncements, and where the ghosts of forgotten industries haunted the cobbled streets. The old copper mine, a gaping wound in the hillside, was a constant reminder of Havenwood's boom-and-bust past, a silent monument to broken promises and shattered dreams. Even the perpetually drizzling weather seemed to conspire to keep the town shrouded in a perpetual state of melancholic ambiguity. And Amelia, born and bred within its damp embrace, felt that melancholy down to her bones.
