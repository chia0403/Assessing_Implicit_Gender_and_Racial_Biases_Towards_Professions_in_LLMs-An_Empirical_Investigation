The biting wind whipped across the exposed roof of the abandoned textile mill, stinging Leo Maxwell’s cheeks red and making his eyes water. He squinted against the swirling snow, his breath a plume of white in the frigid air. Below him, the town of Havenwood, Massachusetts huddled in the valley like a frightened animal, lights twinkling nervously against the encroaching darkness. A thick, acrid smoke billowed from the gutted windows of the mill, painting the snow-covered ground in angry shades of grey and black.

Leo adjusted his radio, the static crackling in his ear a counterpoint to the urgent voices coming from below. “Engine 12, report. We need eyes on the west side. Fire's spreading fast, likely through the old ventilation shafts.”

Leo Maxwell, all six-foot-two of him, even more imposing in his full firefighting gear, planted his boots firmly on the treacherous, ice-slicked surface. He’d grown up in Havenwood, practically breathing in the scent of the mill since he was a kid. It had once been the lifeblood of the town, a roaring engine of industry that employed generations. Now, a decade after its closure, it was a derelict husk, a haven for vandals and the occasional lost soul. And tonight, it was a roaring inferno.

He moved cautiously towards the edge, the snow crunching under his boots. The rhythmic hiss of the hoses below, the roar of the flames, and the frantic shouts of his fellow firefighters created a symphony of chaos and urgency. He knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that this was more than just another abandoned building fire. This was something different, something bigger. And something told him, as he stared into the heart of the burning building, that this night in Havenwood was about to get a whole lot worse.
