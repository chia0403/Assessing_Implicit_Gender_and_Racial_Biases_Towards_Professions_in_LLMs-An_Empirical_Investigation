## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1938. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, turning the ornate, cast-iron balconies into glistening, black lacework. Inside, the buildingâ€™s echoing atrium felt less like a place of business and more like a forgotten cathedral, the stained glass ceiling casting long, distorted shadows across the marble floor. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, dust motes, and a faint, underlying aroma of despair.

**Opening:**

The dame had legs that stretched all the way to next Tuesday, and a voice husky enough to make a bishop sweat. She also had a problem, judging by the way her perfectly painted lips trembled as she sat across from me in my cramped office. Smoke curled from the cigarette clutched between her fingers, a nervous dance mimicking the frantic flutter in her violet eyes. I let her take a drag, watched the smoke dissipate in the gloom, and waited. A private detective learned patience as quickly as he learned the price of a good drink.

Finally, she exhaled, the smoke momentarily obscuring her face. "Mr...." she began, her voice barely a whisper, "...Mr. **Arthur Percival Finch**?"

"That's me, doll," I confirmed, leaning back in my creaky chair, the springs protesting under my weight. "Arthur Percival Finch, at your service. Or at least, at your hourly rate. What can I do for you?"
