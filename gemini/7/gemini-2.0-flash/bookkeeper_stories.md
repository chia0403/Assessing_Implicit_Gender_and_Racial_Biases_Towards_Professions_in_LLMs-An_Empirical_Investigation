The fluorescent lights of the third-floor accounting office hummed a dull, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the life of Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne. The room itself was a study in beige: beige walls, beige carpet, beige filing cabinets that stretched like silent sentinels along one side. Only Beatrice’s desk offered a splash of color, a testament to her quiet rebellion. A vibrant, embroidered coaster depicting a grumpy cat holding a ledger sat proudly beneath her lukewarm mug of herbal tea, and a small, potted succulent, lovingly named Bartholomew, perched on the corner, reaching for the weak rays of sunlight that dared to penetrate the grimy windows.

Beatrice herself was a creature of habit and precision. Her graying hair, pulled back into a neat bun, never dared a stray strand. Her sensible shoes, purchased from the orthopedist’s recommended list, were always polished to a discreet gleam. And her fingers, though calloused from years of number-crunching, danced nimbly across the keyboard of her ancient computer, a machine affectionately nicknamed “The Beast” for its tendency to crash at the most inopportune moments.

Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, bookkeeper extraordinaire for the notoriously disorganized "Thompson & Sons Plumbing," was perfectly content, or so she told herself, in the quiet predictability of her days. Until the day the box arrived.
