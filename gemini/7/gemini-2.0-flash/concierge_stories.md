## Story Opening:

The rhythmic tap, tap, TAP of rain against the oversized glass doors of The Grand Meridian Hotel was the only sound Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth hadn't yet catalogued in her meticulous mental library. She knew the precise squeak of the bellhop's trolley wheels, the almost-silent glide of Mrs. Vandergelt’s orthopedic shoes, the throaty purr of Mr. Henderson’s vintage Jaguar idling outside. But this rain, this incessant drumming, felt different. Ominous, perhaps.

Eleanor sighed, a soft sound that barely ruffled the crisp linen of her impeccably tailored navy suit. She readjusted the small, silver pin proclaiming her "Concierge," a title she wore with quiet pride, and glanced at the clock. 7:58 PM. Two minutes until her shift ended, two more minutes of standing sentinel in this gilded cage. She hoped her replacement, young Thomas, would remember to water the orchids. They were temperamental things, much like some of the hotel's more… discerning… guests.

Suddenly, the rain intensified, and a figure stumbled through the revolving doors, shaking off water like a bewildered Labrador. The man, drenched and clutching a briefcase so tightly his knuckles were white, looked utterly out of place amongst the polished marble and sparkling chandeliers. He was disheveled, his expensive suit rumpled and clinging to his thin frame, and his eyes held a frantic, hunted look that made Eleanor’s professional smile falter ever so slightly.

"I need a room," he rasped, his voice hoarse. "Immediately. Discreetly."

## Setting:

The Grand Meridian Hotel, a landmark of old-world luxury in the heart of Manhattan. Built in the roaring twenties, it exuded an aura of timeless elegance, a haven of discretion for the city's elite. Think high ceilings adorned with ornate plasterwork, gleaming chandeliers casting pools of warm light, and hushed hallways lined with antique furniture and priceless art. The lobby, in particular, was a symphony of marble and polished brass, buzzing with a constant, yet muted, hum of activity: hurried executives, well-dressed couples on romantic getaways, and the discreet security personnel who blended seamlessly into the background. The air was perpetually scented with a subtle blend of lilies and expensive cologne.
