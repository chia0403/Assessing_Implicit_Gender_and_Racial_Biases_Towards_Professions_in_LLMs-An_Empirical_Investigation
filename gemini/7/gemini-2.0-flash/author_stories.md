**Opening:**

The biting wind, flavored with salt and the promise of snow, clawed at the ill-fitting scarf wrapped around Eleanor Abigail Finch's neck. She huddled deeper into the worn tweed coat, the collar scratching against her skin, and cursed the decision to leave her gloves at the inn. Inspiration, it seemed, rarely arrived bundled with common sense.

**Setting:**

Eleanor stood on a windswept clifftop overlooking the tumultuous North Sea. Below, jagged rocks, perpetually kissed by frothing waves, guarded the coastline. The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, was punctuated by the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead.

Behind her, nestled amongst the gorse-covered hills, was the tiny, isolated village of Seabrook. Its houses, built from weathered stone and huddled together for warmth, looked like slumbering creatures against the backdrop of the grey, unforgiving sky. A wisp of smoke curled from the chimney of the only inn, "The Drunken Sailor," its sign creaking ominously in the gale. Seabrook was a place untouched by time, a place where secrets whispered on the wind and the past clung to the cobblestone streets like a stubborn stain. It was a place, Eleanor hoped, that held the answer to her writer's block.
