The acrid smell of burnt rubber and oil hung thick in the air of "Grease Monkeys Garage," clinging to everything like a persistent shadow. It was a scent Beatrice "Bea" Anya Petrova knew intimately, a comfort more familiar than perfume or freshly baked bread. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on Harmony, Nebraska, turning the endless cornfields into shimmering, hazy mirages. Inside, however, the concrete floor of the garage offered a grudging coolness, a refuge from the suffocating heat.

Bea, clad in her perpetually stained coveralls, wrestled with a stubborn lug nut on a beat-up '72 Ford F-100. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, a stray strand of auburn hair escaping from beneath her faded blue bandana. The wrench groaned under her weight, finally yielding with a satisfying *pop*. Bea straightened, wiping a bead of sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of grease in its wake. This truck, like most of the vehicles that rolled through her garage doors, told a story. A story Bea was determined to understand and, more importantly, to fix.
