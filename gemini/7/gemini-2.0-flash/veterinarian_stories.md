## Story Opening:

The scream ripped through the pre-dawn stillness, a raw, guttural sound that sent a shiver crawling up Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's spine. It wasn't the first time she'd heard something unsettling coming from the woods surrounding her clinic, but this was different. This was agony. Ellie threw back the patchwork quilt, the cool air of the early spring morning nipping at her exposed skin. Her mind raced – coyote caught in a trap? Deer struck by a reckless driver? Whatever it was, it needed help, and fast.

She grabbed her battered pair of Wellington boots, pulling them on over her pajama pants, and grabbed her emergency kit, its familiar weight comforting in the growing dread that settled in her stomach. The scream came again, shorter this time, choked with a kind of desperate, animalistic fear. Ellie didn’t hesitate. She grabbed her headlamp from the hook by the door, flicked it on, and plunged into the encroaching darkness, the beam cutting a swathe through the tangled undergrowth.

## Setting:

Ellie Vance's veterinary clinic, "The Crooked Oak Animal Hospital," sat nestled on the edge of the small, rural town of Havenwood, Maine. The clinic itself was a converted farmhouse, painted a cheerful, albeit slightly faded, shade of robin's egg blue. A rambling porch, adorned with overflowing flower boxes in the summer months, wrapped around the front, and a large, gnarled oak tree, its branches twisted and reaching like arthritic fingers, gave the clinic its name.

The property backed onto a dense, sprawling forest, a tapestry of pines, maples, and birches that stretched for miles. The sounds of the forest were a constant presence – the rustling of leaves, the chirping of crickets, the occasional hoot of an owl. But tonight, the sounds were laced with something sinister, something that made the hairs on Ellie's arms stand on end. The scent of damp earth and pine needles hung heavy in the air, mixed with a faint, metallic tang that Ellie couldn’t quite place. Beyond the familiar comfort of her clinic lights, the forest was a maze of shadows and secrets, a place where the wild things roamed and the line between nature and something else blurred.
