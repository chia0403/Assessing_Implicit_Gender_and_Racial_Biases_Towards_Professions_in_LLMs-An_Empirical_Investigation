The stale air hung thick with the ghosts of fried cabbage and forgotten dreams. Sunlight, weak and watery, strained through the grimy lace curtains of 22 Juniper Street, barely illuminating the faded wallpaper, a dizzying pattern of maroon roses clinging desperately to the crumbling plaster. This, thought Delilah Mae Perkins, clutching her oversized tote bag, was not going to be a simple sale.

Delilah Mae Perkins, of Perkins & Pettigrew Realty, had seen her fair share of fixer-uppers in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. But 22 Juniper, inherited by a distant relative of Mrs. Higgins, her most reliable client, possessed an aura that went beyond mere neglect. It was a palpable sense of… wrongness. The air hummed with an unseen energy, and even the normally cheerful birdsong outside seemed muted, hesitant to penetrate the property’s invisible shield.

Harmony Creek itself was a postcard-perfect vision of small-town America. Nestled in a valley cradled by rolling hills dotted with dairy farms, it boasted a charming Main Street with a quaint diner, a bustling antique shop, and the obligatory white-steepled church. Yet, beneath the saccharine surface, Delilah knew Harmony Creek held secrets, whispered in hushed tones by the town's long-time residents. Secrets that, she suspected, were intimately tied to the history of 22 Juniper Street.
