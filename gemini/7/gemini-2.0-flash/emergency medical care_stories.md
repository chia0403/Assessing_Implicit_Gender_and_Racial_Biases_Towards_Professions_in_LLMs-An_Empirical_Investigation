## Story Opening:

The siren wailed, a mournful cry slicing through the pre-dawn quiet of Willow Creek. Amelia Grace Hernandez shivered, not entirely from the early morning chill seeping through the open ambulance doors. It was the sound itself, the desperate urgency woven into its tone, that always sent a prickle of anxiety down her spine. This was it, the moment she transitioned from sleepy EMT to life-saving responder.

She tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear, the motion practiced and automatic. Beside her, partner Mark "Mac" McAlister chewed gum with a rhythmic snap, seemingly unfazed. Amelia envied his calm, his unwavering focus in the face of the unknown. She needed to cultivate that.

Dispatch crackled over the radio, confirming the address: 4 Elm Street, possible overdose. Her stomach tightened. Elm Street. That was Mrs. Peabody's house. The sweet old woman who always had a plate of cookies waiting for them after a medical call, even if it was just a twisted ankle.

"Let's go, Mac," Amelia said, her voice firm despite the tremor in her gut. "We're gonna get there and we're gonna help."

## Setting:

**Willow Creek, Oregon** is a small town nestled in a valley surrounded by the Cascade Mountains. It's a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone, and gossip travels faster than the volunteer fire department. The town center boasts a single grocery store, a diner with vinyl booths and bottomless coffee, and a hardware store that's been owned by the same family for three generations. The surrounding area is a mix of rolling hills dotted with farms, dense forests, and the occasional rushing river. The pace of life is generally slow and peaceful, but even in Willow Creek, emergencies happen. Amelia and Mac are stationed at the small, underfunded but fiercely dedicated **Willow Creek Volunteer Ambulance Service**, which operates out of a converted garage on the outskirts of town.
