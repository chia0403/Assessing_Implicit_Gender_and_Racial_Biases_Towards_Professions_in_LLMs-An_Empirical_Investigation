The biting wind, scented with the promise of coming snow, whipped across Jedediah Elijah Croft's weathered face. He tasted grit and felt the sharp sting in his eyes, but he barely noticed. He was used to it. Jedediah, a man carved from the same stubborn granite as the land he tilled, squinted at the horizon, a perpetual frown etched between his brow.

The setting was Croft's Crossing, a sprawling, unforgiving landscape in the heart of Wyoming. The Croft farm, a collection of faded red barns and a two-story farmhouse clinging to the side of a gently sloping hill, dominated the valley. The fields, usually a patchwork quilt of green and gold in the summer, were now barren and brown, dotted with the skeletal remains of harvested corn stalks. The sky was a vast, bruised purple, promising a harsh winter that Jedediah knew all too well. He stood at the edge of his west field, the chill seeping into his bones even through his thick wool coat, his boots crunching on the frozen earth. He was surveying his land, calculating the yield of the season, and bracing himself for the lean months ahead. He knew this land like he knew the lines on his own hands - every rise and fall, every patch of stubborn clay, every hidden spring. And right now, his land was whispering a warning, a chilling premonition he couldn't ignore.
