## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The metallic tang of impending rain clung to the air, mirroring the taste in Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s mouth. She straightened the silk scarf draped over her navy blazer, a futile gesture against the relentless humidity clinging to downtown Savannah. Another bead of sweat trickled down her spine, a fitting accompaniment to the nervous flutter in her stomach. The quarterly sales reports were in, and Amy knew, with the certainty of a veteran card player staring at a losing hand, that her numbers weren't good. Not good at all.

**Setting:**

Amy stood on the cobblestone sidewalk outside "Colonial Charm," a quaint antique shop nestled amongst the historic buildings of Savannah, Georgia. The shop’s window display, a carefully curated collection of porcelain dolls and tarnished silver tea sets, seemed to mock her with their silent, unchanging elegance. "Colonial Charm" wasn't just any antique shop; it was the linchpin account for “Southern Legacy Heirlooms,” the wholesale antique distributor where Amy worked. If she lost this account…well, she didn’t even want to think about the consequences. The air was thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the distant cries of gulls, a beautiful, deceptive backdrop to the brewing storm within both the sky and Amy Blackwood.
