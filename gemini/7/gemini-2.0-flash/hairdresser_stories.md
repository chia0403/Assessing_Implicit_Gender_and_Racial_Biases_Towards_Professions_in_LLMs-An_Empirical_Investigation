The scent of burnt sugar and perm solution hung thick in the air of "Scissors & Sass," a small salon nestled between a dusty antique shop and a bustling Italian deli on Elm Street. Outside, the perpetually sunny town of Havenwood, California, shimmered with a late-morning heat, baking the already dry landscape a toasty brown. Inside, the only solace from the heat came from the overworked air conditioning unit that rattled like a disgruntled old man.

Seraphina Rosalie Bellweather, or Sera to her clients and practically everyone else, surveyed the scene with a weary sigh. Three stations were occupied: Mrs. Henderson, getting her weekly blue rinse, Brenda from the bakery, anxiously waiting for her roots to be touched up before her nephew's graduation, and, thank god, quiet Mr. Abernathy, whose bi-monthly trim was as predictable and calming as the tide.

Sera smoothed down the wrinkles in her vintage floral apron, the fabric faded from countless washes but still vibrant enough to hint at the life and energy that pulsed beneath her tired exterior. She ran a hand through her own perpetually messy, auburn curls, a reflection, she often joked, of her equally chaotic life. Today, though, the chaos felt more pronounced, a dull throb behind her temples promising a headache that wouldn't quit.

She glanced at the appointment book resting on the counter, a silent litany of cuts, colors, and conversations yet to come. It was Friday, the busiest day of the week, and Sera knew she needed to paste on her professional smile and gear up for another eight hours of listening to town gossip, solving everyone else's problems, and, hopefully, making them feel just a little bit better about themselves. But today, the weight of it all felt heavier than usual, the weight of Havenwood, the weight of her family, and the unspoken weight of a secret she'd been carrying for far too long.
