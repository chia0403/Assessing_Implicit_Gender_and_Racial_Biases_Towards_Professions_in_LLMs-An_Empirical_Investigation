The sterile, metallic tang of blood hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the synthetic lavender scent pumped relentlessly through the Neo-Tokyo Metropolitan Trauma Center. Dr. Aris Thorne, his brow slick with a mixture of sweat and recycled air, barely registered either. His gloved hands moved with a practiced urgency, clamping a bleeder on the mangled arm of the hoverbike courier before him. The flickering neon glow of the cityscape, usually a vibrant backdrop to the constant stream of emergencies that flooded the trauma bay, was blurred into a meaningless kaleidoscope behind him.

Neo-Tokyo, 2077, was a city perpetually teetering on the edge of collapse. Sky-high megastructures, shimmering with holographic advertisements, scraped against a perpetually overcast sky, concealing the grinding poverty and rampant cybernetic augmentation that fueled its underbelly. The city lived and breathed on adrenaline and synthetic innovation, and Aris, more often than not, was its last line of defense against implosion. Tonight, it seemed, was one of those nights. The hoverbike accident was just the latest in a litany of incidents: a rogue AI attacking a robotics factory, a gang war escalating into full-blown cybernetic combat, and a mysterious new virus, dubbed 'Ghostrot,' that was turning its victims into mindless, hyper-aggressive husks. Aris Thorne had seen it all, patched it all up, and lived to fight another day, but tonight, a disquieting feeling gnawed at him â€“ a premonition that this chaos was more than just the usual Friday night madness. Something bigger was coming.
