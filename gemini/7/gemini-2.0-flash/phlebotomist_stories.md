Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a phlebotomist named Eleanor Maeve Riley:

**Setting:** The story begins on a particularly gloomy Tuesday morning at the "Good Shepherd Community Clinic" in the heart of a working-class neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The clinic, a converted brick row house, smells faintly of disinfectant, stale coffee, and simmering anxiety. Posters about flu shots and affordable healthcare line the walls, their cheerful imagery battling against the pervasive feeling of exhaustion that hangs in the air. The waiting room is cramped, filled with a diverse assortment of patients – elderly women with walkers, young mothers juggling toddlers, construction workers nursing injuries, and teenagers glued to their phones.

**Opening:**

The metallic tang of blood always lingered in Eleanor Maeve Riley's nostrils, no matter how many times she scrubbed her hands raw with surgical soap. Today, it was especially potent, mingling with the cloying sweetness of the air freshener Mrs. Petrovic insisted on keeping plugged in near the lab sink. Eleanor sighed, pulling a fresh pair of purple nitrile gloves over her calloused hands. Tuesdays were always the worst. The backlog of weekend ailments, the Monday blues, the general dread of facing another week - it all seemed to culminate in a tidal wave of appointments flooding the Good Shepherd Community Clinic.

She glanced at the schedule pinned to the corkboard above her station. Ten more patients before lunch. Mrs. Henderson with her routine cholesterol check, little Mikey Johnson who was terrified of needles and required extra coaxing, and then… a new name. A young man named Darius with a note flagged in red: "Previous history of fainting spells". Eleanor rolled her eyes. Just what she needed.

Taking a deep breath, she straightened her scrub top, smoothed back a stray strand of her auburn hair, and pasted on her most reassuring smile. Time to face the bloodletting.
