Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a lawyer named...

**Setting:** A grimy, pre-dawn diner in Jersey City, New Jersey. The kind where the coffee is always lukewarm, the vinyl booths are perpetually sticky, and the air hangs heavy with the ghosts of stale grease and broken dreams. Neon beer signs flicker intermittently in the front windows, casting a sickly glow on the rain-slicked street outside.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled weakly as Clarissa Eleanor Van Derlyn strode in, her heels clicking on the worn linoleum tile. The aroma of burnt coffee and frying bacon was a welcome change from the sterile, antiseptic tang of the courthouse. She pulled off her wet trench coat, shaking off the November drizzle, and hung it on a chipped hook near the entrance. Her perfectly tailored skirt suit, usually a weapon of intimidation in the courtroom, looked slightly rumpled and defeated this early in the morning.

Clarissa slid into a booth, the vinyl protesting with a groan. She ignored the faded floral pattern imprinted on her thigh and signaled to the waitress, a woman whose name was surely something like Dolores, but who probably preferred to be called "Dol". "Just coffee, Dol," she said, her voice a low, throaty rasp from too much talking and too little sleep. "Black, no sugar. And maybe a side of bad news, if you've got any."

Dol, unimpressed by Clarissa's expensive attire and weary smile, shuffled over and slammed a chipped mug down on the table. "Bad news is free, sweetheart. Just look outside." She gestured vaguely towards the rain-streaked window. "But coffee's still three bucks."

Clarissa sighed, pulling out a crisp twenty-dollar bill from her wallet. Three bucks for a cup of swill felt extortionate, but in this moment, she was too exhausted to argue. The case was circling the drain. Her client was looking at serious jail time. And Clarissa Eleanor Van Derlyn, who had built her reputation on a string of near-impossible victories, was starting to feel the bitter taste of defeat clinging to her tongue. This was a bad case. And the rain was only just beginning to fall.
