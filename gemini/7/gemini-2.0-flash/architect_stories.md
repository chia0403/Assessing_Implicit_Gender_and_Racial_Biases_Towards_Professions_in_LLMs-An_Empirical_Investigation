## Opening:

The air in the old warehouse hung thick and heavy with the scent of dust, dried paint, and something vaguely… metallic.  A single shaft of morning sun, fractured by the grimy windows high above, sliced through the gloom, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness.  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau coughed, the sound echoing eerily in the cavernous space.  She pushed a stray strand of raven hair behind her ear, the movement smearing a fresh smudge of charcoal across her cheek.  This was it. This was the challenge that could either make her career or break it.  The skeleton of the future, the promise of something extraordinary, lay sprawled before her, waiting to be brought to life.  But as she looked at the decaying brick walls and the rusting steel girders, a prickle of unease danced down her spine. This wasn’t just about architecture; it felt like something more, something… hidden.

## Setting:

The story is set in the industrial district of **Detroit, Michigan**, specifically inside a derelict, turn-of-the-century warehouse known as the **“Blackwell Foundry.”**  The Foundry, once a bustling hub of metalworking, has been abandoned for nearly fifty years, a testament to the city’s economic decline. The building itself is a sprawling maze of interconnected rooms, with soaring ceilings and massive, arched windows that are mostly boarded up.  The interior is a mix of decaying grandeur and urban decay: peeling paint reveals layers of faded murals depicting the Foundry's heyday, while graffiti artists have left their mark on nearly every surface. Piles of rubble and discarded machinery litter the floor, creating treacherous obstacles. The outside of the Foundry is equally bleak, surrounded by vacant lots, cracked pavement, and the rusting hulks of forgotten factories.  The year is **2023**, a time of revitalization efforts in Detroit, making the Blackwell Foundry project a symbol of hope and a battleground for preserving history versus embracing radical change.
