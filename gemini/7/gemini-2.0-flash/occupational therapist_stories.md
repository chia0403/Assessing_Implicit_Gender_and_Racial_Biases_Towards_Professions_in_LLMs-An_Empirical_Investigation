## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A bustling, slightly overcrowded outpatient rehabilitation clinic called "New Beginnings Rehab Center" located in a vibrant, gentrifying neighborhood in Philadelphia. The clinic's walls are painted a cheerful, though slightly chipped, robin's egg blue, and the air hums with the rhythmic beeps of various machines, the chatter of patients, and the occasional booming laugh of the physical therapist from across the hallway, Bruce.

**Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and disinfectant hung thick in the air as Dr. Eleanor Vivian Sterling navigated the maze of parallel bars and resistance bands. Her navy blue scrubs felt a size too small today, clinging uncomfortably in the late-summer humidity. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Eleanor wasn't usually one for self-pity, but this morning felt particularly challenging. Mrs. Henderson, her 9:00 AM appointment, had canceled last minute with a vague excuse about "spiritual alignment," leaving Eleanor with an unexpected, and unwanted, pocket of time. Time she desperately needed to dedicate to charting, not staring blankly at the dusty motivational posters plastered on the walls. The irony, she thought, wasn't lost on her. A poster boasting "BELIEVE IN YOUR POTENTIAL!" seemed particularly cruel as Eleanor wrestled with her own dwindling enthusiasm for her career.
