Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist named Evelyn Maeve Sinclair:

**Opening & Setting:**

The scent of acetone and rose-scented cuticle oil hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume that clung to everything in Evelyn Maeve Sinclair's salon, "Polished Perfections."  Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on the pastel-colored buildings of Coral Gables, baking the bougainvillea bushes into a fragrant frenzy. Inside, Evelyn hummed along to a vintage Ella Fitzgerald tune, her quick, practiced hands smoothing a final coat of shimmering rose-gold lacquer onto Mrs. Abigail Featherstonehaugh's immaculately sculpted acrylics.

Mrs. Featherstonehaugh, a woman whose wrinkles seemed to be held at bay by sheer willpower and a liberal application of botox, adjusted her diamond-encrusted reading glasses and peered at her nails. "Hmm," she finally pronounced, her voice like a rusty hinge. "A shade lighter than the last time, dear."

Evelyn plastered on a smile that didn't quite reach her emerald-green eyes. "Yes, Mrs. Featherstonehaugh. This is 'Rose Whisper,' a new shade. I thought it might complement yourâ€¦complexion."

The truth was, Evelyn was running on fumes. She'd been at the salon since dawn, prepping for a bridal party that was threatening to descend like a swarm of locusts any minute. The pressure of painting perfection onto the pampered appendages of Coral Gables' elite was starting to crack her own carefully constructed shell. She needed a vacation. Or a winning lottery ticket. Or maybe just a very, very large glass of iced tea.
