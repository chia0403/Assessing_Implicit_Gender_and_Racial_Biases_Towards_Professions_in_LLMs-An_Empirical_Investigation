The incessant ringing of the phone sliced through the comfortable silence of Tuesday evening. Arthur Penhaligon sighed, setting down his lukewarm cup of Earl Grey. He knew that ringtone; it wasn't a friend, not anymore. It was the dreaded "Potential Claim" ringtone, reserved for his work phone, permanently tethered to his hip even on his so-called "days off."

Arthur Penhaligon, Senior Insurance Agent at the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Coverage Company, wasn't exactly living the dream. The dream, as it had appeared in his youthful idealism, had involved restoring antique furniture and selling it out of a charming little shop. Instead, he was spending his days wading through the murky waters of flood insurance policies and disputing claims with surprisingly litigious retirees.

His apartment, nestled above a dusty antique store on the quieter side of Cape May, New Jersey, reflected that abandoned dream. The air, normally thick with the salty tang of the Atlantic, carried a faint, persistent odor of varnish and lemon oil. Arthur had rescued a few pieces from demolition sites, their bones promising untold beauty, but they remained perpetually "in progress," draped with drop cloths in the corner, monuments to a future he seemed increasingly unlikely to reach. The walls were painted a soothing, antique white, but the chipped paint and the faded floral wallpaper, remnants from the previous tenant, whispered of neglect. Sunlight streamed weakly through the sheer curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a fitting metaphor for the state of his life.

He glanced at the framed picture on his desk: a younger, brighter Arthur, surrounded by tools and half-restored chairs. He picked up the phone. "Arthur Penhaligon, Mid-Atlantic Coastal Coverage, how can I help you?" he asked, his voice carefully neutral, bracing himself for the storm that was sure to follow.
