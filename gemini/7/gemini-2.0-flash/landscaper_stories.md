## Story Opening:

The smell of freshly cut St. Augustine and the distant sizzle of bacon from Mrs. Henderson's kitchen were the twin harbingers of another Florida morning. For Silas James Blackwood, it was a symphony of predictable comfort, a prelude to the day's back-breaking labor and quiet satisfaction. He took a long sip of his lukewarm coffee, the steam doing little to ward off the damp, pre-dawn chill clinging to the air like Spanish moss. Today was a big one: the complete overhaul of the Thompson estate, a sprawling oceanfront property notorious for its overgrown hibiscus and neglected bougainvillea. He was a landscaper, not a miracle worker, but damn it, he'd turn that jungle into a tropical paradise if it killed him.

## Setting:

**Coastal Haven, Florida:** This small, affluent town on the Gulf Coast boasts sugar-white sand beaches, turquoise waters, and a year-round growing season that both blessed and cursed Silas. The landscape was a painter's palette of vibrant colors: the deep greens of palmetto palms and sea grapes, the shocking pink of bougainvillea, the fiery orange of Royal Poinciana trees, and the muted blues and grays of the sea and sky. However, the salt air, relentless sun, and occasional hurricane made maintaining this beauty a constant battle. The town itself was a mix of old-Florida charm and modern luxury, with weathered beach cottages nestled beside sprawling, multi-million dollar villas. The residents were a blend of old money, seasonal snowbirds, and a scattering of hard-working locals like Silas, all vying for space and sunshine in this little slice of paradise.
