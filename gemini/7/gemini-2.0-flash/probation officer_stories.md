The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Detective Patricia “Patty” Kowalski’s cheeks as she hurried across the parking lot towards the dreary brick building that housed the Cook County Adult Probation Department. The sky was a bruised purple, mirroring the mood that had settled over her since reading the incident report on Tyrone Johnson. Another relapse, another violation. It was the same old song, just a different verse.

Patty shoved her gloved hands deeper into the pockets of her worn, navy blue peacoat, the fabric rough against her skin. Chicago in November was a cruel mistress; beautiful and unforgiving in equal measure. Just like the lives she dealt with every day. The exhaust fumes from the idling buses blurred in the pre-dawn gloom, mingling with the sharp scent of lake water and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt coffee – a smell that permeated the probation department’s breakroom.

The interior of the building wasn't much warmer, both physically and emotionally. Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous drone, casting a harsh, unforgiving glow on the linoleum floors worn thin from years of foot traffic – the endless shuffle of probationers coming and going, their hopes and fears etched onto their faces. Desks overflowed with case files, each one a story of broken promises and missed opportunities. The air hung thick with the scent of stale paperwork and suppressed anxiety, a potent cocktail that Patty had grown far too familiar with over the past fifteen years. This morning, however, the weight of it felt particularly heavy. Today, she had to decide what to do about Tyrone. And Patty Kowalski hated having to make decisions that could ruin someone's life.
