The scent of stale crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both comforted and slightly nauseated Ms. Eleanor Rose Fairchild. It was 7:00 AM, an hour before the first bell would shatter the pre-dawn quiet of Room 3B at Willow Creek Elementary. Sunlight, thin and watery, filtered through the blinds, painting stripes across the alphabet rug that sprawled across the room.

Eleanor, armed with a lukewarm cup of coffee and the remnants of last night's pizza, surveyed her domain. Stuffed animals perched precariously on shelves overflowing with construction paper and glitter glue. Motivational posters, slightly crooked, declared the importance of kindness, perseverance, and the proper use of commas. A half-finished diorama of the Amazon rainforest, complete with miniature plastic monkeys clinging to papier-mâché trees, sat abandoned on a back table.

Willow Creek Elementary was a classic suburban school, nestled in a quiet neighborhood of cookie-cutter houses and meticulously manicured lawns. It was the kind of place where PTA meetings were fiercely competitive, and bake sales generated enough sugar to fuel a small nation. Eleanor loved it, despite the occasional parent who demanded their child be moved to a more “advanced” reading group and the persistent mold in the faculty lounge’s coffee maker. This was her place, these were her kids, and today, she had a feeling, was going to be... interesting. She just couldn't shake the premonition prickling at the back of her neck.
