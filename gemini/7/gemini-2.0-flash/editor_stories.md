Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a main character who's an editor:

**Setting:**

The setting is a sprawling, labyrinthine used bookstore called "The Book Burrow," located in the historic, slightly bohemian neighborhood of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The bookstore is crammed floor-to-ceiling with overflowing shelves, stacks of books teetering precariously, and comfortable, slightly worn armchairs tucked into hidden corners. The air smells of aged paper, leather, and a faint hint of brewing coffee that drifts from the small café nestled at the back. Sunlight streams in through the large, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. It's a haven for book lovers, a place where time seems to slow down, and the outside world fades away.

**Opening:**

The fluorescent light above her desk in The Book Burrow's tiny office flickered erratically, casting long shadows across Eleanor "Ellie" Marguerite Ainsworth’s furrowed brow. Another manuscript. Another week. Another chance to discover a diamond in the rough, or more likely, another politely-worded rejection letter to craft. She sighed, adjusting the heavy-framed glasses that perpetually threatened to slide down her nose. The manuscript in question was titled "The Crimson Corsair," and the cover featured a lurid illustration of a swashbuckler battling a giant squid. It promised thrilling adventure on the high seas, and Ellie, a seasoned editor with a penchant for well-crafted prose and realistic character development, feared the reality would fall far short of the promise. She took a swig of lukewarm coffee from her chipped mug, the caffeine doing little to combat the familiar weight of editorial fatigue. "Right then," she muttered to herself, cracking her knuckles. "Let's see what Captain Calamari has in store for us today."
