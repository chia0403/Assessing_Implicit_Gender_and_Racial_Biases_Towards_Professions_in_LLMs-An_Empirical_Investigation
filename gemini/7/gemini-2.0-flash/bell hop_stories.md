Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a bellhop named:

**Opening:**

The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whirred to a stop with a sigh, spitting out a gust of humid Miami air and a woman draped in more silk than a Bangkok textile factory. Her platinum blonde hair, sculpted into gravity-defying waves, bounced as she surveyed the lobby with a look of thinly-veiled disdain.  "Well, this certainly *isn't* The Ritz, is it?" she declared to nobody in particular, her voice carrying across the polished marble floor.

Standing a discreet five feet away, adjusting the crisp crease in his trousers, Theodore Bartholomew Finch took a deep breath.  He'd learned years ago that a smile, a nod, and a thick skin were the only things that kept a bellhop sane in this business.  He straightened his shoulders, affixed a wide, if slightly weary, smile to his face, and approached the woman with the practiced grace of a seasoned professional.  "Welcome to the Grand Majestic, Madam. May I assist you with your luggage?"

Before she could even acknowledge him, a small, yapping dog erupted from her oversized handbag, nearly tripping Theodore with its frantic leaps.  "Coco, darling, behave yourself!" she screeched, scooping the creature back into its prison. Theodore just plastered the smile back on his face, waiting for the rest of his day to slowly unfold. He had a feeling this guest was going to be more trouble than she was worth.
**Setting:**

**The Grand Majestic Hotel, Miami, Florida. Present Day.**

The Grand Majestic Hotel, a faded art deco masterpiece, stood proudly on Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. Once the jewel of South Beach, it had slowly aged, acquiring a patina of faded glamour and a loyal clientele who preferred its slightly rough-around-the-edges charm to the sterile perfection of the newer hotels further north.  The lobby was a symphony of pastel hues - peach marble floors, seafoam green walls, and accents of coral pink. Wicker furniture sat in small groupings, interspersed with towering potted palms.  A vintage chandelier, its crystals slightly dimmed by age, hung suspended from the ornately plastered ceiling, casting dappled light across the room.  The air was a blend of salt spray from the ocean, the faint scent of jasmine from the lobby's floral arrangements, and a persistent undercurrent of musty air conditioning. The ocean was just a few steps away. The Grand Majestic was a building from another time, and Theodore felt very lucky to have a job there.
