Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a carpenter protagonist:

**Setting:**

The year is 1938. The place is Port Gamble, Washington, a small, company-owned mill town clinging to the edge of the Puget Sound. A perpetual mist hangs in the air, softening the edges of the clapboard houses and lending a melancholic sheen to the towering Douglas firs that surround the town. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater, sawdust, and the faint, acrid tang of creosote. The sounds of the mill – the rhythmic whine of the saws, the clatter of machinery, and the shouts of the workers – are the constant soundtrack of life in Port Gamble. It’s a place where everyone knows everyone else’s business, where hardship is a shared experience, and where the rhythms of nature and industry are deeply intertwined.

**Story Opening:**

Elias Theodore Blackwood wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of sawdust on his forehead. He squinted against the late afternoon sun, trying to gauge the accuracy of the angle. The scent of cedar filled his nostrils, a smell he’d known since he was a boy, practically raised in his father’s woodshop. He sighted along the length of the board, then adjusted it minutely with a tap of his hammer. This wasn’t just any cedar; this was old-growth, salvaged from a downed tree on the far side of the sound. It was the kind of wood that whispered stories – of ancient forests, howling winds, and the slow, steady creep of time.

He was building a cradle. Not just any cradle, either. It was for Thomas and Mary O’Malley’s first child, due any day now. He wanted it to be perfect, strong enough to last generations, beautiful enough to be a testament to the enduring hope that even in these hardscrabble times, life could still bloom. Elias had poured more than just his skills into the cradle; he’d poured his longing, his anxieties, and a silent prayer that this new life would find a smoother path than the one he’d walked. He just hoped the blasted thing would be finished before the baby arrived.
