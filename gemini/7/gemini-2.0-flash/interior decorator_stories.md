Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, her name a perfect, if slightly intimidating, match for her profession, surveyed the grand, if woefully neglected, entrance hall of Blackwood Manor with a critical eye. Dust motes danced in the weak shafts of sunlight struggling to pierce the grime-coated windows, illuminating the sheer volume of work that lay ahead.

The wind howled incessantly, rattling the ancient windows in their frames, a constant, mournful soundtrack to the daunting task ahead. Beatrice, armed with her sketchbook, measuring tape, and an unwavering sense of optimism, was ready to face not only the daunting task of transforming Blackwood Manor, but also, perhaps, the secrets hidden within its shadowy walls.
