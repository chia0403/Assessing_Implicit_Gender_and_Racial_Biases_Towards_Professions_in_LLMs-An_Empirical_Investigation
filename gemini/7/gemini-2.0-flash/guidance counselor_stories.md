## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet dread that clawed at Mrs. Evelyn Beatrice Ainsworth's throat. She hated Mondays. More specifically, she hated the Monday after a long weekend. The air was thick with the leftover scent of stale popcorn from the Friday night football game and the palpable lethargy of teenagers regretting their poor life choices over the past three days. Evelyn took a long sip of her lukewarm Earl Grey, the floral scent a fragile shield against the onslaught of hormonal angst she knew was headed her way. She stared out the window, at the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel in the school courtyard. Even the tree seemed to be sighing, burdened by the weight of potential.

Evelyn adjusted her sensible cardigan, a hand instinctively smoothing a stray strand of her silvering hair. Today, she needed to be ready. Ready to mediate a spat between two friends over a stolen boyfriend. Ready to coax a withdrawn student into sharing their anxieties about college applications. Ready to remind countless young adults that one bad grade wasn't the end of the world. She just hoped she had enough patience left to get through it all.

## Setting:

The setting is Northwood High, a public school nestled in the sleepy suburban town of Oakhaven, Ohio. The building itself is a sprawling, red-brick structure, built in the 1950s. Its age is evident in the cracked tile floors, the chipped paint, and the general feeling that it has seen better days.

Evelyn's office is small and cluttered, a sanctuary of sorts filled with stacks of brochures, pamphlets on everything from career paths to mental health resources, and an overflowing in-box threatening to spill its contents onto her already crowded desk. A corkboard covered in student photos and inspirational quotes hangs on the wall behind her. Despite the chaos, the space is warm and inviting, decorated with small touches like a potted fern on the windowsill and a framed print of Van Gogh’s “Starry Night.” It's a place where students can (hopefully) feel safe and understood, a temporary refuge from the pressures of adolescence. Beyond her office door lies the bustling hallway, the lifeblood of Northwood High, a constant stream of chattering students, slamming lockers, and the occasional echoing announcement.
