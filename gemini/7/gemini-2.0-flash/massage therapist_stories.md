## Story Opening & Setting:

The setting was a Monday morning, draped in the melancholic grey of a Seattle rain. Amelia Josephine Carter, usually a beacon of sunny disposition, felt the dampness seep into her bones as she unlocked the door to "The Knot Whisperer," her massage therapy studio. Located in the vibrant, slightly grungy heart of Fremont, her studio was a haven of aromatherapy and calming music amidst the neighborhood's quirky shops and roaring traffic. Inside, the air hung thick with the lingering scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a testament to the weekend's clientele, a mix of stressed tech workers, weary cyclists, and the occasional tourist nursing aching feet.

Amelia sighed, the sound barely audible over the gentle bubbling of her essential oil diffuser. She knew Mondays were always slow, a post-weekend lull before the mid-week stress started to build. This particular Monday, however, felt heavier than usual. Maybe it was the impending tax deadline, or perhaps just the persistent drizzle clinging to the city, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her own shoulders. As she switched on the soft lighting and adjusted the thermostat, Amelia braced herself for a day of quiet solitude, hoping the universe would send her someone, anyone, whose muscles needed coaxing back into a state of blissful ease.
