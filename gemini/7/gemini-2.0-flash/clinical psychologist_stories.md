## Story Opening:

The aroma of chamomile tea, usually a balm to her fraying nerves, did little to penetrate the lingering scent of desperation clinging to the air. Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Harding exhaled slowly, deliberately, forcing her shoulders to relax. Three hours. Three hours she'd listened to the unraveling tapestry of a life, a life so tangled with loss and regret that Evelyn felt a phantom ache in her own chest. She knew, intellectually, that transference was a phenomenon both natural and vital to the therapeutic process. But some days, the weight of others’ pain felt almost unbearable.

She glanced at the clock on the wall, a plain, unobtrusive thing chosen specifically for its neutrality. Six o’clock. Time to scrub the room, both literally and figuratively. She’d learned early in her career the necessity of rituals, of cleansing the space of emotional residue before the next soul stumbled in, seeking solace and a path forward.

## Setting:

Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Harding's private practice, "Harding Holistic Health," occupied the second floor of a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of Brookline, Massachusetts. The house, once grand but now gently weathered, mirrored the well-intentioned but often weary souls that sought refuge within its walls.

The waiting room was deliberately uncluttered, furnished with comfortable, mismatched armchairs and a low coffee table displaying stacks of well-worn magazines – National Geographic, Smithsonian, and the occasional dog-eared copy of *Psychology Today*. A bubbling fountain in the corner provided a calming white noise, masking the sounds of traffic and the anxieties of the unseen clients waiting their turn.

Evelyn's office, however, was more personal. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating bookshelves overflowing with well-loved books on psychology, philosophy, and even a few dog-eared novels. A large, comfortable armchair faced her desk, a solid oak piece that had belonged to her grandfather, also a doctor, though of the medical variety. Scattered across the surface were notes, appointment books, and a collection of smooth, grey river stones that she often fiddled with during particularly challenging sessions. The overall effect was one of comforting warmth and quiet competence, a sanctuary carved out from the chaos of the outside world.
