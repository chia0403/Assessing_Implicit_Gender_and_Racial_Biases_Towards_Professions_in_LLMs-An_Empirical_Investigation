## Story Opening:

The scent of antiseptic and simmering resentment hung thick in the air, a cocktail familiar to Eleanor Grace Abernathy, RN. It was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays at St. Jude’s General were perpetually teetering on the brink of chaos. Today, however, felt particularly precarious. The emergency room doors had swung open on an endless parade of minor traumas – scraped knees, strained backs, the occasional rogue cat bite – while the critical care unit was a symphony of beeping machines and strained voices.

Eleanor adjusted her mask, the elastic biting into the bridge of her nose, and glared at the overflowing patient chart rack. She was already two hours behind on her medication rounds and Mrs. Davison in room 304, a sweet, albeit demanding, woman suffering from pneumonia, had buzzed for her five times in the last hour demanding more ice chips and an explanation for the flickering fluorescent light above her bed.

“Just another Tuesday,” Eleanor muttered under her breath, her voice barely audible above the rhythmic whoosh of a respirator. She ran a tired hand through her auburn hair, pulling a stray strand loose from her tightly wound bun. This was it. This was the life she had chosen, the life she had dedicated years of study and countless sleepless nights to. And some days, like today, she wondered if she'd made a terrible mistake.

## Setting:

**St. Jude's General Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island.**

The hospital itself was a sprawling, brick behemoth built in the 1950s. While a newer, gleaming wing had been added in the late 90s, the original section, where Eleanor primarily worked, felt like a time capsule of outdated medical technology and institutional indifference. The linoleum floors were perpetually sticky, the paint on the walls chipped and peeling, and the fluorescent lighting cast a sickly, unflattering glow on everything and everyone.

Eleanor’s domain was the **Medical Surgical Unit on the third floor.** The layout was typical: a long central corridor lined with patient rooms on either side, a small, cramped nurses’ station overflowing with paperwork and discarded coffee cups, and a medication room that reeked of alcohol swabs and desperation.

Outside the windows, a panorama of Providence unfolded: the Providence River snaking its way towards Narragansett Bay, the red brick buildings of Brown University nestled on the hill, and the constant hum of city traffic. It was a vibrant, bustling scene, a stark contrast to the often-stagnant atmosphere of the ward where Eleanor spent her days battling illness, comforting the afflicted, and, on occasion, regretting her career choices.
