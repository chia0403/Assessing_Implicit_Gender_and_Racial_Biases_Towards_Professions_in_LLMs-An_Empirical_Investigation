## Opening:

The first cut of the day was always the hardest, even after thirty years. Not the physical act - Agnes Plumtree could practically butcher a whole side of beef in her sleep. No, it was the sound. The sickening thud of the cleaver hitting bone, the sudden release of scent, the knowledge that something that had lived and breathed was now being reduced to manageable portions for Mrs. Higgins’ Sunday roast.

Agnes closed her eyes for a moment, the cool, damp air of Plumtree & Daughters Butchers doing little to alleviate the sudden tightness in her chest. She pictured the Highland cow, brown and shaggy, she'd seen grazing in Farmer Giles' field just last week. It was silly, she knew. It wasn’t *that* cow, and besides, this was her livelihood. But sometimes, just sometimes, the weight of it all pressed down on her like a slab of Aberdeen Angus.

Opening her eyes, she squared her shoulders, the crisp, starched white of her apron a small act of defiance against the encroaching melancholy. The fluorescent lights of the butcher shop hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the glistening array of meats laid out on the marble counter. Today was Friday, which meant fish and chips night for most of the village, so she had to get a move on. She grabbed the cleaver, the cold steel familiar and comforting in her calloused hand, and addressed the awaiting carcass.

## Setting:

**Plumtree & Daughters Butchers** is a long, narrow shop nestled in the heart of the quaint Cotswold village of Little Puddleton. The exterior, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, shade of robin's egg blue, is adorned with a hand-painted sign in elegant script. Window displays rotate weekly, showcasing everything from plump sausages arranged in artful swirls to glistening hams festooned with cloves.

Inside, the shop is a sensory explosion. The air is thick with the mingled scents of sawdust, smoked meats, and the slightly metallic tang of fresh blood. Sawdust, sprinkled religiously each morning, covers the floor, absorbing any errant spills and providing a slightly yielding surface underfoot.

The main feature is the long, gleaming marble counter that runs the length of the shop. Behind it, a gleaming array of meats is displayed under bright fluorescent lights: rosy lamb chops, marbled steaks, plump chickens, and strings of vibrant sausages. A glass-fronted refrigerated display case holds a variety of pre-packaged meats, cheeses, and pates.

At the back of the shop is a door leading to the butchering room, a haven of stainless steel surfaces and gleaming implements. Here, Agnes, along with her daughter, Clara, transform whole carcasses into the cuts of meat that feed Little Puddleton.

Plumtree & Daughters is more than just a butcher shop; it's a cornerstone of the community, a place where gossip is exchanged, recipes are shared, and the rhythmic thud of Agnes Plumtree’s cleaver is a comforting, familiar sound.
