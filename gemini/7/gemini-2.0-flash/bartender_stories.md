## Opening:

The clatter of ice against glass, the murmur of hushed conversations, and the mournful croon of a Billie Holiday record â€“ these were the sounds that cradled Elias Thorne every night. He knew them intimately, like the lines on his own calloused hands. Tonight, however, something was different. A discordant note hung in the air, thicker than the cigarette smoke swirling near the dimly lit booths. Elias could feel it, a subtle prickle beneath his skin, a feeling that promised trouble, and Elias, who preferred the predictable rhythm of his bar, hated trouble. He polished another glass, the gesture more for reassurance than necessity, and watched the reflections of his regulars shift and dance in the polished surface. He just hoped whatever storm was brewing, it wouldn't hit his bar, The Crooked Spoon, too hard.

## Setting:

The Crooked Spoon was nestled deep in the heart of Old Town, Havenwood, a city built on whispers and secrets. The bar was an institution, its mahogany counter worn smooth by generations of elbows and spilled drinks. Stained-glass lamps cast pools of amber light across the room, illuminating the worn velvet booths and the eclectic collection of trinkets that adorned the walls - antique maps, faded photographs, and the occasional dusty taxidermied bird. The Crooked Spoon wasn't trendy; it was comfortable, a haven for those who preferred the company of a stiff drink and a good story to the flashing lights and synthetic beats of the newer establishments uptown. It was the kind of place where the bartender knew your name, your drink, and probably your deepest, darkest secrets, even if you hadn't told him. It was Elias Thorne's sanctuary, and he would defend it fiercely.
