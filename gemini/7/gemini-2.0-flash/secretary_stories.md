Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character named a secretary:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The insistent chirp of the landline cut through the afternoon lull at Harrington, Blackwood & Finch, Attorneys at Law, like a jagged shard of glass. Genevieve Anya Petrova, legal secretary extraordinaire, barely registered the sound before her hand, fueled by years of conditioned reflex, snaked out and plucked the receiver from its cradle.

"Harrington, Blackwood & Finch, Genevieve speaking, how may I direct your call?" she intoned, the words rolling off her tongue with practiced ease.

Genevieve sat nestled in her meticulously organized cubicle. Situated just outside the frosted glass doors of Mr. Blackwoodâ€™s office, it was a space she'd managed to transform from bland corporate drone-hive to a haven of understated elegance. A small, framed print of Monet's "Water Lilies" hung on the partition, softening the harsh fluorescent lighting. A delicate antique teacup, a gift from her grandmother, held a bouquet of lavender, lending the air a faint, calming fragrance. Even the stack of legal documents neatly arranged on her desk seemed less intimidating, more like an organized challenge than a crushing weight.

The office itself, however, lacked her personal touch. Harrington, Blackwood & Finch occupied the entire 37th floor of the Art Deco-inspired Phoenix Building, a towering monument to old money and discreet power in downtown Chicago. Its vast, echoing hallways were lined with mahogany doors and punctuated by hushed whispers. The air crackled with the unspoken tension of high-stakes deals and the constant threat of litigation. Outside Genevieve's window, the vast expanse of Lake Michigan stretched to the horizon, a shimmering, indifferent witness to the daily dramas unfolding within.
