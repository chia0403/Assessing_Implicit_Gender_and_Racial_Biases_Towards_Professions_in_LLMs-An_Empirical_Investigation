## Story Opening:

The dust coated Silas Bartholomew's eyelashes like tiny, grey moths, clinging stubbornly as he squinted at the rising sun. Another day, another stone. He spat, the grit gritty on his tongue, and wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smear of grey across his brow. The air, still cool before the full heat of the day descended, carried the scent of pine and the ever-present, metallic tang of chiselled stone. He took a deep breath, ignoring the ache in his back that had become as familiar as the pattern of veins in his own hands, and picked up his hammer. The quarry waited.

## Setting:

The story begins in the small, isolated mountain village of Eldhaven, nestled in the foothills of the jagged, granite peaks known locally as the Dragon's Teeth. Eldhaven is built almost entirely of the same grey granite that defines the surrounding landscape, giving it a stark, almost severe beauty. Houses are low and sturdy, hugging the slopes, their roofs weighted down with heavy stones. The air is thin and clean, often carrying the sounds of wind whistling through the crags and the rhythmic clang of hammers from the quarry just outside the village.

The quarry itself is a vast, gouged-out wound in the mountainside, a testament to generations of stone cutters who have carved their living from the unforgiving rock. Piles of discarded stone litter the edges, monuments to imperfections and miscalculations. Narrow, winding paths snake through the quarry, leading to various working areas where men like Silas tirelessly chip away at the granite, extracting the blocks that will build homes, churches, and the occasional, opulent tomb for a wealthy merchant from the lowlands. Beyond the quarry, the land stretches out in a tapestry of pine forests and rocky meadows, leading ultimately to the vast and unforgiving wilderness beyond the Dragon's Teeth. Life in Eldhaven is hard, but the people are resilient, bound together by the shared struggle of wresting a living from the unforgiving stone.
