## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of brine and blooming jasmine hung thick in the air, a deceptive sweetness that masked the rot beneath. Eleanor Iris Vance adjusted the strap of her camera bag, the weight a comforting presence against her hip. This was it. The light was perfect, that soft, diffused golden hour that could make even decay beautiful. She took a deep breath, the salt stinging her nostrils, and finally, with a reluctant sigh, stepped onto the warped wooden planks of the pier.

**Setting:**

Eleanor found herself on the crumbling remains of the once-grand Starling Pier, a forgotten appendage clinging to the coast of Oakhaven, Louisiana. Oakhaven itself was a town steeped in history, Spanish moss draped heavy like mourning veils over the ancient oaks that lined the streets, whispering tales of pirates, plantations, and forgotten fortunes. The pier, however, had no such romantic allure. Abandoned after a devastating hurricane fifteen years ago, it was now a skeletal framework slowly being reclaimed by the Gulf. Rust ate at the metal supports, planks buckled and splintered, and the air thrummed with the buzzing of insects feasting on the exposed, decaying wood. Beyond the pier, the sun bled into the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues, a breathtaking counterpoint to the grim reality beneath Eleanor's feet.
