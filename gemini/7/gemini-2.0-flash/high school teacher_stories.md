The scent of disinfectant and stale coffee clung to the air like a stubborn ghost. Ms. Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, her shoulders already aching from the weight of the ungraded pile of Romeo and Juliet essays teetering precariously on her desk, sighed and stared out the grimy window. October in Cedar Creek, Iowa, was a study in faded glory; the vibrant leaves that had drawn tourists just weeks ago were now brittle brown scraps swirling in the wind, mirroring the melancholic mood permeating Cedar Creek High School.

The school itself was a brick behemoth, built in the 1950s and boasting all the charm of a Soviet apartment block. Its long, echoing hallways were lined with lockers adorned with fading stickers and hastily scribbled graffiti, a testament to generations of bored teenagers who had dreamt of escaping the confines of this small, agricultural town. Eleanor, however, had never quite managed to leave. Not completely. After graduating Cedar Creek High herself, she'd ventured off to college with grand aspirations of becoming a novelist, only to find herself, years later, back in the same familiar hallways, teaching English to a new generation of students who, for the most part, seemed equally eager to escape. Today, the bell was about to ring, releasing them into the crisp autumn air, leaving Eleanor to face the endless cycle of grading, planning, and the nagging feeling that she was stuck, a character trapped in a novel that had long lost its plot.
