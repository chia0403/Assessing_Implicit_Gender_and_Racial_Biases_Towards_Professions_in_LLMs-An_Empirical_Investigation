The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed roses and the perfectly sculpted hedges with an almost malevolent tenacity.  Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the pre-dawn chill, surveyed his kingdom.  Not a kingdom of castles and crowns, but of emerald carpets and vibrant blooms.  He was, after all, Elias Thorne, owner and operator of Thorne Landscaping – a business built not on inherited wealth, but on calloused hands, a keen eye, and an unwavering love for the earth.  The smell of damp soil and freshly cut grass, a familiar comfort, filled his lungs as he began his day, the quiet hum of his mower a counterpoint to the sleepy chirping of unseen birds.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility was laced with a subtle unease.  A sense of something…off.  Something lurking just beneath the surface of the perfect suburban veneer.
