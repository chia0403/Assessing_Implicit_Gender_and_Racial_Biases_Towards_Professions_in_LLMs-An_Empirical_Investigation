The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Rain lashed down, turning the already muddy field surrounding Blackwood Manor into a treacherous bog.  The imposing gothic structure, silhouetted against the bruised purple sky, loomed like a malevolent gargoyle, its decaying stonework slick with moisture and shadowed by ancient, gnarled oaks.  A single police car’s headlights cut through the gloom, illuminating a small, huddled group near the wrought-iron gates – uniformed officers, their faces grim, and a figure draped in a forensic tent, the stark white a grotesque contrast to the somber landscape.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettlingly sweet, that clung to Eleanor’s coat like a shroud.  This was it – the culmination of weeks of chilling phone calls, cryptic messages, and a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the heart of a mystery far darker than any she’d encountered before.
