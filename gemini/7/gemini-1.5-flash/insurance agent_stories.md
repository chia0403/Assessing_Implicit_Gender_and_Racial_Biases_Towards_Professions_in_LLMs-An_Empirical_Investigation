The stale scent of cheap coffee and despair clung to the air in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's office like a persistent cough.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of his small, second-floor suite overlooking a perpetually congested stretch of Highway 17.  Bart, a man whose thinning brown hair mirrored the dwindling reserves in his bank account, stared out at the relentless downpour, a half-eaten tuna sandwich drooping sadly beside a stack of unpaid bills.  His desk, a monument to organizational chaos, was buried under a mountain of policy forms, each one a testament to the anxieties and misfortunes of his clients â€“ anxieties he was, increasingly, feeling all too acutely himself.  The only splash of color in the room was a faded poster depicting a cheerful family frolicking on a sun-drenched beach, a stark contrast to the grim reality of Bart's present circumstances.
