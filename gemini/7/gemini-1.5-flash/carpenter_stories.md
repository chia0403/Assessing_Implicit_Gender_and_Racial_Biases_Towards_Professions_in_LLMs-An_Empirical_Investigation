Elias, his weathered hands calloused and strong, ignored the biting wind and the treacherous spray, his concentration fixed on the task at hand.  The scent of pine and salt hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that spoke of years spent battling the elements and the unforgiving demands of his craft.  The lighthouse, a lonely sentinel against the relentless Atlantic, was Elias's current challenge, a testament to his skill and a desperate plea against the encroaching darkness.
