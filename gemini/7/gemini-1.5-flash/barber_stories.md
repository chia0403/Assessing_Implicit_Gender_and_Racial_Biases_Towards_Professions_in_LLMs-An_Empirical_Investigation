The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the October wind, the faded lettering barely legible:  "Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, Master Barber."  Inside, Bartholomew Higgins himself hummed a discordant counterpoint to the wind's lament, his hands deftly wielding a pair of antique shears.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of his shop, illuminating the worn leather of his barber chair and the chipped porcelain mugs lining a shelf cluttered with half-empty bottles of pomade and bay rum.  The air hung thick with the scent of talcum powder, old wood, and something faintly metallic – the lingering aroma of a thousand close shaves.  Bart’s shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the forgotten corner of Grimsborough, hadn't seen a proper sprucing up in decades, mirroring the slow, deliberate rhythm of its owner's life.
