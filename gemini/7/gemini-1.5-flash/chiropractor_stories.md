The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the tangled seaweed.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the jagged peaks of the Isle of Skye, cast long shadows across the rocky cove.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore.  Eleanor, her usually pristine white chiropractic scrubs now speckled with seawater and smelling strongly of kelp, muttered under her breath, her frustration far outweighing the thrill of the meagre catch.  She’d promised her neighbour, old Mr. MacIntyre, a fresh lobster for his birthday, and this wasn’t exactly looking like a birthday feast.  The tiny, windswept village of Portree huddled in the distance, its brightly coloured houses clinging to the hillside like a child's haphazardly built stone tower, a stark contrast to the wild, untamed beauty surrounding her.  This was her life, a blend of back-cracking and battling the elements, a far cry from the sterile, clinical environment she'd left behind in London.
