The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floorboards of “Stitches & Dreams,”  a small, almost hidden atelier tucked away on a cobbled lane behind the bustling marketplace of Prague.  Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows, a steady rhythm accompanying the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Amelia Katarina Petrova’s shears.  Amelia, with her fingers stained a permanent sepia from years of handling dyes and her eyes the colour of a stormy Baltic sea, worked with a practiced grace, her nimble hands coaxing a breathtaking sapphire gown from swathes of shimmering silk.  The flickering gaslight above her cast long shadows that danced across the walls, draped with bolts of fabric in every imaginable hue, a testament to her artistry and the secrets they held within their woven threads.
