The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful symphony across the snow-covered expanse of Denali National Park, its icy fingers clawing at the exposed metal of Captain Amelia “Amy” Fairbanks’s Cessna 185.  The pre-dawn sky bled a bruised purple and grey, the faintest blush of sunrise struggling to pierce the thick cloud cover hanging low over the jagged peaks.  Amy shivered, pulling her fur-lined parka tighter, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The single-engine plane, affectionately nicknamed “The Bumble Bee” by Amy and her small team of ground crew, sat patiently on the makeshift airstrip, a narrow ribbon of packed snow carved into the frozen wilderness.  This wasn't a scheduled flight; this was a rescue.  And time, as always in these unforgiving mountains, was running out.
