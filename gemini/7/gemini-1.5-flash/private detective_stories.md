The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion echoing the turmoil in his gut.  He sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the single bare bulb above casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering gaslight from the alley below.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and something elseâ€¦ something faintly metallic, like old blood drying on cracked pavement.  Jack Stratton, Private Investigator, wasn't used to feeling unsettled, but this case, the disappearance of socialite Evangeline Beaumont, was different. Different in a way that scraped at the edges of his usually cynical pragmatism, leaving a raw, uneasy feeling.  His office, a cramped space above a failing butcher shop in the perpetually damp backstreets of Grimsborough, felt more claustrophobic than usual tonight.  Even the comforting weight of the Smith & Wesson .38 Special in his desk drawer offered little solace.
