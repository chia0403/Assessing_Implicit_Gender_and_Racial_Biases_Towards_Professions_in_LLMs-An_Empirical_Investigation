The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy toolbox from the back of her battered Ford Ranger.  The salty tang of the Atlantic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the smell of decaying seaweed and something faintly…electrical.  Mia shivered, pulling her worn leather jacket tighter.  The craggy cliffs of Cornwall loomed over her, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed relentlessly at the base of the cliffs, the waves a constant, rhythmic roar against the dramatic backdrop of Porthcurno’s iconic Telegraph Museum.  Tonight, however, Mia wasn't here to admire the scenery.  She was here to fix a problem, a very unusual problem, at the most unusual of locations: a seemingly haunted lighthouse perched precariously on the edge of the world.
