The diesel engine coughed, a phlegmy rumble that vibrated through Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's worn leather boots.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 163, swirling like mischievous spirits around his eighteen-wheeler, a beast of chrome and steel named "Betsy." The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy Arizona sky, beat down relentlessly on the cab, baking the vinyl seats until they were almost too hot to touch.  The air conditioner, a valiant but ultimately defeated warrior against the desert heat, wheezed its last gasp before surrendering entirely. Zeke wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the salty moisture instantly disappearing into the dry air.  Ahead, the landscape stretched out – endless miles of ochre desert punctuated by the skeletal remains of tumbleweeds and the occasional lonely saguaro cactus, their arms reaching towards a sky devoid of mercy.  This was Zeke's office, his domain, his purgatory.  He adjusted the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of Betsy's reflection – a loyal companion in this desolate kingdom of sun-baked roads and endless horizons.
