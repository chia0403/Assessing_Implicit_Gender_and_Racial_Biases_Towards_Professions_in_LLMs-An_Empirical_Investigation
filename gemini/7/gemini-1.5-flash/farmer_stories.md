The biting November wind whipped across the fallow fields of Elderwood Farm, stinging Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks and carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Elias, a man etched by years of sun and toil, pulled his worn wool cap lower, the thick fabric doing little to ward off the penetrating chill.  His breath plumed out in ragged white clouds as he surveyed his land, a patchwork of brown and grey under the bruised purple sky.  The farmhouse, a sturdy stone structure that had weathered countless harsh winters, hunkered low against the rising gale, a solitary sentinel on the vast, undulating expanse of the Derbyshire moorland.  A lone, gnarled oak stood guard at the edge of the yard, its branches clawing at the heavens like skeletal fingers.  This was home, and tonight, Elias felt a foreboding grip his heart tighter than the icy wind.
