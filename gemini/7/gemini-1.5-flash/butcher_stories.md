The chill wind, a razor-edged thing whistling down from the glacier-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, bit at Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew's exposed cheeks.  He hauled a side of venison, its fur still clinging stubbornly to the meat, across the slick cobblestones of Oakhaven's market square.

A thin trickle stained the worn leather apron that protected his already-scarred hands.  Oakhaven, nestled in a valley carved by the relentless flow of the Whisperwind River, was a picturesque place, its timber-framed buildings huddled together like gossiping old women, but this morning, the picturesque was overshadowed by a decidedly un-picturesque amount of crimson.
