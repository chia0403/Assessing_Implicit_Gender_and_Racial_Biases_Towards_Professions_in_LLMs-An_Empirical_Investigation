The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the snow-packed street of Havenwood, the crunch of her boots a stark counterpoint to the eerie silence of the otherwise deserted town.  Havenwood, nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, was a picture postcard in summer, a vibrant splash of colour against the emerald slopes.  But winter had a way of stripping away the charm, leaving behind only a skeletal frame of frosted trees and houses huddled together for warmth, their windows glowing like faint embers against the encroaching darkness.  The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient clock tower in the town square, a sound Evelyn found both comforting and unsettling tonight, its measured beat echoing the relentless drumming of her own anxious heart.  Tonight, Havenwood felt less like a sleepy town and more like a silent predator, its secrets buried under a thick blanket of snow.
