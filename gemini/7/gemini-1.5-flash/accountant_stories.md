The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass panes of "Finch & Finch Accountants," a name that once resonated with the quiet pride of a successful family business, now feeling more like a weight on Amelia’s shoulders.

The building itself, a three-story Georgian townhouse with peeling paint and a perpetually leaky roof, groaned under the weight of years and unpaid bills, a testament to the dwindling client base and the creeping shadow of impending bankruptcy. The smell of damp plaster and old ledger books hung heavy in the air, a scent as familiar to Amelia as her own breath.
