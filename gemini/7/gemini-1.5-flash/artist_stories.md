The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the canvas onto her easel.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of her ramshackle studio, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic. Below, the waves crashed against the jagged rocks with a fury that mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.  The air smelled of salt spray and something else, something earthy and faintly metallic â€“ the scent of the peat bogs that clung to the windswept hills behind her isolated cottage in County Clare, Ireland.  Amelia, despite the discomfort, felt a strange sense of exhilaration. This raw, untamed landscape, so often a source of frustration, was today her muse, her inspiration, her fury made manifest.  The blank canvas, however, remained stubbornly, frustratingly blank.
