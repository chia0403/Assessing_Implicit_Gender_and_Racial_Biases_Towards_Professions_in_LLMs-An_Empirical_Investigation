The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday morning.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could disarm a grizzly bear, adjusted her magnification goggles, the cool glass a welcome contrast to the sweat beading on her brow.  Outside the window of her small, sun-drenched operatory at "Bright Smiles Dental," the relentless San Francisco fog clung to the hills like a damp shroud, a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost offensively cheerful decor within.  Paintings of impossibly perfect teeth adorned the walls, a testament to the clinic’s relentlessly optimistic branding – a branding that Amelia, despite her own impeccable dental hygiene, found slightly nauseating.  Today, however, nausea wasn't from the decor; it was courtesy of Mr. Henderson, whose morning breath could curdle milk at twenty paces.
