The bell above the door of "Apothecary's Choice" jingled a discordant welcome, the sound swallowed by the hushed murmur of the late afternoon.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun slanting through the stained-glass window depicting a rather jaundiced-looking St. Fiacre, danced in the air above Elias Thorne's workbench. Elias, a man whose age was as carefully concealed as the potent ingredients in his most prized tinctures, adjusted his spectacles, the thin gold rims glinting. The air in his apothecary, nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient city of Porthaven, hung thick with the scent of dried herbs, bitter almonds, and something indefinablyâ€¦magical.  It was a smell Elias knew intimately, a comforting aroma that had permeated his life for the past forty years.  But today, something felt different.  A subtle shift in the familiar scent, a whisper of something unknown, hung in the air alongside the familiar lavender and chamomile.
