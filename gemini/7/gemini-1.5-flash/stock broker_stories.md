The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Alistair Finch's office, each drop a tiny, insistent percussion against the backdrop of the city's frantic hum.  Below, the canyons of Wall Street throbbed with a life Alistair felt increasingly disconnected from.  Fifty-two floors up, in his impeccably appointed office at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Croft, the only sounds besides the storm were the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fingers against the polished mahogany desk and the low thrum of the server humming beneath it.  The city lights, blurred by the downpour, painted shimmering streaks across the glass, reflecting in the polished silver of his cufflinks â€“ a miniature replica of the charging bull, a symbol of the market's volatility, a volatility Alistair, for the first time in his long and successful career, felt acutely in his own chest.  He stared at the screen, a graph of plummeting stock values mocking the meticulously organized chaos of his desk.  The weight of impending disaster, both personal and professional, pressed down on him like the suffocating humidity of a summer storm.
