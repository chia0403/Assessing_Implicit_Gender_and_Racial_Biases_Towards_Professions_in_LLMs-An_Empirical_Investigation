The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant, angry red.  She tugged her worn wool scarf tighter, the rough texture a welcome contrast to the icy chill that permeated the crumbling stone walls of the abandoned St. Jude’s Orphanage.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying wood, a perfume only a photographer like Amelia, with her nose perpetually buried in the rich tapestry of olfactory experiences, could truly appreciate.  Overhead, a bruised purple sky threatened snow, its impending darkness mirrored by the deepening shadows within the orphanage’s gaping windows.  This was it – the location for her most ambitious project yet: a photographic essay on the forgotten places of Aisling, the small, coastal Irish town where the past seemed to cling to the present like stubborn seaweed to a rocky shore.
