The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant stage door.  Rust groaned in protest with every heave, a sound oddly fitting for the dilapidated grandeur of the Blackwood Theatre, a once-proud Victorian playhouse now clinging precariously to life in the shadow of a gleaming, modern multiplex.

Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, finally managed to force the door open, revealing a cavernous lobby swallowed by gloom, punctuated only by the skeletal gleam of a chandelier hanging precariously from its cracked ceiling.  The air itself seemed to hum with the ghosts of past triumphs and forgotten tragedies â€“ a fitting atmosphere for a woman about to embark on the most ambitious, and possibly foolhardy, production of her career.
