The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d grown accustomed to, the steady rhythm a comforting backdrop to the often chaotic ballet of needles, tubes, and anxious patients.  This Wednesday morning, however, the usual low-level anxiety felt amplified, a tremor in the air thicker than the antiseptic smell clinging to everything.  Amelia,  a woman whose calm demeanor usually charmed even the most needle-phobic, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  It wasn't just the overflowing requisition tray; it was something… else.  A subtle shift in the energy of the room, a premonition as sharp as the lancet she held in her hand.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful song, mirroring the unsettling feeling that settled deep in Amelia’s gut.
