Dust motes danced in the beams, tiny, glittering specters in the hushed grandeur of a place that held secrets as old as the stones themselves.  Blackwood Academy, with its gothic turrets and whispering ivy, wasn't just a school; it was a repository of history, a vault of forgotten stories, and for Elias, a nightly canvas for his solitary existence.
