The wind, a rasping whisper at first, built to a banshee wail across the plains of Montana, whipping dust devils into frenzied dances across the parched earth.  Amelia “Mia” Blackwood squinted against the grit stinging her eyes, her weathered face a roadmap of sun and hardship etched into leathery skin.

Dust, thick as a shroud, hung heavy in the air, coating everything in a fine, ochre film.  The only sound louder than the wind was the lowing of Mia's cattle, a mournful chorus echoing the desolate beauty of the land she'd inherited – a land that was currently threatening to swallow her whole.
