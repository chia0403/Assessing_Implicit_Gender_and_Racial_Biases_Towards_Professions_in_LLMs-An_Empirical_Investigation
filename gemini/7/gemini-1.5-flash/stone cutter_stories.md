The rasp of granite against steel sang a lonely tune across the windswept moor.  A grey, almost ethereal light, typical of a late autumn day in Cornwall, cast long shadows from the jagged cliffs that tumbled down to meet the churning Atlantic.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of Elias Thorne's chisel.
