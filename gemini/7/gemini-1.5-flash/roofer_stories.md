The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne’s thick wool jacket, tugging at the hem and threatening to send his worn work boots skittering across the slick, moss-covered tiles. Below, the city of Porthaven sprawled, a tapestry of gaslit streets and rain-darkened rooftops stretching towards the brooding, grey Atlantic.  Elias, a man sculpted by years of hard labor under unforgiving skies, gripped the rusted chimney stack for dear life. The ancient building, a crumbling Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on the edge of the cliff, groaned under the weight of the storm, its timbers protesting with a symphony of creaks and sighs. The job – patching the roof before the worst of the winter set in – felt less like work and more like a desperate battle against the elements and the inevitable decay of time.
