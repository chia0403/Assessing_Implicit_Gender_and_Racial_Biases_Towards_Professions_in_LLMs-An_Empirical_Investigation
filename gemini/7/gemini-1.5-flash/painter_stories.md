The salt spray kissed Aurelia Blackwood’s face, carrying the sharp tang of brine and the faint, sweet scent of seaweed.  She stood perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the wind whipping her auburn hair across her canvas.  The sky, a bruised purple bruised by a retreating storm, mirrored the tempestuous emotions swirling within her.  Below, the village of Port Blossom huddled against the cliff face, its whitewashed cottages clinging to the land like barnacles to a ship’s hull.  Aurelia, however, wasn't interested in capturing the picturesque charm of the village today.  Her attention was fixed solely on the chaotic dance of the waves, the way the light fractured and reformed on the churning water, a maelstrom of colour and movement that demanded to be translated onto her canvas.  This was her sanctuary, this wild, unforgiving coast, a place where the canvas became a mirror reflecting the tempest in her soul.
