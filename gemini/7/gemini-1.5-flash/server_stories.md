The clatter of ceramic mugs against saucers, the hiss of the espresso machine, and the low thrum of conversation formed a familiar, almost comforting, cacophony for Amelia Jean Worthington.  Amelia, or Mia as most of the regulars at "The Daily Grind" called her, expertly navigated the bustling coffee shop, a tray laden with steaming lattes and delicately frosted muffins balanced precariously in her capable hands.  Rain lashed against the large bay windows of the shop, blurring the already hazy November cityscape of Portland, Oregon, into a watercolour painting of grey and muted greens. Inside, however, the air was warm and thick with the aroma of roasted coffee beans, cinnamon, and the lingering sweetness of burnt sugar.  The low, worn armchairs were occupied by a mix of laptop-wielding students, gossiping housewives, and solitary figures lost in books, each a miniature drama unfolding within the larger performance of the Daily Grind.
