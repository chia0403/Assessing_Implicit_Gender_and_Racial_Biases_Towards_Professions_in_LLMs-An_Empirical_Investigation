The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Holloway’s hair across her face as she wrestled with a recalcitrant antenna cable.  Rust, the insidious enemy of coastal electronics, had claimed another victim: the aging, but vital, emergency broadcast system atop the crumbling lighthouse at Cape Despair.  The Cape, a jagged tooth of rock thrusting defiantly into the churning grey Atlantic, was a place where the sky wept a perpetual drizzle and the only sounds louder than the wind were the mournful cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs.  Amy, bundled in layers of wool against the November chill, squinted at the corroded wiring, the lighthouse’s skeletal frame looming behind her like a weathered giant guarding a secret.  The air smelled of brine, seaweed, and the faint, metallic tang of ozone.  It was a smell she’d come to know intimately over the years, a smell that both repelled and, strangely, comforted her.  Tonight, however, the comfort was thin, overshadowed by the urgent hum of the malfunctioning transmitter threatening to cut off the lifeline to the scattered fishing villages clinging precariously to the coastline.
