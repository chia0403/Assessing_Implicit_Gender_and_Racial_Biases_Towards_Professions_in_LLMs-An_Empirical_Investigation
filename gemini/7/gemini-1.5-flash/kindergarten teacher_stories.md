The aroma of stale crayons and slightly-too-sweet juice boxes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  It clung to the brightly coloured carpet, the miniature chairs scattered haphazardly around the room, even to the slightly frayed edges of her favourite cardigan.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of Room 2B, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays – a miniature galaxy swirling above the miniature people sprawled on the floor, engaged in a surprisingly ferocious game of building blocks.  Outside, the relentless November wind howled a mournful tune, but inside, Room 2B hummed with a chaotic, endearing energy that was Eleanor’s own particular brand of happy.  Today, however, even her usual cheerful resilience felt… frayed, like the edges of that cardigan.
