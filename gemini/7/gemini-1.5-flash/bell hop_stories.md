The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Crystal Palace Hotel lobby, reflecting the nervous tremor in Augustine "Gus" Blackwood's hand as he polished it.  Gus, a bellhop of precisely five years and three months standing at the Crystal Palace, knew that gleam was a deceptive one. Beneath the surface, the spittoon held the residue of a thousand whispered secrets, a thousand anxieties coughed up by the hotel's transient clientele. Tonight, the air itself crackled with a different kind of tension, a static charge that hummed in the ornate chandeliers and vibrated in the plush velvet carpets.  Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking the rain-slicked streets of 1920s Chicago, each drop a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of urban unease.  The Crystal Palace, a monument to gilded age excess now showing its age in chipped paint and fading grandeur, held its breath.  Something was about to happen.
