The relentless Parisian drizzle, a fine, almost imperceptible mist, clung to Elias Thorne's charcoal grey overcoat like a second skin.  He pulled the collar higher, the damp chill seeping through despite the expensive wool.  The city, usually a kaleidoscope of vibrant life even under a grey sky, felt muted tonight, its usual cacophony subdued to a low hum.  Elias, however, felt anything but muted.  A knot of anxiety, tight as a Gordian knot he’d once painstakingly recreated in miniature for a client, coiled in his stomach. The Musée d'Orsay loomed before him, its imposing silhouette softened by the mist, a gothic ghost against the inky backdrop of the Seine.  This wasn't a casual evening stroll for Elias Thorne, celebrated architect and renowned preservationist;  tonight, his reputation – and perhaps his career – hung precariously in the balance.
