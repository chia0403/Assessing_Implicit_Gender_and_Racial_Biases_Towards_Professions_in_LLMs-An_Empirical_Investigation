The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks, a familiar sting that did little to rouse him from his usual state of bleary-eyed indifference.  He wrestled a thermos of lukewarm coffee from its precarious perch in the battered cab of his pickup truck, the rusty metal groaning a mournful protest with each movement.  The sky over the New Mexico desert was still a bruised purple, the rising sun promising another day of brutal heat on the endless stretch of Interstate 40.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red grit, danced across the asphalt like mischievous spirits, already teasing the day’s oppressive heat.  Elias, a veteran highway worker with calloused hands and a permanently sun-weathered face, sighed, the sound lost in the rumble of distant eighteen-wheelers.  His work boots crunched on the gravel shoulder as he stepped out, the silence broken only by the whisper of the wind and the distant drone of the approaching traffic – a symphony of asphalt, steel, and the relentless hum of the American highway.
