The salt spray stung Dr. Evelyn Reed's face as she wrestled the recalcitrant fishing net from the tangled heap on the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the churning grey waters of the Irish Sea, painting the sky in bruised purples and angry oranges.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, carried a faint, unsettling undercurrent of something else – something metallic and vaguely…rotten.  Evelyn, her waterproofs slick with seawater and her usually meticulously-styled auburn hair escaping its braid, squinted at the distant, looming cliffs of the Blasket Islands.  This wasn't exactly the kind of veterinary emergency call she'd anticipated when she'd taken on the locum position at the remote practice on Inisherin.
