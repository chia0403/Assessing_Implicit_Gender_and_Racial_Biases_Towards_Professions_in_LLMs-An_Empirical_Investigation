The chipped porcelain mug warmed Elara Jean Beaumont's hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the tremor still buzzing in her fingers.  Rain lashed against the single-paned windows of the Sunny Days Child Care Center, blurring the already hazy view of the overgrown garden beyond.  Inside, the usually vibrant playroom was subdued, a hushed quiet broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hallway and the occasional sniffle from a sleeping child nestled in a brightly coloured beanbag chair.  The air hung thick with the scent of spilled juice, crayons, and a lingering undercurrent of wet wool â€“ the result of a particularly enthusiastic puddle-jumping session earlier that afternoon.  Elara sighed, the steam from her tea fogging her glasses as she surveyed the scene, a mixture of exhaustion and quiet contentment settling over her.  Tonight, however, the contentment was tinged with a growing unease, a feeling that something was...off.
