The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk matched the chipped optimism in her heart.  It was the second week of October, a week notorious at Oakhaven Elementary for the annual "Pumpkin Palooza" – a week typically brimming with giddy anticipation, small-handed pumpkin carving, and the sweet scent of cinnamon.  This year, however, the air hung heavy with the damp chill of an unusually early autumn storm, mirroring the dampening effect of the overflowing "To Do" list perpetually clinging to her corkboard.  Outside, rain lashed against the ancient, ivy-covered brick walls of the school, a relentless rhythm that echoed the relentless thump-thump-thump of her own weary heart.  The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, a fitting accompaniment to the low thrum of anxiety that vibrated through the otherwise silent classroom.  Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming of the storm.  She rubbed her temples, the pressure behind her eyes a familiar companion these days.  The year, she knew, was going to be a challenging one.
