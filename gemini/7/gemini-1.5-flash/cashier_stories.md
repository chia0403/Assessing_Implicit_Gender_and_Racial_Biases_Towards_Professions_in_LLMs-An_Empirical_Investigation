The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday afternoon.  Amelia, whose name tag proclaimed her simply "Amy," meticulously arranged a pyramid of perfectly aligned oranges, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos that seemed to constantly swirl around her.  Outside, the late-summer sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the already sweltering air inside the convenience store to a near-unbearable temperature. The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the sharp tang of cleaning solution, a perfume only a convenience store could concoct.  The only respite from the heat was the weak, sputtering air conditioning unit above the freezer, fighting a losing battle against the relentless Texas sun.  Amelia sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic *beep-boop* of the scanner and the murmur of indistinct conversations from the few customers browsing the aisles. This was her life, at least for the next six hours.
