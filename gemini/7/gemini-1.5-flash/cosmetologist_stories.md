The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as unique to Serenity's Salon as the woman who owned it:  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of the Victorian storefront, blurring the already fading neon sign that advertised “Serenity’s: Where Beauty Blooms.”  Inside, however, the storm was a distant rumble, muffled by the low hum of the hair dryers and the soft chatter of Izzy’s clients.  Izzy herself, perched on a plush velvet stool behind a gleaming stainless-steel sink, expertly applied a rich, mahogany-colored dye to a young woman's hair, her nimble fingers a blur of practiced precision.  The salon, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, was a haven of warmth and comforting chaos, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.
