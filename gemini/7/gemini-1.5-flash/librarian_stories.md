Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, wasn't just a library; it was a labyrinth of forgotten histories, whispered secrets, and, Elias suspected, something far more sinister.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below provided a constant, unsettling backdrop to the silence within, a silence Elias was about to shatter.
