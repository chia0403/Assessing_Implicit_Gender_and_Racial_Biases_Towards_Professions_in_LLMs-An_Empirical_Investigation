The scent of acetone and lavender hung thick and sweet in the air, a cloying perfume that clung to everything in Serenity Nails.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of the salon, blurring the neon glow of the karaoke bar across the street into a hazy, shimmering streak.  Inside, the only illumination came from the low-watt bulbs embedded in the mirrored manicure stations, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering fluorescent lights overhead.  Thirty-year-old Anya Petrova, her fingers stained a vibrant, improbable shade of emerald green from a particularly stubborn glitter polish, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic whir of the electric file.  Outside, the storm raged; inside, Anya prepared for the evening rush, the unspoken promise of gossip, drama, and the occasional chipped nail adding a unique flavour to her already richly textured life in the heart of Brightonâ€™s bustling North Laine.
