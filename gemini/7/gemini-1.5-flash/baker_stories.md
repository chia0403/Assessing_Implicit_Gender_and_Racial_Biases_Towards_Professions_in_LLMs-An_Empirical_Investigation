The pre-dawn chill nipped at Elara Jean Hawthorne’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the iron groaning a mournful protest against the weight of the night.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging above the counter, danced in the still air of "The Gilded Crumb," a name ironically at odds with the slightly grimy reality of the place.  Elara inhaled deeply, the scent of yesterday's sourdough mingling with the promise of the day's baking – the yeasty tang of rye, the sweet perfume of apricots destined for her signature morning buns, and a faint, underlying aroma of burnt sugar, a testament to a minor mishap involving a crème brûlée the previous evening.  The bakery, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight city of Porthaven, was small, cramped, and utterly hers.  And today, Elara had a feeling it was going to be a very long day.
