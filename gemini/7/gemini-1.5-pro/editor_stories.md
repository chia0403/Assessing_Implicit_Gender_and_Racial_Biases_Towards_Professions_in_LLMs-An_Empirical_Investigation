Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  Elias, full name Elias Alistair Thorne, pushed his wire-rimmed glasses further up his nose and sighed, a puff of air that ruffled the loose pages of the manuscript balanced precariously on his knees.  His cramped attic room, tucked away in a crooked brownstone on the edge of Greenwich Village, usually felt like a cozy sanctuary. Tonight, however, with the wind howling and the deadlines looming, it felt more like a literary pressure cooker.  Scattered around him were the remnants of a working weekend:  cold coffee in chipped mugs, a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels, and stacks of manuscripts, each one a potential bestseller or a dismal failure, all vying for his attention.  The scent of old paper and printer ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in Elias's otherwise chaotic life.  He was, after all, an editor, and this messy, ink-stained world was his domain.
