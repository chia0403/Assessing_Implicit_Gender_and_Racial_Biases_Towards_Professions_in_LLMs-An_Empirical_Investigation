The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he crossed the cobblestone street, his breath puffing out in white clouds.  Above him, a wrought-iron sign creaked rhythmically, proclaiming "Thorne Family Dentistry - Est. 1888."  The sign, like the building itself, showed its age: paint peeled from the iron curlicues, and the mortar between the bricks of the three-story building had begun to crumble in places.  Port Blossom, Maine, a once-thriving fishing town, had fallen on harder times, and Elias, like many of its residents, felt the chill not just in the air but in the very bones of the place.  Inside, the waiting room was empty save for Mrs. Henderson, the receptionist, who was knitting a vibrant, almost violently cheerful, scarf. The scent of cloves and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that usually comforted Elias, but today, it felt strangely oppressive.  Something was different.  He couldn't put his finger on it, but a knot of unease tightened in his stomach as he unlocked his office door.
