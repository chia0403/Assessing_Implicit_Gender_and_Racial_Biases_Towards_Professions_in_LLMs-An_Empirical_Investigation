The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, releasing a pungent aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He knelt on the scorching shingles of Mrs. Gable's Victorian, the slate-grey roof sloping precariously towards the manicured lawns of Oakhaven. Below, miniature roses bloomed in riotous profusion, oblivious to the shimmering heat haze rising from the asphalt streets of the small, affluent town nestled in the heart of the Connecticut River Valley.  Elias wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the New England summer bearing down with a vengeance. He adjusted his worn leather tool belt, the familiar weight a comfort against the dizzying height, and reached for another shingle, the rhythmic *thwack* of his hammer the only sound breaking the drowsy afternoon quiet.  He had a feeling this particular job, and this particular town, was going to be anything but ordinary.
