The rhythmic clatter of Eleanor Vance's typewriter keys punctuated the otherwise hushed stillness of the pre-dawn office.  Pale light, filtered through the grimy windows of the Bradbury Building, painted elongated diamonds across the dusty oak floor.  Built in 1893, the building, a marvel of wrought iron and brick in its heyday, now exuded a melancholic charm, its once-grand lobby faded and neglected. Eleanor, however, found solace in its quiet decay.  She arrived each morning before the bustling city of Los Angeles fully awoke, preferring the gentle hum of the fluorescent lights and the faint scent of aging paper to the cacophony of traffic and the insistent ring of telephones.  This morning, however, something felt different. A disquieting stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual pre-dawn quiet.
