The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" jingled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the melancholic drizzle painting the cobblestones of Little Puddleton grey.  The year was 1923, and the small, perpetually damp village, nestled in a fold of the Yorkshire Dales, felt as though it had been forgotten by time, and perhaps by God himself. Inside, amidst the scent of bay rum and pipe tobacco, Finnian O'Malley, a man whose ginger moustache seemed to possess more life than the rest of him, meticulously sharpened his straight razor.  The only other sound in the shop was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock, a stoic observer of the slow, unchanging rhythm of life in Little Puddleton.  Finnian glanced at the empty barber chair, a sigh escaping his lips like a deflating balloon.  Business had been slow, slower than a snail in a treacle jar, and the gnawing worry of unpaid bills was beginning to overshadow even the comforting scent of his trade.
