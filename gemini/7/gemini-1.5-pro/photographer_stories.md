The salt spray stung Elsie Aurelia Cartwright's face as she leaned precariously over the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a rust-bucket trawler currently battling the choppy waters off the coast of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands.  Grey cliffs, streaked with white guano, loomed out of the churning Atlantic, their jagged edges softened by a persistent, clinging mist. The air vibrated with the cries of unseen seabirds and the rhythmic thrum of the *Sea Serpent’s* ancient engine. Elsie gripped her camera, a battered Leica M6, its worn leather a testament to years of faithful service. She’d come to Inis Mór chasing the ephemeral light that played across the islands, a light she’d only ever glimpsed in faded postcards and the romantic ramblings of long-dead poets.  She hoped to capture its essence, to bottle it within the confines of a 35mm frame. But so far, the island seemed determined to keep its secrets shrouded in mist and shadowed by an almost perpetual twilight.
