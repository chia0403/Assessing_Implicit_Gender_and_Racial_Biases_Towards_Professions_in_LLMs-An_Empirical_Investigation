The snipping of scissors punctuated the humid air of Clementine’s Coiffure, a small salon tucked between Mrs. Miggins' perpetually dusty antique shop and a laundromat that hummed with the low thrum of a thousand spinning secrets.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon “OPEN” sign into a hazy, flickering invitation. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her mahogany curls pulled back in a severe bun, swept stray hairs from the linoleum floor.  The only other occupant of the salon was a wilting fern in the corner, its fronds drooping dramatically, mirroring Amelia's own weariness as she glanced at the stubbornly empty appointment book on her counter. The scent of perm solution lingered faintly in the air, a bittersweet reminder of busier days.  In the small town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, even hair grew slowly, it seemed.  And on this particularly dreary Tuesday, it felt as if time itself had decided to take a nap.
