The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, tearing at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's already frayed nerves.  Sleek, black ice coated the sidewalks of Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, reflecting the flashing blue and red lights of her squad car like a morbid disco ball. It was 3:17 am, a time when the city held its breath, caught between the exhale of the last revelers and the inhale of the early risers.  Tonight, however, the city wasn't just holding its breath. It was bracing itself.  Chalk outlines glowed eerily under the pulsating lights, marking the spot where the third victim in as many weeks had been found.  The same MO: throat slit, a single black feather placed meticulously on the chest.  Izzyâ€™s breath plumed out in white puffs as she surveyed the scene, her gloved hands shoved deep into the pockets of her thick parka. The feather, illuminated by the harsh glare, seemed to mock her.  This wasn't just a killer. This was an artist, and Lincoln Park was his canvas.
