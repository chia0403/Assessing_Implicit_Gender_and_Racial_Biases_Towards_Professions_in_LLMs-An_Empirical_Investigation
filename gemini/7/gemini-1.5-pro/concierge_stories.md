The rain hammered against the ornate glass doors of the Hotel Magnifique, each drop a tiny, frantic drumbeat against the hushed elegance within.  Inside, bathed in the warm glow of crystal chandeliers,  Evangeline Beatrice Periwinkle, the hotel’s legendary concierge, adjusted the single perfect crimson rose pinned to her lapel.  The Magnifique, nestled high in the Swiss Alps, clung to the mountainside like a jeweled spider, its windows offering breathtaking views of snow-capped peaks and the glacial valley below.  Tonight, however, the storm had drawn a thick, white curtain over the world outside, trapping the hotel's guests within its opulent embrace.  A shiver of anticipation, a familiar prickle, danced on Evangeline’s skin.  Storms like these always brought… interesting guests.
