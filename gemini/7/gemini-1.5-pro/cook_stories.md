The clatter of pots and pans was Evelyn Rose Mayweather's morning symphony. Not the delicate tinkling of wind chimes, oh no. This was a full-blown percussion concerto – the clang of a heavy stockpot against the stove, the rhythmic whoosh of the whisk against copper, the insistent sizzle of onions melting in butter.  Her kitchen, tucked away at the back of the Whispering Pines Inn, a rambling Victorian perched on the edge of the windswept Oregon coast, was a battlefield of delicious chaos. Outside, the grey Pacific churned and roiled, mirroring the nervous flutter in Evelyn’s stomach as she prepared for the annual Fishermen's Feast, a celebration that tested the mettle of even the most seasoned cook.  Salt spray hung thick in the air, carrying with it the scent of brine and pine, a fragrance that usually soothed Evelyn, but today only amplified the pressure.  The Feast was Evelyn's chance to prove, once again, that she was more than just the innkeeper’s daughter – she was a culinary force to be reckoned with.
