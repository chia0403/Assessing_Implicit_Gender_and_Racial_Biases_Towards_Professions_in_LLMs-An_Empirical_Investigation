The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s Tuesday evening.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on a metal cylinder, and the faint chemical tang of the floor cleaner Amy had used earlier.

And tonight, it was her kingdom.  Her only company, aside from the flickering image of Mrs. Higgins, the eternally cheerful weatherwoman on the small television perched above the lottery tickets, was the incessant drumming of the rain and the gnawing feeling that something unusual was about to happen.
