The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Prunella Higginbottom as she wrestled Mrs. Van Derlyn's dustbins to the curb.  Flakes of early snow, fat and wet, clung to her eyelashes and the worn wool of her coat.  Chimney smoke, thick and grey, curled from the rooftops of the grand Victorian houses lining Sycamore Street, painting the already overcast sky a deeper shade of gloom. Here, in the affluent heart of Oakhaven, Connecticut, the lawns were manicured even in the dying days of autumn, the hedges trimmed to geometric perfection, and the air held a crisp scent of pine needles and woodsmoke. Agnes, however, noticed none of the picturesque charm.  Her chapped hands ached, her back throbbed, and the Van Derlyns' miniature dachshund, Princess Fluffybutt III, had just peed, with malicious precision, on the hem of her only good skirt.  This, Agnes thought grimly, was not shaping up to be a good day.
