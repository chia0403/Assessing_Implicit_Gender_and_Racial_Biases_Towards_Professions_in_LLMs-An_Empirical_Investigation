The insistent Florida humidity clung to Amelia Reyes like a damp towel, even inside the sanctuary of “Knots Be Gone,” her small massage therapy practice.  Sunlight, filtered through the blinds, cast zebra stripes across the pale green walls, illuminating framed anatomical charts and a small, bubbling fountain that gurgled a vaguely oceanic tune.  Jasmine incense battled valiantly, but mostly fruitlessly, against the lingering scent of lavender massage oil.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, tapped meticulously manicured nails on her appointment book.  4:00 PM:  Mr. Henderson, deep tissue.  She sighed, rubbing a knot that had taken up permanent residence between her shoulder blades.  Mr. Henderson was a notorious complainer – the temperature was always either too hot or too cold, the pressure too firm or too light, the music too stimulating or too soppy.  Amelia glanced at the clock. 3:55.  Right on schedule, the first strains of Mr. Henderson’s characteristically loud throat clearing echoed from the waiting room.
