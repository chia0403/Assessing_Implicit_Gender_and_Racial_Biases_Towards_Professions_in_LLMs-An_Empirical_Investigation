Rain lashed against the thirty-foot windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading Manhattan skyline into a smudged watercolour of greys and blacks.  Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne III, tapped a manicured nail against his mahogany desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the storm's chaotic drumming.

Tonight, however, the city beyond the glass was a swirling vortex, reflecting the turbulent state of Elias's own mind.  The Dow had closed down 600 points, his biggest client was threatening to pull out, and the faint, cloying scent of lilies from the sympathy bouquet sent by a rival firm (for a deal Elias had snatched from under their noses just last week) only added to the oppressive atmosphere.
