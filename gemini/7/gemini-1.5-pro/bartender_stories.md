The rain hammered against the stained glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, which seemed fitting given the clientele of O’Malley’s.  Smoke hung thick in the air, a blend of cheap tobacco and the lingering scent of desperation.  A single, bare bulb swayed precariously above the bar, casting long, distorted shadows across the room.  Eliza Jane O’Connell, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped down the sticky mahogany surface with a practiced hand.  Her green eyes, usually sparkling with mischief, were tonight clouded with a weariness that went deeper than the late hour. O’Malley’s, nestled between a pawn shop and a boarded-up bookstore in the heart of Dublin's less reputable docklands, wasn't exactly a beacon of hope.  But it was Eliza’s, inherited from her Da, and tonight, like every night, she held vigil, a silent guardian against the encroaching darkness.
