The biting November wind whipped at the edges of Elara Thistlewick's oversized scarf, threatening to snatch her beret along with it.  Grey clouds, heavy with unshed rain, clung low over the rooftops of Montmartre, Paris.  Elara, her gloved fingers clutching a worn leather satchel overflowing with charcoal pencils and sketchbooks, paused on the steep, cobbled incline of Rue Foyatier.  Number 13, the Bateau-Lavoir, loomed before her, a ramshackle wooden structure that seemed to defy gravity and common sense in equal measure. Its peeling paint, a patchwork of greens and blues, only added to its bohemian charm.  This was the heart of the artistic avant-garde, a haven for painters, sculptors, and writers, and Elara, fresh off the boat from London, was determined to make her mark within its hallowed, paint-splattered walls.  The scent of turpentine and Gauloises cigarettes hung heavy in the air, a heady mix that both exhilarated and slightly intimidated her.  Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the creaking door, the sound echoing through the dimly lit hallway like a timid knock on the door of destiny.
