She tugged her cashmere scarf higher, the vibrant peacock blue a stark contrast to the greyscale backdrop of the Edinburgh cityscape.  Rain slicked the cobblestones of Victoria Street, reflecting the warm glow emanating from the antique shops and cozy pubs nestled amongst its brightly painted facades. Eleanor, her breath puffing out in small white clouds, paused in front of number 17, a narrow, four-story townhouse squeezed between a vibrant green bookstore and a shop overflowing with tartan kilts.  This was it: the infamous Balfour House, her latest – and potentially most challenging – interior design project.  Rumoured to be haunted by the melancholic spirit of a Victorian poet, the house had stood empty for decades, its interior a time capsule of faded grandeur and decaying opulence.  Eleanor, however, saw not ghosts, but potential. She saw the bones of something beautiful, waiting to be resurrected.
