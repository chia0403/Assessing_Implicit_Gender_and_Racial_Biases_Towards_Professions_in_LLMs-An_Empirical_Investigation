Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, unforgiving glow on the controlled chaos below.

It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, and the calm before the storm that always seemed to precede a full moon had officially broken.

Amelia braced herself, knowing the next few hours would be a blur of blood, sweat, and desperate prayers.
