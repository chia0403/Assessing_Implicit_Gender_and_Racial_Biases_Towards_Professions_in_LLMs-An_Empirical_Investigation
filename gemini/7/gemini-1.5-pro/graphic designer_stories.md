The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Sprocket" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia "Amy" Reyes's apartment window, painting the edges of her overflowing drafting table an unsettling shade. Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless soundtrack to the all-nighter she was pulling. Amy, her dark curls piled haphazardly on top of her head, squinted at the vibrant vector art blooming on her monitor.  It was 3:17 AM in the gritty, yet vibrantly artistic, Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, a place where struggling artists and trendy coffee shops existed in a fragile, caffeine-fueled symbiosis. The air in Amy's cramped studio apartment, a converted attic space above a vintage clothing store, hung thick with the scent of instant ramen and the sharp tang of marker fumes.  Tomorrow – or rather, later today – was the deadline for the rebranding pitch of "Brew & Bites," a struggling bakery desperate for a millennial makeover, and Amy, despite the gnawing anxiety in her stomach, felt a thrill of excitement pulsing through her tired limbs. This was her chance, her shot at breaking free from the endless cycle of freelance gigs and ramen dinners.
