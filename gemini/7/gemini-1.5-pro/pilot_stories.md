The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s flight suit as she prepped the De Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  The frozen expanse of Great Slave Lake stretched before her, a vast, white canvas cracked with intricate lines of pressure ridges.  Yellowknife, a scattering of lights clinging to the rocky shore, receded quickly as the single propeller sputtered to life, its throaty rumble echoing across the frigid landscape. The sky, a swirling blend of bruised purple and deep indigo, hinted at the rapidly approaching Arctic twilight.  Mia adjusted her headset, the fur trim tickling her cheek, and double-checked the coordinates for the remote diamond mine, a pinprick of civilization hundreds of miles north.  This wasn't just another cargo run. This was a lifeline, delivering vital medical supplies to a miner injured in a cave-in, and Mia, with her years of experience navigating these treacherous skies, was the only pilot willing to risk the flight.
