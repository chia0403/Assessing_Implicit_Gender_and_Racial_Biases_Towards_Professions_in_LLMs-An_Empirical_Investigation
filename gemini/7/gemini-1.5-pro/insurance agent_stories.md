Rain lashed against the window of Archibald "Archie" Finch's cramped office, mimicking the tempest brewing in his gut.

It depicted a vintage 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, now a twisted wreck of chrome and steel, photographed against the backdrop of the infamous Widow's Curve on the rain-slicked Highway 1 outside of the sleepy, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  This wasn't just another fender bender; this was a career-ender.  And possibly, Archie feared, something much worse.
