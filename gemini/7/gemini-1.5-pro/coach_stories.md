The biting November wind whipped across the desolate practice field, carrying the scent of damp earth and the faint echo of shouting.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows of the bleachers onto the churned mud, illuminating only a handful of figures huddled against the cold.  This was Coach Eleanor Vance's domain – the ragged edge of Gridiron High, where dreams of football glory were forged in the crucible of relentless drills and pre-dawn practices. Tonight, however, the usual electric buzz of anticipation was replaced by a heavy, oppressive silence.  Eleanor, her breath clouding the air before her, gripped a crumpled playsheet in her gloved hand, her gaze fixed on the lone player practicing his throws under the unforgiving glare of the lights.  Something was wrong, she could feel it in the very marrow of the old stadium bones.  This wasn't the usual pre-game jitters; this was something colder, something…unsettling.
