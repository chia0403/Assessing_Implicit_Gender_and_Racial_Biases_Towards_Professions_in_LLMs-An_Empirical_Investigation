The flickering neon sign of the "Desert Rose Motel" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow across Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's dusty Ford Taurus.  Wind whipped across the desolate New Mexico landscape, rattling the car windows and whistling a mournful tune through the gaps in the motel's peeling turquoise paint. Esme adjusted her crisp white blouse, a stark contrast to the grime accumulating on the steering wheel, and sighed.  Truth be told, she hadn't pictured the pinnacle of her career as a regional sales rep for "Sunshine Sponges" involving a Tuesday night in a half-empty motel parking lot on the outskirts of Truth or Consequences, population: 6,411 (and dwindling).  But here she was, staring down a lukewarm vending machine coffee and a sales pitch she'd practiced so many times it tasted like stale bread. Tomorrow, she would face the proprietor of the "World's Largest Pistachio," a roadside attraction boasting a nut the size of a small dog, and try to convince him that industrial-sized cleaning sponges were exactly what his dusty monument needed.  Esme took a deep breath of the dry desert air, the scent of sagebrush and despair mingling unpleasantly, and told herself, for the hundredth time, that this was just a stepping stone. A slightly cracked, pistachio-stained stepping stone.
