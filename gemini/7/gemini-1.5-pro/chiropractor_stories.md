The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the backdrop of the howling wind.  His clinic, nestled between a dilapidated laundromat and a perpetually flickering pawn shop on the edge of Bleak Creek, Oregon, wasn't much to look at. The chipped paint on the "Thorne Chiropractic - Spine Aligned, Life Refined" sign out front was a testament to the harsh Oregon winters, and the single flickering fluorescent light in the waiting room cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swaying branches of the lone, gnarled oak tree visible through the grimy window.  Inside, Elias, a man whose youthful optimism had been eroded by years of battling insurance companies and the chronic aches of the town's aging population, stared out at the downpour, a mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in his hands.  It was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays in Bleak Creek were usually quiet. Too quiet.  Elias had a feeling this one was going to be different.
