The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the ticking grandfather clock in the corner.  Each drop seemed to mimic the relentless anxiety that permeated the air of the small, book-lined room.  Located on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, the office was a carefully curated sanctuary, designed to soothe troubled minds.  Rich mahogany furniture, warm lighting, and the faint scent of sandalwood incense usually created a haven of tranquility. But tonight, even the flickering flames of the scented candles seemed to dance nervously in the draft that snaked its way under the ill-fitting window frame. Elias himself, a man whose composure was normally as steady as the old clock's pendulum, felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He glanced at the empty leather armchair opposite his desk, a space usually occupied by the anxieties and confessions of his patients.  Tonight, however, the emptiness felt ominous, a prelude to a storm far more turbulent than the one raging outside.
