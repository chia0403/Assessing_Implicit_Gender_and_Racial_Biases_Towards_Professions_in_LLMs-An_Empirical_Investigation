The sun beat down on the terracotta rooftops of Dubrovnik, baking the ancient stones until they radiated a fierce, dry heat.  Alizandra "Ali" Petrović, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid to escape the oppressive warmth, adjusted the microphone clipped to her linen blouse.  She stood on the polished limestone of the Stradun, the main thoroughfare of the Old City, her gaze sweeping across the expectant faces of the twenty-odd tourists gathered before her.  They hailed from every corner of the globe, clutching water bottles and fanning themselves with brochures depicting the very sights they were about to see. Ali smiled, a practiced, welcoming curve of her lips that didn't quite reach the weariness in her hazel eyes.  This was her tenth tour of the week, and while she loved sharing the history and beauty of her city, the relentless summer sun and endless stream of questions were starting to take their toll. "Dobrodošli u Dubrovnik," she began, her voice carrying a hint of the melodic Croatian accent that charmed her visitors, "Welcome to Dubrovnik, the Pearl of the Adriatic."
