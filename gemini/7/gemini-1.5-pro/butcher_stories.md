The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and something faintly metallic that clung to the cobblestones of Grimsby.  It was a scent Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne's Fine Meats, knew intimately.  His shop, nestled between a fishmonger and a perpetually gloomy pub called The Mariner's Rest, was a beacon of warm, yellow light against the pre-dawn grey. Inside, Elias, a man built like an oak barrel with hands the size of shovels, was already hard at work.  Sawdust dusted his thick apron, and a thin sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead beneath his close-cropped, iron-grey hair.  The rhythmic *thwack* of his cleaver against the thick wooden chopping block echoed out into the deserted street, a prelude to another day in the life of a Grimsby butcher.
