The biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied spirals.  Frost glittered on the browning grass verges, and the weak afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the Victorian terraced houses.  Inside number 27, a burst pipe sang its mournful, dripping song.  Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, her toolbox clanking at her side, surveyed the scene with a sigh.  The leak, judging by the spreading puddle shimmering under the flickering fluorescent kitchen light, was a nasty one.  This was the third call-out to this particular street in as many weeks. Sycamore Street, with its charming façade and aging plumbing, was rapidly becoming Amy's nemesis.
