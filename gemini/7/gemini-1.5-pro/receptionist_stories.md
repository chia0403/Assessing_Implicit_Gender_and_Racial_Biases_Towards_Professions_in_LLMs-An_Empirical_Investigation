The relentless click-clack of Amelia Pearl Hawthorneâ€™s acrylic nails against the worn, beige keys of the ancient computer echoed through the otherwise silent lobby.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the faux-marble floors and potted ficus trees straining towards the single, grimy window. Amelia, perched behind a mahogany reception desk scarred with years of coffee rings and pen marks, sighed dramatically.  The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, once a beacon of Art Deco elegance, now exuded the distinct aroma of stale perfume and mothballs.  Built in 1928, the hotel clung precariously to its fading grandeur in the rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood of New Victoria, its once-opulent facade now chipped and overshadowed by gleaming, modern high-rises.  Tonight, like most nights, Amelia was the sole occupant of this fading relic, save for the occasional scurrying cockroach and the flickering ghost of what the Grand Majestic once was.
