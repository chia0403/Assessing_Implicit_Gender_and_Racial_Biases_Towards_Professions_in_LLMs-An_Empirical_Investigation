The biting wind whipped across the exposed crags of Ben Lomond, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth.  Low clouds, the colour of bruised plums, clung to the mountainside, obscuring the summit.  Below, nestled in a sheltered glen, lay the Highland Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, a collection of mismatched buildings huddled together like gossiping villagers. Inside the largest, a converted barn smelling of hay and antiseptic, Elara Thistlewick, head animal caretaker, wrestled a particularly stubborn bandage onto the wing of a buzzard.  The bird, a magnificent female with a fierce gleam in her golden eye, hissed its displeasure, talons clicking impatiently against Elara’s gloved hand.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumbeat that echoed the anxious thumping of Elara’s heart.  This was the third injured bird of prey admitted that week, and something about it felt… wrong.
