The biting wind whipped down cobbled Corvus Lane, rattling the frosted panes of Elias Thorne's tailor shop and sending shivers down his spine despite the crackling fire in the hearth.  Snow, the colour of bone china, piled against the shop's crooked door, obscuring the faded gold lettering that proclaimed "Thorne & Son, Fine Tailors." Son, of course, had been gone these past five years, a ghostly absence Elias still felt in the too-large shop, in the silence between stitches. Corvus Lane itself, usually bustling with the clamor of the Lower City markets, was strangely subdued this particular midwinter morning. Only the rhythmic clang of a distant blacksmith's hammer broke the eerie stillness, a stark counterpoint to the hushed whisper of falling snow.  Inside, amidst bolts of rich velvet, shimmering silks, and the warm, earthy scent of leather and beeswax, Elias, his fingers gnarled and calloused from years of working needle and thread, hunched over a half-finished commission: a crimson doublet destined for Alderman Thornely's winter ball.  He paused, a frown etching itself into his lined face, a premonition of unease settling like a shroud around him.  Something was amiss.
