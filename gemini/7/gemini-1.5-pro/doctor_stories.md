The surgery, a converted fisherman's cottage, smelled faintly of antiseptic and the lingering scent of the kippers Mrs. Henderson had insisted on gifting him that morning.  The ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner was the only sound besides the ceaseless roar of the sea, a constant reminder of the slow, relentless passage of time in a place where life and death were intimately intertwined with the tides.
