The biting wind whipped off Lake Desolation, tearing at the exposed skin on Silas "Si" Blackwood's cheeks and gnawing at the edges of his thick flannel shirt.  Dawn hadn't yet cracked the iron-grey sky above the Adirondack Mountains, but Si was already halfway up the steep, snow-dusted slope, the scent of pine resin sharp in the frigid air.  His breath plumed out before him in ghostly bursts as he hauled himself higher, his spiked boots digging into the frozen ground.  The forest surrounding him was a cathedral of towering pines and spruces, their snow-laden branches interlocked in a silent, watchful embrace.  Si's destination was a stand of old-growth hemlock marked for felling â€“ giants that had stood for centuries, their wood dense and dark, whispering stories of a time long before the chainsaws and skidders echoed through these ancient woods.  This morning, their silence would be broken.
