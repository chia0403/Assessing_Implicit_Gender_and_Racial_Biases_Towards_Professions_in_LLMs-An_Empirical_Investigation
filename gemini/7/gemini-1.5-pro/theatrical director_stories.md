The faded velvet curtains of the Rialto Theatre in Port Blossom, Oregon, smelled of dust and forgotten dreams.  Rain lashed against the arched windows flanking the stage, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Delilah Iris Thorne. Delilah, a woman whose dramatic flair extended far beyond the proscenium, paced the creaking floorboards, her crimson shawl swirling around her like a disgruntled flamenco dancer. The once-grand auditorium, now populated only by cobwebs and the ghosts of past performances, echoed with the rhythmic click of her heeled boots.  The promised funding for her ambitious, avant-garde production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," set in a post-apocalyptic laundromat, had vanished like a rogue sock in a dryer, leaving Delilah facing the stark reality of a cancelled show and a mountain of debt.  The only light in the cavernous space emanated from a single, bare bulb dangling precariously above the stage, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to mock her predicament.
