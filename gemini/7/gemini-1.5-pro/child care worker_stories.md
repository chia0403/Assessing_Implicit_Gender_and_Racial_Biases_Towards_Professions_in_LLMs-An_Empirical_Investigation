The air in the Bumblebrook Early Learning Center buzzed with the frenetic energy only a room full of toddlers could generate.  Paint smeared tiny hands reached for blocks, while miniature versions of chefs stirred invisible concoctions in plastic bowls.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating a rainbow mural painted by the children last week.  Amidst this controlled chaos moved Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braids bouncing against her shoulders as she navigated the obstacle course of tiny humans.  A rogue giggle erupted from behind a stack of brightly colored cushions, followed by a small, sticky hand reaching out and grabbing Ameliaâ€™s denim-covered knee.  This was her world, a vibrant, messy, and endlessly rewarding kingdom of finger paints, story time, and the occasional temper tantrum.  Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, barely stirred.  But inside Bumblebrook, the day was just getting started.
