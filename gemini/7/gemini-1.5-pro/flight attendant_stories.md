The stale recirculated air hummed a monotonous C-sharp, a familiar lullaby to Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over the Denver International Airport was a bruise-colored canvas streaked with hesitant strokes of lavender. Inside Gate C42, the boarding call for Flight 187 to Honolulu was echoing off the sterile linoleum and the restless shuffling of passengers. Mia, clad in her crisp navy uniform with a sunflower pinned to her lapel, stood at the gate entrance, plastering on a smile that felt increasingly brittle with each passing red-eye.  She'd seen enough bleary-eyed travelers and overstuffed carry-ons in her five years with Pacifica Airlines to last several lifetimes.  This flight, however, felt different. A prickly unease danced at the edges of her awareness, a sensation she couldn't quite place but couldn't ignore.  The air thrummed, not just with the recycled oxygen, but with a subtle, almost imperceptible static charge.
