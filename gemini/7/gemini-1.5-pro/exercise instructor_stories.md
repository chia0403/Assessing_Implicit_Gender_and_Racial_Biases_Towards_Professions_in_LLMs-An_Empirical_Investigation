The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a damp towel.  Palm fronds swayed rhythmically in the pre-dawn breeze, casting long, dancing shadows across the turquoise tiled deck of the opulent "Aqua Vista" condominium complex.  Amy, dressed in vibrant coral leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her headset microphone, a bead of sweat already trickling down her temple.  Twenty brightly coloured yoga mats lay neatly arranged before her, facing the shimmering expanse of the Atlantic Ocean.  The rising sun, a molten orange orb, peeked over the horizon, painting the sky in a breathtaking gradient of pink and gold.  This was Amy's favourite time of day, the quiet before the chaos, the moment before her class of high-powered executives and socialites transformed from bleary-eyed early risers into energized, yoga-posing warriors.  But today, something felt different.  A tension hung in the air, thicker than the humidity, and Amy couldn't shake the feeling that this particular sunrise yoga session was going to be anything but ordinary.
