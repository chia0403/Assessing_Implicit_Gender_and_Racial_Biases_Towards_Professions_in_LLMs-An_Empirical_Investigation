The biting wind whipped across the vast expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Elias Vance's chapped lips and sending dust devils swirling across the cracked asphalt of Highway 395.  The sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the sawtooth peaks of the Sierra Nevada, cast long, distorted shadows across the empty highway.  Elias, his fluorescent orange vest a beacon against the deepening twilight, leaned against the tailgate of his Caltrans truck, the rumble of its idling engine a low hum in the stillness.  A half-eaten sandwich wrapped in wax paper sat beside him, forgotten. His focus was fixed on the shimmering heat haze rising from the asphalt a mile down the road, where the lonely ribbon of highway disappeared into the heart of the desert. Something out there – something just beyond his vision – felt wrong.
