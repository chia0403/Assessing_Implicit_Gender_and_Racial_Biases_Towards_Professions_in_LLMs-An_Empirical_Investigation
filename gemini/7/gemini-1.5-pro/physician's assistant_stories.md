The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital, the hem of her long white coat snapping against her ankles.  Gargoyles perched on the aging brick building leered down at her, their granite faces slick with rain. The hospital, a gothic behemoth nestled in the heart of the historically preserved, yet increasingly gentrified, Greenwich Village, felt more like a medieval fortress than a place of healing tonight. Amelia pulled her woolen scarf tighter, the damp chill seeping through her thin gloves. The illuminated clock tower above the main entrance chimed eleven times, each clang a mournful echo in the deserted courtyard.  She was late. Again. Dr. Klein wouldn't be pleased. But the late-night clinic at St. Jude’s was always overflowing with a mix of ailments and anxieties, and tonight had been no exception – a suspected broken wrist from a skateboarding mishap, a persistent cough that wouldn't quit, and a particularly harrowing case of what Amelia suspected might be appendicitis.
