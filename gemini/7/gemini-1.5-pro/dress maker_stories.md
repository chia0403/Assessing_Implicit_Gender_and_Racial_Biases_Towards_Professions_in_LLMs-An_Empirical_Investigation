The gas lamps of Swanston Street hissed and spat, casting flickering puddles of orange light onto the rain-slicked cobblestones of Melbourne, 1888.  Inside her small atelier, nestled between a butcher shop and a purveyor of exotic teas,  Elara Jane Thistlewick pricked her finger for the tenth time that evening. A tiny bead of blood welled up, staining the ivory silk she was painstakingly draping over a dress form.  "Blast it all," she muttered, sucking the wound. The scent of lavender and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort against the rising damp from the street below. Her shop, "Thistle & Thread," was a haven of silks, satins, and lace, a riot of colour and texture in the otherwise grey and practical city. Tonight, however, the vibrant hues seemed to mock Elara’s exhaustion.  The Melbourne Cup was a mere week away, and the demands of the city’s fashionable elite were relentless.
