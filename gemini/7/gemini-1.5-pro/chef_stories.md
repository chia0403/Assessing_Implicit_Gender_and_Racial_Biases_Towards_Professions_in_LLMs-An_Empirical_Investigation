The clatter of aluminum stockpots, the rhythmic thump of a meat cleaver, and the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil formed the morning symphony of Rosalie "Rosie" Marchand's life.  Her small bistro, "Le Papillon Bleu," nestled between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually overflowing flower stall in the cobbled heart of Vieux Lyon, was just beginning to awaken.  October sunlight, pale and buttery, slanted through the paned windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above copper pots hanging from the low, beamed ceiling.  Outside, the crisp air carried the scent of roasting chestnuts and the distant rush of the Saône River, a constant, soothing presence in the ancient city.  Rosie, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, wiped a smudge of flour from her cheek with the back of her hand, her hazel eyes surveying her domain with a mixture of exhaustion and fierce satisfaction. Today was the first day of the annual Fête des Lumières, and Rosie, along with the rest of Lyon, was preparing for a deluge of hungry revelers.
