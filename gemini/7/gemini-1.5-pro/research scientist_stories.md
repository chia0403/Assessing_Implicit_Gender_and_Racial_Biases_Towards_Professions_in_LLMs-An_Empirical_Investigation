The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Aris Thorne's auburn braid across his face as he adjusted the thermal imaging camera mounted on the drone.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with iridescent green aurora, cast an eerie glow over the desolate landscape.  It was 2:17 am at the McMurdo Stationâ€™s remote outpost, designated "Icehaven," a prefabricated research lab clinging precariously to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  Inside, the constant hum of the life support systems fought a losing battle against the encroaching silence of the vast frozen wilderness. Aris, bundled in layers that made him resemble a Michelin Man, squinted at the drone's feed, his breath fogging the small monitor.  He was searching for something far stranger than penguins or icebergs. He was hunting for a signal, a faint energy signature buried deep beneath the ice, a signature that defied all known laws of physics.
