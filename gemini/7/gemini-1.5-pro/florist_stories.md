The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic drizzle painting the cobblestone streets of Little Puddleton grey.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour and fragrance, Elsie Clementine Hawthorne hummed along to a scratchy Billie Holiday record, meticulously arranging a cascade of sapphire-blue delphiniums.  Rain lashed against the large, paned windows, blurring the view of the sleepy village square beyond.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the faintest hint of cinnamon from the bakery across the street.  It was a Tuesday, usually quiet, but Elsie had a feeling today would be different.  A shiver ran down her spine, a prickle of anticipation that had nothing to do with the chill in the air.
