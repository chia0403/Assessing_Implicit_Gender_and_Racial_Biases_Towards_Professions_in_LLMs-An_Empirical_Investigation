The fluorescent lights of the Wetherby & Blake law offices hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the click-clack of keyboards and the hushed murmur of phone conversations. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a paralegal with a penchant for true crime podcasts and an aversion to lukewarm coffee, stared out the grime-streaked window at the relentless Chicago drizzle.
