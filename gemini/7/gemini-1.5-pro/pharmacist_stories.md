The rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of the pestle against the mortar, grinding cardamom pods into fragrant dust, was the soundtrack to Elias Thorne’s life. The Apothecary and Dispensary of Elias Thorne occupied a snug, ivy-choked building on the cobbled corner of Finch Street and Nightingale Lane in the perpetually autumnal town of Hollow Creek.  A place where the mist clung to the gas lamps like a shroud and the wind carried whispers of woodsmoke and something else, something faintly sweet and unsettling, from the direction of the Whispering Woods that bordered the town’s eastern edge.  The year was 1902, and Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the Derbyshire Dales, felt both utterly disconnected from and intensely aware of the burgeoning modernity stirring in the world beyond its shrouded borders. Elias, with his neatly trimmed beard, wire-rimmed spectacles, and the faint scent of lavender clinging to his starched white coat, was a pillar of this peculiar little community. He dispensed remedies for everything from chilblains to heartbreak, although the latter, he admitted with a sigh, was proving far more resistant to his concoctions.
