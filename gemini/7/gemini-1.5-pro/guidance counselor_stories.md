The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as a guidance counselor. Her office, Room 117, was a carefully curated haven against the chaos of teenage life.  Sunlight, strained through the grimy window overlooking the student parking lot, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the worn, but comfortable, floral armchair across from her desk.  A framed print of Van Goghâ€™s sunflowers hung slightly askew on the wall, a testament to a recent tremor that had rattled the San Francisco peninsula.  It was a Monday morning in early October, the air thick with the scent of impending rain and the faint, metallic tang of anxiety radiating from the students shuffling past her door. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a loose bun, sipped lukewarm tea from a chipped mug, her gaze fixed on the overflowing in-box, a paper Everest threatening to topple and bury her alive. This Monday, however, felt different.  A premonition, perhaps, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with overflowing paperwork and everything to do with the quiet knock that now echoed in the small room.
