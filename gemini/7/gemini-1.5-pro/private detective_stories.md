Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia "Mia" Cortez's office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing headache pounding behind her eyes.  The neon sign outside, proclaiming "Cortez Investigations - Discretion Guaranteed," flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the water-stained walls. Her office, nestled between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on a forgotten stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles, usually held a certain shabby charm. Tonight, it just felt damp and depressing.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, thick enough to choke on. It was 11:37 pm on a Tuesday, the kind of night that made Mia question her life choices.  A crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes lay beside a half-empty bottle of cheap bourbon on her desk, the only company aside from a dusty oscillating fan that wheezed rhythmically in the corner.  The sudden, sharp jangle of the telephone pierced the monotonous rhythm of the rain, making her jump.
