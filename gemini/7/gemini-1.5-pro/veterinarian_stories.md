The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Alistair Finchley, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the loose edges of his tweed overcoat.  He hunched deeper into the collar, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Lamplight spilled from the windows of the Darrowby Veterinary Clinic, casting warm rectangles against the deepening twilight. The clinic, a converted stone cottage nestled on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales, looked impossibly cozy from the outside, a stark contrast to the bleak, windswept landscape surrounding it. Inside, the faint bleating of a lamb mixed with the crackling of the fire Alistair had stoked earlier.  He paused on the flagstone path, his worn leather satchel heavy in his hand, and looked up at the swirling, gunmetal sky.  Winter had arrived in the Dales, and with it, the long nights and the unpredictable emergencies that tested a rural vet's skill and resilience.
