The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped inside the classroom, punctuated the otherwise peaceful quiet of Ms. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten room.  Sunbeams, filtered through the paper sunflowers clinging to the large window, painted dappled patterns across the miniature tables and chairs.  Tiny, brightly colored plastic cubbies lined the far wall, each adorned with a child’s hand-drawn self-portrait taped haphazardly above the name label. The air smelled faintly of Elmer’s glue and the lingering ghost of apple juice.  Outside, in the small, fenced playground of Maplewood Elementary, the swing set swayed gently in the early morning breeze, awaiting the arrival of its boisterous occupants.  It was 7:15 am, a full hour and fifteen minutes before Ms. Vance’s rambunctious kindergarten class would descend upon her, transforming the serene space into a whirlwind of glitter, giggles, and the occasional tantrum.  But for now, the only sound was the incessant chirping and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Ms. Vance's pencil against her lesson plan book as she brainstormed ways to incorporate the unexpected classroom visitor into her "Wonderful World of Insects" unit.
