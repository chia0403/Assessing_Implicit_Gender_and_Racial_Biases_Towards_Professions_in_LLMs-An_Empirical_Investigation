The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Milly” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her cheek as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning rose bushes.  Frost glittered on the browned leaves, clinging like stubborn memories of summer’s glory. Milly tucked the stray braid behind her ear, her breath puffing out white clouds that dispersed quickly in the sharp air.  Her worn leather gloves, usually stained green with chlorophyll, were dusted with a fine layer of frost.  The Periwinkle estate, nestled in the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, was usually a riot of color, even in late autumn.  But this year, a cruel, early frost had swept through the valley, leaving behind a landscape of muted browns and icy greys.  Milly, head gardener and owner of Hawthorne Landscaping, had the unenviable task of assessing the damage and planning for a spring resurrection. The grand, Tudor-style house loomed behind her, its mullioned windows reflecting the steely grey sky.  It looked down upon the ravaged gardens like a disapproving dowager, adding to the weight already settling on Milly’s shoulders.
