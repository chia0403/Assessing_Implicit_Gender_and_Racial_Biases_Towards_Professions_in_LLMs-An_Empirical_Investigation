The frosted glass of Amelia Hayes's office, etched with the discreet legend "A. Hayes, Esq.," offered a distorted, shimmering view of the Chicago skyline. Forty stories below, the wind whipped off Lake Michigan, sending flurries of gritty snow swirling across the polished black granite of Millennium Park.  Inside, the air was still and hushed, warmed by the crackling fire in the hearth and the low hum of the climate control.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a severe knot, paced restlessly in front of the fire, the plush Persian rug muffling the click of her Louboutins.  A half-empty glass of amber liquid sat on the inlaid rosewood desk, beside a thick file embossed with the words "Kendrick Estate - Confidential." It was 5:17 am, and the predawn light, a pale, watery grey, was just beginning to bleed through the gaps in the towering skyscrapers.  This was the hour Amelia did her best thinking, the hour when the city held its breath before the chaos of another day began.  But this morning, even the quiet couldn't penetrate the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  Something about the Kendrick case feltâ€¦ wrong.
