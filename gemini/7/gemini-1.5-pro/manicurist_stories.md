The humid Miami air, thick with the scent of hibiscus and salt, clung to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez like a second skin.  Her small salon, "Amy's Nail Nook," nestled between a laundromat and a bodega on Calle Ocho, pulsed with the rhythmic whir of a nail drill.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty storefront window, glinted off rows of brightly coloured polish bottles, transforming them into tiny glass jewels. It was a Tuesday afternoon, usually slow, but today every plush pedicure chair was occupied.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, expertly shaped Mrs. Garcia’s nails with a sapphire-tipped file, her mind already racing through the mountain of bills waiting for her at home. Outside, the rumble of a passing lowrider vibrated through the floor, a constant reminder of the vibrant, yet often unforgiving, city that held her captive and her dreams.
