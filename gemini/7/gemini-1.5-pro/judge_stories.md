The mahogany desk, polished to a gleam that rivaled Judge Amelia Iris Thorne's perfectly coiffed silver hair, reflected the weak November sun filtering through the gothic windows of her chambers.  Dust motes danced in the anemic light, illuminating the spines of leather-bound law books lining the walls.  Charleston, South Carolina, sweltered beneath an unseasonable warmth, the humid air thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant, rhythmic clang of a trolley.  Amelia, however, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.  The file on her desk, thick with accusations and counter-accusations, held the fate of a prominent family, a family she had known her entire life, and it was her duty to decide their future. The weight of it pressed down on her like the humidity, making it difficult to breathe.  Outside, church bells chimed, their mournful tone a stark contrast to the cheerful chatter drifting in from the street below. It was Sunday, a day for reflection and peace.  But for Amelia, there would be no peace until this case was resolved.
