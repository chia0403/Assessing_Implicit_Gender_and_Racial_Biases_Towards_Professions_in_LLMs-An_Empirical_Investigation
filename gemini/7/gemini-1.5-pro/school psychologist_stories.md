The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the Northwood Elementary School parking lot.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and bruised plums, swirled around her ankles like tiny, frantic dancers. Above her, the sky, a vast canvas of gunmetal grey, threatened snow.  Northwood Elementary, a squat brick building with mismatched, grime-streaked windows, hunched against the desolate landscape like a grumpy badger. Inside, Eleanor knew, the fluorescent lights buzzed with a relentless, sterile hum, and the air hung thick with the mingled scents of crayon wax, stale pizza, and that indefinable, vaguely antiseptic aroma peculiar to elementary schools.  Today, however, a different kind of tension permeated the usual Monday morning chaos. A tension Eleanor could practically taste on the back of her tongue, bitter and metallic like old pennies.  It had started with a phone call from Principal Davies just before dawn, a call laced with a quiet urgency Eleanor hadn't heard in her five years at Northwood. Something was wrong, and it wasn't just the usual Monday morning blues.
