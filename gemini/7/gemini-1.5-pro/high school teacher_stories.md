Outside, the skeletal branches of a towering oak clawed at the grey sky above Ashwood High, a brick behemoth that had seen better days.  Inside room 214, flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rows of desks, most of them empty.  It was Friday afternoon, the last period of the week, and even the most dedicated students were already halfway out the door in spirit, if not in body.

She was trying to decipher the sprawling scrawl of Kevin Miller's latest attempt at Shakespearean analysis, a task that proved as challenging as deciphering hieroglyphics.  The bell was due to ring any minute, releasing her and her handful of remaining students into the weekend, but a nagging sense of unease kept her tethered to her seat, a feeling she couldn't quite put her finger on.
