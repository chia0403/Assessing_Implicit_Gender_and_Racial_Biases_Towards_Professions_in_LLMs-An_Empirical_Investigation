The biting wind whipped Amelia "Millie" Reyes's trench coat around her legs, plastering stray strands of dark hair across her already chapped lips.  February in Barrow, Alaska, was less a season and more a sustained act of aggression by nature. The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, threatened another blizzard.  Millie pulled her scarf tighter, the coarse wool scratching against her skin, a small price to pay for a bit of warmth against the -20 degree chill.  She stood on the edge of the frozen Chukchi Sea, the wind howling like a banshee, carrying with it the faint, metallic tang of salt and something else... something almostâ€¦ rotten.  The small Inuk village of Nuvuk, clinging precariously to the edge of the rapidly eroding coastline, huddled like a dark smudge against the fading light. Millie was here for a story on climate change, on the disappearing permafrost and the struggling community it supported, but the unsettling smell, coupled with the unnerving silence emanating from the village, told her this story was about to become something much more.
