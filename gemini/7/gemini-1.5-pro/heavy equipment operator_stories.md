The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Bernadette “Bernie” Kowalski’s cheeks even through the layers of fleece and thermal wear.  Sunrise painted the snow-covered peaks of the Brooks Range a soft apricot, a stark contrast to the steel-grey sky overhead.  Bernie, perched high in the cab of her D11T dozer, exhaled, a puff of white vapor momentarily obscuring her view of the pipeline access road snaking its way across the frozen landscape.  The behemoth beneath her grumbled and vibrated, a familiar rhythm that had become the soundtrack to her life these past five years.  Today, however, the rhythm felt different, laced with a tension Bernie couldn't quite place.  The radio crackled to life, a dispatch voice cutting through the silence, “Kowalski, you read me?”  Bernie keyed the mic. “Loud and clear, Dispatch.”  The voice continued, “We’ve got a situation developing down near Mile Marker 147. Possible… anomaly.  Need you on-site ASAP.”
