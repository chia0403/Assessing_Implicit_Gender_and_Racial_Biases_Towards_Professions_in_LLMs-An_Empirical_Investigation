The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, her poodle, Princess, tucked under one arm like a furry, shivering handbag.  Rain lashed against the large window, blurring the already fading October afternoon light into a hazy grey. Inside, the warm, chamomile-scented air hummed with the low thrum of a hairdryer.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her auburn braid draped over her shoulder like a silken rope, expertly wielded a pair of thinning shears, sculpting layers into the thick, dark hair of a young woman whose eyes were glued to her phone.  Shear Perfection, nestled between a laundromat and a slightly dubious-looking antique shop in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary, her canvas, her kingdom of curls and coiffures.  This Tuesday, however, like most Tuesdays in Port Blossom, was proving distinctly un-magical.
