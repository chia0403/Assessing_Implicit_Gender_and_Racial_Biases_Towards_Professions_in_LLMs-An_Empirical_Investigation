The chipped porcelain owl perched atop the Dewey Decimal System shelf seemed to stare judgmentally at Amelia Peabody, Librarian Extraordinaire.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the forgotten corner of the City of Lost Books.  This wasnâ€™t the grand, sweeping reading room of the central library, but a small, cramped annex, filled with shelves groaning under the weight of centuries of unread tales.  Amelia, a woman whose spectacles magnified both her wisdom and her slight weariness, traced the faded inscription on a leather-bound volume.  "Chronicles of the Whispering Woods," it read.  A shiver, more of anticipation than cold, snaked down her spine.  She had been drawn to this particular collection, a seemingly insignificant portion of the library's vast archives, by a cryptic note tucked inside a forgotten issue of the *Bibliophile's Bulletin*.  The note, penned in elegant, faded ink, spoke of a hidden chamber, a place where stories could come alive, a place within the very walls of the City of Lost Books.
