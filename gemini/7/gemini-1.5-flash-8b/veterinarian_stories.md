The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  Dust devils, stirred up by the relentless gale, danced across the cracked earth of the desolate plains bordering the Mojave Desert.  The year was 2047, and the once-lush grasslands, now a patchwork of barren scrub and sun-baked earth, held a cruel beauty.  Amelia Hayes, DVM, the sole veterinarian for the sprawling, isolated ranching community of Sunstone, shivered, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  A lone coyote, its fur matted and eyes hollow, huddled beneath the skeletal remains of a tumbleweed, its whimpers barely audible above the howling wind.  This was her world now â€“ a world of harsh beauty, desperate animals, and dwindling resources.  The rusted sign, barely clinging to its post, read "Sunstone Veterinary Services."  Today, the silence was more unnerving than the storm.
