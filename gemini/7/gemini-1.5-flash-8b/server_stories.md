The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam, painting her already sweat-stained apron in a lurid hue.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale coffee, burnt popcorn, and desperation.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was a particularly potent brew of all three.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless drumming of her heart against her ribs.  The tiny diner, a relic of a bygone era, felt claustrophobic in the downpour.  Tables were scattered like discarded dominoes, each one a silent testament to the night's patrons â€“  a lonely businessman hunched over a lukewarm cup, a couple huddled over whispered secrets, and a gaggle of teenagers glued to their phones, oblivious to the storm raging both inside and out. Sparky, with her perpetually messy braid and eyes that held the weariness of a seasoned veteran, was the glue holding the whole place together.
