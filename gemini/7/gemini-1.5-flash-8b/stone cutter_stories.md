The biting wind whipped Elara Stonehand's ragged cloak around her as she surveyed the quarry.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled through the jagged peaks of the Grey Peaks, illuminating the scarred face of Mount Ash.  Dust motes danced in the air, swirling around the chipped fragments of granite, remnants of a thousand past carvings, and the rough-hewn blocks awaiting Elara's touch.  This was the heart of the Whispering Valley, a place where whispers of forgotten gods echoed in the stone and the very air seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next chisel stroke.  Elara, whose fingers, hardened and calloused from years of relentless labour, were stained a perpetual shade of ochre, felt the familiar ache in her muscles, the constant thrumming in her bones.  She was a stone-cutter, a sculptor of whispers, a weaver of ancient narratives into the unyielding rock of Mount Ash.
