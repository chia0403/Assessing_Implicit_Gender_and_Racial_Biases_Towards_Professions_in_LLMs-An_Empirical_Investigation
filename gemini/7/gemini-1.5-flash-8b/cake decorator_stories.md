The aroma of buttercream frosting, sugared almonds, and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a fragrant cloud swirling around Amelia Nightingale, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of spun sugar and hands that moved with the precision of a hummingbird's wings.  Her workshop, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the burgeoning artisan district of Old Oak, was a kaleidoscope of colour and creativity.  Stacks of pristine white fondant sheets, like snowy tapestries, lay beside bowls overflowing with vibrant marzipan roses and sculpted chocolate figures.  The rhythmic clatter of her tools – a flurry of spatulas, piping bags, and rolling pins – filled the space, a symphony only she could appreciate.  Today, a particularly demanding order awaited her: a five-tiered wedding cake for the esteemed Lord Ashworth, a man whose reputation for meticulous detail matched Amelia's own.  Each layer, sculpted to resemble a cascading waterfall of sugared blossoms, demanded flawless execution.  The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second a pressure cooker building in Amelia's chest.  She needed to be perfect.
