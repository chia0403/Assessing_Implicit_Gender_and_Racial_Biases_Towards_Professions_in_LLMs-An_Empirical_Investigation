The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  Once, a riot of color and fragrant blossoms, it now resembled a battlefield after a cruel frost.  The overgrown hedges, once manicured into perfect geometric shapes, now clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers.  This was Mr. Finch's estate, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the mist-shrouded valley of Oakhaven.  Amelia, a landscaper with fingers that knew the secrets of every blade of grass and the language of every blooming rose, felt a familiar knot of frustration tighten in her chest.  Mr. Finch, a notoriously demanding client with a penchant for the extravagant and a disdain for compromise, had once again subjected her artistry to his whims.  This time, his "vision" had resulted in a chaotic, almost hostile landscape, a testament to his inability to see the beauty in simplicity.  But Amelia, though deeply frustrated, had a reputation to uphold.  A reputation built on meticulous planning, unwavering dedication, and the rare ability to coax life from even the most desolate plots.  She would restore the garden to its former glory, even if it meant another sleepless night and a bruised ego.
