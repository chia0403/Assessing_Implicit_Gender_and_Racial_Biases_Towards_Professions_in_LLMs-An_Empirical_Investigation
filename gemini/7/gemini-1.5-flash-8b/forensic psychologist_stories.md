Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s head.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and something else, something acrid and metallic that clung to the back of her throat.  She traced the outline of a smudged bloodstain on the peeling paint with a gloved finger.  The warehouse, a forgotten relic of a bygone industrial era, had been transformed into a makeshift crime scene – a stark and unsettling tableau of shattered glass, twisted metal, and the chilling silence of death.

Setting:  The rusted, rain-soaked warehouse, a forgotten corner of the industrial district of Blackwood, nestled between the towering chimneys of the long-dormant steelworks and the stark, grey expanse of the riverfront.  The warehouse, once teeming with machinery, now lay silent and desolate, its skeletal structure a monument to forgotten purpose.  Moonlight, fractured by the torrential rain, illuminated only small pockets of the interior, revealing a chaotic scene. The humid air, heavy with the stench of decay, pressed down on the few figures working within the space, an almost palpable sense of foreboding pervading the atmosphere.
