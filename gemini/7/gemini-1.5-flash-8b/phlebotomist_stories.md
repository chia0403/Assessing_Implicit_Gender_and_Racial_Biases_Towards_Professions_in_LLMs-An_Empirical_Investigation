The fluorescent hum of the lab vibrated through Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's shoes, a constant, low thrum that seemed to echo the relentless rhythm of her workday.  The sterile white walls of the blood donation center at the Mercy Hospital, stark and antiseptic, reflected the fluorescent lights, creating a dizzying, almost surreal landscape.  Empty blood bags, each one a small, pale void, lined the shelves like silent, expectant mourners.  Amy, a phlebotomist with three years under her belt, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  It was almost 2 PM, and the afternoon lull had descended, broken only by the hushed whispers of nurses and the rhythmic *thwop* of the automated blood-sorting machine.  A nagging unease, a premonition of the day's inevitable tragedies, clung to the air like the lingering scent of antiseptic.
