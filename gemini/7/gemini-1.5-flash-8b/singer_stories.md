The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Glimmer" cast an oily sheen on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Market Square.  The air, thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts and stale beer, hung heavy in the damp November night.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, cramped music venue tucked behind the marketplace stalls, a rhythmic counterpoint to the thumping bass and soaring vocals emanating from within.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, his sanctuary, his stage.

Elias Thorne, a baritone whose voice could melt glaciers and mend broken hearts, stood backstage, a whirlwind of nervous energy.  His crimson velvet jacket, usually a symbol of controlled charisma, was now crumpled and damp.  He adjusted the microphone stand, the familiar metal cold against his palm.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, he would finally perform at the Golden Glimmer, a venue that had previously only hosted up-and-coming talent, a stepping stone for stars to ascend to greatness.  This time, Elias hoped, he would leave his own mark.
