Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia "Em" Hayes's chest.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and damp earth, a scent that clung to the small, unassuming physiotherapy practice nestled on the outskirts of Blackwood.  Blackwood, a town swallowed by the encroaching shadows of the ever-expanding city, a place where the past clung stubbornly to the present, leaving a layer of unspoken hardship on everything.  Em, a physical therapist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a spirit that mirrored the resilience of the ancient oaks clinging to the hillsides surrounding the town, knew this feeling all too well.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of rehabilitation was replaced by a palpable tension, a low-level anxiety that seemed to vibrate in the very walls of the clinic.  A new patient, a young man named Liam O'Connell, had arrived, and whispers followed him like the unwelcome rain.  Liam was the son of a renowned Blackwood carpenter, a man whose life had been tragically cut short in a workplace accident years ago.  The local community still held the family in its sorrowful gaze.  Em felt the weight of that history settling on her shoulders, a responsibility as heavy as the lead in the weights she used to rehabilitate her patients.  The clinicâ€™s worn, floral wallpaper, once a beacon of calming colour, felt somehow strained under the pressure of it all.
