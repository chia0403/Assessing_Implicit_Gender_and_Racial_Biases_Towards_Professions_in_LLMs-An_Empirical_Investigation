The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Nightingale's scarlet coat around her as she trudged across the frozen expanse of Blackwood Manor's sprawling grounds.  Snow, the consistency of fine glass, crunched under her boots, each step echoing eerily in the vast silence.  The manor itself, a looming silhouette against the bruised twilight sky, seemed to press in on her, its many dark windows like vacant eyes staring out into the desolate landscape.  Em, Animal Caretaker of Blackwood Manor, shivered not just from the cold, but from a creeping unease that had settled in her gut like a lead weight.  It had been a week since the strange occurrences began.

Setting:

Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched atop a windswept hill overlooking a valley choked by ancient, gnarled trees. The manor, once a prestigious estate, had fallen into a state of quiet decay, its grandeur now tinged with a chilling melancholy.  Ivy clawed at the stonework, obscuring many of the windows.  Broken, skeletal branches scraped against the slate roofs, and the air crackled with a palpable sense of foreboding.  The grounds were vast and wild, a maze of overgrown paths and hidden glades, where the murmur of the wind sounded like whispers.  A frozen river wound its way through the property, its surface a mirror reflecting the bleak, star-dusted sky. Within the manor's shadowed walls lived a menagerie of unusual and exotic creatures â€“ the care of which fell entirely upon Em.
