The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School guidance office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Sterling's day.  Paperclips clattered, staplers clicked, and the muffled sounds of teenagers arguing drifted in through the open doorway, a constant, low-level storm brewing just beyond her carefully curated cubicle.  Amy, a school psychologist with a perpetual frown etched into her brow that she diligently fought against with a practiced smile, stared at the overflowing stack of student referrals.  Each file represented a unique struggle, a hidden wound, a fractured piece of a young life.  This particular Monday felt heavier than usual.  The scent of stale coffee and angst mingled in the air, a potent cocktail of early-morning stress and adolescent rebellion.  The school year was barely three weeks old, and already, the cracks were showing. The stark, beige walls seemed to absorb the anxiety, mirroring the unspoken burdens carried by the students she worked with.  A small, framed poster depicting a tangled knot of intertwined threads hung on the wall, a silent reminder of the complex web of emotions and experiences that Amy, and the students, navigated each day.
