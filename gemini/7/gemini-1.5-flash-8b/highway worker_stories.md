The biting wind, a relentless, icy fist, whipped across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming plains.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grey, danced erratically across the cracked earth, swirling around the rusted, half-buried sign that proclaimed the lone, two-lane highway: US-20, "The Heart of the Rockies."  This was Amelia "May" Cartwright's domain, or at least the portion stretching from mile marker 314 to 327.  May Cartwright, a highway worker for the Wyoming Department of Transportation, considered herself a guardian of this barren beauty, a protector of the asphalt ribbons that stitched together the scattered settlements and isolated ranches.  Today, however, the guardian felt more like a prisoner.  The relentless snow had transformed the landscape into a treacherous, white labyrinth, and the highway, usually a vibrant artery of life, was now a frozen, silent tomb.
