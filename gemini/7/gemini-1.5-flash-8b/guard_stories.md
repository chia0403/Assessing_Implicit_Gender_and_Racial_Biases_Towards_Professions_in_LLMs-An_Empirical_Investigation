The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper, clawed at the exposed skin of Sergeant Alistair Blackwood.  He shivered, not from cold alone, but from the pervasive, unsettling feeling of being watched.  The stone walls of the Citadel, etched with centuries of history, seemed to press in around him, their shadows lengthening with the approaching dusk.  He adjusted the worn leather straps of his armour, the familiar weight a comforting anchor in this sea of unease.

The Citadel, perched atop the jagged peaks of the Whisperwind Mountains, was a fortress of ancient design, its crenellations a stark silhouette against the bruised violet sky.  Towering above the surrounding landscape, it was a monument to forgotten kings and untold stories.  Within its labyrinthine corridors, secrets whispered on the wind and rumours festered in the echoing chambers.  Alistair, a veteran of countless patrols and skirmishes, knew the Citadel's every shadowed alcove and hidden passage, yet tonight, the familiar felt alien. The air itself hummed with an unspoken dread, a palpable energy that prickled the backs of his neck.  He was the last sentinel on the western rampart, his duty a lonely vigil against the unknown.
