Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Detective Inspector Amelia Hayes's head.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and stale coffee, hung heavy in the small, windowless room.  Amelia, a probation officer with the Metropolitan Police, stared at the chipped Form 107, the latest in a seemingly endless stream of paperwork detailing the transgressions of her latest caseload.  Across the cluttered desk, a half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned, a testament to the gnawing emptiness that settled in her stomach as often as the relentless rain outside.  The office, tucked away on a back street in the seedy heart of London's East End, felt as isolating as the cases themselves.  Each chipped mug and faded poster seemed to hold a silent judgment of her failures, and tonight, the failures felt particularly crushing.  Her latest charge, a young man named Leo Santiago, had disappeared.  And Amelia knew, with a sinking certainty that mirrored the sinking city outside, that the reasons were far more sinister than any misplaced paperwork.
