He hunched deeper into his threadbare cloak, the crimson lining a faded echo of the vibrant colours he once used to craft.  The year was 1888, and London, though pulsating with the restless energy of a burgeoning metropolis, held a chilling dampness in its heart.  Elias's workshop, tucked away on a narrow alley, smelled not of fine silks and fragrant lavender, but of damp wool and the lingering scent of old leather.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating intricate patterns pinned to a worn table – designs for garments he would never again create.  The once-bustling room, echoing with the rhythmic clack of his needles and the hushed murmur of his apprentices, now felt eerily quiet.  Elias’s last order had been delivered a week ago, a simple mourning dress for a lady who had left the world far too soon.  And with that, the business, and the joy of creation, had slipped away like the afternoon fog.
