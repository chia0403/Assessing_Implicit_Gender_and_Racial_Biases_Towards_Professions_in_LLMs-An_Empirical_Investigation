The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the frosted panes of "The Cleaver's Cut," a butcher shop tucked away on a cobbled street in the shadowed heart of Blackwood.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, blanketed the alleyways, turning the city into a sculpted canvas of white.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of aged spices, mingled with the pungent aroma of freshly cut meat.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, a man whose calloused hands seemed to whisper the stories of the livestock they'd touched.  Barty, a butcher of exceptional skill and a soul etched with the quiet wisdom of the countryside, stared intently at the glistening slab of prime sirloin.  He traced the intricate marbling with a finger, his gaze reflecting the subtle shift in light that danced across the surface.  Tonight, a particular chill hung in the air, not just from the blizzard outside, but also from a sense of unease that settled over him like a premature frost.  The small shop, usually humming with the clatter of knives and the low murmur of customers, was strangely quiet.
