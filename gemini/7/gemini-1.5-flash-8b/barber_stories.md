The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, ochre yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soaps, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's anxious face.  Sunlight, fractured and weak through the grime-coated windowpanes, painted long shadows across the cluttered barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the air, stirred by the rhythmic whir of the antique barber chair, its leather worn thin in places, whispering tales of countless haircuts.  This was Barty's sanctuary, his battlefield, and, more often than not, his prison.  The small shop, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the dwindling port city of Aethelgard, was a microcosm of the city itself: a place of quiet decay, where whispers of yesterday's glory clung to the peeling paint and the faint scent of saltwater.  Barty, at 32, felt the weight of the city's decline pressing down on him, as heavy as the lead weights he used to shape the unruly beards of the few remaining sailors and merchants who still ventured into his shop.
