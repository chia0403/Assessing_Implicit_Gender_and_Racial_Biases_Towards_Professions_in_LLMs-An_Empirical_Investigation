The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Stone's meticulously organized life.  Paperclips clicked, pens scratched across tax forms, and the faint aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air.  Amelia, a tax preparer with a degree in actuarial science and a heart of gold (or at least, a heart that always felt as though it was carrying a few extra pounds of responsibility), stared at the mountain of forms before her.  Monday morning, the usual deluge of last-minute filings, always promising to be even more frantic than the week before.


The setting was a small, unassuming office on the second floor of a strip mall in a suburb of Philadelphia.  Rows of cubicles, each a miniature fortress of tax documents and neatly stacked manila folders, stretched into the gloom of the fluorescent-lit space.  A perpetual state of quiet chaos reigned; a constant hum of whispered conversations, the rhythmic clack of keyboards, and the occasional frustrated sigh spoke volumes about the anxieties contained within those walls.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the heavy atmosphere inside.  Amelia, meticulously arranging her stack of forms, felt the familiar weight of the season's pressure settle upon her shoulders. She'd promised herself no more late nights this year.  But, as usual, it didn't feel like a promise she could keep.
