The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating a chipped porcelain mug on her cluttered desk.  Eleanor, a woman whose sharp features seemed sculpted from granite and tempered by years of relentless dedication, focused on the patient's molars.  Her brow furrowed, she muttered a silent prayer for a pain-free extraction.  Outside, the bustling city of Aethelgard roared – a symphony of sirens, car horns, and the distant rumble of construction – a constant reminder of the world beyond the sterile, antiseptic walls of her practice.

The clinic itself was a testament to decades of accumulated dental tools and forgotten patients.  Browned wooden cabinets, overflowing with jars of instruments and mismatched trays, lined the walls.  A chipped porcelain sink, stained with years of countless rinses and spatterings of fillings, sat beside the small, cluttered reception desk. The air, thick with the lingering scent of antiseptic and the faint metallic tang of blood, was a comforting, familiar blanket to Eleanor, a silent witness to her daily rituals.  Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis built on the slopes of extinct volcanoes, offered few distractions from the relentless grind of her work.  The relentless rhythm of city life outside merely provided a backdrop to the precise, methodical work of the dentist.
