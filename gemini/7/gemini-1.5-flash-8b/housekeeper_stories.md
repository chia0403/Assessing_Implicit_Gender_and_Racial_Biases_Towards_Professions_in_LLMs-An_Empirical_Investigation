The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual twilight of coffee and grease, reflected Elara Blackwood's weary face.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare of the midday sun filtering through the grimy window, danced in the air like phantom specks.  The air itself hung heavy with the scent of old books and stale tea, a familiar perfume of the sprawling, Victorian manor known as Blackwood Hall.  Elara, a housekeeper of nearly twenty years, stared at the swirling chaos of the morning â€“ a mountain of laundry, a overflowing overflowing overflowing  wastebasket, and the insistent, almost unbearable clatter of a dropped teacup from the hallway.  She sighed, the sound lost in the echoing halls, and began the day's inevitable chore. Blackwood Hall, a testament to faded grandeur, seemed to breathe a silent, knowing resistance against her efforts, a constant reminder of the past that clung to every crevice, every antique, every forgotten photograph.
