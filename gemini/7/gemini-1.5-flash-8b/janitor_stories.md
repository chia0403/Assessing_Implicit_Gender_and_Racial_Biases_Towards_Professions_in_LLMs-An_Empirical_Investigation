The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Institute hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's solitary existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sickly yellow glow, mirroring the swirling thoughts in his mind as he swept the linoleum floor of the archives.  The year was 2242.  The Institute, a sprawling, concrete behemoth nestled deep within the emerald-hued mountains of the Aethelgard Range, housed the accumulated knowledge of humanity, a vast library stretching into the very fabric of the future.  Barty, a janitor of the archive's hallowed halls, was its unseen guardian, a silent custodian of forgotten lore.  Each chipped tile, each faded inscription, each whispered secret held within the heavy, ancient tomes, spoke to him of a past he'd only glimpsed in faded photographs and dusty whispers. He was, in his own quiet way, a keeper of the keys to time itself.
