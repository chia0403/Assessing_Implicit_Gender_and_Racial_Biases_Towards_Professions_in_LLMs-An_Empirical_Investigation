The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Amelia Ashworth's hand, mirroring the tremor in her own heart.  Rain lashed against the ornate, centuries-old windows of the Grand Chateau de Beaumont, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the fragile peace of the afternoon.  The scent of damp earth and decaying roses hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the meticulously arranged bouquets that graced the reception hall, their vibrant colours a desperate attempt at masking the oppressive gloom.  Amelia, Grand Concierge of the Chateau, stood sentinel at the vast, dark mahogany desk, its polished surface reflecting the swirling grey outside.  Before her, a single, crimson envelope lay untouched, addressed in elegant script to "Monsieur Le Duc."

**Setting:**

The Grand Chateau de Beaumont, a sprawling, gothic masterpiece nestled deep within the misty, rain-soaked Ardennes forest.  The chateau, once a symbol of opulent grandeur, now felt steeped in an unsettling quietude.  Its vast halls, once echoing with laughter and the clatter of silverware, now whispered only with the sighing of the wind and the drip, drip, drip of water.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the delicate carvings and faded tapestries that adorned the walls.  The air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and damp stone, held a subtle undercurrent of something else â€“ something ancient and unsettling.
