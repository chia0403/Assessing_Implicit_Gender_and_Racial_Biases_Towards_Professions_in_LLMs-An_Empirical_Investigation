The chipped paint of the "Artist's Alley" sign, a faded, almost-forgotten turquoise, scraped against the wind-whipped brick.  Rain lashed down on the cobbled streets of  Port Blackwood, a city built on the jagged, grey cliffs overlooking the churning, perpetually grey North Sea.  This was the only place Anya Petrova, twenty-seven, considered home.  Here, nestled in the damp, windswept alleyway, her small, cluttered studio was a refuge from the ceaseless roar of the storm outside and a haven for her vibrant, fantastical paintings.  Anya, with her perpetually smudged charcoal-grey eyes and hair the colour of stormy clouds, was a creature of the gloom, yet her art glowed with the colour of a thousand sunrises.  Tonight, however, even the familiar, comforting glow of her oil lamps seemed dimmed, overshadowed by a looming darkness that felt as tangible as the relentless rain.
