The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded shade of coral, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a miniature mountain range constructed of colourful Lego bricks, a testament to the boundless creativity of the children who, for now, were elsewhere.  Eleven-year-old Amelia "Amie"  Peterson, her floral sundress a stark contrast to the gritty environment, surveyed the scene.  The air hung heavy with the faint scent of crayons and something vaguely sweet, probably a stray juice box. Amie adjusted the worn strap of her canvas tote bag, her brow furrowing slightly as she listened to the muffled sounds of children's laughter echoing from the hall.  She was the after-school care worker for the struggling neighbourhood daycare, a small fortress of brightly coloured walls struggling against the encroaching realities of neglect and poverty.  The tiny space, crammed with more toys than any child could ever need, felt strangely heavy, a weight on her shoulders mirroring the emotional baggage she witnessed daily.
