The fluorescent hum of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," was a constant, low-grade thrumming that had become Elias Thorne's personal soundtrack.  He’d been a cog in this machine for seven years, meticulously balancing spreadsheets, wrestling with tax codes, and meticulously cataloging the financial lives of others.  The beige walls, the sterile office chairs, the relentless clicking of keyboards – it all felt like a suffocating embrace.  It was a Tuesday morning, the same as every other Tuesday morning, except today, the hum seemed slightly louder, punctuated by an almost imperceptible tremor that ran through the building.

Elias, a man whose meticulous nature extended to the very way he arranged his pens on his desk, felt a prickle of unease.  He was on the cusp of closing the books for the latest quarter, a task he usually approached with the detached efficiency of a surgeon. But today, something felt…off.

The setting was the bustling, albeit mundane, financial district of Metropolis.  High-rise buildings, their glass facades gleaming under the grey London sky, pressed in around the small, unassuming office building where Numbers & Nuggets resided.  A constant stream of cars, taxis, and delivery vans honked and rumbled past, their sounds blurring into the background, yet somehow feeling amplified within the confines of the office.  A subtle, almost palpable tension hung in the air, like the thick fog that often rolled in from the Thames, clinging to the city’s edge and wrapping around the towering structures.
