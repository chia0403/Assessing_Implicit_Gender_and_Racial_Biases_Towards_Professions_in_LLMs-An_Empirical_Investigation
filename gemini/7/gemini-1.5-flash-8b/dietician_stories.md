The biting November wind whipped Amelia Josephine Blackwood's crimson coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of ancient, gnarled sycamore trees.  St. Jude's Market, a vibrant symphony of aromas and clattering stalls, lay just beyond the narrow passage, but Amelia, a Registered Dietician with a passion for nutritional restoration, wasn't interested in the tempting smells of roasted chestnuts and spiced wine.  She was on a mission, a quest for the elusive, and often elusive, 'perfectly nourished' individual.


Amelia’s practice, tucked away in a sun-drenched attic room above a small, bustling bakery in the heart of the sprawling city, was known as "Nourishment Pathways." It was less a clinical setting and more a haven – a blend of calming natural light, warm woods, and carefully curated scents of chamomile and lavender.  Her clients, a diverse group ranging from stressed-out office workers to burgeoning artists, sought Amelia's expertise, not just to address health concerns, but to unravel the intricate tapestry of their daily eating habits and emotional ties to food. This particular quest, however, was different.

This man, known only as "The Forest Keeper," was her latest mystery.
