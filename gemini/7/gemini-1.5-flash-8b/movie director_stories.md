Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Chateau de la Lune, a sprawling, gothic edifice perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking the Loire Valley.  Inside, amidst the swirling mists of cigarette smoke and the hushed murmur of whispered anxieties, sat  Augustine "Gus"  Delacroix, a man whose reputation, like the ancient stones of the chateau itself, was both formidable and riddled with hidden cracks.  Gus, a renowned, if controversial, movie director known for his visceral depictions of the human condition, was deep in a frantic re-write, the rhythmic clack of his typewriter a stark counterpoint to the tempest outside.  His meticulously organized workspace, usually a haven of order, was now a battlefield of crumpled papers and spilled coffee mugs, testament to the pressure building around his latest project, "The Serpent's Kiss".  The film, a dark, allegorical tale of betrayal and redemption, was scheduled for a premier in Cannes, and Gus felt the weight of expectation pressing down on him like the oppressive weather.
