The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's hard hat around, nearly snatching it from her grasp.  Grey clouds, bruised and threatening, hung low over the sprawling, steel-and-concrete canyons of the city's new waterfront development.  Construction cranes, skeletal giants against the darkening sky, reached like grasping arms towards the churning, restless horizon.  Amy, a seasoned concrete finisher, felt the familiar tremor of anticipation – the quiet, almost palpable energy that precedes a storm.  This particular project, the "Marina Metropolis" – a marvel of modern architecture slated to become the city's new beacon – was her domain.  For the past three years, she'd poured her sweat and her skill into every poured foot of concrete, every carefully placed rebar.  Tonight, though, the air held a different weight, a tension beyond the usual pre-storm anxiety.  The wind seemed to whisper secrets, secrets Amy couldn't quite decipher. Tonight, something felt… different.
