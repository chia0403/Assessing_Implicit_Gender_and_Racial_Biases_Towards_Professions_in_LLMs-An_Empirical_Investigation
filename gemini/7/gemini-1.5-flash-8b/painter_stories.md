The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s crimson cloak around her, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The cobbled streets of Prague, normally a symphony of bustling activity, were eerily silent, shrouded in a pre-dawn gloom that clung to the ancient buildings like a shroud.

This was the city’s shadowed heart, a place where whispers seemed to crawl along the walls, and where the very air vibrated with an unsettling stillness.  She clutched the worn leather satchel containing her paints and brushes, her only companions in this desolate hour.  A faint, almost imperceptible melody drifted from a nearby alleyway, a haunting tune played on a violin, a melody that seemed to tug at something deep within her soul.  Amelia felt an urgent pull, a need to follow the music, to unravel the mystery it held.  Tonight, Prague had something to tell her, and she was determined to listen.
