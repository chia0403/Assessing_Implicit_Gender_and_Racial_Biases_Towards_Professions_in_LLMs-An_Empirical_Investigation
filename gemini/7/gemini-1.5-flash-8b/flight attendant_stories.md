The flickering fluorescent lights of the economy section hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of Amelia "Amy" Davies's heart.  She traced the condensation clinging to the cool plastic of a water bottle, the condensation mirroring the anxiety bubbling within her.  Tonight's flight, Oceanic Airways 815, was slated to land in Los Angeles in just under two hours, but the air crackled with an unspoken tension, a palpable fear that hung heavy in the recycled cabin air.  Amy, 27, with hair the colour of storm clouds and eyes the shade of a stormy sea, meticulously arranged the rows of empty seats.  Each empty space a silent accusation, a stark reminder of the empty space she felt inside.  This wasn't just any flight. This was the last leg of her journey, the last step toward making a fresh start in a city that felt like a land she no longer recognised.

The setting: The cramped, almost claustrophobic economy cabin of Oceanic Airways 815, a Boeing 737-800, soaring through the twilight sky above the Pacific Northwest, just hours before dawn.  The stale smell of airport food and recycled air hung heavy in the cabin, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from the complimentary amenity kits.  Outside, the vast, star-dusted expanse of the night sky held silent witness to the silent anxieties of the passengers, and the quiet turmoil of Amelia Davies.
