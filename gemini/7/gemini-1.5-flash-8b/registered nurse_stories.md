The fluorescent hum of the emergency room vibrated through Amelia Hayes's bones.  It wasn't the jarring, chaotic noise of a typical ER rush, but a low, almost hypnotic thrum, punctuated by the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of vital signs monitors and the hushed whispers of fellow nurses.  It was a quiet before the storm, a stillness that felt strangely ominous.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude's Hospital, felt the pressure building, not from the patients, but from the weight of unspoken anxieties in the air.  The sterile white walls and the antiseptic smell of disinfectant felt less comforting than usual.

Amelia, 32 years old and meticulously organized, stared at the empty stretcher in the trauma bay.  It was an unusual quiet for this bustling city hospital.  The bustling city, with its million stories and untold lives, seemed strangely absent, replaced by a suffocating calm.  She checked the time on her watch: 2:00 AM.  Normally, this was a lull, the hour when the adrenaline rush of the night shift finally began to subside.  This night, however, felt different.  A thick fog clung to the city, mirroring the oppressive atmosphere within the sterile walls.
