The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic rustling of papers and the occasional exasperated sigh.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Maplewood Elementary, illuminating a chaotic scene of rainbow-colored construction paper, crumpled drawings, and spilled glue.  It was a Tuesday, the dreaded Tuesday before the long weekend, and Mrs. Vance felt the familiar knot of frustration tightening in her stomach.  Thirty tiny, enthusiastic tornadoes were attempting to conquer their grammar homework assignments, and she was, quite frankly, running out of patience.


The classroom itself was a testament to the relentless creativity and energy of eight-year-olds.  Handmade animal sculptures, perched precariously on desks, jutted out into the space.  A vibrant mural, depicting a fantastical forest teeming with imaginary creatures, covered one wall, a testament to a collaborative art project from a few weeks prior.  Despite the vibrant chaos, a faint smell of antiseptic lingered, a reminder of the persistent battle against germs and sticky fingers.  The air was thick with the scent of crayons, pencils, and unidentifiable concoctions stirred up by children in the midst of a "science experiment."
