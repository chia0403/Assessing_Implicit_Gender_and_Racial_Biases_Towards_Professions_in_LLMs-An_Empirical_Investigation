The fluorescent lights of the law firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Stone's relentless typing.  Rain lashed against the oversized picture window of the third-floor office, blurring the cityscape into a hazy grey.  Amelia, a paralegal with five years under her belt at Sterling, Hayes & Crowe, felt the familiar pressure build in her chest.  It wasn't just the relentless flow of documents, or the looming deadline for the Peterson case – though both contributed – it was the palpable sense of wrongness that clung to the air like damp wool.  Every whispered conversation in the hallway, every stapled report, seemed to conspire against her, hinting at something she wasn't supposed to know.  The Peterson case, a seemingly straightforward breach of contract, felt increasingly tangled, like a skein of silk that had been deliberately knotted.  She knew the law, the precedents, the procedures – but this felt different.  The details, the small inconsistencies, they were like pieces of a puzzle, missing vital edges, hinting at something much darker, something that no legal brief could contain.
