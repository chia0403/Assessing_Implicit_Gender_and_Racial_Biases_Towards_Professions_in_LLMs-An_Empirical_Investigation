The flickering neon sign of "The Gilded Scissors," casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street, was the only thing separating Amelia Rose Blackwood from the gnawing emptiness inside.  Inside the salon, a symphony of electric clippers, the rhythmic snip-snip of shears, and the muffled chatter of clients created a chaotic but oddly comforting soundtrack to her despair.  Amelia, a cosmetologist with a penchant for intricate updos and a heart full of unspoken regrets, was hunched over the sink, meticulously washing a particularly stubborn streak of blonde out of a client's hair.  The scent of lavender and cheap bleach hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the perfume of regret that clung to her.

The Gilded Scissors wasn't a high-end salon.  It wasn't even a particularly busy one.  Situated in a quiet, decaying part of the city, it was a relic of a bygone era, clinging to life like a wilting rosebush.  The salon's once-vibrant emerald green paint had faded to a dull, mossy green, and the chipped Formica countertops looked like they'd seen better days.  Dusty mannequins, sporting hairstyles long since out of fashion, stood in the corners, silent witnesses to the salon's slow, melancholic decline.  The dim lighting and worn, floral wallpaper only exacerbated the feeling of entrapment Amelia felt.  Outside, the rain continued its relentless drumming on the corrugated metal roof, mirroring the relentless drumming of self-doubt in her heart.
