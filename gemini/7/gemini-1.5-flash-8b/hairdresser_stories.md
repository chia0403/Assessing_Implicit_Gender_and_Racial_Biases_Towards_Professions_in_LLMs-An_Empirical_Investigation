The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained a muted grey-green from years of spilled developer and rinsed colour, mirrored the overcast sky outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Scissors & Secrets," a tiny salon tucked between a bakery and a struggling antique shop.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, her name a whispered secret amongst the neighbourhood regulars, meticulously snipped a strand of auburn hair.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip echoed the steady patter of the rain, a lullaby of sorts in the quiet salon.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and hands that seemed to know every strand of hair better than the owner of the head it sat upon, concentrated.  She was trying to coax life back into a client's hair, a life drained by grief and stress, just as her own creativity felt drained of energy. Outside, the rain grew heavier, a tempestuous prelude to the storm gathering within.
