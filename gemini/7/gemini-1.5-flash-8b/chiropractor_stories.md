Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Amelia Nightingale's clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The rhythmic drumming was a soundtrack to the mounting frustration, a counterpoint to the low hum of the massage table beneath her.  Amelia, a chiropractor with a practice tucked away in the quiet backstreets of Oakhaven, stared out the grimy window.  Leafy branches, skeletal and grey under the relentless downpour, clawed at the glass.  Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to its historical charm, was, as always, shrouded in an oppressive dampness, a feeling that mirrored the weight settling on Amelia's shoulders.

The clinic, "Aligned and Alive," was a testament to Amelia's dedication and, perhaps, a little desperation.  Barely more than a converted garage, it boasted an array of mismatched furniture, salvaged from various secondhand stores.  A faded tapestry depicting a stylized sun hung crookedly on one wall, a stark contrast to the stark reality of the patients who sought her help.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and old vinyl, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the townâ€™s inhabitants, a constant reminder of the burden of their aches and pains.  Today, the burden felt especially heavy.
