The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet anxieties that filled the room.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating the chipped paint on the walls and the worn leather of her therapistâ€™s chair.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with ten years of experience, meticulously filed her nails, the rhythmic click-click a counterpoint to the muffled sobs emanating from the other side of the room.  Today was one of those days.

The setting was the modest, slightly-too-warm office suite in a building that housed a mix of accounting firms and struggling yoga studios on the outskirts of a city that felt both vibrant and suffocating.
