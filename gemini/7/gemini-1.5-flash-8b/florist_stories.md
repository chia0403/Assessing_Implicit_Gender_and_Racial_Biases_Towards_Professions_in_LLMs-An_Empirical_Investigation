The aroma of bruised violets and decaying roses hung heavy in the air, a pungent counterpoint to the sweet, almost cloying scent of lilies that perpetually bloomed in the front window of "Flora's Fairytales."  Rain slicked the cobblestones outside, reflecting the flickering gaslight lamps in a dizzying dance.  Amelia Seraphina Thistlewick, her floral-printed apron stained a deep crimson from a particularly temperamental crimson dahlia, sighed.  Another Tuesday, another torrent of complaints about wilting blooms.  The tiny shop, nestled between a bakery overflowing with sugared pastries and a tailor's shop whose window displayed rows of meticulously pressed trousers, was her kingdom, her prison.  She loved the vibrant chaos of it all, the endless symphony of petal colours and delicate thorns, but sometimes the weight of expectations felt as heavy as the lead weights she used to anchor her prize-winning hydrangeas.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain against the small, leaded windows was the only constant in the unpredictable world of flowers.
