The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electric Solutions" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water pooled in the cracked asphalt, reflecting the fractured light like a thousand miniature, shattered mirrors.  Inside, bathed in the dim, buzzing hum of transformers and the metallic tang of ozone, Elias Thorne, a man whose hands, calloused and scarred from years spent wrestling with wires and circuits, meticulously traced the fault line on a mangled copper cable.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed in the cramped confines of the workshop. Elias, a wiry man with eyes that held the perpetual flicker of a streetlamp in a storm, concentrated, his brow furrowing in thought.  The clock on the chipped workbench read 2:17 AM.  Tonight, even Sparky's wasn't safe from the electrical storm raging outside.
