The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous drone that seemed to amplify the quiet thrum of anxiety in the air.  Eleven o'clock on a Tuesday, and the usual boisterous energy of her AP Literature students was replaced by a tense stillness.  The room, normally decorated with vibrant posters of famous authors and evocative quotes, felt muted, almost suffocating.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded portrait of Emily Dickinson that hung precariously above the worn mahogany desk.  Eleanor, with her perpetually tired eyes and a scattering of grey threads in her dark brown hair, stared at the crumpled stack of essays on her desk, each one a miniature universe of teenage angst and literary ambition.  Outside, the city of  New Haven, Connecticut, bustled with a life that felt utterly disconnected from the hushed intensity of her classroom.
