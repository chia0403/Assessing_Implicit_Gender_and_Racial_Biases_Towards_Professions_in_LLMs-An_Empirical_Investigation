The chill wind whipped across the cobblestones of the Old Quarter, carrying the scent of brine and woodsmoke.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the leaded windows of the Palais de Justice.  Inside, Judge  Alistair Blackwood, a man whose sharp, hawk-like eyes seemed to absorb every whispered word and nuanced expression, hunched over a massive oak desk.  Documents, yellowed with age and stacked impossibly high, formed a mountain around him.  The air, thick with the smell of aged parchment and simmering mahogany, pressed down on him like a suffocating blanket.  The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows that swirled around the portraits of past judges, their stoic gazes fixed on the present, a silent judgment echoing in the very stones of the building.  He was a man forged in the crucible of the city's injustices, his face a map of sleepless nights and weary compromises.  This, the final case of the year, hung like a shroud over the city, promising a long, arduous night.
