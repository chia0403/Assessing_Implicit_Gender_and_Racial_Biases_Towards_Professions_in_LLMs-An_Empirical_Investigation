The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" salon reflected the afternoon sun, casting dancing motes of dust across the cluttered waiting area.  A single, wilting bougainvillea vine clawed at the window frame, a fragile echo of the vibrant city life outside.

Each cut, each conversation, each whispered secret, was a thread woven into the fabric of the neighborhood.  Today, a particularly nervous young woman, her nametag reading "Seraphina," sat in the stylist's chair, her gaze fixed on Amy's hands as she meticulously shaped the layers of her hair.
