The fluorescent hum of the trading floor, a relentless, metallic drone, vibrated through Amelia "Amy"  Stone's skull.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the pallor of the FTSE 100, stubbornly refusing to budge from its stagnant afternoon slump.  Amy, a stock broker at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Sage, chewed the end of a pen, its tip a chipped sliver of white against the deep indigo of her tailored suit.  Her meticulously organised desk, a battlefield of scribbled notes and half-empty coffee cups, was a testament to the frenetic energy of the last few hours.  Yesterday's projected gains had vanished into thin air, replaced by a gnawing uncertainty that felt like an icy hand gripping her stomach.  It was a feeling she knew all too well in the unforgiving world of high finance.

Setting:

The trading floor of Sterling & Sage, a colossal space crammed with blinking screens, whirring keyboards, and the low thrum of unseen servers.  Rows of traders, each a tiny ant in the colossal machine, hunched over their monitors, their faces illuminated by the cold, hard light.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated by the sharp crackle of announcements, and the occasional sharp cry of a trader celebrating a fortunate trade. The imposing glass walls afforded a glimpse of the bustling city outside, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic energy of the room.
