The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, reflected the sickly yellow light filtering through the dusty, floral wallpaper of the Grand Hotel Normandie.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.  Thirty-two-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop with a mop of unruly brown hair perpetually escaping its overly-tight tie, sighed.  Another Tuesday. Another lukewarm cup of lukewarm coffee. Another guest demanding a room overlooking the Grand Canal, despite the view being, as Barty had often muttered to his chipped mug, "largely consisting of beige rooftops and a rather underwhelming water feature."

The Grand Hotel Normandie, a once-grand establishment now showing its age, clung to the faded glory of its past.  Its grand ballroom, once echoing with the joyous clatter of dancing shoes and the clinking of champagne flutes, was now mostly used for the annual pensioners' tea dance â€“ a pale imitation of the boisterous evenings of yesteryear.  The scent of stale roses and the faint aroma of mildew clung to the corridors, a persistent reminder of the hotel's fading grandeur.  The heavy oak doors, once gleaming under polished brass, now creaked with the weight of forgotten footsteps and whispered secrets.  Barty,  with his perpetually creased uniform and weary eyes, was a silent witness to it all, the unassuming custodian of a fading dream.
