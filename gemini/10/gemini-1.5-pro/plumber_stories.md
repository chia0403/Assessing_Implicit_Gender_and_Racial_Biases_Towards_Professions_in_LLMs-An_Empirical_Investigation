The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he wrestled a stubborn pipe wrench in the cramped crawl space beneath Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning rose bushes.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of his headlamp, illuminating the cobwebs and rusting pipes like some macabre disco.  Above him, in the cozy warmth of her Victorian home in the small town of Oakhaven, Illinois, Mrs. Henderson hummed along to a scratchy recording of Bing Crosby, blissfully unaware of the frozen plumber contorted beneath her floorboards battling a leak that threatened to flood her prized Persian rug.  Oakhaven, usually a picture of quaint Midwestern charm, felt less idyllic from Elias's perspective. The air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and the metallic tang of rust, clung to him like a second skin. He muttered a curse under his breath, the wrench finally giving way with a groan of protesting metal.  The leak, a pinprick hole in a corroded copper pipe, hissed mockingly at him.
