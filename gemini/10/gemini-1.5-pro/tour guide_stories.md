The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes.  A gecko, emerald green and impossibly still, clung to the faded turquoise wall of the Aloha ʻĀina Tours office, its eyes glittering like obsidian beads.

Amelia sighed, a strand of her long, dark hair escaping the neat braid coiled at the nape of her neck. This was the third no-show this week. She hoped her rent money wasn't about to become as elusive as the legendary Nightmarchers she sometimes recounted on her twilight tours.
