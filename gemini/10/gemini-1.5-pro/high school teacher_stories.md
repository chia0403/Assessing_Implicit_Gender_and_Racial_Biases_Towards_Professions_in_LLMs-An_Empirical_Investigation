The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the frantic scribbling of his Advanced Placement English students. Outside, the October wind rattled the skeletal branches of the sycamores lining the grounds of Ashworth Preparatory Academy, a prestigious, if slightly stuffy, boarding school nestled in the rolling hills of western Massachusetts. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows, blurring the view of the manicured lawns beyond. Inside, Elias felt the familiar pressure of Friday afternoon building.  He glanced at the clock – 3:07 pm.  Three minutes until he could unleash these bright young minds upon the weekend, and retreat to the quiet sanctuary of his on-campus apartment, a small but cozy space tucked away in a converted carriage house behind the main building.  He’d been looking forward to a quiet evening with a worn copy of Dickens and a glass of single malt, a ritual he rarely deviated from. But something in the air, a subtle shift in the atmosphere of the usually predictable Ashworth, told him this Friday would be different.
