The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Yukon Territory, carrying with it the stinging snow that clung to Amelia "Amy" Reyes' thick parka.  Dawn was a hesitant smudge on the horizon, barely illuminating the skeletal silhouettes of the frost-covered spruce trees that dotted the landscape.  Amy, her breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the earflaps of her hat and climbed into the heated cab of her Komatsu D375A-8 dozer. The behemoth machine, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy" by Amy, rumbled to life, its powerful engine a reassuring counterpoint to the howling wilderness. This was her office â€“ a frozen, unforgiving arena of permafrost and ice, carved out for the construction of the new Trans-Yukon pipeline. Five hundred miles from the nearest town, Camp Frostbite, as the workers wryly called it, was a collection of prefabricated buildings and heavy machinery huddled against the relentless elements.  Today's task was a particularly challenging one: carving a path through a treacherous stretch of ice-covered bedrock known as Devil's Pass.  Even Betsy, with her massive blade and ripper shank, would be tested.
