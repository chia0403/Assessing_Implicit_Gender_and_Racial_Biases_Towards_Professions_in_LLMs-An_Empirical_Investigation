The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the large front window.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from conditioning a fresh batch of irises, glanced up from her work.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, gleamed under the streetlights, reflecting the warm glow emanating from the little flower shop.  November had arrived, cloaking the seaside town in a damp chill that hinted at the coming winter, but inside, the air hung heavy with the sweet, earthy fragrance of hundreds of blooms, a vibrant defiance against the encroaching grey.  Amelia tucked a loose strand of her auburn hair behind her ear, a small smile playing on her lips.  She loved this time of year, the contrast between the bleakness outside and the explosion of colour she cultivated within her shop.  Little did she know, the approaching storm was about to bring more than just rain to Port Blossom.
