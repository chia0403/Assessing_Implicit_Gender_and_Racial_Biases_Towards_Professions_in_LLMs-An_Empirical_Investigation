The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the edges of his worn canvas jacket.  He hunched deeper into the collar, his breath puffing out in small white clouds, as he trudged across the frozen, rutted track leading to the O’Malley farm.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised snow before nightfall. Crows, black specks against the fading light, cawed raucously from the skeletal branches of a lone elm tree silhouetted against the bleak horizon.  Nestled in the valley below, the scattered farmhouses of Ballynahown, County Clare, Ireland, blinked with welcoming pinpricks of warm yellow light, a stark contrast to the desolate beauty of the surrounding landscape.  Elias pulled his battered Land Rover to a stop outside the O’Malley’s ramshackle barn, the engine shuddering in protest as he killed the ignition. Tonight’s call wasn't going to be easy.
