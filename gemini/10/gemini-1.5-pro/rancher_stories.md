The wind, a biting November gust that smelled of snow and sagebrush, whipped at Amelia Jane Cartwright's chapped lips as she surveyed the vast expanse of the Cartwright Ranch. The sun, a pale disc bleeding orange onto the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the ponderosa pines that dotted the rolling hills.  Amelia Jane, bundled in a thick wool coat and a worn leather hat, stood atop a rocky outcrop overlooking the north pasture, her breath pluming white in the frigid air. Below, a herd of Hereford cattle huddled together, their dark forms a stark contrast against the snow-dusted ground. The ranch, nestled in the heart of Montana's Bitterroot Valley, stretched for miles in every direction – a patchwork of emerald meadows, dense forest, and craggy peaks that scraped the sky.  Winter was coming, and with it, the promise of hardship and the unwavering test of Amelia Jane's resilience, a trait she’d inherited from generations of Cartwrights who had tamed this wild and unforgiving land.
