Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting emblem for The Gilded Lily.  The bar, tucked away in a forgotten alley of New Orleansâ€™ French Quarter, usually buzzed with a mix of tourists and regulars seeking refuge from the humid Louisiana air. Tonight, however, only a handful of souls braved the storm, their faces illuminated by the flickering gas lamps that cast long shadows across the mahogany bar. Behind that bar, polishing glasses with a practiced hand, stood Evangeline Marie Dubois.  Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, had escaped a few rebellious strands that framed a face etched with both weariness and a quiet strength.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and the lingering ghost of Evangeline's signature cocktail, the "Voodoo Lily," a potent mix of rum, absinthe, and a secret ingredient she guarded with her life.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a prelude to what Evangeline sensed was going to be a long, strange night.
