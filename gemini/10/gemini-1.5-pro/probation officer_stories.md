The stale air hung thick with the scent of instant coffee and despair in the waiting room of the Southside Community Corrections office.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped linoleum floor and the worn, mismatched chairs. Amelia Reyes, her full name Amelia Sofia Reyes, tapped a pen against her clipboard, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the anxious sighs and muffled coughs around her.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the bleakness that permeated this corner of Chicago on a Tuesday morning in November.  Amelia, a probation officer barely three years into her career, already felt the weight of the city's broken promises pressing down on her, a constant reminder of the thin line between hope and recidivism she walked every day. Today's caseload was a particularly challenging one, including a repeat offender with a history of violent outbursts and a young single mother struggling with addiction.  Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the long day ahead.
