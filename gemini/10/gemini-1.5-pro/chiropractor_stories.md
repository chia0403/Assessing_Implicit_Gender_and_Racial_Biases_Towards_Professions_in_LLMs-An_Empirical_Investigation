The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the knot of his tie, the Windsor a touch too tight for the simmering frustration coiling in his gut.  His clinic, Thorne Chiropractic and Wellness, was a testament to years of back-breaking student loans and even more back-breaking labour. Yet, on this particularly dreary Tuesday evening in October, in the perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Washington, his waiting room remained stubbornly empty. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock inherited from his grandmother, each tick an unwelcome reminder of the mounting bills and the gnawing fear that his dream was slowly, inexorably, crumbling to dust.  Rain lashed against the large front window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Havenwood, with its dense evergreen forests pressing in on all sides and its inhabitants steeped in a peculiar brand of stoic silence, hadnâ€™t exactly welcomed him with open arms. He'd hoped his gentle touch and holistic approach would be a balm to their aching backs and stiff necks.  So far, it seemed the only thing Havenwood was receptive to was the relentless drizzle.
