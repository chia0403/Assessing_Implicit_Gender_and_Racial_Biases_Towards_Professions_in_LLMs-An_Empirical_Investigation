The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Evelyn "Evie" Ramirez's flight jacket as she prepped her Cessna 206 for takeoff.  The tiny airstrip, little more than a flattened patch of gravel carved into the side of a snow-dusted mountain, clung precariously to the edge of the Denali National Park wilderness.  Towering pines cast long, skeletal shadows across the frost-covered ground, and the air, crisp and clean, vibrated with the low hum of the single-prop engine.  It was just after dawn, and the sky, a canvas of bruised purples and fiery oranges, hinted at the brutal beauty of a subarctic winter day.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid air, ran a gloved hand over the plane's fuselage, a familiar ritual before every flight. This particular run, however, was different. It wasn't a routine mail delivery or a scenic tour for tourists.  This time, she was flying into the heart of the Alaskan wilderness, a place whispered about in local legends, a place few had seen and even fewer returned from.  A place called the Valley of Whispering Ice.
