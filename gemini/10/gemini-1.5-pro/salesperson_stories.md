The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Motel cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Reyes's tired face.  Rain lashed against the windshield of her beat-up Honda Civic, the wipers struggling to keep up.

Tomorrow, she'd be on the road again, chasing the elusive dream of a big sale in the vast, unforgiving landscape of the American Southwest.
