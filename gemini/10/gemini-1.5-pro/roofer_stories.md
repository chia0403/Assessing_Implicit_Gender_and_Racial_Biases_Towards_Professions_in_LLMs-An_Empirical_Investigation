The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, releasing a pungent aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of black across his forehead. Below him, the sleepy town of Harmony Ridge, Pennsylvania, shimmered in the heat haze. Red brick houses with neatly trimmed lawns sprawled across the valley, punctuated by the occasional white steeple of a church.  Elias perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Gable's Victorian, three stories up, the slate tiles hot beneath his worn work boots.  A faint breeze rustled the leaves of a nearby oak, offering little respite from the oppressive heat.  He'd been up here since dawn, replacing the damaged section of roof, and his muscles ached with a familiar weariness. But the view, stretching across the rolling hills to the distant mountains, was a small compensation.  Today, though, something felt different.  A disquiet hummed in the air, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the height or the heat.
