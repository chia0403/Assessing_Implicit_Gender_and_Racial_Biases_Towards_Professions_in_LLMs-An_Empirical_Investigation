The aroma of stale coffee and damp wool hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom. Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of St. Jude's Elementary, blurring the view of the typically vibrant maple trees lining Sycamore Street.  It was a dreary Tuesday in late October, the kind that made the second-graders at St. Jude's particularly squirmy.  Plastic pumpkins grinned from the windowsills, their cheerful orange a stark contrast to the grey gloom that permeated the room.  Mrs. Vance, a woman with kind eyes the color of warm honey and hair the shade of autumn leaves, tapped a ruler lightly against the chalkboard. The rhythmic tapping did little to quell the rising tide of chatter and fidgeting. A paper airplane, folded with surprising precision, zipped past her ear.  This was going to be a long day.
