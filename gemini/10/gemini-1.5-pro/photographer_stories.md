The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, clinging to the fine hairs that escaped her braid.  The biting wind whipped around her, a familiar lullaby on the jagged cliffs of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands.  Below, the Atlantic roared, a churning beast gnawing at the base of the cliffs, its frothy breath rising in plumes against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Amelia shifted her weight, the rough texture of the Aran sweater scratching against her skin, a comforting reminder of home.  Her camera bag, heavy with lenses and the promise of capturing the ephemeral beauty of the approaching sunrise, dug into her shoulder.  She’d come to Inis Mór to escape the clamor of Dublin, the endless demands of clients, the suffocating feeling of creative stagnation.  Here, amongst the ancient stones and the relentless sea, she hoped to find inspiration, to reconnect with the raw power of nature that had first ignited her passion for photography.  The sky began to lighten, a sliver of fiery orange peeking over the horizon, painting the clouds in hues of apricot and rose.  Amelia raised her camera, her breath catching in her throat, ready to capture the fleeting magic of the dawn.
