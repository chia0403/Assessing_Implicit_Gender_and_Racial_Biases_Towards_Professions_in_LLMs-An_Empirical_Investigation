The rain hammered against the arched, gothic window of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental surgery, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the leaded glass. Grey November light, filtered through the downpour, painted the waiting room in a monochrome wash, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air above the worn, floral carpet.  A single, wilting fern in a brass pot offered a splash of anemic green. Located on the ground floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, Oregon, Thorne Family Dentistry had served the community for three generations. Elias, however, feared he might be the last.  The once-thriving practice, inherited from his father, was now struggling, mirroring the slow decay of the town itself.  He sighed, the scent of antiseptic mingling with the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow, and picked up a chipped porcelain figurine of a molar, absently rubbing its smooth surface.  The steady drip from a leaky pipe somewhere in the walls punctuated the silence, a metronome counting down to another long, lonely afternoon.
