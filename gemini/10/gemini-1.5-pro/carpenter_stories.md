The rasp bit into the cherrywood, sending a fine spray of sawdust swirling in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through Elijah Blackwoodâ€™s workshop window.  The air, thick with the scent of cedar and pine shavings, hung heavy and still in the July heat. Elijah, sweat beading on his brow, paused his work, wiping his forehead with the back of his calloused hand.  His workshop, nestled at the edge of the whispering pines that bordered the small, isolated town of Havenwood, Maine, was a sanctuary.  Tools hung neatly from pegboard walls, each in its designated place.  Stacks of lumber, seasoned and ready for use, lined one wall, their earthy fragrance mingling with the sweeter notes of the cherrywood he was currently shaping into a rocking chair.  Outside, the only sounds were the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant, mournful cry of a loon echoing across the placid surface of Havenwood Lake.
