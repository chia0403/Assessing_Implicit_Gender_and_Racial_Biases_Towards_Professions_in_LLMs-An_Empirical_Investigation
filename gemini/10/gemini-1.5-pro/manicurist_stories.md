The air hung heavy with the scent of Mrs. Higgins' chosen polish, "Tickle Me Pink," mingled with the faint aroma of chlorine bleach wafting over from the laundromat next door. Amelia, with a smile that could charm a grizzly bear out of its honey, greeted the newcomer without missing a beat in her intricate brushwork. "Be with you in a jiffy, hon!" she called out, her voice warm and laced with a gentle Southern drawl.
