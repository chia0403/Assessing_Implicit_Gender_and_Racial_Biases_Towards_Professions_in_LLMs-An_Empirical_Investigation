The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the quiet murmur of the electric fireplace. Her office, nestled in a converted Victorian house on the edge of the historic district of Ashworth, Maine, was a sanctuary of warm colours and soft textures, deliberately designed to soothe frayed nerves. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song, stripping the last stubborn leaves from the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the property. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke and the faint, comforting aroma of Earl Grey tea brewing in a delicate china pot on a small table by the plush, emerald green velvet chaise lounge.  Dr. Vance, her silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, adjusted the tortoiseshell frames of her glasses and glanced at the antique clock on the mantelpiece.  5:57 pm. Three minutes until her last appointment of the day, and the unsettling quiet that had settled over Ashworth for the past week continued to prickle at the edges of her awareness.
