The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia "Stasia" Petrova, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chin as she surveyed the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre.  Flakes of chipped paint, the colour of dried blood, littered the steps leading up to the once-grand entrance.  The ornate plaster cherubs flanking the double doors had lost limbs and wings, their blank, eyeless sockets staring out at the desolate Ohio town of Harmony Creek.  Above them, the theatre’s marquee, a rusty skeleton against the bruised twilight sky, clung precariously to its moorings. One flickering bulb stubbornly illuminated half of the title of Stasia’s latest, and possibly last, production:  "A Mid…".  The rest had succumbed to the elements, leaving the play’s fate – much like the theatre’s – hanging precariously in the balance.
