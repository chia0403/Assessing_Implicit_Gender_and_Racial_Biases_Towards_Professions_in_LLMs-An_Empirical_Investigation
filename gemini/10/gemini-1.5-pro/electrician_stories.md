The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of brine and damp cedar, and plastered Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s thick, black braid against her cheek. The sky, a bruised purple streaked with angry orange, promised a downpour. Amy, perched precariously on the second-story scaffolding of the old Victorian lighthouse, tightened her grip on the rusted junction box. Below her, the churning grey waters crashed against the craggy rocks at the base of the lighthouse, their rhythmic roar a constant, ominous presence.  Orcas Island, usually a haven of tranquility, tonight felt wild and exposed. The lighthouse, long deactivated and slated for demolition, was her current project – a final, tricky rewiring job before the wrecking ball swung.  And tonight, with the storm brewing and the last ferry to the mainland long gone, she was utterly alone.
