The biting wind whipped off the slate-grey North Sea, stinging Amelia “Amy” Sanchez’s cheeks as she surveyed the ragtag group assembled on the blustery beach.  Sand, propelled by the unforgiving gusts, stung her eyes and grated against the worn fabric of her Sunderland AFC tracksuit.  Seaham, a small, former mining town on the Durham coast, wasn't exactly known for its balmy weather, especially not in November.  Amy pulled her hood tighter, the embroidered "Coach" logo a small beacon against the drab landscape.  This was her new reality, far from the manicured pitches and roaring stadiums of her previous life. This was where she was supposed to rebuild, to find the spark she'd lost somewhere between the championship wins and the crushing defeats.  This was where she was supposed to turn a group of misfit teenagers into a football team.  The Seaham Sirens.
