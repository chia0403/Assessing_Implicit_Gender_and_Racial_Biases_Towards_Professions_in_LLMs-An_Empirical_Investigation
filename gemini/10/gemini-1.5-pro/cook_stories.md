The clatter of pots and pans, a symphony of kitchen chaos, was Evelyn Rose Hawthorne's comfort music. The salty tang of simmering bouillabaisse hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet perfume of ripening mangoes piled high on a nearby counter.  Her restaurant, "The Copper Kettle," nestled in the heart of the cobbled, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, was a riot of warmth and colour. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows, illuminating the mismatched chairs, the worn wooden tables, and the shelves crammed with jars of pickled vegetables and preserved fruits, all lovingly made by Evelyn herself.  It was early June, and the tourist season hadn't yet reached its peak, allowing Evelyn a moment of relative calm before the inevitable summer rush. This morning, however, a different kind of tension crackled in the air, a premonition of change that Evelyn couldn't quite put her finger on.
