Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his temples.  Neon light from the "Lucky Clover Motel" across the street bled through the blinds, painting stripes of sickly green across the peeling wallpaper. Silas Finch, full name Silas Montgomery Finch, private investigator, sat hunched over his desk, a half-eaten bowl of lukewarm chili con carne growing a skin in the damp air.  His office, nestled above a pawn shop on the wrong side of the El tracks in downtown New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, wasn't much, but it was his.  The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and despair â€“ the usual bouquet.  The flickering bulb overhead cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the rain, making the overflowing ashtrays and stacks of dusty files look like monstrous, shifting creatures in the periphery of his vision.  A crumpled photograph of a smiling redhead lay face down on the blotter, a silent testament to the case that had brought Silas to this particular low point.
