The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled a recalcitrant sample case across the cobbled mews.  Number 17, her destination, was tucked away at the far end, a converted stable block that now housed the impossibly chic apartment of  Cassian Thorne, a reclusive novelist known for his brooding thrillers and even more brooding personality.  The Georgian architecture of Bath, usually so charming with its honey-coloured stone, felt oppressive under the steely grey sky.  Eleanor tugged her cashmere scarf higher, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  This was her biggest commission yet, and while Thorneâ€™s reputation preceded him (difficult, demanding, a perfectionist), the potential payoff was enormous.  If she could impress him, her small interior design business could finally move out of the "promising newcomer" category and into the big leagues.  The heavy oak door of Number 17, studded with iron nails, loomed before her, a silent, imposing sentinel.
