The frosted pine trees stood like silent sentinels, their branches heavy with the recent snowfall, and the only sound was the rhythmic crunch of Amy's boots breaking the icy crust.  A pale sliver of moon hung low in the indigo sky, casting long, eerie shadows that danced across the snow-covered fields. Wildhaven was home to a diverse collection of rescued animals, from majestic bald eagles to playful river otters, but Amy’s heart belonged to the wolves.  The crisp air vibrated with their low, mournful howls, a sound that sent a familiar shiver down her spine, a mix of awe and profound respect.  Today, however, the howls carried a different edge, a frantic urgency that had Amy quickening her pace, her breath clouding the frigid air.
