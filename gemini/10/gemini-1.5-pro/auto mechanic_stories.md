The rusty tang of brake dust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet, cloying scent of honeysuckle that stubbornly climbed the chain-link fence surrounding Rosie's Auto Repair.  Elara "Ellie" Vasquez wiped a greasy streak across her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a trail of grime that mirrored the ones crisscrossing her faded denim overalls.

Today, however, the usual hum of engines and clang of tools was replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the distant, mournful cry of a train whistle. Ellie had a feeling that quiet wouldn't last.
