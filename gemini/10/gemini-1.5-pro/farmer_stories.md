The wind, sharp and cold even for late October, whipped across the vast, flat expanse of the Palouse, stinging Amelia Rose Thatcher's cheeks as she surveyed her winter wheat. The rolling hills, usually a soothing wave of green, were now a muted ochre, broken only by the darker lines of fallow fields.  Amelia, her hands thrust deep into the pockets of her worn canvas jacket, stood at the crest of the highest rise on her property, the Thatcher Homestead, a patch of land stubbornly clinging to the traditions of family farming amidst the encroaching tide of agribusiness. The sky, a bruised purple, threatened snow, and the air held the metallic scent of approaching winter.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its cry a mournful counterpoint to the rustling whisper of the dry wheat stalks.  The nearest town, Harmony Creek, was a speck in the distance, its flickering lights a faint beacon against the gathering dusk. This land, stretching as far as the eye could see, was Ameliaâ€™s legacy, a burden and a blessing in equal measure.
