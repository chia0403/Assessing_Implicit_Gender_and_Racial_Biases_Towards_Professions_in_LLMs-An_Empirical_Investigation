The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lurid, fuchsia glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amidst the aroma of hairspray and the hum of dryers, Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne swept up stray strands of auburn hair, the last remnants of Mrs. Henderson's weekly perm. Rain lashed against the large picture window, blurring the view of the deserted harbor. It was a Tuesday evening in late November, the kind of night that made Amy long for the warmth of her small apartment and a mug of hot cocoa. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival, and Amy plastered a welcoming smile on her face, hoping it wasn't another blue-rinse requesting a beehive.
