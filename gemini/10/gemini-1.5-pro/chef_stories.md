The clatter of aluminum stockpots and the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil filled the pre-dawn air of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, yet fiercely ambitious, bistro nestled in the heart of Montmartre.  Rain lashed against the skylight, mirroring the nervous energy thrumming through  Isabelle "Izzy" Dubois.  Her fingers, stained yellow from years of turmeric and saffron, tightened around the handle of a well-worn chef's knife. Tonight was the night.  Months of planning, weeks of frantic preparation, and years of dreaming had all culminated in this moment.  Tonight,  renowned food critic, Antoine Vernier, was coming to Le Papillon Bleu.  Izzy, clad in her crisp white chef’s jacket, felt a mixture of excitement and dread swirling in her stomach, a sensation not unlike the béchamel she'd meticulously whisked to perfection just moments ago.  The future of her restaurant, her livelihood, hung precariously in the balance, much like the delicate sugar sculpture perched atop her signature lavender crème brûlée.
