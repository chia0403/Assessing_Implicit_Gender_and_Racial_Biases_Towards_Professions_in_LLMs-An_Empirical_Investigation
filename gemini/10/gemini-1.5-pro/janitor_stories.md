The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech labs hummed a lonely tune, reflecting off the polished linoleum floors. Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket down the deserted hallway.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the windows of the imposing skyscraper. Inside, it was a sterile, silent world of gleaming steel, pristine white walls, and the faint, chemical tang of scientific endeavor.  It was 3:17 am, Elias's usual starting time.  Zenith BioTech prided itself on its immaculate facilities, and Elias was the silent guardian of that image. Tonight, however, something felt different.  A prickle of unease ran down his spine, a feeling he couldn't quite place. It wasn't the usual quiet; he was accustomed to the solitude. It was something else, a subtle shift in the air, a sense ofâ€¦wrongness.
