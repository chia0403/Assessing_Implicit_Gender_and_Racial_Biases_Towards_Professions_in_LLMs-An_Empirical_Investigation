The rusty hinges of the "Clip Joint" groaned a mournful tune as Elias Finch pushed the door open, the bell above it jingling a discordant counterpoint. The aroma of bay rum and talcum powder, tinged with the metallic scent of disinfectant, hung heavy in the air. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked window, illuminated swirling motes of dust dancing above the worn leather chairs. Elias, his own dark hair slicked back and meticulously styled, surveyed his domain. The Clip Joint wasn't much, a single room sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop on the seedier end of Elm Street, but it was his.  Outside, the humid New Orleans air hung thick and heavy, promising another sweltering July day. Inside, the quiet hum of the electric clippers on their charging stand offered a fragile peace, a moment of stillness before the rush of customers and the snip-snip-snip of scissors that marked the rhythm of Elias's life.
