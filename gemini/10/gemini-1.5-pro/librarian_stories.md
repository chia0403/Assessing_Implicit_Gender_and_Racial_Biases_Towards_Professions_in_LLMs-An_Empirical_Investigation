The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, plumed out before him as he unlocked the heavy oak doors.  A brittle November wind, scented with pine needles and woodsmoke, whipped down Main Street, rattling the paned windows of the library and scattering the few remaining crimson leaves clinging to the ancient maple out front. Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, was a town that embraced its winters with a stoic, almost welcoming, quietude. The library, with its worn wooden floors, the scent of aged paper and leather, and the ever-present hush, was the epicenter of that quietude. Elias, a man who found solace in the ordered world of Dewey Decimals and the hushed whispers of turning pages, felt a deep sense of belonging within these walls. But the tranquility of this particular morning was about to be shattered.  A single, scarlet mitten lay abandoned on the libraryâ€™s stone steps, a splash of vibrant color against the muted grey of the dawn.
