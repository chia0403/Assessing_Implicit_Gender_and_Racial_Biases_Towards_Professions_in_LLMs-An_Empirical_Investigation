The biting November wind whipped across the deserted parking lot of the MercyVale Urgent Care, sending a discarded coffee cup skittering across the asphalt like a tumbleweed.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the sterile white walls and polished linoleum floor.  Eleanor Vance, PA-C, rubbed the bridge of her nose, the faint ache a testament to the relentless stream of patients she'd seen that day.  Everything from sniffles and sore throats to a suspected broken tibiaâ€”Tuesday nights in the small, upstate New York town of Havenwood were notoriously unpredictable.  The clock above the reception desk blinked 3:17 AM, the digital glow an unwelcome reminder of how long it had been since she'd last seen her own bed.  Silence, save for the low hum of the refrigerator in the break room, finally settled over the clinic.  Eleanor leaned back in her rolling chair, the squeak a jarring sound in the newfound quiet, and closed her eyes, just for a moment.  That's when the phone rang.
