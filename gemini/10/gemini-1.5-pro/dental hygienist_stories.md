The fluorescent lights of Aspen Dental hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Reyes, their sterile glow reflecting off the polished chrome of the dental instruments laid out before her.  It was a Tuesday morning in late October in the small, perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Rain lashed against the large picture window of the clinic, obscuring the view of the usually picturesque harbor. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted her mask and glanced at the clock: 7:58 am.

The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of approaching anxiety.
