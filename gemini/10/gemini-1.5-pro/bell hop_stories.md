The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh, a breath of warm, jasmine-scented air escaping into the crisp November evening.  Rain slicked the Chicago streets, reflecting the neon glow of the city back onto the polished brass fixtures of the hotel's grand entrance.

He was nineteen, barely a man, and all nervous energy beneath a veneer of practiced professionalism.  Tonight was the annual Diamond Gala, the biggest event in the Grand Majestic's calendar, and Fitz was determined to make a flawless impression, hoping to catch the eye of Mr. Henderson, the head concierge, and finally escape the purgatory of bellhop duty. The air crackled with the buzz of anticipation, the murmur of affluent voices a constant hum beneath the soaring ceilings.  Tonight, Fitz knew, fortunes could be made and broken, secrets whispered and revealed, and perhaps, just perhaps, his own future decided.
