The insistent drumming of rain against the arched windowpane mirrored the thrumming anxiety in Elsie Amelia Cartwright’s chest.  Fog, thick as cotton wool, clung to the neo-Gothic spires of St. Jude's Cathedral across the street, obscuring the usually vibrant stained glass. Inside the opulent, yet slightly dusty offices of Thorne & Blackwood Solicitors, the air hung heavy with the scent of old leather-bound books and the faint, metallic tang of approaching thunder. Elsie, perched on the edge of her worn velvet chair, smoothed the crisp folds of her navy skirt and re-adjusted the tortoiseshell spectacles perched on her nose. The antiquated typewriter sat before her, a silent, metallic beast awaiting her command, but her gaze remained fixed on the heavy oak door of Mr. Blackwood’s office. It had been closed for an unsettlingly long period, and the muffled sounds emanating from within – a raised voice, the distinct clink of glass, then an abrupt silence – did little to calm her nerves. This was not a typical Monday morning.
