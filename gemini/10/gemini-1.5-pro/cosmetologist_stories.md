The pungent scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, battling with the saccharine sweetness of hairspray. Fluorescent lights, unforgiving in their brightness, glinted off the chrome and glass surfaces of "Shear Perfection," a small salon nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down Italian restaurant in the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Oregon.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy, inviting glow. Inside,  twenty-eight-year-old Elara Juniper Bloom, her name as vibrant and layered as her signature dye jobs, leaned over her current client, Mrs. Henderson, meticulously teasing the elderly woman's thin, white hair into a cloud-like bouffant. Elara hummed along to the eighties power ballads blasting from the small radio perched precariously on a stack of Vogue magazines, her mind already crafting the intricate updo she planned for the upcoming Harmony Glade Founder's Day Ball.  This year's theme was "Roaring Twenties," and Elara, with her innate flair for the dramatic, was determined to make every head in Harmony Glade turn.
