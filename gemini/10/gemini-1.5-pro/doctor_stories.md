The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the hem of his long wool coat flapping against his legs.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows against the gothic stonework of the venerable London institution.  Built in 1822, the hospital had witnessed centuries of sickness and healing, its very stones breathing with the echoes of whispered prayers and stifled sobs. Tonight, however, an unusual tension hung in the air, a palpable sense of unease that went beyond the usual anxieties of a hospital night.  The fog, thick and swirling like a restless spirit, clung to the wrought-iron gates and obscured the view of the dimly lit Thames just beyond.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frosty air, pulled his collar higher and quickened his pace, the rhythmic thud of his boots echoing ominously in the silent courtyard. He had a feeling tonight was going to be one he wouldn't soon forget.
