The rain was coming down in sheets, mirroring the despair pooling in Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s worn-out sneakers.  Neon signs from the other businesses on Bleecker Street blurred through the downpour, reflecting in the slick black asphalt. The only sounds competing with the drumming rain were the rhythmic *thwack* of the kitchen door swinging open and closed as harried cooks pushed out orders and the occasional, exasperated sigh from Sal, the owner of Sal’s Famous Slice, as he wiped down the already spotless counter for the tenth time that hour. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the red and white checkered tablecloths and the mostly empty booths. It was a Tuesday night in late November, the kind of night that smelled of wet wool and impending winter, and the kind of night that usually meant meager tips for Mia.
