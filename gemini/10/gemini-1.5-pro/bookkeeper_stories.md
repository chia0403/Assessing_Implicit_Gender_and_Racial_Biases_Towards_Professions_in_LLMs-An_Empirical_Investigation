The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Amelia Prudence Holloway's meticulously organized desk, illuminating columns of figures in her neat, precise hand.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the Grimshaw Building, a five-story brick behemoth that squatted on the corner of Bleak Street and Shadow Lane in the perpetually overcast city of New Birmingham.  It was 1888, and the fog, a near-constant companion in this industrial metropolis, clung to the cobbled streets like a shroud, muffling the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the cries of street vendors.  Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, dipped her pen in the inkwell, a tiny frown creasing her brow.  The accounts of Grimshaw & Sons Foundry weren't balancing, and a discrepancy of two shillings and sixpence was gnawing at her like a persistent toothache.  She prided herself on her accuracy, her ability to bring order to the chaos of numbers, and this imbalance felt like a personal affront.
