The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, PhD, RD,  sending stray auburn curls escaping from her meticulously pinned bun across her chapped lips. She tugged her thick wool coat tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and wet earth filling her nostrils.  Eleanor, a nutritionist known throughout the Hudson Valley for her no-nonsense approach to healthy eating and her uncanny ability to coax even the most stubborn eaters into enjoying kale smoothies, found the bleak beauty of the late autumn landscape strangely soothing.  She stood on the wide, wraparound porch of Blackwood Manor, a dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning gray waters of the Hudson River.  The peeling paint, the boarded-up windows, and the general air of neglect spoke volumes about the manor's current inhabitants, or rather, its singular inhabitant:  the reclusive and eccentric artist, Julian Thorne, who had summoned Eleanor to his crumbling kingdom for reasons unknown.
