The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford. Gargoyles, slick with rain, leered down from the medieval stonework, and the leaded windows of the library glowed with a warm, inviting light.  It was just past five on a Thursday afternoon, and the usual hush of scholarly pursuit had fallen over the ancient institution.  Alistair, however, felt anything but peaceful.  The crumpled letter in his pocket, an invitation to a remote manor house in the Scottish Highlands, weighed heavily on his mind, a portent of something unsettling he couldn't quite grasp.  The sender, a reclusive historian he’d corresponded with only briefly, had promised a glimpse at a discovery that would “rewrite history itself.”  Alistair, a specialist in forgotten languages and arcane texts, had initially dismissed it as the ramblings of a crank. But the cryptic postscript – a single word in a language he'd thought extinct – had piqued his curiosity, drawing him away from the familiar comfort of his dusty books and into a world of shadows and unanswered questions.
