The diesel grumbled like a caged bear, shaking the cab of the Peterbilt 389 as Dale "Grizzly" Grierson wrestled it to life.  The pre-dawn sky over the Flying J truck stop in Barstow, California, was a bruised purple, streaked with thin bands of orange promising a scorching Mojave day.  Grizzly, a mountain of a man with a grizzled beard to match his nickname, adjusted the brim of his faded John Deere cap and exhaled, a plume of vapor disappearing into the dry air.  He had a long haul ahead of him, a load of avocados destined for Chicago, and the thought of 3,000 miles of asphalt ribboning out before him was both exhilarating and daunting.  He took a long swig of lukewarm coffee from his thermos, the metallic tang a familiar comfort, and grabbed his CB microphone.  "Breaker one-nine, this is Grizzly, anyone out there on the rubber ducky lane?" He paused, listening to the static hiss.  "Heading eastbound, looking for company.  Over."
