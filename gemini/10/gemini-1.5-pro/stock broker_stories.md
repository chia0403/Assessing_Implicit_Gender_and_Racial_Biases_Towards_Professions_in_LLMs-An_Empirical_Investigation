The rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's forty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Below, the Chicago skyline glittered, a jagged archipelago of light in the encroaching dusk.  Elias, his tie loosened, his tailored suit rumpled from a day wrestling with volatile markets, stared out at the storm, a half-eaten container of lukewarm General Tso's chicken forgotten on his mahogany desk.  It was a Friday night, the kind most people celebrated with laughter and libations, but for Elias, the week's anxieties clung to him like the damp Chicago air.  The Dow had plunged, taking a chunk of his clients' portfolios – and his commission – with it.  He'd fielded calls all day from panicked investors, their voices laced with accusation and fear. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his Montblanc pen against the desk was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, a counterpoint to the city’s muffled roar.  This wasn't just another bad day on the market; this felt…different.  Like the calm before a financial hurricane.
