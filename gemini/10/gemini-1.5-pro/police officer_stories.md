The relentless New Orleans humidity clung to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz like a second skin, plastering her dark hair to the back of her neck.  Spanish moss dripped from the ancient live oaks lining Esplanade Avenue, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cracked pavement.  A lone streetcar clattered past, its bell a mournful clang in the pre-dawn quiet.  Izzy stood on the wrought-iron balcony of a decaying mansion, the sickly sweet scent of decay wafting up from the overgrown courtyard below.  A single flickering gas lamp illuminated the scene: a body sprawled on the flagstones, a crimson stain blooming across the aged stone like a grotesque orchid.  This was Izzy's third murder this month, each more bizarre than the last, and the unease that had been a low hum in her gut was now a full-blown symphony of dread.
