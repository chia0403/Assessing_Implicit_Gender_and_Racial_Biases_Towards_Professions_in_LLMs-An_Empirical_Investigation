The biting November wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's charcoal grey coat around his legs as he ascended the steps of the grand, yet decaying, Blackwood Manor. Gargoyles, weathered and chipped, leered down from the eaves, their stony gazes seemingly fixed on him.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic, clung to the back of his throat. Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, had been abandoned for decades, shrouded in local legend and whispered rumours of a dark past.  Now, bathed in the weak afternoon sun, it stood as a stark silhouette against the bruised sky, awaiting Elias's expertise. He was here to unravel the mystery of a recently discovered skeleton, hidden within its crumbling walls, a mystery that had baffled even the seasoned detectives of the North Yorkshire Police.  Elias adjusted his leather satchel, the weight of his professional tools a familiar comfort against the unsettling atmosphere of the place, and pushed open the heavy oak door, its groan echoing the disquiet in his own heart.
