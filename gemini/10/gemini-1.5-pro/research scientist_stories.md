The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Aris Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy steel door closed against the gale.  Ice crystals, fine as diamond dust, stung her exposed cheeks.  The McMurdo Station research outpost, a cluster of prefabricated buildings huddled on the volcanic rock of Ross Island, felt less like a scientific haven and more like a metal cage rattling in the jaws of a frozen beast. Inside the brightly lit, sterile confines of Lab 4, the constant hum of machinery was a stark contrast to the howling wilderness outside. Aris, bundled in her thermal layers, exhaled, a small cloud of condensation forming momentarily in the dry, recycled air.  The faint green glow of the aurora australis painted the frosted windows, a breathtakingly beautiful yet ominous reminder of their isolation at the bottom of the world.  Tonight, Aris wasn't studying the celestial lights; she was preoccupied with something far stranger, something lurking in the depths of the ice shelves, something that defied all known biological principles.
