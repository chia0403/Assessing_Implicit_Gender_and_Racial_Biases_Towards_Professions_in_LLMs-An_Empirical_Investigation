The humid Miami air hung heavy, clinging to Eliza Beatriz Hernandez like a damp towel as she surveyed her 6:00 AM "Sunrise Sculpt" class.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically in the pre-dawn breeze just beyond the open-air studio perched on the rooftop of the Biscayne Bay Grand Hotel.  Below, the city was still waking, a muted symphony of car horns and distant sirens barely audible over the thrumming bass emanating from Eliza's portable speaker.  A kaleidoscope of neon yoga mats dotted the weathered wooden deck, each occupied by a dedicated (or perhaps just desperate) soul seeking a dose of fitness before the Florida sun unleashed its full fury. Eliza, clad in vibrant turquoise leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her headset microphone. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, a testament to the energetic warm-up she'd just led.  Her dark curls were pulled back in a high ponytail, revealing the sharp angles of her cheekbones and the determined glint in her hazel eyes. "Alright, my warriors," she boomed, her voice surprisingly powerful for her petite frame. "Time to chisel those abs and sculpt those glutes!"
