The flickering fluorescent lights of the Darrow & Sons Drafting office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of pencils on vellum. Dust motes danced in the pale rectangles cast by the tall windows overlooking Cleveland's industrial Flats.  Here, amidst the scent of blueprint ink and stale coffee, Elias Thorne meticulously rendered the cross-section of a bridge support, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Elias, a man of quiet routine and precise measurements, preferred this kind of day.  The quiet allowed him to focus, the cold sharpened his senses.  But today, a disquiet hummed beneath the surface of the usual calm, a feeling he couldn't quite put his finger on, like a misplaced dimension line on a carefully crafted drawing.
