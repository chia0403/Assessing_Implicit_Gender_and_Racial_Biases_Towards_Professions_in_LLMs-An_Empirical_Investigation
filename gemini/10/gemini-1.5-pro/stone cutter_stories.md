The biting wind whipped off the granite peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the near-constant whisper of falling snow.  The small village of Whisperstone huddled in the mountain's shadow, its houses built low and sturdy from the very rock the wind carried.  Smoke curled lazily from chimneys, a testament to the fires burning within, offering a stark contrast to the unforgiving landscape.  Here, nestled against the cliff face in a workshop carved directly into the stone, worked Elias Thorne. His calloused hands, rough as the granite he shaped, moved with a practiced grace, coaxing beauty from the unyielding stone.  The rhythmic clang of his chisel against the rock echoed through the otherwise silent workshop, a counterpoint to the wind's mournful song.  Today, Elias wasn't working on a grave marker or a lintel for one of the village homes.  Today, he was working on something... different.  Something that held the weight of a secret, a secret as heavy as the granite block before him.
