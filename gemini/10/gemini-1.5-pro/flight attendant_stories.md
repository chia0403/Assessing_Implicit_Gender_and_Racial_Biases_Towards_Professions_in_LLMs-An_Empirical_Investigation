The stale recirculated air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the scent of cheap coffee and someoneâ€™s overly enthusiastic application of duty-free perfume.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez smoothed down the crisp navy of her uniform jacket, a practiced smile fixed on her face as she navigated the narrow aisle of the Embraer E175.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport was a bruised purple, hinting at the bitter February cold that awaited them. Flight 428 to Bismarck, North Dakota, was already delayed by twenty minutes due to a de-icing issue, and the palpable frustration radiating from the passengers was starting to thicken the air as much as the perfume.  Mia, however, remained outwardly unfazed.  Seven years of navigating cramped quarters and disgruntled travelers had honed her ability to project an aura of serene competence, even when she was internally counting down the seconds until she could escape to the relative peace of the galley.  This particular flight was just the first leg of a four-leg day, and a long one at that.  Bismarck, then Fargo, followed by a quick turnaround in Sioux Falls, and finally back to Minneapolis.  She just hoped the weather cooperated.  A blizzard was brewing in the Dakotas, and the last thing Mia needed was to be stranded in Fargo overnight.
