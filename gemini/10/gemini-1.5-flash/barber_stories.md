The scent of Bay Rum and old leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sun-bleached window overlooking Elm Street, danced in the amber light filtering through the grimy glass.  Barty, his hands stained a permanent mahogany from years of wielding shears and straight razors, meticulously swept a stray hair from the worn, crimson velvet upholstery of his barber chair.  Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood hummed with the low thrum of a summer afternoon â€“ the lazy drone of cicadas competing with the distant clatter of a passing milk float.  But inside Butterfield's, time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace, a rhythm dictated by the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Barty's clippers and the hushed confidences shared between him and his clientele.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of the shop was punctuated by an unsettling silence, a stillness that prickled at Barty's usually calm demeanor.
