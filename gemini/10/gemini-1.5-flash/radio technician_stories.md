The static crackled, a familiar hiss that Elias Thorne, Jr. had grown to tolerate as much as he tolerated the perpetual dampness clinging to the walls of his workshop.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle building, each drop a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of the storm.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone, soldering flux, and something indefinably *old* – the aroma of decades spent wrestling with defunct electronics and the ghosts of forgotten broadcasts. Elias, perched on a stool amidst a chaotic landscape of disassembled radios, oscilloscopes, and half-finished projects, frowned at the flickering dial of a vintage Zenith.  The storm, it seemed, wasn't just outside; it was brewing inside the machine itself.  This wasn't just static; this was something… else.
