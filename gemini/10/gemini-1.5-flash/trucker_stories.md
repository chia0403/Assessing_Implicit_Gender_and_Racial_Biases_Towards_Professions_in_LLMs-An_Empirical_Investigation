The biting wind whipped across the vast, snow-dusted plains of Saskatchewan, stinging Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's cheeks raw.  His breath plumed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the already limited visibility as he wrestled the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, a battered but beloved Kenworth named "Betsy."  The headlights of Betsy cut twin swaths through the swirling blizzard, illuminating only a small, treacherous portion of the endless highway stretching before him like a frozen ribbon.  The radio crackled with static, punctuated by the occasional, distorted voice of a dispatcher, their words swallowed by the howling wind.  Bart, his thick, calloused fingers gripping the wheel, felt the familiar knot of tension tighten in his stomach.  This wasn't just a snowstorm; this was a white-out, the kind that could swallow a man whole and leave no trace.  He'd been driving for twenty years, seen his share of bad weather, but thisâ€¦ this felt different.  This felt like the end of the road.
