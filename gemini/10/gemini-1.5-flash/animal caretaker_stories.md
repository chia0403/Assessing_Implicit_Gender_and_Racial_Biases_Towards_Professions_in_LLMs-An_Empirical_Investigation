The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overpowered tonight by the sharp tang of woodsmoke and something elseâ€¦ something faintly metallic, like old blood.  Mia squinted into the gathering dusk, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawing at the bruised purple sky above the sprawling acreage of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary.  Whispering Pines wasn't whispering tonight; it was howling a mournful, uneasy tune.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, was a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, a sprawling network of enclosures, rehabilitation centers, and rambling forested pathways.  But tonight, the usual quiet symphony of nocturnal creatures was replaced by a disturbing silence, broken only by the relentless wind and the frantic thump-thump-thump of Mia's own heart.
