The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent of antiseptic and pine – a strangely comforting combination – hit her immediately, battling the icy air that seeped in with each gust.  Inside, the clinic was a haven of controlled warmth, the low hum of the aquarium in the reception area a counterpoint to the frantic chirping of a caged parakeet.  Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking the churning grey waters of Alder Creek, blurring the already fading light of a late afternoon.  Eleanor, her breath misting in the air, pulled off her damp gloves, the familiar weight of her worn leather satchel a welcome anchor against the storm brewing both outside and, she suspected, within the clinic’s walls.  This was Alder Creek, a small, isolated coastal town where everyone knew everyone else's business, and often their pets' ailments as well. And tonight, something felt different, something heavier than the usual winter gloom.
