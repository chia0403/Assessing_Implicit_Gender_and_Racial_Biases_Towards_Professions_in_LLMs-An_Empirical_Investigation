The chipped paint of the front door, a faded robin's egg blue clinging desperately to the warped wood, was the first clue.  Then came the overgrown ivy, strangling the Victorian façade like a verdant serpent, and finally, the unsettling silence emanating from within number 13 Grimstone Lane.  Amelia Hawthorne, renowned interior decorator and connoisseur of all things aesthetically pleasing, felt a tremor of unease, a stark contrast to the usually exhilarating thrill of a new project.  This wasn't just a derelict house; it was a mausoleum draped in melancholic creepers, whispering stories of forgotten grandeur and, Amelia suspected, a hefty dose of unsettling history. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else… something faintly metallic, like old blood.
