The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of Elias Thorne's tailoring shop. Elias, a man whose life was measured in the precise fall of a needle and the whisper of fine silk, hunched over his workbench, the dim light of a single oil lamp casting long shadows across his meticulously organised tools.  Dust motes, illuminated by the lamp's weak glow, danced in the stillness of the room, each a tiny, swirling testament to the years Elias had spent within these four walls, surrounded by bolts of fabric, half-finished garments, and the ghosts of countless clients.  The shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually shadowed district of Oakhaven, felt more like a sanctuary than a place of business â€“ a quiet refuge from the bustling, often brutal, life beyond its aged oak door.
