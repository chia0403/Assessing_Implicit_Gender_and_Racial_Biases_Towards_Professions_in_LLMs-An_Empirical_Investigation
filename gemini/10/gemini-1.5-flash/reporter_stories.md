The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic pounding in Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's chest.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, a smell that clung to everything in the sweltering humidity of the Guatemalan rainforest.

The humid darkness pressed in, broken only by the flickering beam of her headlamp, revealing the rough-hewn walls adorned with faded religious icons and a single, wilting orchid in a chipped ceramic pot. This wasn't the glamorous assignment she'd envisioned when she'd pitched the story – the disappearance of a renowned archaeologist – but the further she delved, the more certain she was that this forgotten corner of the world held a truth far darker than she could have imagined.
