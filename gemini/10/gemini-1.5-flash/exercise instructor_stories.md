The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez like a second skin as she unlocked the doors to "Body & Soul Fitness."  The air inside the small, independent gym was thick with the scent of sweat-dampened linoleum and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder of last night’s grueling Muay Thai session.  Outside, the Los Angeles sky was still a bruised purple, hinting at the fiery sunrise that would soon paint the city in vibrant hues. Amy, however, was far from vibrant.  Her normally bright eyes, usually sparkling with enthusiastic energy, were shadowed with exhaustion, a stark contrast to the cheerful "Rise and Grind!" motivational poster plastered above the reception desk. The only sound was the rhythmic hum of the refrigerator in the corner, quietly dispensing its icy contents to the empty water cooler.  Today, Amy felt anything but ready to grind.
