The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Serenity Hair Studio.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that sliced through the gloom of the otherwise dimly lit salon.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the shop, a relentless percussion against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s shears. Amelia, with her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of colours from years of wrestling with unruly hair and experimental dyes, worked with a focused intensity that belied the chaos swirling around her.  Her salon, nestled in the cobbled alleyway behind the bustling marketplace of Oakhaven, was as much a refuge as it was a business; a haven for the city's eccentrics, the heartbroken, and the simply weary seeking solace in a good haircut and a sympathetic ear.
