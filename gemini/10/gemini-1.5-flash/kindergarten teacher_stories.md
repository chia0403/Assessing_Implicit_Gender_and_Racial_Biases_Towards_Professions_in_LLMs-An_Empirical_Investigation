The chipped paint of the rainbow-striped wall seemed to sigh with the humid July air, clinging to Ms. Eleanor Vance like a second skin.  Sunlight, thick and golden, slanted through the dusty windowpanes of Sunflower Kindergarten, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the otherwise silent classroom.  The air, usually buzzing with the chaotic energy of twenty-five five-year-olds, hung heavy and still.  Crayon shavings, scattered like fallen confetti across the brightly colored carpet, were the only evidence of the recent eruption of creative chaos, now slumbering under the spell of the summer heat.  Eleanor, her usually vibrant red dress wilting slightly in the oppressive humidity, sat at her desk, the scent of old glue and dried paint a familiar comfort in the unexpectedly quiet room.  A half-finished letter to her sister lay abandoned, overshadowed by the oppressive stillness that felt more unsettling than peaceful.
