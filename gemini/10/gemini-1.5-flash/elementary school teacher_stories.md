The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s Third Grade” sign flaked onto the already-dusty windowsill, a miniature metaphor for the state of Eleanor’s spirit on this particular Monday morning.  October in Willow Creek, Ohio, was usually a symphony of vibrant autumn leaves and the comforting scent of woodsmoke, but this year, a damp chill clung to everything, mirroring the icy dread in Eleanor’s heart.  The air inside Willow Creek Elementary hummed with the low thrum of restless children, a sound usually music to her ears, but today it grated on her frayed nerves like nails on a chalkboard.  The scent of overripe apples from the overflowing fruit bowl on her desk only served to amplify the sour taste in her mouth.  The year was shaping up to be…challenging, to put it mildly.
