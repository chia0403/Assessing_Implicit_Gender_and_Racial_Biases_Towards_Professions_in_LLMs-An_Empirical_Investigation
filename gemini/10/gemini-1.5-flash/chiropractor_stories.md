The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee straight off the churning Atlantic, threatened to tear the whole thing from its moorings.  Her small, shingle-sided building, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the perpetually tempestuous coastline of Cornwall, groaned in protest.  Inside, the comforting aroma of lavender and eucalyptus struggled to compete with the pervasive scent of brine and seaweed.  Eleanor, her auburn hair whipped around her like a fiery halo, finally secured the awning, a small victory against the elements that mirrored the tiny triumphs she achieved daily, easing the aches and pains of the rugged Cornish folk who sought her healing touch.  The sign, slightly askew despite her efforts, still proclaimed: *Vance Chiropractic:  Relieving the Strain of the Coast*.  This was her life, her sanctuary, and her battleground, all rolled into one spectacularly windswept package.
