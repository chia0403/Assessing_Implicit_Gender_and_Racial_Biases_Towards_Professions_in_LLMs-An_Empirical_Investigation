The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslight-flickering lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the anxious sheen on Finley “Finn” O’Malley’s forehead.  Finn, a bellhop whose uniform – once crisp, now slightly rumpled – hung loosely on his lean frame, nervously adjusted the worn leather strap of his luggage cart. The air hung thick with the scent of aged mahogany, pipe tobacco, and something indefinably… unsettling.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ornate windows and hinting at the storm brewing beyond the gilded facade of the Grand Majestic.  Tonight, however, the storm felt far more internal than external, a tempest brewing in the gut of the city and reflected in the nervous twitch of Finn’s left eye.  He’d been expecting a late-night check-in, a particularly demanding guest, according to the night manager’s cryptic note, but this… this felt different.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, was heavier than any storm.
