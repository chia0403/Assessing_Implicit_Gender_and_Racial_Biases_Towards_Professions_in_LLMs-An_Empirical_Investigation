The rasping shriek of metal on metal sliced through the pre-dawn stillness, a sound Elias Thorne, Jr. had grown intimately familiar with over his twenty-two years patching potholes along the sun-baked asphalt of Interstate 40.  The relentless Arizona sun already gnawed at the edges of the desert, painting the sky in bruised purples and angry oranges even before the first rays broke the horizon.  Elias, his face already slick with sweat despite the early hour, squinted at the approaching semi-truck, its oversized tires spitting gravel as it thundered past his work zone.  The air, thick with the scent of diesel and scorching earth, vibrated with the truck's power, a stark contrast to the quiet hum of his own battered pickup, parked a safe distance away, its bed overflowing with tar and patching material.  Today's target: a particularly nasty crater swallowing up a lane near mile marker 217, a black hole promising broken axles and frayed tempers.
