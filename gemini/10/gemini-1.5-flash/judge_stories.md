The air hung thick and cloying, a humid blanket woven with the scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic rhythm against the backdrop of the city's low hum, a sound Judge Anya Sharma was intimately familiar with after twenty years presiding over the courts of Mumbai.

Rohan Desai* – a name that already felt like a bitter taste in her mouth.
