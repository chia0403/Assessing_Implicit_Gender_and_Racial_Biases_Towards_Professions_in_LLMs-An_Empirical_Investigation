The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of blood and sawdust and something indefinably *old*, clinging to the rafters of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop like a stubborn shroud.  Barty, a man whose girth suggested a lifetime spent wrestling sides of beef rather than paperwork, wiped his brow with the back of a hand perpetually stained crimson.  His shop, Butterfield's Best, sat nestled on the crooked cobblestone street of Oakhaven, a village so quaint it bordered on clich√©, tucked away in a valley where the mist clung low and long, even on the sunniest of days.  The bell above the door, a tarnished brass monstrosity that sounded more like a dying cough than a welcoming chime, hadn't jingled in what felt like hours, a silence that gnawed at Barty more than any hungry wolf ever had.  Outside, the wind whispered through the ancient oaks that gave the village its name, their leaves rustling secrets only the oldest stones could understand.  And Barty, with his cleaver resting heavily on the worn wooden block, knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something was about to break that unnerving quiet.
