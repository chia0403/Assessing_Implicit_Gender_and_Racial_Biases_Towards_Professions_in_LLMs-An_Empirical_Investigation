The scent of rain-soaked petrichor hung heavy in the air, a damp perfume clinging to the vibrant blooms crammed into the greenhouse.  It was a scent Aurelia “Rella” Hawthorne adored, a subtle counterpoint to the intoxicating fragrance of lilies, roses, and jasmine that usually dominated her world. Rella, owner of "Petal & Stem," a small but wildly popular florist shop nestled in the cobbled heart of the quaint seaside village of Seabrook, shivered despite the warmth radiating from the greenhouse's ancient heating system. Outside, the grey November sky threatened another downpour, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  Seabrook, usually a picture of postcard-perfect charm, felt oddly menacing tonight, the usually cheerful gaslights casting long, skeletal shadows across the wet streets.  Rella’s normally meticulous shop felt chaotic, a vibrant but unsettling kaleidoscope of color and scent, reflecting the uncertainty swirling within her.
