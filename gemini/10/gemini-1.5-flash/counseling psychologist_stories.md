The chipped paint on the windowsill was a surprisingly comforting shade of faded teal, a colour Dr. Eleanor Vance found herself studying more often lately.  Rain lashed against the glass of her small, book-lined office in the converted attic space above "The Cozy Kettle" tea shop on Bleecker Street.  The rhythmic drumming was a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Eleanorâ€™s pen on her notepad, a rhythm born of the unsettling silence that hung heavy between her and her patient, Mr. Henderson, whose grief-stricken face was almost swallowed by the shadow cast by the single, flickering desk lamp.  The scent of Earl Grey, strong and comforting, drifted up from downstairs, a bittersweet reminder of the normalcy Eleanor herself seemed to be losing.  Outside, the New York City night raged; inside, a different kind of storm brewed.
