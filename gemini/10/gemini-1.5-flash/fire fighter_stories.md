The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Lieutenant Elias Thorneâ€™s throat, a familiar companion on nights like these.  Above, the bruised purple of twilight bled into a sky choked with the greasy smoke billowing from the smoldering pines.  The air vibrated with the low crackle of the flames, a sinister lullaby that underscored the frantic rhythm of axes biting into wood and the hiss of water against burning timber.  Thorne, his face streaked with soot and sweat, gripped his hose nozzle, the metal cold against his gloved hand.  He stood on the edge of the inferno, the flames licking hungrily at the base of the ancient Redwood National Park, a silent testament to the relentless power of nature, and the desperate fight to contain it.  The roar of the fire was almost deafening, punctuated only by the sharp cries of panicked wildlife fleeing the encroaching heat.
