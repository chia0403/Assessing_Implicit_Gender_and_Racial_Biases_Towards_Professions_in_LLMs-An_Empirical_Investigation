The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s grey hair across his weathered face as he wrestled a stubborn timber beam into place.  Above him, the skeletal frame of the new lighthouse clawed at the bruised, pewter sky.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, carried the mournful cry of gulls circling the jagged, granite cliffs of Illume Head.  Below, the churning Atlantic gnawed relentlessly at the base of the promontory, a constant, thundering reminder of the unforgiving power of the sea.  Elias, his calloused hands slick with sweat and resin, grunted with effort, the rhythmic clang of his hammer echoing against the stark, windswept landscape.  The lighthouse, a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness, was Elias's masterpiece, his testament to a life spent battling the elements, both at sea and on land.
