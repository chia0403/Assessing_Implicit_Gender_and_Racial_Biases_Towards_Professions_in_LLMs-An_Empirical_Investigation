The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s hands, a meager comfort against the November chill seeping through the single-paned window of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the relentless drumming of anxiety that had become the soundtrack to her days lately.  Her office, nestled in the attic of a rambling Victorian house on the edge of Ashwood, was a space of deliberate mismatched charm: a worn Persian rug sat atop the creaking floorboards, a collection of oddly shaped succulents struggled in mismatched terracotta pots on the windowsill, and the scent of old books and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the stormy sky, their silhouettes etched starkly against the bruised purple of the twilight.  The only sound besides the rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hallway below, a metronome counting down to something she couldn't quite name.  Tonight, it felt especially ominous.
