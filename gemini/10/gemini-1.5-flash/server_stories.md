Red-checkered tablecloths stretched across a room buzzing with the clatter of cutlery, the murmur of conversations, and the occasional, strained laugh from a customer wrestling with a particularly stubborn wine cork.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a pale, unforgiving glow on the peeling wallpaper depicting a cartoonishly happy family enjoying – you guessed it –  lasagna.  Amelia, however, felt far from happy.  Tonight felt like a particularly brutal test of her already fraying patience.
