The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorneâ€™s cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn, grey cloak, the rough wool scratching against his already chapped skin.  Xylos, they called it the Weeping Land, and for good reason.

Valerius shifted his weight, the cold seeping into the very bone of him, and adjusted the grip on his halberd.  He was the last outpost, the lone sentinel between the crumbling ramparts of Fort Aethelred and whatever lurked beyond the whispering plains.  Tonight, however, the whispering felt more like a scream.
