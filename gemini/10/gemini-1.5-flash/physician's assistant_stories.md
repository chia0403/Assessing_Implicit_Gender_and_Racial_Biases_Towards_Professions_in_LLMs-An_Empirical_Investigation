The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the scent of woodsmoke and brine clinging to the damp air.  Salt spray, tasting faintly of seaweed and something indefinably ancient, stung her lips.  She pulled her worn wool scarf tighter, the collar of her peacoat scratching against her already chapped neck.  The gaslights of Port Blossom, Maine, flickered weakly against the gathering dusk, casting long, skeletal shadows from the crooked, weather-beaten houses that huddled together like gossiping old women.  Amelia, a physician’s assistant at the small, perpetually understaffed Blossom Bay Clinic, was late, a fact that gnawed at her already frayed nerves.  The rhythmic clang of the harbor bell, a mournful counterpoint to the wind’s howl, served only to amplify her anxiety.  Tonight, the urgency felt different, heavier than the usual rural emergency calls.  This time, it was personal.
