The chipped porcelain cherub holding a flickering tea light cast a jaundiced glow across the mahogany desk, illuminating the meticulously organised chaos of Amelia Katherine Finch's workspace.  The air in the opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hung thick with the scent of aged leather, expensive perfume, and something indefinably… Parisian.  Outside, the relentless Parisian rain hammered against the vast arched windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour wash of greys and blues.  Amelia,  Hotel Grand Majestic's head concierge, a woman whose elegance was as sharp and polished as the silver buttons on her impeccably tailored uniform, sighed, the sound barely audible above the drumming rain.  Her perfectly manicured hand reached for the next entry on her overflowing list – a request for a private viewing of the Mona Lisa, followed by a bespoke truffle-hunting experience in the Perigord region.  Just another Tuesday.
