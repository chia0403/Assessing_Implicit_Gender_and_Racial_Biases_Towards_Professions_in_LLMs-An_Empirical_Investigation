The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, RN.  It clung to the crisp, white fabric of her scrubs, a second skin she’d worn for the past fifteen years at St. Jude’s Memorial Hospital.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the nurses' station, blurring the cityscape into a hazy, grey impression.  Inside, the usual frenetic energy of a busy Tuesday night was amplified by a palpable sense of unease.  A low hum of anxious whispers drifted from the adjacent emergency room, punctuated by the sharp beeps of heart monitors and the urgent calls of doctors.  Eleanor, however, remained an island of calm amidst the storm, her dark eyes scanning the patient charts with a practiced efficiency that belied the gnawing feeling in her gut – a feeling that tonight was different.  This wasn't just another Tuesday at St. Jude's.
