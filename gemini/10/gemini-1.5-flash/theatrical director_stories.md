The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Elara Vance, Director of the crumbling Majestic Playhouse, could truly appreciate.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously above the stage, danced in the shafts of weak moonlight filtering through the grimy skylight.  Cracks spiderwebbed across the faded crimson velvet curtain, mirroring the fissures in Elara’s own carefully constructed composure.  Tonight, the Majestic – a once-grand dame of the theatrical world, now teetering on the brink of demolition – was hosting not a glittering premiere, but a desperate, last-ditch attempt at salvation: a benefit performance of Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, a play as chaotic and unpredictable as Elara's current life.
