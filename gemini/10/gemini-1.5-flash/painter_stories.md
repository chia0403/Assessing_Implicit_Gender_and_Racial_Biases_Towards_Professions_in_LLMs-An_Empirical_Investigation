The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He stood perched precariously on the jagged rocks of Penberth Cove, the wind whipping his already unruly brown hair across his eyes.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Below, the churning turquoise water crashed against the granite cliffs, a chaotic ballet of foam and shadow.  Elias, however, was oblivious to the dramatic spectacle.  His gaze was fixed on the bruised purple and fiery orange of the setting sun, its reflection shimmering like molten gold on the wet rocks, a spectacle he was desperately trying to capture on his weathered canvas.  His easel, a sturdy, if slightly battered, piece of oak, braced against the wind, held a painting that already hummed with the raw energy of the Cornish coast.
