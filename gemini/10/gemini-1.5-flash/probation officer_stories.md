The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room was a perfect match for the weary resignation etched onto Elias Thorne’s face.  Elias, a man whose forty years had left him looking closer to fifty, slumped back in his creaky chair, the fluorescent lights humming a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his pen against the overflowing paperwork on his desk.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the building, located on the bleak, industrial fringe of Grimsborough, a city that seemed perpetually shrouded in a miasma of exhaust fumes and forgotten dreams.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the lingering despair of lives gone awry, a familiar perfume to Elias, a man who spent his days navigating the treacherous currents of second chances and shattered expectations.  Today, however, felt particularly heavy, the weight of a case file thicker than any he’d encountered in his decade with the Grimsborough Probation Department pressing down on him like a physical burden.  His next appointment was scheduled for 3 pm, a young man named Arthur Jenkins, convicted of grand theft auto, and Elias already felt the familiar knot of apprehension tightening in his stomach. This wasn't just another case; it was a ticking clock, and the hands were moving too fast.
