The wind, a rasping chisel against the granite cliffs of the Mourne Mountains, whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face.  He squinted, his eyes, the colour of chipped flint, tracing the intricate network of fissures in the grey stone before him.  The air, thick with the scent of rain and pulverized rock, hung heavy and cold, a familiar blanket draped over the desolate beauty of County Down.  Elias, a man whose life was etched as deeply into the stone as the carvings he created, adjusted the worn leather strap of his hammer, its familiar weight a comfort in the biting wind.  For fifty years, the Mournes had been his canvas, and the granite, his palette.  Today, however, the canvas felt different, the paletteâ€¦ unsettling. A tremor, barely perceptible, ran through the earth, a shiver that seemed to resonate within the very heart of the mountain itself.
