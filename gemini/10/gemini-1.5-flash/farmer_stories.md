The rasping cough that rattled Elias Thorne’s chest echoed the dry, brittle sound of the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the dead oak at the edge of his field.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around his worn boots as he surveyed his parched acreage.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down on the cracked earth of Thorne’s Farm, baking the already-withering corn stalks to a crisp.
