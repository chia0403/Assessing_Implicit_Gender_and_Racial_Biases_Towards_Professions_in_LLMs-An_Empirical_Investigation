The chipped porcelain teacup rattled in Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's hand, the tremor barely perceptible against the shuddering rhythm of the old gramophone in the corner. Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of her attic studio, mimicking the frantic tempo of the jazz tune spilling from the horn â€“ a melody as melancholic as the grey November sky pressing down on the cobbled streets of Prague.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously overhead, danced in the air, swirling like the ghosts of forgotten performances.  Sera, her crimson hair a fiery contrast to the muted greys of the room, hunched over a worn leather-bound notebook, its pages filled with lyrics scrawled in a spidery script, a half-finished melody nagging at the edges of her mind. The scent of damp plaster and old paper hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to this forgotten sanctuary, a refuge from the glittering, demanding world of Prague's burgeoning music scene that awaited her downstairs.
