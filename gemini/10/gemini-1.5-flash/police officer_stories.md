The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s face as the wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of Blackrock Beach.  The sky, a bruised purple mirroring the churning grey sea, threatened further misery.  Rain, fat and unforgiving, lashed down, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the jagged cliffs that guarded the coastline like skeletal fingers.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and something else, something acrid and unsettling that pricked at the back of her throat – the metallic tang of blood.  Mia shivered, pulling her threadbare police-issue anorak tighter around her, the damp clinging to her like a second skin.  This wasn't the picturesque Cornish coast the tourists flocked to; this was the raw, unforgiving heart of it, where secrets were buried as deep as the ocean floor.
