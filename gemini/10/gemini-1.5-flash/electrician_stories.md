The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the low thrum of cicadas.  Sweat beaded on Elias Thorne's brow as he wrestled a stubborn length of conduit into place, the rusty metal protesting with a screech that echoed through the cavernous attic of the Dubois Plantation House.  Dust motes, disturbed by his movements, danced in the weak shafts of light filtering through cracks in the aged cypress shingles. Elias, a man built more for the solid ground than precarious heights, cursed softly under his breath, his calloused fingers tightening their grip on the conduit.  The Dubois family, renowned for their eccentricity as much as their wealth, had called him in to rewire the entire plantation â€“ a task that, even for a seasoned electrician like Elias, felt more like an archaeological dig than a simple job. The house itself, a sprawling antebellum monstrosity, seemed to breathe with a life of its own, its shadowed corners whispering tales of forgotten generations.
