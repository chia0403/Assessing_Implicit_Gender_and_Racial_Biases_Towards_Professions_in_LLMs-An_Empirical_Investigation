The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne's calloused fingertips as he meticulously polished a snifter.  The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation – a familiar perfume Elias had come to tolerate, even, in a strange way, appreciate. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the bar, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, orange smear.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering neon sign above the bar – a faded image of a rusty mug overflowing with something that might have once been ale – and the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above the pool table in the corner.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night hubbub was conspicuously absent.  A lone, unshaven man nursed a beer in the dimmest corner, his shoulders hunched against the chill that seemed to seep from the very bricks of the building.  Elias knew this quiet was a prelude to something, something usually unpleasant, something that always found its way to The Rusty Mug.
