The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the squeak of Elias Thorne’s worn sneakers on the polished floor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the beams as Elias, a man whose life seemed permanently coated in a film of grime and weariness, pushed his mop across the vast expanse of polished wood.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, old gym socks, and something vaguely floral – the faint, desperate perfume of a forgotten cheerleader's bouquet, perhaps.  Outside, the October wind howled a mournful song, rattling the windows of the imposing gothic building, a stark contrast to the stifling, echoing silence within the deserted gym.  Elias, however, remained oblivious to the tempest brewing beyond the glass.  He was lost in his own quiet world, a world of discarded water bottles, forgotten basketballs, and the ever-present, comforting weight of routine.
