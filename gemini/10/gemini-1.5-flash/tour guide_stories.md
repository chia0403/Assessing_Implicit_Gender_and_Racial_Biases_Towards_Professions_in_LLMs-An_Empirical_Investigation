The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless rhythm against the backdrop of crumbling Mayan temples, their weathered stones slick with a film of moisture.  Amelia Hernandez, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent under the relentless Yucatecan sun, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, but her eyes, the colour of dark chocolate, gleamed with an infectious enthusiasm as she surveyed her small group of tourists – a boisterous family from Ohio, a quiet Japanese couple, and a lone, slightly dishevelled backpacker who seemed more interested in the lizards darting between the ruins than the historical significance of the site.  This was Chichen Itza, a place Amelia knew as well as the back of her hand, a place that held both breathtaking beauty and secrets whispered on the wind.  Today, however, something felt…different.  A prickling unease settled in the pit of her stomach, a sensation far more potent than the usual humidity.
