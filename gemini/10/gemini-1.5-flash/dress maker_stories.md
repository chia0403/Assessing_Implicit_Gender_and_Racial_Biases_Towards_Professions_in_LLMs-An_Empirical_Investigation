The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to everything in Aurelia "Rella" Hawthorne's tiny shop.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the single, grimy window overlooking Cobblestone Lane, illuminating the rainbow of fabrics stacked high on shelves â€“ velvets the color of a raven's wing, silks the shade of a summer sky, and linens as crisp as freshly fallen snow.  Rella, her nimble fingers flying over a length of emerald green taffeta, hummed a forgotten waltz, the rhythm a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears.  Outside, the cobblestones were slick with a recent rain shower, reflecting the gaslight's hazy glow, but inside, her little haven remained a sanctuary of warmth and creativity, a world away from the grim reality of 1888 London.
