The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel framework of the skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's face and tugging at the frayed edges of his safety harness.  Below, the city sprawled like a chaotic tapestry of light and shadow â€“ a dizzying dance of illuminated skyscrapers, neon-drenched storefronts, and the inky blackness of the river winding its way through the concrete jungle.
