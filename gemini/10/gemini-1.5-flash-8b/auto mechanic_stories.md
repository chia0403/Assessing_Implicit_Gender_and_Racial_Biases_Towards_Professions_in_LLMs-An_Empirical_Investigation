The flickering fluorescent lights of "Rusty Wrench" Auto Repair hummed a mournful tune, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of hammers and the hiss of compressed air.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating grease smudges on the spotless white apron of  Amelia "Amy"  Carter.  Amy, a wiry woman with hands calloused but surprisingly delicate, meticulously adjusted a stubborn bolt on a vintage motorcycle engine.  The workshop, cramped and cluttered, smelled of oil, burnt rubber, and something faintly sweet, likely the lingering aroma of a particularly potent coffee from the diner across the street.  This was her sanctuary, her domain, where the roar of engines and the symphony of metal against metal became her comforting soundtrack.  Today, however, the usual cacophony was subdued, replaced by a strange silence.  Outside, a blanket of thick fog hung heavy over the small town of Oakhaven, obscuring the normally bustling main street.  The usual lunchtime chatter from the local hardware store and bakery had been swallowed by the fog, as if the town itself was holding its breath.  Amy's focus, usually laser-sharp on the task at hand, was haunted by a nagging unease.  A sense of impending something, something indefinable yet unsettling, clung to the air like the damp fog itself.
