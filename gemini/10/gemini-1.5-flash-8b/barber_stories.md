The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped linoleum floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Edge."  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, ethereal butterflies, swirled in the meager light.  A single, sputtering coal fire in the hearth crackled and popped, its warmth a fragile shield against the chill November air that seeped through the gaps in the drafty storefront.

The rhythmic scraping of steel against steel was the only sound in the nearly empty shop, save for the occasional creak of the old building itself.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages echoed on the cobblestones of the bustling, yet strangely quiet, Victorian-era city of Ashworth.
