The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Hayesâ€™s own thoughts.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, school psychologist at Northwood High, stared out the window of her small, cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The relentless grey of the October sky reflected the leaden weight settling on her chest.  A half-eaten granola bar sat forlornly on her desk, a testament to the fragmented hours and the mounting anxieties that accompanied her job.  It had been a particularly brutal week.  Threats of violence had been reported; a rise in student suicides had prompted district-wide crisis meetings; and a new wave of social media bullying was plaguing the student body.  Northwood High, a once-proud institution, felt fragile, vulnerable, like a ship caught in a relentless storm.

The chipped paint on the walls of her office, a faded shade of robin's egg blue, felt as if it bore witness to all the unspoken traumas and hushed anxieties that the students carried within these hallowed halls. Each day, the students walked through these very halls, unaware of the silent battle she waged within her own mind, battling against the relentless tide of despair.
