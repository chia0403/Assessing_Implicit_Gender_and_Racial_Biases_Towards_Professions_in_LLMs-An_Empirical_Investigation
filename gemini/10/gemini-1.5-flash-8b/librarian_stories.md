The chipped porcelain doll, Amelia Peabody, perched precariously on the edge of the antique mahogany desk, its painted eyes staring blankly at the swirling dust motes dancing in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the towering bookshelves of the Grand Library of Oakhaven.  Dust motes, Amelia mused, tiny universes in their own right.  A universe she was intimately familiar with, given her existence within these hallowed halls.  Amelia Mallory, librarian extraordinaire, sighed, the sound swallowed by the hushed whispers of the aged volumes.  It was a Tuesday, a day she normally dedicated to cataloging rare first editions, a routine as comforting as a warm cup of chamomile.  But today, the routine was fractured.  A letter.  A crumpled, yellowed letter resting on her desk, addressed simply, "To Amelia Mallory."  

The library itself was a symphony of muted tones.  Warm, honeyed wood polished smooth by countless generations of readers.  Rows upon rows of books stretched endlessly into the gloom, their spines whispering secrets in faded ink.  Sunlight filtered through the high arched windows, illuminating swirling patterns of dust motes and highlighting the intricate carvings on the library’s ancient stone walls.  A subtle, earthy scent, a blend of aged paper, leather, and forgotten spices, hung heavy in the air.  The faint clinking of porcelain teacups from the quiet tea room reached her, a gentle counterpoint to the quiet hum of the library itself. This particular Tuesday, however, seemed charged with an unspoken tension. Amelia felt it, a strange prickling sensation beneath her skin.  The library, usually a calming refuge, felt almost… expectant.
