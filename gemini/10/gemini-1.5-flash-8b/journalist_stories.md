The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into the threadbare, wool-lined coat.  Rain, the relentless, grey kind that swallowed the light, plastered the cobblestones of the Lower Quarter to a slick, unforgiving surface.  The scent of damp earth and rotting seaweed hung heavy in the air, a perpetual olfactory reminder of the city's precarious existence clinging to the cliffs.  Above, the jagged silhouette of the Citadel, a monument to forgotten glories, loomed, its stone battlements a grim contrast to the misery below.  Em, a journalist for the *Chronicle of the Isles*, pressed her nose against the condensation-fogged window of the dilapidated newsstand, trying to make out the barely legible print on the flyer plastered to the inside.

The year is 1487. The Lower Quarter, a sprawling labyrinth of narrow alleyways and cramped tenements, nestled between the soaring grandeur of the Citadel and the turbulent sea, was her beat.  It was a place where whispered rumors became the loudest cries, where poverty festered and hope sprouted amidst the decay.  Em, with her sharp eyes and even sharper wit, was determined to unearth the truth, no matter how hidden or unpleasant.  This particular flyer, proclaiming the impending arrival of a renowned alchemist, intrigued her.  Was it a miracle worker or a charlatan?  That was the question Em had to answer, a question whispered on the wind and simmering beneath the surface of this rain-soaked city.
