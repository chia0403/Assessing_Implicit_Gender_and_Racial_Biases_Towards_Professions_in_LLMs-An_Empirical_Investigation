The air in "The Crimson Cleaver," hung thick with the scent of rosemary, blood, and something faintly metallic, like old pennies buried in the earth.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the insistent rhythm of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood's own heartbeat.  He wiped a glistening blade on a coarse linen cloth, the sheen catching the single flickering bulb that illuminated the small, dimly lit shop.  Barty Blackwood, butcher of the shadowed alleyways and whispered secrets, felt the familiar knot of apprehension tighten in his gut.  Tonight, the whispers were louder.


Setting:

The Crimson Cleaver, a small, ramshackle butcher shop nestled in the back alleys of a sprawling, perpetually overcast city known only as Veridian.  Cobblestones, cracked and worn, formed the alleyways that wound like dark arteries through the city's heart.  The air, perpetually damp and carrying the cloying perfume of industrial waste, thickened with the scent of the nearby river.  The shop itself, built of weathered wood and stained with the tell-tale marks of countless butchered beasts, seemed to absorb the darkness of the alley, giving off a haunting, almost spectral glow.
