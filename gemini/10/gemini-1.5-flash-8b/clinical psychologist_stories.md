Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The grey light, filtered through the downpour, cast long, unsettling shadows across the meticulously organized shelves lining the walls.  Each item, from the gleaming, polished obsidian of her desk to the meticulously arranged stacks of clinical texts, seemed to hum with a silent pressure.  Dr. Vance, a clinical psychologist with a sharp, almost steely gaze, sat hunched over her latest case file.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain punctuated the anxious drumming in her temples.  Today's appointment with Arthur Penhaligon was crucial.


The office, located on the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the heart of the city's fog-shrouded district, exuded a peculiar blend of sterile professionalism and unsettling decay.  Once a hub of bustling activity, the neighborhood had fallen into a quiet, almost spectral state.  Jagged, graffiti-scarred buildings huddled together like huddled figures, their faces obscured by a perpetual twilight.  A constant, low hum, like a forgotten engine sputtering beneath the city, reverberated through the building, blending with the rhythmic pounding of the rain. The scent of damp earth and stale cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, a scent that Dr. Vance, despite her years of experience, found deeply unsettling.
