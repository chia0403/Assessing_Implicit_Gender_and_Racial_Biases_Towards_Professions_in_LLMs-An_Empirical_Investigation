The flickering fluorescent lights of the Economy Class cabin hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engines.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal fuselage of the Boeing 737, a relentless percussion mirroring the frantic drumming in Amelia Hayes’ chest.  Amelia, a flight attendant with five years of experience and a perpetually tired smile, knew this wasn't a typical flight.  This one was different.  Something about the passengers, their hushed whispers and averted gazes, the way they clung to their belongings as if protecting sacred relics, unnerved her.

The setting was a late autumn evening.  The sky outside was a bruised purple, streaked with streaks of grey, reflecting the ominous mood of the plane.  Amelia’s gaze fell on the swirling vortex of clouds outside the window, a maelstrom that seemed to mirror the tempest brewing inside the cabin.  The cabin itself was cramped and smelled faintly of stale coffee and fear.  Empty seats sat scattered amongst the rows of passengers, as if a sudden exodus had just happened, only to be replaced by an unsettling sense of pending drama.  The plane was scheduled for a short-hop across the Pacific from Tokyo to Seoul. But the unspoken tension hanging in the air was a palpable force, a hush that screamed louder than any words.
