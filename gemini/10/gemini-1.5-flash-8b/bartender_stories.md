The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly green glow over Amelia "Amy"  Kingston's face, highlighting the faint stubble on her chin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding headache throbbing behind her eyes.  The air in the dimly lit bar hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and desperation.  Amy, behind the mahogany bar, felt the familiar weight of the night pressing down on her.  Each clinking glass, each mumbled conversation, each sigh of relief or despair, echoed in the cavernous space.  The Rusty Mug was more than just a bar; it was a temporary refuge, a stage for the lives of its patrons, and tonight, the drama was particularly intense. The small town of Oakhaven, nestled between the whispering pines and the winding river, was a place where secrets were buried deeper than the roots of the ancient oaks and carried along on the relentless currents of time.
