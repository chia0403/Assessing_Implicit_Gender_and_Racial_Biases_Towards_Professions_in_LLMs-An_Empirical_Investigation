The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the chipped linoleum floor, a pattern mirrored in the weary lines etched around her eyes.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and Amelia, twenty-four years old, felt the familiar gnawing emptiness in her stomach, a counterpart to the emptiness in the aisles.  Seven years. Seven years she'd been ringing up overpriced frozen dinners and stale bread, seven years lost in the fluorescent glow of this beige purgatory.  Today, however, held a flicker of something different.  A flicker of...possibility.

The setting was a small, suburban grocery store, a Super Saver Mart, located on the edge of town, just off a highway with faded, painted lines on the asphalt.  A relentless drone of traffic seemed to seep into the store, blurring the already indistinct edges of the day.  The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and decaying produce, a perfume that Amelia had come to recognize as the unmistakable aroma of routine.  Rows of brightly-lit shelves groaned under the weight of consumer goods, their labels promising satisfaction while whispering promises of emptiness.  The store’s clock ticked, a silent metronome counting down the minutes until Amelia’s shift ended.
