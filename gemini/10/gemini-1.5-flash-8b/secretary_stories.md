The year was 2024.  The smell of stale coffee and old paper filled the air, a comforting aroma in its own way.  Her office, a small cubicle in a corner of the sprawling, glass-walled building, was, in every way, unremarkable.  Except, perhaps, for the subtle glow emanating from a small, intricately carved wooden box tucked beneath a stack of invoices.
