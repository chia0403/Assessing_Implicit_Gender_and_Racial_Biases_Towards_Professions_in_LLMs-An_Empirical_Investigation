The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Dakotas, stinging Amelia "Mac" MacIntyre's cheeks.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling like tormented spirits.  Her rig, a battered but loyal Freightliner named "The Iron Horse," groaned under the weight of a thousand tons of frozen produce destined for a city she couldn't even name, let alone imagine.  The vast, unforgiving landscape stretched out before her, a canvas of bruised ochre and muted grey, mirroring the weariness that clung to her bones.

Mac, her jaw clenched against the wind's assault, pulled the oversized trucker's hat further down over her eyes, her gaze fixed on the faint, barely discernible line where the horizon met the bruised sky.  This was her life.  This was her kingdom.  The endless highway.
