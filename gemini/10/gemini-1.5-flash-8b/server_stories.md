The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow-brown where spilled coffee had long ago dried, reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of the "Rusty Mug."  Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heartbeat.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, yet each clinking glass, each scraping chair, sent a jolt of anxiety through her.  Amelia, a server at the Rusty Mug, known for her perpetually tired eyes and her practiced smile, felt the weight of the empty booths pressing down on her.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest within her.

The Rusty Mug, a greasy spoon diner in the heart of the forgotten town of Ash Creek, clung to a ragged existence, barely clinging to the edge of viability.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating the faded posters of local bands and the worn, sepia-toned photographs stuck haphazardly to the cracked walls.  The smell of stale coffee and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the diner's faded glory.  A single bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock Amelia's every move.  Empty tables, each one a miniature tomb of a forgotten meal, filled the space.  The only sound besides the drumming rain were the occasional sighs of patrons who had succumbed to the long night, and the low hum of the antiquated refrigerator, a rhythmic counterpoint to Amelia's growing dread.
