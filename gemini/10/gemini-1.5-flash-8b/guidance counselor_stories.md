The fluorescent lights of Ms. Amelia Hayes's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the worn surface of her desk.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminated by the single overhead fixture, creating an almost ethereal quality to the otherwise mundane space.  Amelia, a guidance counselor at the perpetually overcast Northwood High, stared out the grimy window overlooking the rain-slicked parking lot.  The grey sky mirrored the muted palette of her life, a life carefully constructed of routine and the quiet anxieties of teenagers.  Today, however, the grey felt heavier, thicker, like a suffocating blanket.  A new weight pressed down on her chest, a weight that had little to do with the usual student struggles of heartbreak or academic pressure.  It was something... deeper, something unsettling.  A whisper of something wrong, just beyond the veil of the ordinary.

The office itself was a study in faded grandeur.  The plush, once-deep-red carpet was now a muted burgundy, stained in places with the faintest traces of spilled coffee and the invisible residue of countless tears.  A chipped ceramic mug sat on her desk, perpetually filled with lukewarm chamomile tea, its porcelain surface reflecting the fractured light.  Beside it, a stack of overflowing student files, each a microcosm of a young life, waited patiently for her attention.  Today, however, they seemed almost irrelevant.  The whispers of trouble had reached beyond the walls of her office.
