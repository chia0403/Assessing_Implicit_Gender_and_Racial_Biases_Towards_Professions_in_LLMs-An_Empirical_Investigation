The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, clinging to the cobblestones of the old city.  Dr. Aris Thorne, registered dietician and owner of "Nourish & Thrive," adjusted her spectacles, the slight mist blurring the intricate carvings of the nearby building.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, illuminating the faded frescoes depicting scenes of feasting and famine.  She'd chosen this particular alleyway, a forgotten corner of the bustling marketplace in Seville, for her late-afternoon reconnaissance.  The whispers of the city, often a cacophony, seemed to quiet here, leaving only the rhythmic clinking of the water vendor's cart and the distant cries of vendors hawking exotic spices.  Her clients, a vibrant mix of artists, poets, and artisans, each with their unique dietary needs and desires, had prompted a quest for the most uncommon ingredients, a journey that had led her to this hidden, atmospheric spot.  She was seeking a specific type of saffron, one said to have a unique, almost ethereal flavor, vital for the upcoming experimental food therapy program she was developing for a group of young, struggling writers.  Knowing her clients, a single hint of this spice could be the key to helping them find their inner harmonyâ€”and their creative juices.
