The biting wind whipped across the exposed hillside, stinging Elara Stoneheart's cheeks as she surveyed the nascent form of the sculpture.  Grey granite, rough-hewn and brooding, stood sentinel against the bruised, purple sky.  For three moons, Elara, daughter of the renowned stone-master Aethelred, had sculpted this colossal figure of a griffin, its wings poised for flight, its eyes seeming to follow the shifting clouds.  The air, thin and crisp at 3,000 feet, carried the scent of pine needles and the distant, echoing clang of hammers against stone from the village nestled below.

The year was 1072.  The valley of Eldoria, nestled between towering peaks that scraped the swirling grey clouds, was a place of stark beauty and quiet tradition.  Its people, the Eldorian, were masters of stone, not just in their skill but in their deep-rooted reverence for the earth.  Every carved detail, every rough-hewn edge, was imbued with the spirit of the mountain itself.  Elara, though, felt a growing unease. A sense of something missing, something more than the raw power that infused her work.  The griffin, while magnificent, felt cold, lifeless, devoid of the soul she craved to capture.  The village lay below, a tapestry of thatched roofs and flickering hearth fires, a world of mundane tasks and whispered legends, a world that felt distant and insignificant from this high, wind-swept perch.
