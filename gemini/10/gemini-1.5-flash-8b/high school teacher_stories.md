The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her students' pens against notebooks.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a faded map of the American West plastered to the back wall.  Eleanor, her tweed jacket a familiar grey against the pastel-coloured walls, leaned against her desk, a half-eaten apple core nestled in her hand.  Today's lesson, the Dust Bowl, felt less like a historical event and more like a distant, arid landscape, as unfamiliar and alien to her students as it was to her.


The old high school building, perched on a hill overlooking the sprawling, industrial town of Havenwood, felt as though it had absorbed the town's muted anxieties.  Each creaking floorboard, each dusty corner, whispered tales of generations of Havenwood students, of triumphs and tragedies, of dreams born and shattered within its echoing halls.  The town itself was a paradox: steeped in tradition yet trapped in a cycle of economic stagnation, its vibrant past a faded photograph compared to the grey-skied present.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and simmering factory smoke, seemed to carry with it the weight of unspoken disappointments and unfulfilled potential.
