The chipped paint of the Victorian banister scraped against Amelia "Em"  Ashworth's worn canvas shoes as she ascended the stairs, the air thick with the scent of aged mahogany and something faintly sweet, like overripe fruit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the drawing-room, illuminating a scene of disarray.  Broken figurines lay scattered like fallen stars, their once-vibrant glazes dulled by neglect.  This was the Blackwood Manor, a project Em had eagerly anticipated, a challenging restoration.  Her initial impression, however, was less inspiration and moreâ€¦ melancholy.

The grand estate, nestled deep within the whispering woods of Ashwood Hollow, had been abandoned for decades.  Rumours swirled around it, tales of a tragic love affair and a family cursed by an unknown, unseen force.  Em, despite her love for history and her adventurous spirit, found herself wrestling with a growing sense of unease. The house, built of weathered stone and intricately carved wood, seemed to press in on itself, the silent observer of generations lost.   She felt a shiver, not just from the damp chill of the neglected rooms, but from something deeper, something intangible that seemed to cling to the very walls.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting for her to uncover the secrets buried within its decaying grandeur.
