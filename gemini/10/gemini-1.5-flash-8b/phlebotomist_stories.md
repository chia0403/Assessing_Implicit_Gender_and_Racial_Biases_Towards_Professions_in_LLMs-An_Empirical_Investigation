The fluorescent lights of the "Precision Diagnostics" lab hummed, a constant, low thrumming that Amelia "Amy" Cartwright found oddly comforting.  Each day, the rhythmic beep of the automated blood-drawing machine and the soft click of her gloves sliding on were her familiar lullaby.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the stark light, felt like a protective shell, a cocoon around her as she navigated the sometimes chaotic flow of patients.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of the lab was punctuated by a different, more urgent undercurrent.  The air crackled with an almost palpable tension, a tension Amy felt deep in her bones.  It wasn't just the usual pre-lunch rush; something was different.  The pre-dawn shift at Precision Diagnostics was usually a predictable symphony of coughs, anxieties, and the quiet whispers of the unspoken.  But today, the tension vibrated with a different, almost desperate frequency.  Something about the air hung heavy, carrying a hint of fear, a fear that Amy knew she should not ignore. The crisp, sterile scent of disinfectant was almost overwhelming.
