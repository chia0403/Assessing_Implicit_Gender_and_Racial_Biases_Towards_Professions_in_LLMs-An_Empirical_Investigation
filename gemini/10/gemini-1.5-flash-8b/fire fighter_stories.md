The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, whipping Amelia Hayes's fire-resistant coat around her like a frantic dancer.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and impending doom, hung heavy in the mountain valley.  Below, nestled amongst the towering pines, the small village of Oakhaven huddled in the shadows, seemingly oblivious to the looming threat.  Amelia, a seasoned firefighter with the Blackwood Mountain Rangers, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another wildfire; the whispers among the seasoned veterans spoke of somethingâ€¦else.

Amelia Hayes, Firefighter Captain, Blackwood Mountain Rangers, Station 17, stood on the precipice of a craggy, windswept ridge.  The valley stretched out before her, a tapestry of emerald green and burnt ochre, a volatile mix of life and death.  A plume of smoke, dark and menacing, already painted the dawn sky with an ominous shade.  The pre-dawn light, struggling to pierce the dense forest canopy, illuminated the jagged silhouette of the towering peaks.  The silence, broken only by the wind's mournful cry, was punctuated by the distant, rhythmic crackle of burning timber.  This was no ordinary fire; the whispers of the woods told tales of something ancient, something awakened.
