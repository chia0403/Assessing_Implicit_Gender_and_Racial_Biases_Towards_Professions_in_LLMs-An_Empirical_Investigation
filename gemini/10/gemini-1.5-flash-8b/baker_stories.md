The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of jasmine from the small, potted plants that lined the walls of "The Golden Crust."  Amelia Blackwood, a baker with hands as strong as they were nimble, kneaded a ball of dough, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Sunlight, filtering through the lace-curtained windows, painted the small, bustling bakery in warm hues.  Rows of rustic wooden tables, each laden with chipped china cups and saucers, filled the space.  The rhythmic clink of spoons against china, the murmured conversations of regulars, and the cheerful clatter of Ameliaâ€™s apron against the counter all formed a comforting symphony, a soundtrack to her life.  But today, a discordant note, a lingering sense of unease, echoed beneath the otherwise pleasant noise.  The bakery, usually a haven of warmth and familiarity, felt unusually quiet, almost expectant.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the Old Quarter, normally alive with the hustle and bustle of market day, were surprisingly deserted.  A palpable stillness had descended upon the city, a stillness that mirrored the unease in Amelia's heart.
