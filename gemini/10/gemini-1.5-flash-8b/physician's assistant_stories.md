The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's crimson coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alley.  Rain, the persistent, icy kind that seeped into your bones, stung her face.  The flickering gaslight of the nearby apothecary cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her frantic pace.  Above the clamor of the city – the distant clang of church bells, the boisterous shouts of hawkers – echoed a rhythmic, almost hypnotic, drumming.  It wasn't the steady beat of a drummer, but the insistent, rhythmic thump-thump of a rapidly beating heart.

Amelia, Physician's Assistant at St. Jude's Hospital, knew this sound all too well.  It was the soundtrack of her life.  The frantic, irregular heartbeat signaled a growing sense of dread, a prelude to a patient's deteriorating condition.  This was the heart of the sprawling, labyrinthine district known as the Lower Ward, a place where poverty clung to the very stones and disease festered in the shadows.  Each alley, each dimly lit doorway, whispered tales of hardship and despair, stories Amelia felt obligated to listen to, to heal. Today, the drumming was particularly insistent, particularly frantic, and it was drawing her towards a small, rickety tenement building on the edge of the shadowed marketplace.
