The biting wind, a relentless, clawing beast, whipped at Elias Thorne's worn leather jacket, tugging at the frayed edges of his scarf and threatening to rip the battered roll of roofing felt from his grasp.  He braced himself against the relentless onslaught, his calloused hands gripping the precarious ledge of the Victorian mansionâ€™s steeply pitched roof.  Below, the cobbled streets of  Old Spitalfields, London, were a blur of muted autumnal colours; the skeletal branches of ancient plane trees reaching like skeletal fingers towards a bruised grey sky.  Rain, a persistent, icy drizzle, plastered the grime-coated guttering and clung to the chipped terracotta tiles like tenacious, wet spiders.

Elias Thorne, a roofer of weathered experience and even wearier spirit, was not one for dramatic pronouncements or grand gestures.  He knew the roof was his stage, his canvas.  This particular roof, however, felt like a poisoned chalice.  It had haunted him, a silent, dripping accusation, ever since he'd first been called to assess the damage last spring. Now, weeks of relentless repair, fueled by lukewarm tea and the faint scent of pipe tobacco, had brought him to the most treacherous and potentially rewarding patch.  He had to get the damaged section of leadwork replaced, and he knew the weight of it was more than just metal and lead. This was more than just his trade; it was the weight of the secrets hidden within the very stone and brick of the house itself.
