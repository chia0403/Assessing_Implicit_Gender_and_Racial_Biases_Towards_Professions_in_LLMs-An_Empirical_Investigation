The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, whipped at Lieutenant Commander Amelia Petrova's flight suit, stinging her exposed cheeks.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Antarctic plateau clawed at a bruised sky, a monochrome landscape of white and grey stretching to the horizon.  Amelia, pilot of the Aurora, a sleek, silver-grey research craft, wrestled the controls, the aircraft shuddering violently against the unforgiving gale.  A blizzard, born of the Earth's icy heart, had descended, trapping them high above a region shrouded in almost perpetual darkness.  Her breath puffed out in visible clouds as she fought to maintain altitude, the faint glow of the Aurora's internal lights the only warmth in the suffocating cold.  The radio crackled static, swallowed by the howling wind.  Her co-pilot, a veteran named Jian Li, was silent, his presence a stark counterpoint to the tempestuous roar of the outside world.  Amelia knew, with a chilling certainty, that this wasn't just another Antarctic storm. Something was amiss.
