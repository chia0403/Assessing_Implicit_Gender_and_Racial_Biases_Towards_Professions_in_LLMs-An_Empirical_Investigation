The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Rain, a relentless curtain of icy needles, stung her cheeks and plastered her trench coat to her frame.  The aroma of damp earth and something vaguely sweet, perhaps decaying fruit, clung to the air, a constant reminder of the city’s relentless cycle of life and death.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist, focused on the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her boots on the stones, a counterpoint to the city’s ceaseless murmur.  Her destination: the dilapidated tenement building on the corner, a fractured monument to a forgotten era, where the residents clung to the remnants of normalcy in a world built on fractured promises.  Within its crumbling walls, Amelia's therapy often felt more like a desperate struggle against the very foundations of existence itself.
