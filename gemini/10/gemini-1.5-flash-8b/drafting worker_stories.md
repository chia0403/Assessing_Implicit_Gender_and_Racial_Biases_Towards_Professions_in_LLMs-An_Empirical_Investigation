The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a constant, almost hypnotic thrumming that echoed the rhythmic click-clack of Elias Thorne's drafting pen against the tracing paper.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating the intricate blueprints spread across his large drafting table.  The air, thick with the scent of old ink and stale coffee, hung heavy in the cramped, windowless space.  Elias, a drafting worker for the sprawling, century-old architectural firm of Blackwood & Hayes, was hunched over a complex elevation drawing, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of traffic and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost sterile atmosphere of the room.  The year is 1938.
