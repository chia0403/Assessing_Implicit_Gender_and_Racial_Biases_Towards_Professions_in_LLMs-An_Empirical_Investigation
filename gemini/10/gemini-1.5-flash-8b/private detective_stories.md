The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Oldport, Massachusetts.  Detective Alistair Finch, a man whose trench coat seemed to absorb the city's perpetual dampness, hunched deeper into the doorway.  A wisp of cigarette smoke, his only companion in the pre-dawn gloom, curled around his face, obscuring the lines etched by countless sleepless nights and unresolved cases.  His fedora, pulled low, shadowed the weary eyes that scanned the street for any sign of movement.  Today's case, he reminded himself grimly, smelled of desperation and deceit,  a scent clinging thick to the already oppressive air.

The Rusty Mug, a greasy spoon diner that had seen more secrets spilled than coffee brewed, was the central hub of this particular investigation.  A low, rhythmic clinking of metal on metal from the nearby shipyard echoed through the almost empty streets.  The harsh tang of salt and brine permeated the cold, humid air, mixing with the lingering aroma of stale doughnuts and burnt coffee.  Alistair, with his sharp eyes and the subtle elegance that belied his gruff exterior, was about to enter.  He knew this was just the beginning of a long and likely treacherous chase into the heart of the maritime underworld.
