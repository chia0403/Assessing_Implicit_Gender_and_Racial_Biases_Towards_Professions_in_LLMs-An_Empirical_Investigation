The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a monotonous drone against the clatter of Dr. Eleanor Vance's meticulous movements, was the only sound that pierced the oppressive silence.  Eleanor Vance, D.C., meticulously adjusted the vertebrae of a patient, her touch precise and practiced. Outside, the grey, November sky mirrored the gloom that hung in the reception area.  Rain slicked the pavement of Maple Street, mirroring the chill that had settled in the air, a chill that seemed to seep into the bones of everyone who entered the small, unassuming office.  The worn, floral wallpaper seemed to sigh with every drip from the eaves.  Eleanor's office, "Vance Chiropractic," was nestled in a quiet corner of a historic, but fading, downtown district.  The once vibrant storefronts of Maple Street were now home to boarded-up windows and decaying storefronts, each telling its own silent story of a city struggling to hold onto its past.  Eleanor, hunched over her patient, felt a familiar prickle of anxiety.  Another day, another weary soul seeking relief from the aches and pains of modern life.
