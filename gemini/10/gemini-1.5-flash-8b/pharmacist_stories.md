The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, "Apothecary's Grace," was a constant companion to Amelia Blackwood.  It wasn't a melody, not exactly, but a predictable, almost comforting, drone that filled the small, cluttered space.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-streaked windows, casting long shadows that danced across the neatly arranged shelves of vials, jars, and boxes.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral—perhaps the lingering perfume of the last customer—hung heavy.  Amelia, a pharmacist with a surprising passion for the obscure and a talent for remembering every detail, meticulously organized the ingredients for a particularly rare tincture.  This particular batch was crucial for an upcoming experimental treatment for a rare neurodegenerative disease.  The quiet hum of the refrigeration unit, the gentle clicking of her keyboard, and the occasional clatter of bottles were the only sounds besides the ceaseless, almost imperceptible, ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner of the apothecary.
