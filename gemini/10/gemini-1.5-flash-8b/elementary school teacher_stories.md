The chipped paint of the "Miss Abigail Hayes" sign above the classroom door seemed to mock the vibrant murals adorning the walls.  Crimson volcanoes erupted from beside serene blue oceans, a testament to the raw, unpredictable energy of the students within.  Abigail Hayes, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the chaotic tableau.  Crayon shavings, meticulously arranged into elaborate constellations on the dusty floor, spoke of a class fueled by creativity, a classroom perpetually on the cusp of something... magnificent.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet marching in a synchronized, if slightly off-key, cadence was the soundtrack to her morning.  It was the first day of fifth grade, a day she'd been anticipating, and dreading, all summer.  The students, each a unique volcano about to erupt, were a mix of giggles, whispers, and the ever-present scent of freshly sharpened pencils.  The air hummed with a palpable, pre-dawn excitement, a symphony that only the start of a new school year could orchestrate.
