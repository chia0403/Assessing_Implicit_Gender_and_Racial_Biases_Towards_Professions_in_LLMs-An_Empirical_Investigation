The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" sign, a faded rose pink, barely clung to the weathered wood.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's heartbeat.  Inside, the tiny salon, smelling faintly of lavender and stale coffee, was bathed in the soft glow of a single, flickering fluorescent light.  Amy, a whirlwind of nervous energy in a faded denim jacket and worn leather apron, meticulously snipped at a strand of auburn hair, the rhythmic snip-snip a frantic counterpoint to the deluge outside.  Her reflection, strained and anxious, stared back from the smudged mirror.  Today, things felt different.  The usual chatter of her regulars, the low hum of conversation and the gentle clinking of scissors against hair â€“ it was all muted, overshadowed by a heavy, unseen weight pressing down on her.  The rain outside intensified, mirroring the storm brewing within her.  The small salon, her sanctuary and her struggle, felt like a cage.
