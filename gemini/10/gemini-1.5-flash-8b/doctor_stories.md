The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the desolate, snow-covered expanse of the Antarctic plateau.  The air, thin and frigid, clawed at her lungs.  Frozen landscapes stretched out before her, an endless white canvas punctuated only by the skeletal remains of research stations and the occasional, ominous crevasse.
