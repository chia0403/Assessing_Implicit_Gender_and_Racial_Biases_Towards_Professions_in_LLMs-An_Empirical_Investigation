The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Free Zone" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's carefully calculated life.  Filing cabinets, overflowing with tax forms and receipts, lined the walls like silent, judgmental witnesses.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, windowless office.  Amelia, a woman of meticulous habits and quiet determination, was currently wrestling with a particularly complex Schedule C, the one submitted by Mildred Periwinkle, a renowned, albeit eccentric,  artist whose income was a swirling vortex of commissions, materials, and inexplicable deductions.

The office, located in a nondescript strip mall on the edge of the rust-colored, industrial district of the city, offered little in the way of ambiance.  Grey linoleum floors, worn smooth by countless footsteps, echoed the staccato rhythm of Amelia's keyboard.  Beyond the office's dusty window, a lone, scraggly oak tree swayed in the wind, its skeletal branches reaching out as if grasping for something Amelia knew it would never find:  a little bit of sunshine.
