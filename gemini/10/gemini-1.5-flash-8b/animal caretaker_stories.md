The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Nightingale's cloak around her as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Whispering Woods.  Dust motes danced in the faint sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of ancient trees, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched and writhed like the creatures Em was sworn to protect.  She worked at the Blackwood Sanctuary, a sprawling haven for endangered and exotic wildlife tucked deep within the heart of the whispering woods.  Founded by the eccentric but deeply compassionate Lord Ashworth decades ago, the Sanctuary was a testament to a love for the natural world bordering on the obsessive.  Em, with her own brand of quiet dedication and a fondness for the creatures under her care, had been a keeper at Blackwood for five years.  Today, however, felt different.  A peculiar, unsettling stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual damp chill of the woods.  The usual chorus of birdsong was muted, the rustle of leaves replaced by a unnerving quiet.  Em tightened her grip on the worn leather strap of her satchel, containing her essential tools â€“ a small, well-worn first aid kit, a selection of specialized animal feeds, and a small, beautifully crafted wooden whistle only she possessed.  Something was amiss.  And it didn't feel right.
