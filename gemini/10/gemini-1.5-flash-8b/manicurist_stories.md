The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected Amelia Nightingale's face.  She wasn't looking at it, though.  Her gaze, sharp and focused, was fixed on the intricate pattern of crimson swirls she was painstakingly applying to the client's nail.  The scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Polished Petal," a tiny salon tucked away on a side street of the bustling, historic district of  Old Oakhaven.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains, dappled the room in a warm, honey-gold light, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  A gentle, almost hypnotic, rhythm filled the spaceâ€”the rhythmic clicking of Amelia's nail clippers, the soft sighs of her clients, the faint whisper of the city beyond the window.  It was a world carefully contained within these four walls, a world of perfect manicures and whispered secrets.
