The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, murky yellow, reflected the flickering gaslight above the Grand Imperial Hotel's lobby.  Dust motes danced in the wavering beam, swirling around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop whose perpetually rumpled uniform – once a crisp navy blue – now bore the faded marks of countless hurried trips and spilled drinks.  The year was 1928.  The air, thick with the scent of stale cigars and simmering coffee, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the roaring twenties.  Rain hammered against the ornate glass of the hotel's entrance, a relentless percussion against the hushed whispers of the arriving and departing guests.  Tonight, a particularly boisterous party of businessmen was making their way toward the elevators, their laughter echoing through the vast, cavernous space. Barty, however, felt a different kind of clamor, a low, insistent thrum in his chest, like a trapped bird.  He wasn't sure what it was, but something about tonight felt...off.
