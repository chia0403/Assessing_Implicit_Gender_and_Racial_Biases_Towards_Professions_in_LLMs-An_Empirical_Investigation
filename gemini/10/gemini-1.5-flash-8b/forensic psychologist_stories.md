Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Institute for Forensic Psychology, a monolithic structure perched precariously on the edge of the city, overlooking the churning grey river.  The wind howled, a mournful symphony echoing the relentless thoughts of Dr. Eleanor Vance,  a forensic psychologist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a mind honed by years of dissecting the darkest corners of the human psyche.  Tonight, the storm mirrored the tempest within her.

The air inside the office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and fear.  Flickering fluorescent lights cast long, unsettling shadows across the meticulously organized desk piled high with files.  Eleanor Vance, her tweed jacket damp and clinging, stared at the most recent case file: "The Blackwood Tapestry," the chilling nickname for the latest serial murder case plaguing the city.  Each entry was a meticulously crafted mosaic of depravity, and Eleanor's every instinct screamed that this killer wasn't just another predator. This was a mind architect, weaving a narrative of horror with every meticulously calculated act.
