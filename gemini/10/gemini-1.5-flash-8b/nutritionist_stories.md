The aroma of roasted dandelion greens, strangely reminiscent of burnt sugar, hung heavy in the air of the tiny, sun-drenched kitchen.  Dr. Anya Petrova, a registered dietitian and certified nutritionist with a penchant for unconventional remedies, meticulously measured out a spoonful of spirulina powder into a glass of lukewarm water.  Outside, the vibrant colours of the Tuscan countryside, olive groves shimmering in the midday sun, contrasted sharply with the muted tones of her small, stone cottage.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the adjoining study, a room filled with meticulously organized books, journals, and overflowing herb boxes.  Anya, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic clinking of her measuring spoons.  Today's patient, a renowned sculptor named Lorenzo Bellini, was proving particularly resistant to her holistic approach. Heâ€™d opted for a radical, nearly starvation-inducing, diet plan inspired by some obscure ancient text.  Anya, however, believed in balance, not deprivation. The Tuscan sun beat down on her, a tangible reminder of the heat that was consuming Lorenzo's resolve.
