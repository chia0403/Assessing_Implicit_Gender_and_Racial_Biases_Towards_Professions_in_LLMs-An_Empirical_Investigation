The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged peaks of the Obsidian Mountains, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already meagre visibility.  Sergeant Elara "Stormblade" Blackwood shivered, not from the cold, but from the creeping dread that settled in her gut like a lead weight.  She adjusted the worn leather straps of her armour, the familiar feel offering little comfort against the encroaching darkness. The watchtower, a precarious perch of weathered stone clinging to the cliff face, offered a panoramic view of the desolate valley below, but all it revealed tonight was the swirling white abyss.  This was the Shadow's Pass, notorious for its treacherous blizzards and the whispered legends of the creatures that lurked in the encroaching gloom.


Elara's setting: The Shadow's Pass, a notoriously dangerous mountain pass in the Frostfell region of the Kingdom of Aeridor.  The landscape is a stark and unforgiving wilderness of jagged peaks, frosted forests, and icy rivers.  The watchtower, built into the mountainside centuries ago, is her only refuge from the relentless elements.  A palpable sense of isolation hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the mournful wind and the occasional, ominous screech of unseen creatures.
