The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the chaotic symphony of sirens wailing outside and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a heart monitor struggling to maintain a steady rhythm.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, a registered nurse with five years' experience, felt a familiar knot tightening in her chest.  Tonight, the ER was particularly brutal.  A string of accidents involving drunk drivers, a stabbing victim with a grim prognosis, and now, a young woman, barely more than a girl, crumpled on the gurney, her breath ragged and shallow.

Amelia, a woman whose sharp eyes often missed nothing, was acutely aware of the girl's small, trembling hand clutching the worn edge of the sterile sheet.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy over the scene, a tangible weight pressing down on the already exhausted staff.  The rhythmic beeping of the machines seemed to mock the silence between the frantic calls for help, a haunting counterpoint to the agonizingly slow progress of life.  This was the rhythm of her world, a ballet of life and death danced out in the sterile white corridors of the city hospital, and she was forever caught in the middle.  Tonight, it felt particularly relentless.
