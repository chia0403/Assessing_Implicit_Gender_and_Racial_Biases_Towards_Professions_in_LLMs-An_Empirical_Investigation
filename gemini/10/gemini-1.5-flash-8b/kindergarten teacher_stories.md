The chipped paint of the Miss Abigail's Kindergarten classroom, a pastel-hued nightmare of faded blues and greens, clung to the walls like a forgotten dream. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the meticulously arranged blocks, meticulously crafted by little hands.  A faint scent of cinnamon and stale crayons hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting aroma to Miss Abigail Blackwood.  Today, however, the usual symphony of toddler chatter was muted, replaced by an uneasy quiet.  It was Tuesday, the day the new girl, Lily, arrived.

The room, despite its tired appearance, held a quiet magic.  A small, wooden train, painstakingly decorated with tiny, colorful stickers, chugged along its designated track, its miniature passengers waving imaginary flags.  A row of rainbow-colored chairs, each with a small, worn-out name tag, faced a brightly colored, felt-covered easel where a masterpiece of hand-drawn trees was drying. The warmth of the afternoon sun, tinged with the late-summer chill, was the only other visible presence in the room.
