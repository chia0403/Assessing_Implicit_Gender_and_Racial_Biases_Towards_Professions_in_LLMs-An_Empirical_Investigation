The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and unwashed ambition, clinging to the chipped paint of the backlot dressing rooms.  Amelia "Amy"  Stone, director of "The Crimson Bloom," stared out the grimy window, a half-eaten sandwich abandoned on a cluttered table.  The flickering neon sign of the "Sunset Serenade Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow over the abandoned set, a testament to the film's current, and frankly, questionable, progress.  The projected budget had evaporated like the last vestiges of summer rain.  Her phone buzzed, a shrill discord in the otherwise oppressive silence.

Setting: The backlot of a small, struggling film studio on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a sprawling wasteland of partially built sets and rusting machinery.  The year is 1999.  The oppressive heat of late summer hangs heavy in the air, punctuated by the distant rumble of traffic and the occasional shriek of a passing train.  Inside the cramped dressing rooms, the air conditioner struggles, a futile battle against the stifling humidity.
