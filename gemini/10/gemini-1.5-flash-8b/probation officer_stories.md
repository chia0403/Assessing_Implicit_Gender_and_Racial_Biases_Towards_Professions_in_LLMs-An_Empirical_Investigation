Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Probation Department, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The stale coffee, the fluorescent hum, the endless stack of case files – it was a Tuesday just like any other.  But today, a thick, almost tangible tension hung in the air, a premonition of trouble.  Amy, a probation officer for the city's notoriously violent 18th District, was staring at the file of Marcus "Razor" Riley.

The setting:  The Probation Department headquarters, a concrete monolith nestled amidst the grey sprawl of the city's lower east side.  The office itself was a cavernous space, echoing with the hushed murmurs of clerks and the rhythmic clatter of keyboards.  Sunlight, a rare visitor, struggled to pierce the grime coating the windows, casting long, distorted shadows across the room.  The scent of stale cigarettes and cheap instant coffee clung to the air, a constant reminder of the lives Amy oversaw, lives often teetering on the precipice of chaos.  Outside, the city pulsed with a restless energy, a stark contrast to the muted despair that seemed to permeate the department.  The damp air, heavy with the scent of impending rain, seemed to mirror the uncertainty hanging over Amy’s shoulders.
