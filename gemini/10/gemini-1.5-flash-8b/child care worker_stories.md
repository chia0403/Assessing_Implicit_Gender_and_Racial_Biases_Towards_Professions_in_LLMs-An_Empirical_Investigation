The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to hum with a low, anxious energy.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her name a whispered hymn in the quiet corners of the daycare, adjusted the worn stuffed giraffe, checking its floppy ears, its faded spots a match for the weariness settling in her own chest.  It was Tuesday, the day the twins, Leo and Lily, had a particularly volatile energy, their tiny, freckled faces mirrored in the agitation of the room.  Amelia, a child care worker at Sunshine Smiles Daycare, found herself strangely drawn to the intensity, to the tiny dramas played out in the quiet corners of the room, and she felt the responsibility of her role weighing heavily on her young shoulders.  The scent of play-doh and stale juice hung in the air, a familiar perfume of childhood. Outside, the harsh reality of the urban sprawl was a distant roar.
