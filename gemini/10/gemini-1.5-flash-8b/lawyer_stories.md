Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law firm, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's thoughts.  The year was 1938, and the air in the cramped, third-floor office of Sterling & Sterling hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the worn mahogany desk where Em, a sharp-featured woman with eyes the color of stormy seas, stared at a mountain of legal documents.  The city of New York, a roaring behemoth of ambition and inequality, stretched out below, a cityscape mirroring the turmoil in her own soul. Em, a young lawyer barely out of her apprenticeship, found herself embroiled in a case that smelled as foul as the city's overflowing gutters.  The case:  a bitter dispute over a sprawling tenement building, a battleground of whispered accusations, hidden debts, and a family history stained with secrets stretching back decades.  It felt like wading through a swamp, every step sinking her further into the mire of the city's underbelly.  This wasn't the glamorous world of courtroom drama that she'd envisioned. This was the harsh reality of legal practice in the heart of the Depression, a reality that demanded more than just words and eloquent arguments.
