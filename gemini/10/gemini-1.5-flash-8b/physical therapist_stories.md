Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hayes’s heart.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and disinfectant, hung heavy in the small, cluttered physiotherapy room.  Sunlight, fractured and feeble, struggled to pierce the gloom, casting long shadows that danced with the swirling dust motes.  Amelia, a physical therapist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a perpetually tired smile, hunched over a patient, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Her name, etched onto the faded nameplate on her desk, shimmered faintly in the gloom: Amelia Hayes, LPT.  The patient, a weathered farmer named Silas, groaned, his weathered face etched with a mixture of pain and resignation.  The room, a space barely larger than a walk-in closet, contained a worn therapy table, a collection of exercise bands gathering dust, and a stack of medical journals that seemed to whisper forgotten diagnoses.  The only other sound besides the rain and Silas’s groans was the rhythmic ticking of a vintage grandfather clock from a neighbouring room, a reminder of time's relentless passage, a constant hum in the otherwise quiet clinic. The old wooden floorboards creaked beneath Amelia’s sneakers, a soundtrack to the slow, measured process of healing.
