The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of pine and damp earth.  Elias Thorne, groundskeeper for the sprawling estate for the past fifteen years, shivered, pulling his threadbare wool jacket tighter around him.  October's grip was relentless, threatening to claw at the vibrant autumn foliage that clung stubbornly to the ancient oaks lining the drive.  Sunlight, weak and filtered, barely pierced the encroaching gloom, casting long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously tended gardens.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece of dark stone and towering turrets, loomed over him, silent and imposing, as if watching his every move.  Elias adjusted the weight of his worn gardening tools, the familiar metal a comforting presence in the chilling air. The estate’s extensive grounds – a labyrinth of meticulously sculpted hedges, flowerbeds bursting with colour, and winding paths – felt vast and foreboding, despite the muted beauty.  A single, lone raven perched atop a weathered stone gargoyle, its obsidian eyes fixed on Elias, as if judging his every step.  This was Elias's world, a place of quiet contemplation and meticulous care, a world that held a secret, whispered in the rustling leaves and the groaning of ancient trees.
