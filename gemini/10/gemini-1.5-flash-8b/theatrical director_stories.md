The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the cobbled alleyway, illuminating the chipped paint of the "Grand Guignol" theatre.  Rain, a relentless curtain of icy water, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, echoing the nervous energy simmering within Isolde Nightingale, artistic director.  Rain lashed the already dismal façade of the theatre, a building more haunted by whispers than by applause. Isolde, her breath misting in the frigid air, clutched a worn leather-bound script, its pages brittle with age and brimming with dramatic possibilities.  The script, titled "The Raven's Lament," pulsed with a dark, brooding beauty that mirrored the oppressive atmosphere of the decaying Victorian district surrounding it.  Isolde shivered, not just from the cold, but from a deep-seated unease. This play, this production, felt…different. It felt haunted.  She knew, with a chilling certainty, that the performance held the potential to be a masterpiece...or a catastrophe.
