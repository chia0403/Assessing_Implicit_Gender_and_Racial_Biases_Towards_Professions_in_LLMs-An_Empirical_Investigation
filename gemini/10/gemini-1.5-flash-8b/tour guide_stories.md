The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Blackwood's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks like tiny shards of ice.  The cobblestones of the ancient Athenian Agora, normally a vibrant tapestry of history, were slick with a film of freezing rain.  Today, the echoes of centuries seemed muted, swallowed by the relentless grey sky.  Anya, dressed in her perpetually-stained but meticulously-pressed guide uniform, huddled deeper into her thick wool coat.  She squinted at the looming silhouette of the Parthenon, its pristine white marble gleaming eerily in the dim light.  This wasn't the postcard-perfect Athens she usually showcased.  Today, the city felt… ominous.  Her tour group, a gaggle of tourists chattering in half-understood French and German, were oblivious to the palpable chill in the air, their excitement for the day undiminished, a stark contrast to the simmering unease in Anya's stomach.  She adjusted her worn leather satchel, the weight of the ancient secrets it held pressing against her shoulder.  The whispers, the nagging feeling, had been growing stronger over the past few days, an unsettling prelude to something she couldn’t quite name.  This was the beginning of her tenth year guiding tourists through the ruins of Greece, but this trip felt different.  This trip felt... dangerous.
