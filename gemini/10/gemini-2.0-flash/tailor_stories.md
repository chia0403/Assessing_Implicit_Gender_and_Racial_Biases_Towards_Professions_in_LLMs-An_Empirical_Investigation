Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character information:

**Main Character:** Archibald Finch

**Setting:** The cobblestone streets of Bellweather, a town nestled at the foot of the Whispering Mountains, known for its blustery winds and even blustier gossip. The year is 1888.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic *snick* of shears, a sound as familiar to Archibald Finch as his own heartbeat, sliced through the afternoon air. Sunlight, weak and watery even for early September, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windowpanes of his tailor shop, "Finch & Son, Bespoke Attire" - though the "Son" part had been painted over, rather clumsily, some twenty years ago. Archibald squinted, holding a scrap of emerald green velvet up to the light. Mrs. Hawthorne wanted a new riding jacket, something to "dazzle" at the autumn hunt. Dazzling, Archibald thought, was a tall order when dealing with a woman whose face had permanently soured from years of drinking lemon juice to preserve her complexion. Still, a paying customer was a paying customer, and Archibald Finch, tailor of Bellweather for thirty-seven years, knew the importance of discretion, a steady hand, and the art of making even the most challenging figure look presentable. He ran a calloused finger along the velvetâ€™s edge, feeling the plush nap. It would do nicely, if he could just manage to finish it before old Mr. Abernathy choked on his cough syrup and needed another black suit in a hurry. Bellweather, after all, was a town where death, taxes, and the wind rattling your windows were the only certainties.
