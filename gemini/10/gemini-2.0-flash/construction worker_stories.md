The air hung thick with the smell of concrete dust and diesel, a familiar cologne to Leonardo Armando “Leo” Rizzo. He spat a plume of the dust-laced saliva into the cracked earth beside his steel-toed boot, the sound swallowed by the roar of the demolition crew tearing down the remnants of the old warehouse.

Leo, a man built like a brick shithouse himself at six-foot-four and nearing fifty, squinted against the harsh Nevada sun. His face, perpetually tanned and etched with deep lines around his perpetually squinting eyes, told a story of a life spent battling the elements and wrestling stubborn materials. He wore the standard uniform: faded jeans, stained Carhartt jacket, and a hard hat emblazoned with the logo of "Desert Rose Construction," their motto, “Building the Future, One Foundation at a Time,” ironic considering their current task.

The setting was Las Vegas, Nevada, but not the glitzy, glamorous strip. Leo was working on the outskirts of the city, in the rapidly expanding industrial district, a sprawling landscape of warehouses, distribution centers, and construction sites vying for space in the arid desert. This particular site was a prime piece of real estate, purchased by a tech company with plans to erect a sprawling server farm - the digital backbone of some newfangled AI venture. Leo and his crew were the demolition team, the grunts tasked with clearing the way for progress, tearing down the old to make way for the new. The skeletal remains of the warehouse, all twisted metal and crumbling brick, stood as a silent testament to a bygone era, a stark contrast to the sleek, futuristic promise of the project to come. He felt a pang of something akin to sorrow, a fleeting connection to the ghost of the building, before the foreman’s yell snapped him back to the present. "Rizzo! Get your ass in gear! We got a schedule to keep!"
