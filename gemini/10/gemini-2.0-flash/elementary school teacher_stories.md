The fluorescent lights of Maplewood Elementary hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth had grown so accustomed to she barely registered it anymore. Outside, October was throwing a tantrum, scattering wet leaves across the playground and whipping rain against the single-pane windows of her classroom, Room 2B. Inside, however, was a carefully curated haven of cheerful chaos.

Construction paper pumpkins with wonky, glitter-glued smiles lined the bulletin board. A slightly lopsided alphabet chart marched across the top of the chalkboard. The scent of crayons and Elmer's glue hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that always made Eleanor feel like she was exactly where she was supposed to be. But today, the storm outside seemed to seep into the room, dampening even the brightest of the pumpkin smiles. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her worn wooden desk, fiddled with the silver charm bracelet her students had given her last Christmas, the tiny apple dangling a little looser than she remembered. Something felt off, and it wasn't just the weather.
