The engine roared to life, a guttural growl that vibrated through the soles of Jedediah Bartholomew’s worn work boots. He adjusted his thick gloves, the leather already creased and stained with diesel, and squinted at the oppressive, dusty landscape. He'd seen sunrises paint the sky in a thousand vibrant hues, and sunsets bleed across the jagged peaks like spilled wine, but this morning, the world was just a flat, unforgiving grey.

**Setting:** Jedediah Bartholomew was perched high in the cab of his Komatsu PC490LC-11 excavator, the steel behemoth looming over the desolate expanse of the Broken Creek Reclamation Project in the Arizona desert. The air was thick with the grit and promise of another sweltering day. Broken Creek wasn’t a creek anymore, not really. Decades of drought and ill-advised mining had turned it into a cracked, barren scar across the red earth, a graveyard for dreams and shattered hopes. The Reclamation Project, funded by a reluctant government grant and spearheaded by a collection of equally reluctant engineers, aimed to revitalize the area, somehow coaxing life back into the parched soil. Jedediah, with his decades of experience and a quiet understanding of the land, was the man tasked with moving mountains – or, more accurately, moving the mountains *back* to where they belonged. He was to dig out contaminated soil, reshape the eroded riverbed, and prepare the ground for the installation of a complex network of water retention systems. It was a Sisyphean task, a constant battle against the relentless forces of nature, but Jedediah, a man of few words and even fewer complaints, was ready for another day’s work. The dry, cracking earth awaited his touch, or rather, the crushing, earth-moving power of his excavator.
