The wind, a raw, insistent thing smelling of damp earth and coming snow, slapped Elias Thorne awake. He didn't need an alarm clock; the land itself was his timekeeper. Groaning, Elias shifted, the stiff cotton sheets clinging to his skin in the frigid pre-dawn air. He'd been dreaming again, the same dream he had every November: a summer's worth of golden wheat, ripe and heavy in the fields, swaying gently in the sunshine. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the approaching winter, that this year's harvest wouldn't be anything like that.

Elias Thorne was a farmer, born and bred on the hardscrabble acres of Thorneâ€™s End. The farm itself nestled in the valley between the Blackwood Mountains and the whispering, pine-laden woods of Ashdown Forest. The valley, once fertile and bountiful, was now showing its age, the soil depleted, the rains increasingly erratic. The little village of Oakhaven, a collection of stone cottages huddled around a crumbling church and a barely-functioning blacksmith, was slowly suffocating along with it. Thorne's End, the largest farm in the valley, was its heart, and Elias felt the weight of Oakhaven's survival pressing down on him with every sunrise.
