The hum of the ancient refrigerator in the kitchenette provided a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tapping of her fingers against the stained Formica tabletop. This apartment, perched precariously above Benny's Bodega in Brooklyn's Sunset Park, was her refuge, her battleground, and, increasingly, her prison. It smelled faintly of stale coffee, newsprint, and the lingering ghosts of rejected manuscripts.
