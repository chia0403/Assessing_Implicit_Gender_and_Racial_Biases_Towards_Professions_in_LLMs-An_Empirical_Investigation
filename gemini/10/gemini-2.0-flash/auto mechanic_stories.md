Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an auto mechanic:

**Setting:**

The air in "Rusty's Repair" hung thick with the smells of motor oil, welding fumes, and stale coffee. Sunlight, filtered through layers of grime on the corrugated iron roof, cast dusty beams across the cluttered shop floor. Engines, in various states of disassembly, sat perched on stands like metallic patients awaiting surgery. Wrenches and sockets, scattered like discarded bones, lay amidst a graveyard of tires and spare parts. Outside, the flat, seemingly endless expanse of the Nevada desert shimmered under a merciless sun, the asphalt of Route 66 radiating waves of heat. The only sign of life beyond the repair shop was the occasional semi-truck roaring past, or the lonely wail of a distant coyote.

**Opening:**

Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light illuminating Amelia "Amy" Grace Oâ€™Connell as she wrestled with a stubborn lug nut on a vintage Ford Mustang. Her brow was furrowed, a smudge of grease darkening her cheek, and strands of fiery red hair escaped her messy bun. A low growl emanated from her throat, a sound that mirrored the tightening of her muscles as she put her full weight behind the wrench. "Come on, you rusty bastard," she muttered, gritting her teeth. Finally, with a satisfying *crack*, the nut gave way. Amy straightened, wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving another streak of grease, and surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye. "One down, four to go," she sighed, a hint of weariness creeping into her voice. It was just another sweltering Tuesday in the middle of nowhere, and for Amy O'Connell, it was just another day at Rusty's Repair.
