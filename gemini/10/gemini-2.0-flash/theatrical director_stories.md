The air in the Grand Majestic Theatre hung thick with dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging precariously over the empty stage. Rehearsals were done for the day, but the echoes of Clara’s booming voice, coaching a wobbly Prince Charming through a particularly awkward sword fight, still seemed to reverberate off the plush, faded velvet of the seats. Bartholomew Finch, known to everyone simply as Bart, slumped in one of those seats, running a hand through his already wildly dishevelled hair. He was a theatrical director, and right now, a thoroughly defeated one.

The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the city's entertainment district, was now a faded relic, its gilded cherubs chipped, its crimson carpets threadbare. Located on the wrong side of the tracks in Oakhaven, a town clinging to the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, its glory days were long behind it. Now, it hosted a rotating cast of second-rate touring companies and the occasional, embarrassingly underfunded community production, usually directed by Bart himself. The local townsfolk, more interested in football and fried chicken than Shakespeare and Sondheim, barely noticed its existence. He was perpetually fighting a losing battle against apathy and a budget that wouldn't cover a decent costume let alone pyrotechnics. And this year’s Christmas Spectacular, *Santa’s Holiday Hoedown*, was shaping up to be his most spectacularly disastrous production yet.
