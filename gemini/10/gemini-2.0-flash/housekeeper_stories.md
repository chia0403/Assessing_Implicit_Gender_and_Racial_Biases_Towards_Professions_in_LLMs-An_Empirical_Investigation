The chipped porcelain mug, warmed by weak, lukewarm tea, did little to fight the chill that always seemed to cling to the cavernous hallways of Blackwood Manor. Clara Abigail Higgins, housekeeper extraordinaire (though sheâ€™d never call herself that), took a small sip and sighed, the sound echoing faintly in the silence. It was 5:30 AM, precisely thirty minutes before the first sliver of dawn would attempt to pierce the heavy velvet curtains that perpetually shrouded the windows, and she was, as always, the first soul awake in the grand, decaying edifice.

Blackwood Manor, nestled deep in the heart of the perpetually misty Yorkshire Dales, was a gothic behemoth, all imposing stone gargoyles and shadowed turrets. Three generations of Blackwoods had lived and died within its walls, leaving behind a legacy of wealth, eccentricity, and a palpable sense of unease. The current owner, the reclusive and perpetually grieving Lord Alistair Blackwood, rarely ventured from his study, leaving Clara to navigate the labyrinthine corridors and the dusty, cobweb-laden treasures that filled them. The air was thick with the scent of aged paper, beeswax polish, and something indefinably melancholic, like the memory of laughter long since faded. This was her domain, her responsibility, and though it often felt like wrestling with a restless ghost, Clara, with her steadfast spirit and a duster permanently attached to her apron pocket, was determined to bring a little order and light into its shadowed heart.
