The crisp autumn air, laced with the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, nipped at Elias Theodore Finch's nose as he crunched across the gravel path. He loved this time of year at Oakhaven Manor, loved the way the sprawling estate transformed into a tapestry of fiery reds, golds, and browns. Of course, he also dreaded it; the sheer volume of leaves that threatened to engulf the pristine lawns and meticulously manicured gardens was enough to give a man nightmares.

Elias, a man built like an oak himself – sturdy and dependable, with hands weathered from years of working the land – adjusted his worn tweed cap and surveyed his domain. Oakhaven Manor stood proud atop a gentle knoll, its gothic architecture imposing against the vibrant foliage. Gargoyles perched on the roofline seemed to glare down at him with stony disapproval, as if judging his efforts before he even began. The stone walls were draped in ivy, a verdant embrace that Elias spent half his life trying to keep at bay, lest it swallow the entire estate whole.

Beyond the Manor itself lay a labyrinth of formal gardens, rose bushes now dormant for the winter, and ancient, gnarled trees that had witnessed generations of Oakhaven residents come and go. Hidden within the groves were crumbling statues of mythical creatures, their marble surfaces slick with moss and lichen. Further still, the manicured lawns gave way to untamed woods, their paths winding and mysterious, a stark contrast to the rigid order imposed upon the rest of the estate.

Oakhaven Manor was more than just a workplace to Elias; it was a living, breathing entity, a silent companion that had been the backdrop to his entire life. And as he bent to pick up a stray leaf, the crisp rustle echoing in the stillness of the morning, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was different today, something unsettling was in the air, buried beneath the familiar scent of autumn and damp earth. He just couldn’t put his finger on what.
