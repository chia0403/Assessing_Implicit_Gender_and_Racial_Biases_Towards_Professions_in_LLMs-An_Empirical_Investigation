Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and main character details:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed, a monotonous drone that rivaled the steady rhythm of Beatrice Penelope Plum's tapping fingernails against the polished surface of her desk. Outside, the rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of the 'Sterling & Sterling Financial Solutions' building, turning the cityscape into a blurry watercolor painting. Inside, the air was thick with the antiseptic scent of disinfectant and the unspoken tension that always seemed to linger before the quarterly results were released. Beatrice sighed, pushing her tortoiseshell glasses up her nose. It was only 9:03 AM, and she already felt the weight of the day pressing down on her like a poorly filed tax return.

**Setting:**

The Sterling & Sterling Financial Solutions building lobby in downtown Chicago. The decor is modern and minimalist, with a color palette of greys, blues, and chrome. Expensive abstract art hangs on the walls, presumably to impress clients. The receptionist desk is large and curved, made of a dark wood with a polished granite top. Beyond the desk is a small seating area with leather chairs and a glass coffee table displaying corporate brochures. The overall feeling is sterile and impersonal.

**Main Character:**

Beatrice Penelope Plum. A mid-30s woman with a sharp mind and a dry wit, hidden beneath a veneer of professional politeness. She's intelligent and observant, but finds herself stuck in a job she doesn't love, though she has a knack for it. She wears sensible shoes and conservative clothing, but secretly dreams of escaping the corporate world.
