Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a main character named Imogen Willowbrook, an animal caretaker:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped across the exposed cliffs of Seabrook Island, carrying the scent of salt and the insistent cries of gulls. The Seabrook Wildlife Sanctuary, a haven clinging precariously to the edge of the island, was a patchwork of windswept meadows, rocky outcrops, and scrubby pine woods. A ramshackle collection of weathered wooden buildings huddled near the center, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin. These served as the Sanctuary's offices, veterinary clinic, and various enclosures for the injured and orphaned animals that found their way here.

**Opening:**

Imogen Willowbrook huddled deeper into her worn, fleece-lined jacket, the hood pulled tight against the blustery wind. The spray from the crashing waves below occasionally stung her face, leaving a salty film on her already chapped lips. She squinted, her gaze fixed on the small, dark shape struggling against the tide on the beach below. It looked like a seal pup, far too young to be out on its own, and clearly in distress. "Hold on, little one," she muttered, her breath misting in the frigid air. "I'm coming."

Imogen, a lean woman with a perpetually wind-burned face and perpetually messy braid escaping from her hood, worked at the Seabrook Wildlife Sanctuary. Animals were drawn to her, sensing her genuine compassion and her unwavering dedication to their well-being. She'd been patching up broken wings, nursing orphaned fawns, and coaxing grumpy badgers to eat since she was barely tall enough to reach the animal enclosures. Seabrook, with its wild beauty and its constant challenges, was her home, and its creatures were her responsibility. And that struggling seal pup needed her help, immediately.
