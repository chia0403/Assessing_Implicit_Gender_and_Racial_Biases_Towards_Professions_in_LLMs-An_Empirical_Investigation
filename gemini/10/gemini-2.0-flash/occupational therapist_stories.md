**Opening:**

The stale smell of bleach hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the battles fought and won, or sometimes lost, within these rehabilitation walls. Eleanor Grace Davies sighed, adjusting the clip holding back her unruly auburn curls. Outside, a robin chirped insistently against the muted roar of city traffic, a fleeting glimpse of normalcy that felt miles away from the reality she was immersed in. She checked her watch, the second hand ticking with an almost mocking precision. Mrs. Hathaway was late. Again.

**Setting:**

Eleanor's domain was the Occupational Therapy wing of St. Jude's Hospital in bustling downtown Chicago. The room itself was a testament to resilience and adaptability. One corner held a mock kitchen, complete with a low countertop and adapted utensils designed to help patients regain independence in meal preparation. Another section housed a variety of adaptive tools for dressing, bathing, and grooming â€“ reaching aids, button hooks, sock assists, all meticulously arranged on a shelf. Parallel bars dominated the center, a constant challenge and support for those relearning to walk. The walls, painted a calming shade of pale green, were decorated with encouraging posters: "Progress, Not Perfection" and "Small Steps, Big Victories." Despite the clinical setting, Eleanor had tried to inject a sense of warmth and personality into the space, scattering potted plants around the room and pinning up patient-created artwork. The large window, while offering a view of the cityscape, was also a constant reminder of the world outside, the life her patients were striving to rejoin.
