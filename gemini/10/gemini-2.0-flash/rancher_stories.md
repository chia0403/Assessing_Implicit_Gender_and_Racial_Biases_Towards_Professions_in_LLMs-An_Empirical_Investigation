## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mimicking the frenzy in Rosalie Mae "Rose" Harding's gut. She stood on the porch of the weathered ranch house, the noon sun beating down on the brim of her worn Stetson. In the distance, heat shimmered above the horizon, distorting the already unforgiving landscape. That shimmering heat felt almost like a taunt, a physical manifestation of the drought that had gripped Red Rock County for the last three years. Today, the bank manager, Mr. Abernathy with his starched collar and condescending smile, was due to arrive. Today, Rose faced losing everything her family had built from nothing.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in Red Rock County, Montana, a vast and sparsely populated region known for its rugged beauty and unforgiving climate. Rose Harding's ranch, the "Broken Spur," sprawls across several thousand acres of rolling plains, punctuated by rocky outcroppings and dry creek beds. The ranch house itself is a sturdy, single-story structure built from local stone and timber, showing its age in the faded paint and the leaning porch railing. The surrounding land is primarily grazing pasture, interspersed with patches of scrub brush and hardy grasses, all currently withered and brittle under the relentless sun. In the distance, the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains provide a dramatic, yet distant, backdrop. The nearest town, Dusty Gulch, is a small, dwindling settlement, reliant on the dwindling fortunes of its ranchers and farmers. The overall atmosphere is one of hardship, resilience, and a deep-seated connection to the land, a land that is now proving to be a cruel mistress.
