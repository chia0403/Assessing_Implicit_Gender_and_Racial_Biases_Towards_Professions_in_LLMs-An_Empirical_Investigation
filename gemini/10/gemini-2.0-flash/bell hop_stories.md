## The Story Opening:

The last rays of the Parisian sunset bled through the stained-glass dome of the Hotel Saint-Germain, painting the opulent lobby in hues of rose and gold. Gaspard Dubois, a bellhop whose impeccably tailored uniform concealed a heart that yearned for more than just tips and fleeting glimpses of luxury, adjusted the stack of perfectly pressed newspapers balanced precariously on his hip. He watched as Madame Dubois, the imposing head concierge with a coiffure as impenetrable as the fortress of her authority, approached him with a glint in her eye.

"Gaspard," she announced, her voice carrying across the hushed lobby, "We have a special arrival. Mr. Alistair Sterling, a renowned art collector. He requests the best suite, naturally. See to it that his belongings are handled with the utmost care, and ensure his comfort is… unparalleled. Understand?"

Gaspard nodded, the weight of the newspapers feeling insignificant compared to the unspoken pressure in Madame Dubois's tone. He knew what "unparalleled" meant in the language of the Hotel Saint-Germain: anticipate every need before it arises, cater to every whim, and disappear like a phantom when no longer required. It was a role he'd mastered, but tonight, a sense of foreboding prickled at the back of his neck. Mr. Alistair Sterling's arrival felt different. It felt… important.
