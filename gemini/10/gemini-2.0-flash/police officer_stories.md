The acrid smell of burnt sugar clung to the damp air, thick and cloying, a stark contrast to the biting February wind that whipped off Lake Michigan. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi huddled deeper into her worn leather jacket, the collar scratching at the back of her neck. She stood on the cracked asphalt of a back alley in Little Village, the heart of Chicago's Mexican community. Graffiti, a riot of vibrant colors and swirling script, covered the brick walls, a silent testament to the neighborhood's soul. Steam rose from a discarded dumpster, momentarily obscuring the flashing blue and red lights painting the scene in an unsettling dance.

Izzy’s breath puffed out in white clouds as she surveyed the scene. A small, rusted food cart lay overturned, its once-cheerful yellow awning ripped and flapping in the wind like a wounded bird. The sugary aroma, now tinged with something darker, something metallic, was strongest here. Beneath the cart, partially obscured by a scattering of broken churros and spilled chocolate sauce, lay the body of a man. His face was frozen in a silent scream, the snow beginning to dust his dark hair. Detective Isabella Rossi had a feeling this wasn't just a case of a food vendor having a bad night. This was murder.
