Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hair cutter named Cordelia Blackwood:

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. Cordelia's salon, "Strands of Tomorrow," is nestled in a revitalized art district in Neo-London, once a grimy industrial area, now a vibrant hub of creativity and technological innovation. The salon itself is a curious blend of vintage charm and futuristic sleekness. Exposed brick walls from the original Victorian building are juxtaposed with glowing holographic displays showcasing the latest hairstyles and hair-augmentation technology. Smart-mirrors analyze hair health and suggest personalized treatments, and robotic arms assist with complex styling, though Cordelia, stubbornly, still prefers the feel of scissors in her own hands. Outside, hovercars hum through the air and bio-engineered plants climb the buildings, creating a lush, almost surreal, urban landscape.

**Opening:**

Cordelia Blackwood hated Mondays. Even in 2042, even with the promise of synthetic avocado toast for lunch and a virtual meditation session scheduled for the afternoon, Mondays clung to her like static cling to a recycled polyester shirt. She stared at the digital clock embedded in her smart-mirror: 8:58 AM. Two minutes until her first client, a nervous young data analyst named Elara with a severe case of split ends and existential dread.

Cordelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of her own midnight-blue, genetically-enhanced hair behind her ear. "Strands of Tomorrow," her pride and joy, was usually a haven. A place where people came to reinvent themselves, to feel beautiful, to forget, even for an hour, the relentless hum of Neo-London and the ever-present pressure of a world hurtling towards… well, she wasn’t entirely sure what it was hurtling towards. But this morning, even the scent of organic lavender essential oil couldn't quite cut through the Monday-morning gloom. She just hoped Elara wouldn’t ask for another pixie cut. She was getting tired of pixies.
