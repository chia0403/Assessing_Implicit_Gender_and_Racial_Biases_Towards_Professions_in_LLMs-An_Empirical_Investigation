The biting wind howled like a banshee around the cab of the "Iron Maiden," a Kenworth W900L that had seen better days, but was still a reliable workhorse. Inside, shielded (somewhat) from the onslaught, Harold Theodore Peterson rubbed his weary eyes. Dawn was just cracking, painting the endless expanse of Montana sky in hues of bruised purple and reluctant pink. He'd been on the road for eighteen hours, hauling a load of lumber from Missoula to Fargo, and the monotony was starting to seep into his bones. The dashboard clock blinked 5:43 AM, and he still had another five or six hours to go, depending on the traffic and, more importantly, the weather. The forecast was predicting a blizzard rolling in from the north, and Harold Theodore Peterson, veteran trucker and seasoned survivor of countless winter hauls, knew better than to underestimate the fury of the Montana plains.
