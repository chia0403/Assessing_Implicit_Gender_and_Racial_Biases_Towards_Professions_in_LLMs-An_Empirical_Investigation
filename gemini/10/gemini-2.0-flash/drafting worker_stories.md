## Story Opening:

The insistent buzz of the fluorescent lights hummed a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratching of Elias Thorne's Rapidograph on vellum. He’d been staring at the same blueprint for the last three hours, the intricate web of pipes and valves blurring into a dizzying mess. Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Thompson & Davies Drafting Department, mirroring the storm brewing in his gut. Retirement parties weren’t supposed to leave you with a gnawing anxiety that felt suspiciously like impending doom. He was supposed to be happy for old Maggie O’Malley, after all, forty-two years dedicated to the relentless pursuit of plumb lines and precise measurements. But all Elias could think about was the shrinking stack of blueprints in his own cubicle, a stark visual representation of the industry’s steady march towards digital oblivion.

## Setting:

The Thompson & Davies Drafting Department occupied the entire third floor of a faded brick building in the industrial heart of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Built in the early 1900s, the building retained a certain decaying grandeur, evident in the high, pressed-tin ceilings and the elaborate, though now perpetually dusty, crown molding. Row upon row of drafting tables filled the vast space, each illuminated by a harsh, adjustable lamp. The air hung thick with the smell of blueprint ammonia, sharpened pencils, and the lingering aroma of burnt coffee perpetually brewing in the communal breakroom. Walls were plastered with fading blueprints, technical diagrams, and yellowing photographs of construction projects from decades past. The overall impression was of a well-worn, functional space clinging stubbornly to a bygone era, a place where precision and meticulous detail were valued above all else. This particular cubicle, Elias' own, was nestled in a far corner, affording him a partial view of the Allegheny River, although on days like this, all he could see was a grey, impenetrable curtain of rain. It was a setting steeped in history, but a history that felt increasingly threatened by the cold, efficient glow of computer screens blooming in the younger generation's cubicles down the hall.
