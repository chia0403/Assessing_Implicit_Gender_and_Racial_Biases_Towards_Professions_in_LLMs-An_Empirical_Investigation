## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy over New Orleans. Spanish moss dripped from the ancient oaks lining St. Charles Avenue, casting long, skeletal shadows across the streetcar tracks. The air tasted of coffee and regret, a common morning cocktail for a city that thrived on late nights and second chances. The faint strains of a mournful trumpet, a lone musician serenading the empty streets, drifted from the French Quarter.

**Opening:** Amelia "Millie" Dubois stared into the bottom of her lukewarm chicory coffee, the faint sediment swirling like a miniature hurricane. Four AM. An ungodly hour, even for a lawyer on the edge. But sleep had become a luxury she couldn't afford, not with the weight of the world – or at least, the weight of her latest case – pressing down on her chest. She wasn't usually one for sentimentality, but right now, even the familiar comfort of the Cafe Du Monde was offering little solace. She ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, the tension headache throbbing behind her eyes a constant reminder of the impossible task ahead. This wasn't just another pro bono case; this was personal. This was about more than just justice. This was about redemption, for her client and, perhaps, for herself.
