## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of burnt sugar hairspray and disappointment hung thick in the air, clinging to the vinyl booths of the diner like a forgotten promise.  Penelope “Penny” Ainsworth swirled the lukewarm coffee in her chipped mug, the condensation tracing wet circles on the already sticky surface of the table.  Outside, the neon sign of “Betty’s Bites” flickered sporadically, mirroring the erratic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Five years. Five years she'd poured her savings, her energy, and every last drop of creative spark into "Penelope's Parlour," and today, the bank had slapped a notice on her door that was more permanent than any perm she'd ever given. Eviction.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the small, economically struggling town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. Penny's Parlour, formerly a thriving hub of local gossip and carefully curated beauty, is located on the main street, sandwiched between a dusty antique store and the aforementioned Betty's Bites diner. Harmony Creek is the kind of town where everyone knows everyone else’s business, where the highlight of the week is Friday night football, and where progress moves at a glacial pace.  It's a town of weathered faces, hardworking hands, and a fierce loyalty to its own. The beauty standards are… traditional, let's say. Think big hair, bold lipstick, and meticulously maintained nails, rather than avant-garde cuts and subtle contouring.
