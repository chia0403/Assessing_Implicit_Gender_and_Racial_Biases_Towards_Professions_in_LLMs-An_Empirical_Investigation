The fluorescent lights of Sterling Insurance, humming with a manic energy they didn’t possess past 5 PM, buzzed a discordant tune above her head. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, bleary-eyed and battling the insistent prickle of a headache, stared at the overflowing “IN” tray. It looked like a hungry maw, patiently waiting to devour her sanity one triplicate form at a time. The aroma of stale coffee, perpetually brewed in the communal kitchenette down the hall, clung to the air like a persistent ghost.

Eleanor’s setting was decidedly less romantic. She sat in a beige, fabric-covered office chair that perpetually squeaked whenever she dared to shift, her station tucked away in a windowless cubicle on the seventh floor of Sterling Insurance’s headquarters. The building, a concrete monstrosity nicknamed "The Sterling Silver Surfer" for its vaguely metallic sheen and tendency to reflect the harsh midday sun, dominated the skyline of downtown Port Blossom, Ohio. Eleanor's view consisted solely of a pale gray partition plastered with motivational posters featuring images of eagles soaring and platitudes about reaching for the stars, none of which alleviated the monotony of her daily grind. She was, quite simply, surrounded by beige and paperwork, the unfortunate queen of a very dull kingdom.
