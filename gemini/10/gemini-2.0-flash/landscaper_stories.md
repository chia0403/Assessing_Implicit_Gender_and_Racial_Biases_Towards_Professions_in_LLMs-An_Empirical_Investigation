Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our landscaper:

**Setting:**

The sun beat down on the affluent suburban street in Oak Haven, Connecticut. Manicured lawns, each a testament to wealth and meticulous care, stretched like emerald carpets between stately colonial houses. The air, thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming hydrangeas, hummed with the rhythmic drone of lawnmowers and the soft clatter of garden tools. It was late July, the peak season for landscaping, and the pressure to maintain these suburban paradises was palpable.

**Story Opening:**

The screech of metal against asphalt announced the arrival of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, owner and sole employee of "Higgins Horticultural Harmony," driving his beat-up 1988 Ford F-150. Rust bloomed along its fender like a rebellious wildflower, a stark contrast to the pristine vehicles parked in the driveways of Bart's clientele. He sighed, running a hand through his perpetually dusty brown hair. Another day, another perfectly symmetrical shrub to trim, another patch of crabgrass to eradicate, another fortune to be made off the anxieties of homeowners obsessed with curb appeal. Today's target? The impeccably maintained estate of Mrs. Eleanor Van Derlyn, a woman whose expectations were as high as her property taxes. He killed the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the chirping of crickets already preparing for dusk, and braced himself. "Alright, Higgins," he muttered to himself, grabbing his well-worn gardening gloves, "Let's harmonize."
