## Story Opening:

The first chill of autumn had already bitten the high peaks, a stark contrast to the sun-baked stone yard where Alistair MacLeod wrestled a granite boulder into submission. Dust, fine as powdered bone, clung to his sweat-soaked shirt and embedded itself in the deep lines etched around his eyes. He paused, the heavy hammer resting against the rough surface of the stone, and wiped his brow with a grimy forearm. The rhythmic clang of his tools, a constant soundtrack to his life for the past forty years, had fallen silent, replaced by the harsh rasp of his own breath. He felt the familiar ache in his shoulders, the weariness that settled deep in his bones like the granite itself.

He looked up at the lowering sun, a fiery orb sinking behind the jagged silhouette of the Sawtooth Mountains. Another day almost gone. Another monument chipped closer to completion. He spat on the ground, a dark globule that quickly disappeared into the dry earth. He wasn't getting any younger, and the cold, unyielding stone seemed to mock his dwindling strength.

## Setting:

The stone yard itself was a chaotic landscape of half-finished monuments, discarded chips of granite glittering like diamonds, and piles of tools worn smooth with years of use. It sat nestled at the foot of the Sawtooth Mountains, a range known for its distinctive, serrated peaks and its abundance of high-quality granite. The air, usually clear and crisp, was thick with the pervasive dust that was the lifeblood and the curse of every stonemason in the region. Scattered around the yard were crude wooden sheds that served as workshops and storage, their roofs sagging under the weight of the harsh winters. A single, dilapidated wagon, its wheels half-buried in the dust, sat near the entrance, a silent testament to the slow, deliberate pace of life in this remote corner of the world. Beyond the stone yard, a narrow, winding road snaked its way towards the small town of Granite Gulch, a settlement built entirely on the back of the stone industry and perpetually bathed in the same gray dust as Alistair MacLeod himself.
