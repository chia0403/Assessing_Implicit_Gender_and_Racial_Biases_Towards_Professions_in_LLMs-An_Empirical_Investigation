## Story Opening:

The insistent, jarring buzz of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's alarm clock dragged her from a dream where she was performing surgery on a miniature giraffe. She groaned, swatting blindly at the device until the noise ceased, leaving a ringing silence in its wake. 4:30 AM. Another dawn, another frantic bleating, barking, or meowing demanding her immediate attention.

Ellie sat up, the threadbare patchwork quilt sliding off her shoulders. Outside, the world was a pre-dawn watercolor of indigo and grey, slowly yielding to the promise of a crisp autumn day. A mournful hoot echoed from the distant woods, and closer, the comforting rhythm of waves crashing against the rocky shore. This was her life now: the relentless call of the wild, tempered by the gentle rustle of sea oats and the salty tang of the ocean air. 

She sighed, running a hand through her sleep-tousled auburn hair. At least the giraffe surgery had gone well. In reality, she suspected her first patient of the day would be far less cooperative.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Seagull's Rest, Maine**, a small, windswept coastal town clinging to the edge of the Atlantic. Ellie Finch operates her veterinary practice, **"Coastal Creatures Veterinary Clinic,"** out of a converted barn on the outskirts of town. The clinic is charmingly rustic, smelling faintly of hay and disinfectant, with mismatched furniture and walls adorned with framed drawings from local schoolchildren.

The barn overlooks a small, rocky beach, where fishing boats bob gently in the harbor. The town itself is a quaint collection of brightly colored houses, antique shops, and seafood restaurants, all connected by narrow, winding streets. A dense forest borders the town to the west, providing a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife, from deer and foxes to the occasional moose and bear. The ocean is a constant presence, both a source of livelihood for the town's fishermen and a powerful, unpredictable force that shapes the lives of everyone who calls Seagull's Rest home. The season is **late October**, just before the first real snows are expected, lending a sense of urgency and preparation to the air.
