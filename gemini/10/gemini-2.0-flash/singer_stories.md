Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a singer:

**Setting:**

The year is 1968. The air hangs thick with the scent of patchouli and rebellion in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Sunlight filters through the eucalyptus trees, dappling the weathered wooden porch of a small, ramshackle bungalow nestled high in the hills. Inside, the walls are painted a vibrant, chaotic mix of colors, adorned with psychedelic posters, vintage tapestries, and a scattering of dreamcatchers. A worn Persian rug covers most of the floor, partially obscuring the outlines of paint splatters from forgotten art projects. A well-loved but slightly out-of-tune piano sits prominently in the corner, its ivory keys yellowed with age.

**Opening:**

A plume of smoke curled lazily from the lit end of a slim, hand-rolled cigarette balanced precariously on the edge of a chipped ceramic ashtray. Across the room, **Esmeralda "Esme" Paloma Blackwood** sat hunched over a worn leather-bound journal, its pages filled with a frantic scrawl of lyrics and half-finished poems. The afternoon sun, blazing against her pale face, highlighted the smudges of eyeliner beneath her large, expressive eyes. She tapped a long, slender finger against her teeth, lost in the labyrinth of her own thoughts. Her voice, usually a soaring, soulful instrument, was currently trapped behind a wall of writer's block, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the incessant drone of a distant motorcycle struggling up the steep, winding road.

Esme exhaled a frustrated sigh, tossing the pen onto the journal with a clatter. "Come on, Esme," she muttered to herself, her voice barely a whisper, "something. Anything. You've got a gig tomorrow night, and all you've got is a melody that sounds suspiciously like a lost Beatles B-side." She pushed herself up from the floor, her vintage velvet dress rustling softly, and wandered over to the piano. Maybe, just maybe, a few chords could conjure up the spark she desperately needed.
