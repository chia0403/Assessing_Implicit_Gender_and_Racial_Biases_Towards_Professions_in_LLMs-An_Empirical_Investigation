**Story Opening:**

The clatter of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the shack was almost deafening. It was a constant, drumming rhythm that threatened to drown out the whisper of the waves crashing against the rocky shore a mere fifty feet away. Inside, a single, bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light across a cluttered desk. Pages, some crumpled, some covered in furious scribbles, littered the surface like fallen leaves after a storm. In the centre of it all, hunched over a battered typewriter, sat Ignatius Blackwood, his brow furrowed in concentration, a half-smoked cigarette precariously balanced on the edge of a chipped teacup. He paused, his fingers hovering above the keys, and took a long, slow drag. The taste was bitter, a fitting accompaniment to the stale loneliness that had become his constant companion. Another line refused to come. Another sentence dead on the page. The damn thing was mocking him.

**Setting:**

The scene is set in a dilapidated, single-room shack perched precariously on the rugged coast of Cornwall, England. It is autumn, judging by the relentless rain and the grey, churning sea visible through the shack's single, grimy window. The interior is sparsely furnished. A rickety bed in the corner, covered with a threadbare blanket, suggests a life of minimal comfort. Beside it, a small, rusting gas heater struggles to ward off the damp chill that permeates the air. The walls are bare and peeling, stained with years of sea spray and neglect. The focal point is undoubtedly the desk, a testament to Ignatius’s dedication (or perhaps obsession) with his craft. Despite the disarray, a certain order exists amongst the chaos; each discarded page, each overflowing ashtray, a silent testament to the writer’s tireless struggle to capture the story simmering within him. The overwhelming impression is one of isolation, both physical and emotional. The shack is a refuge, but also a prison, a place where inspiration is as fickle as the Cornish weather.
