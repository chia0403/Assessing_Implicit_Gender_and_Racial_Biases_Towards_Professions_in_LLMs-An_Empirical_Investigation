Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a logger named Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan:

**Story Opening:**

The howl started low, a mournful sigh lost in the throat of the forest. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan paused, hand hovering over the throttle of his chainsaw. He cut the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the sound. It wasn’t the wind; Bart knew the language of these woods better than his own name. It was something alive, something close, and something deeply, unsettlingly *wrong*. He’d heard enough injured animals in his thirty years to recognize the note of pain, but this was different. This was… despair.

He laid the chainsaw carefully on the damp earth, the metallic smell a jarring intrusion in the pine-scented air. He'd been working a particularly stubborn redwood, its rings a testament to centuries of silent watching.  "Damn fool wolf, probably got himself caught in a snare again," he muttered, though he didn't believe it for a second.  He pulled his axe from the log, the familiar weight a comfort in his calloused hand. He would check it out.  Not because he cared about wolves, not particularly, but because that sound was grating on his nerves, and a logger had a duty to the woods, even if the woods didn’t always appreciate it.
**Setting:**

The story is set deep in the **Avenue of the Giants** area of **Humboldt Redwoods State Park** in Northern California, circa 1960.

*   **Visual:** Immense, ancient redwood trees dominate the landscape. Their massive trunks, often ten to fifteen feet in diameter, rise hundreds of feet into the sky, creating a cathedral-like atmosphere. Sunlight filters weakly through the dense canopy, casting long, dappled shadows on the forest floor. Ferns, mosses, and redwood sorrel carpet the undergrowth, creating a lush, verdant environment. Logged areas show stark contrast, stumps standing as monuments to fallen giants.
*   **Sensory:** The air is cool and damp, smelling of pine needles, rich earth, and the faint, sweet scent of redwood bark. The only sounds are the occasional rustle of leaves, the drip of water from the trees, and the distant roar of the Eel River. Sometimes, the rumble of logging trucks on the nearby highway breaks the tranquility.
*   **Socio-economic:**  The area is heavily reliant on the logging industry. Small towns cling to the edges of the forest, their economies directly tied to the fate of the redwood trees.  There's a constant tension between the loggers, who see the trees as a resource, and the environmentalists (though the movement is only just beginning to gain traction), who fight to protect the remaining old-growth forests.  It's a hardscrabble life for many, with long hours and dangerous work.  The attitudes of the time are generally pro-development and wary of outsiders.

I hope this opening and setting are a good starting point for your story! Let me know if you have any other questions.
