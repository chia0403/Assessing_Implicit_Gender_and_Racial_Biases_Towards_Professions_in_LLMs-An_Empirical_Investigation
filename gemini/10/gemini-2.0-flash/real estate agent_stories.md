The salt-laced wind whipped around Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, tugging at the silk scarf tied artfully around her neck. The scarf, a vibrant splash of turquoise and coral, was entirely out of place against the backdrop of peeling paint and weather-beaten grey clapboard that defined Port Blossom. Eleanor, however, was not. She was a master of adapting, a chameleon in a cashmere sweater.

Port Blossom wasn’t exactly known for its cashmere clientele. More like retired fishermen, artists with more hope than funds, and a scattering of summer tourists lured by the promise of quaint charm and fresh lobster. And right now, that charm was obscured by the encroaching fog, clinging to the air like a damp shroud.

Eleanor adjusted the 'For Sale' sign hammered into the overgrown lawn of the property. 13 Seafoam Lane. The Widow Pettigrew’s former residence. Prime real estate, if you overlooked the structural issues, the leaky roof, the persistent scent of mothballs, and the lingering rumor that the Widow Pettigrew hadn’t exactly *left* the property.

The setting sun, a hazy orange orb threatening to disappear completely behind the gathering mist, cast long, distorted shadows across the porch, making the house seem even more haunted than it already was. Eleanor, despite her polished exterior, couldn't help a shiver trace its way down her spine. This wasn’t just a property; it was a test. A test to see if she, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, newly relocated to Port Blossom after a slightly-less-than-graceful exit from Boston’s cutthroat real estate scene, had what it took to thrive in a place where charm was currency and secrets were buried deeper than the pilings holding the houses upright.
