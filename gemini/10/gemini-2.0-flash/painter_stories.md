The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging the face of Eleanor Aurora Finch as she wrestled with her easel. Salt spray speckled the canvas, a mosaic of unintended texture across the almost-finished rendering of the tempestuous waves crashing against the craggy cliffs of Marsden Rock. She swore under her breath, a puff of white dissolving instantly into the relentless gale. October in South Shields was never kind, but the dramatic light was too irresistible to ignore, even for someone who’d spent a lifetime chasing it.

Eleanor Finch, or El, as she preferred to be called, had come to the north-east coast seeking solace and inspiration after a bruising year in London. The art world had chewed her up and spat her out, leaving her confidence shattered and her palette feeling distinctly… grey. She'd traded her cramped Notting Hill studio for a tiny, whitewashed cottage overlooking the sea, hoping the vastness of the horizon might somehow clear the blockage in her soul and coax the vibrant colours back onto her canvas.

The cottage itself, named "Seabird's Rest" by its previous, presumably more sentimental, owner, was tucked away at the end of a cobbled lane, a haven from the tourists who flocked to the beaches during the summer months. Inside, it was a comforting jumble of mismatched furniture, salvaged from charity shops and antique markets. Jars overflowed with brushes, tubes of paint were scattered like fallen soldiers across her worktable, and the scent of linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of her chosen path, a path she desperately hoped she hadn’t completely lost.
