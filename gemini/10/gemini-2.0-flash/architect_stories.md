## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** Venice, Italy, a sweltering July afternoon. The narrow, cobbled streets thrum with the cacophony of tourist chatter and the gentle lapping of water against ancient stone foundations. The air hangs thick and heavy, perfumed with the mingled scents of saltwater, exhaust fumes from a passing vaporetto, and the unmistakable, alluring aroma of frying cicchetti from a nearby bacaro.

**Story Opening:**

The heat radiating off the sun-baked Piazza San Marco felt oppressive, even through the wide brim of Eleonora Isabella Rossi's Panama hat. She tugged at the linen scarf clinging uncomfortably to her neck, wishing she'd chosen a lighter dress. The shimmering mirage of the Basilica di San Marco distorted in the heat haze as she glanced up, her eyes, the colour of rich, dark espresso, searching. She was late, of course. Signor Moretti, the prospective client whoâ€™d practically begged for a meeting to discuss his latest grand vision, was undoubtedly already impatiently tapping his polished shoe on the ancient marble. Eleonora knew she should have left the studio earlier, but the final revisions to the Museo del Vetro expansion had held her captive. Glass and light; her obsessions, her joys, and sometimes, her downfalls when it came to punctuality. Taking a deep breath, Eleonora adjusted her architectural plans, tucked neatly beneath her arm, and navigated the throng of selfie-stick wielding tourists with the practiced ease of a native Venetian. Another afternoon, another project, another dance on the crumbling stage of a city she both loved and despaired of. But this time, something felt different. A subtle shift in the atmosphere, a prickle of unease she couldn't quite place. It was as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
