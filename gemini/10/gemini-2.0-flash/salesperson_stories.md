## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The harsh, blinding glare of a late August sun bounced off the chrome hood of a cherry-red 1967 Mustang, baking the asphalt of the used car lot in Phoenix, Arizona. The air shimmered with heat, making the rows of dusty sedans and dented trucks seem to melt and reform in the distance. A lone saguaro cactus stood sentinel in the corner of the lot, casting a meager shadow that offered little relief.

**Opening:** Perspiration beaded on the forehead of Reginald Augustus Worthington III, clinging to the meticulously styled comb-over that was doing its damnedest to conceal the creeping bald spot beneath. He tugged at the knot of his paisley tie, the polyester fabric sticking uncomfortably to his sweat-soaked shirt. Reginald, known to his colleagues (and sometimes even to himself) as “Reggie the Resurrector,” was staring intently at a faded, baby-blue Ford Pinto, its once-proud paint job now peeling like sunburned skin. He saw potential. He *always* saw potential. After all, turning lemons into lemonade was his specialty, and that Pinto… well, it was practically a lemon orchard. He just needed the right sucker – er, customer.
