The scent of sugared almonds and roasting apples hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the leaded windows of the bakery.  It was just before dawn, that still-dark-and-silent hour where the world belonged only to the dreamers and the bakers.  And this morning, it belonged to Genevieve Fleur Dubois.

Genevieve, or Gen as most folks in the sleepy Cotswold village of Willowbrook called her, hummed softly to herself, a half-remembered Christmas carol bubbling from her lips as she wrestled a hefty bag of flour onto the scarred wooden countertop.  The bakery, "Fleur's Flourishes," was her kingdom, a warm, inviting space bursting with terracotta tiles, mismatched vintage furniture, and the constant, happy aroma of baking bread.  Sunlight, when it eventually deigned to break through the perpetually overcast sky, would stream through the window overlooking the village square, illuminating the neatly arranged rows of sourdough loaves, gingerbread men, and Gen's signature éclairs – each one a miniature work of art. 

Willowbrook itself was postcard-perfect, a cluster of honey-stone buildings nestled beside a babbling brook. Life moved slowly here, measured by the changing seasons and the predictable rhythm of village events: the summer fete, the autumn harvest festival, and the Christmas carol sing-along by the ancient oak tree in the square.  Gen loved it here, the comforting familiarity, the close-knit community. But lately, a restlessness had been stirring within her, a yearning for something more than the comforting predictability of her life. And as she dusted her hands with flour and gazed out at the sleeping village, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change.
