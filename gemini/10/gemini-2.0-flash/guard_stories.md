Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a guard named:

**Main Character:**  Seraphina Elara Thorne

**Setting:**  The Obsidian Gate, a colossal arched structure of volcanic rock carved with snarling gargoyles, marks the only land entrance to the floating city of Aerilon.  Aerilon hangs suspended above a perpetually stormy sea, powered by ancient, forgotten technology. The Gate itself is situated on a narrow, windswept plateau overlooking the churning abyss.  The sky is a perpetual twilight, illuminated only by the flickering, violet lightning that dances around Aerilon's shimmering towers.  The air is thick with the scent of ozone and brine.

**Story Opening:**

The wind howled like a banshee, tugging at Seraphina Elara Thorne's cloak and threatening to rip it clean off her back. She pulled the heavy, obsidian-colored fabric tighter around her, its rough weave offering little comfort against the biting chill that seeped into her bones. Below, the churning sea spat angry whitecaps towards the cliff face, a dizzying reminder of the perilous drop that awaited any who faltered on their watch.  Another flash of violet lightning illuminated the Obsidian Gate, painting the snarling gargoyles in stark relief, their shadows seeming to writhe and twist in the unnatural light. Seraphina shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Five years she'd stood guard here, five years of listening to the wind's ceaseless lament and the city's humming energy, but the unsettling feeling that something was about to change, something significant, refused to leave her.  Tonight, more than ever, the Obsidian Gate felt less like a protector, and more like a cage.
