## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The harsh, unforgiving glare of a July sun beat down on the dusty parking lot of the "St. Jude's Outreach Clinic" in Harmony Creek, Arizona. The clinic, a squat, prefabricated building that looked like it had been dropped in the middle of nowhere, hummed with the relentless drone of overworked air conditioning. The air inside, however, barely managed to fight off the suffocating heat, leaving a thin film of perspiration on everyone and everything.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrix "Bea" Bellweather, phlebotomist extraordinaire, slammed the screen door behind her with a practiced thwack. The fly buzzing stubbornly around her head finally gave up and buzzed away, back to the sun-baked asphalt and the promise of discarded sweet tea. Bea sighed, the sound barely audible over the whirring of the waiting room's ceiling fan. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the indentations from her safety glasses already starting to itch. Another Monday, another mountain of venipunctures. Her red Mary Janes, mismatched with her floral scrubs (a deliberate act of rebellion against the clinic's drab beige aesthetic), squeaked softly on the linoleum floor as she made her way to the back office. The faint smell of antiseptic and fear clung to the air, a familiar perfume she had, unfortunately, grown accustomed to. She grabbed her coffee mug – chipped and stained with the remnants of countless hurried brews – and filled it to the brim from the lukewarm pot bubbling on the burner. "Just another day in paradise," she muttered under her breath, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach her tired, hazel eyes. And then, she heard it. A muffled sob coming from Exam Room 3, and a name whispered in a desperate tone that made her stop, coffee mug halfway to her lips. "Please, Dr. Ramirez... please... Bea Bellweather can't find out."
