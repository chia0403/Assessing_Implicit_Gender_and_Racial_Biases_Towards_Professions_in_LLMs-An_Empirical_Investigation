The stale air hung thick with the scent of jet fuel and regret. Amelia “Amy” Rosewood leaned against the corrugated metal wall of the hangar, the greasy dampness seeping through the back of her flight suit. Outside, the endless, flat expanse of the Nevada desert shimmered under the brutal midday sun, a heat haze blurring the distant jagged peaks. Here, in Area 51, the world felt both utterly isolated and perpetually scrutinized.

Amy, a pilot whose name was once whispered with reverence amongst the Air Force elite, felt like a ghost in this place. She had flown the fastest, most advanced aircraft the world had ever seen, danced with the edge of the atmosphere, and stared down the barrels of things no human was ever meant to comprehend. But that was before. Before the accident, before the rumors, before they grounded her and banished her to this desolate corner of the country, flying “test flights” that were more like glorified babysitting of experimental tech.

She pulled a crumpled pack of cigarettes from her pocket, the lighter already in her hand. The click of the igniter was sharp in the relative quiet, the acrid smoke a familiar comfort against the gnawing anxiety that had become her constant companion. Another day in purgatory. Another day waiting for something to happen, something that might either break her completely or, against all odds, set her free.
