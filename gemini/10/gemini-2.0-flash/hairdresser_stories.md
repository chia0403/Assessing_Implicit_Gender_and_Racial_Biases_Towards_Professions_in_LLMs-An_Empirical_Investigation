The humid summer air hung thick and heavy in "Shear Perfection," clinging to Amelia Rose Thornton like a damp towel. Outside, the late afternoon sun was starting to mellow, painting the quaint little town of Havenwood in hues of peach and gold. But inside, the salon was a whirlwind of hairspray fumes, the rhythmic snip-snip of Amelia’s scissors, and the low hum of gossip flowing between clients and stylists.

Amelia, her blonde hair pulled back into a messy bun that perpetually threatened to unravel, navigated the chaos with the grace of a seasoned dancer. Her smock, perpetually speckled with errant strands of every imaginable color, bore testament to years spent transforming Havenwood's residents from drab to dazzling (or at least, presentable for the annual church picnic). She loved the controlled chaos of her domain, the intimate connection she forged with each person who sat in her chair, and the satisfaction of wielding her scissors like a sculptor’s chisel, shaping not just hair, but confidence. But today, a subtle restlessness simmered beneath her usual cheerful demeanor. The scent of perming solution and stale coffee couldn't quite mask the faint aroma of impending change hanging in the air. Today felt different.
