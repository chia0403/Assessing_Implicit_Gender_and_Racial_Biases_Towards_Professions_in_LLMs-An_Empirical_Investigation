## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Serenity Nails & Spa" buzzed overhead, a discordant hum against the tranquil rainforest sounds piped in through the speakers. Olivia Grace Davenport tapped her manicured, bubblegum-pink nail against the cool glass counter, a nervous rhythm that betrayed the calm facade she usually cultivated. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the windows, mirroring the relentless storm brewing within her. Three appointments had canceled in the last hour, leaving her with nothing but the rhythmic whir of the ventilation system and the creeping dread that this, this quiet, was the calm before another one of *those* storms. The last one, just three months ago, had landed her in the psych ward with a diagnosis and a prescription she’d promptly flushed down the toilet. Olivia hated pills. She hated the dulling haze they cast over everything, the way they stifled the vibrant, chaotic symphony of her mind. Right now, she needed that symphony. She needed its energy, its drive, its…*everything*. She needed it to survive.

## Setting:

**Serenity Nails & Spa** is tucked away in a quiet, albeit somewhat dilapidated, strip mall in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. The strip mall, painted a faded salmon color, is comprised of a laundromat, a struggling vintage clothing store, and a perpetually closed-down deli. Inside Serenity Nails & Spa, Olivia has tried to create a haven of peace and tranquility, a stark contrast to the gray skies and urban grit outside. Walls are painted a calming sage green, adorned with framed prints of cherry blossoms and serene landscapes. Four plush, oversized pedicure chairs line one wall, each with its own bubbling foot bath. Three manicure stations are neatly arranged on the opposite side, each equipped with the latest nail tools and a dizzying array of nail polishes in every shade imaginable. The air smells faintly of acetone and lavender, an attempt to mask the more pungent chemical odors. Despite Olivia’s best efforts, the space feels slightly worn, a testament to the constant wear and tear of daily life and the meager profits she scrapes together. The reception desk, manned (or rather, womanned) by Olivia, is strategically placed to offer a clear view of the entrance, allowing her to greet clients and, more importantly, keep an eye on anyone who might disrupt the carefully curated tranquility.
