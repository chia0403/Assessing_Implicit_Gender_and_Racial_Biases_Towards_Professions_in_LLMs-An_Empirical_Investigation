## Story Opening:

The stale, floral air of the hospice clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a shroud. She tugged at the too-tight collar of her navy blazer, the heat in the small visitation room exacerbating her already simmering anxiety. Eleanor hated hospices. Hated the antiseptic optimism layered thinly over the pervasive scent of decay and the dull hum of machinery fighting a losing battle. But she was here for a reason, a grim professional reason that demanded she steel herself and ignore the tremor in her hands.

The woman in the bed, a frail figure almost swallowed by the white sheets, was barely recognizable. Her skin, once vibrant and sun-kissed, was now papery and translucent, stretched taut over the sharp angles of her skull. Eleanor pulled up a chair and placed her briefcase, heavy with files and psychological assessments, beside her. She took a deep breath, the floral scent now feeling suffocating.

"Hello, Mrs. Abernathy," Eleanor began, her voice carefully modulated and low. "My name is Dr. Eleanor Vance. I'm a forensic psychologist." The woman didn't stir, her chest rising and falling with the shallow, labored rhythm of a broken clock. Eleanor continued, "I'm here to talk to you aboutâ€¦ your son, Michael."

A faint flicker in the woman's eyes, a ghost of recognition, told Eleanor she had finally pierced the fog of morphine and dementia. It was a fragile connection, but it was enough. The clock was ticking, and Eleanor Vance had a story to unravel before it ran out of time.

## Setting:

The story initially opens in **St. Jude's Hospice**, a sprawling, single-story building nestled in the quiet outskirts of the small, coastal town of **Havenwood, Maine**. The hospice, known for its scenic garden and purportedly compassionate care, stands in stark contrast to the dark secrets that lie buried within the Abernathy family. Havenwood itself is a town steeped in New England history, known for its picturesque harbor, charming antique shops, and a lingering unease that hangs in the salt-tinged air. The idyllic facade hides a history of disappearances and unsolved mysteries, a breeding ground for dark secrets and long-held grudges.
