Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and an electrician named as the main character:

**Setting:** A creaky, Victorian-era lighthouse perched precariously on the jagged, wave-battered cliffs of Blackwood Island, Maine. The air is thick with the briny smell of the sea and the mournful cry of gulls. Inside, the circular rooms are dim, lit only by dust-motes dancing in the weak daylight filtering through grime-coated windows and the occasional flicker of an emergency lamp. The lighthouse has been decommissioned for years, but the foghorn, thankfully silent, looms large, a rusting monument to a bygone era.

**Opening:**

The shriek of rusty hinges echoed in the cavernous space as Alistair Finch wrestled the heavy oak door of the lighthouse open. He braced against the wind, a gust of salt spray stinging his face. “Blackwood Island,” he muttered, his breath misting in the chilly air. “Just as charming as they said.” Alistair, a third-generation electrician with a toolbox older than some of the buildings he wired, adjusted the strap of his bag on his shoulder and stepped inside. He inhaled deeply, a scent that was part salt, part damp stone, and a whole lot of history filling his lungs. His assignment: to assess the feasibility of rewiring the entire abandoned structure for a potential historical restoration project. A project that, according to the grant proposal he'd read on the ferry over, involved turning the lighthouse into a bed and breakfast. Alistair chuckled humorlessly. He'd seen some rough jobs, but this… this felt like a date with a ghost. The beam of his headlamp cut through the gloom, illuminating a spiral staircase that seemed to disappear into the inky blackness above. "Right then," he said to the empty room, the only sound to answer him being the wind whistling through a crack in the aged glass of the lantern room. "Let's see what horrors this old girl is hiding."
