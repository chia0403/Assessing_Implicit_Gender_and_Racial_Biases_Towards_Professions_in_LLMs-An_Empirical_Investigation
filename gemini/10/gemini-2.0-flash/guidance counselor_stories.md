## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The perpetually lukewarm, beige-toned office of the guidance counselor, Mr. Arthur Reginald Finch, at Northwood High. The air, even in late October, held a faint, lingering scent of chlorine from the nearby swimming pool. Motivational posters ("Reach for the Stars!" plastered across a stock photo of impossibly perfect teens) lined the walls, their cheerfulness actively mocking the weary slump in Arthur's shoulders. Piles of college brochures, SAT prep books, and forgotten permission slips formed precarious mountains on his desk, threatening to avalanche at the slightest provocation. Outside, the sound of the Friday afternoon pep rally for the upcoming Homecoming game vibrated through the thin walls, a discordant symphony of teen angst and manufactured enthusiasm.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a basketball against the linoleum floor pulled Arthur Reginald Finch from his half-hearted attempt to alphabetize scholarship applications. He groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. It was Friday, for crying out loud. Wasn't anyone else excited for the weekend? He glanced at the clock: 3:57 PM. Almost freedom. Then, a voice, muffled but insistent, shattered the fragile peace.

"Mr. Finch? You in there? It's... it's Tiffany."

Arthur sighed. Tiffany Peterson. Of course it was. He braced himself. Tiffany Peterson and trouble were as inseparable as peanut butter and jelly.
