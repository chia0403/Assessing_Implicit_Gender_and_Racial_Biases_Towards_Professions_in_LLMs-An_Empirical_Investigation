## Story Opening:

The stench hit Mario Giovanni Rossi like a physical blow, a pungent cocktail of mildew, stagnant water, and something vaguely reminiscent of rotten fish. He wrinkled his nose, adjusting his worn tool belt and pulling his cap lower over his brow. "Mama mia," he muttered under his breath, "What kind of unholy creature died in here?"

He pushed open the basement door of the Blackwood Estate, a rambling, gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the grimy windows, illuminating cobwebs thick as shrouds and revealing a space that seemed to have been abandoned to the ravages of time and dampness.

## Setting:

The basement was a labyrinth of crumbling brick walls, punctuated by low, arched doorways that led to unseen chambers. Pipes, thick as a man's arm, snaked across the ceiling and down the walls, coated in rust and condensation. Pools of murky water glistened on the uneven concrete floor, reflecting the faint light and adding to the overall sense of decay. A single, bare bulb hung precariously from a wire, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. The air was heavy and damp, clinging to Mario's skin and filling his lungs with a musty chill. This was no ordinary plumbing job. This was a dive into the depths of forgotten history, and Mario Giovanni Rossi had a very bad feeling about it.
