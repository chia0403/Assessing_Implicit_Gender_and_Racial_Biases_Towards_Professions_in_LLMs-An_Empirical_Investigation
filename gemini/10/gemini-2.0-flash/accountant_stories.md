The rhythmic clatter of keyboard keys was the only sound competing with the hum of the fluorescent lights, a familiar symphony that lulled Eleanor Mallory into a state of near-meditative focus. At least, it usually did. Tonight, however, the harmony was grating, each tap a tiny hammer blow against the brick wall she’d erected around her swirling anxiety.

Eleanor Mallory, Certified Public Accountant, sat hunched over her desk, her brow furrowed in concentration. The desk itself was a battlefield of financial statements, receipts organized into precariously balanced stacks, and empty coffee cups rimmed with the tell-tale stains of late nights. Surrounding her was the office of "Mallory & Finch, Certified Public Accountants," located on the third floor of a somewhat dilapidated building in downtown Providence, Rhode Island.

The building, affectionately nicknamed "The Ledger" by its tenants, had seen better days. Peeling paint graced the walls, the elevator shuddered with each ascent and descent, and the faint aroma of mildew hung in the air. Inside, the Mallory & Finch office was a reflection of its partners: meticulously organized, yet possessing a certain worn charm. The walls were painted a soothing (and slightly outdated) shade of seafoam green, and framed photographs – mostly blurry snapshots of office picnics and Christmas parties from years past – adorned the walls. A well-worn ficus tree, a silent witness to countless tax seasons, stood sentinel in the corner. The whole place felt like a comfortable, if slightly faded, sweater.

Tonight, however, the comfort was elusive. The deadline for quarterly taxes loomed, and Eleanor was wrestling with a particularly thorny discrepancy in the accounts of a local seafood restaurant. She ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, pushing stray strands of auburn hair from her face. The numbers just weren't adding up, and the nagging feeling that something was deeply, fundamentally wrong refused to be silenced. It was a feeling Eleanor knew all too well; a feeling that usually preceded a discovery far more significant than a simple accounting error. Tonight, the feeling was almost palpable. Tonight, it felt like trouble.
