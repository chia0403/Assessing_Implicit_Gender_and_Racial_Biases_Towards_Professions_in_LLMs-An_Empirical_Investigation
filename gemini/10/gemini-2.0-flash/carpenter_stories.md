## Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The crisp, pre-dawn air bit at Elias Hawthorne's cheeks as he unlocked the padlock on the weathered gate. Dust motes, disturbed by his movements, danced in the weak beam of his flashlight. The "Yard," as it was universally known, sprawled before him - a chaotic tapestry of salvaged lumber, rusting metal sheets, and the skeletal remains of forgotten projects. Located on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a quiet, almost stubbornly rural town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, the Yard was Elias's sanctuary, his workshop, and, occasionally, his curse.

**Opening:** Elias Hawthorne took a deep breath, the scent of damp wood and earthy decay filling his lungs. He hated mornings, especially mornings that started with the Yard. But today, a peculiar restlessness had tugged him out of bed before the rooster even dared to crow. He couldn't shake the feeling, a persistent prickling at the back of his neck, that something important, something waiting, lay hidden amongst the towering stacks of reclaimed timber. Tonight, the annual Oakhaven Harvest Festival would kick off, and Mayor Hemlock, a man with more bluster than brains, had commissioned Elias to build the centerpiece: a massive, celebratory bonfire platform. Heâ€™d been putting it off, dreading the logistical nightmare, but the Mayor, in his usual fashion, had "suggested" that a "timely completion" would be "beneficial to their ongoing professional relationship." In other words, get it done, or find your lumber supplies mysteriously dwindling. With a sigh, Elias adjusted the strap of his worn leather tool belt, the familiar weight grounding him. Today, he wouldn't be just a carpenter building a platform; he'd be a magician, pulling order from chaos, a temporary bulwark against the creeping dread that seemed to have settled over Oakhaven. And he had a feeling, a deep-seated, unsettling feeling, that this year's bonfire was more important than anyone realized.
