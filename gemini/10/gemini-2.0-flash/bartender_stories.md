Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The Rusty Mug is a dive bar clinging to the edge of the bay in Port Blossom, Maine. Salt-laced air sneaks in through gaps in the weathered clapboard, mixing with the stale scent of spilled beer and decades of regret. String lights, more broken than working, cast a hazy, uneven glow across mismatched furniture â€“ scarred wooden tables, vinyl-ripped booths, and a bar that's seen better centuries. Outside, the mournful clang of foghorns echoes, a constant reminder of the sea's power and the smallness of the town.

**Opening:**

The clock above the liquor bottles read 2:17 AM, but for **Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne**, time had lost all meaning hours ago. Another mournful foghorn blared outside The Rusty Mug, a sound that usually signaled the end of a long shift. Tonight, however, the few lingering patrons were unusually resistant to being shepherded out.

Ellie wiped down the already gleaming bar, the repetitive motion a small comfort in the face of the swirling chaos of her thoughts. Her reflection stared back at her from the polished surface; tired eyes above high cheekbones, a messy braid escaping her pulled-back hair. She wondered if the foghorn was mocking her. She was a bartender, a job she loved. Tonight though, it was starting to feel like a life sentence.
