The insistent chirping of his antiquated alarm clock dragged Dr. Alistair Humphrey Finch from the murky depths of sleep. He groaned, turning onto his side and burying his face in the threadbare pillow. 5:00 AM. Every damned morning, that infernal device demanded he greet the grey light filtering through the grimy windows of his flat. He’d meant to replace it for months, maybe even years, but somehow, amidst the chaos of his life, a new alarm clock always remained at the bottom of a very long list.

His flat, above Mrs. Higgins' pie shop on Harrow Street, smelled perpetually of baking apples and stale coal smoke. It was a comforting, if somewhat suffocating, aroma. The building, a relic of the late Victorian era, groaned and sighed with every gust of wind that swept through the narrow, cobbled streets of Stepney Green, a district in London's East End. Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, and furniture that had seen better days were the defining characteristics of Alistair’s home. It was a far cry from the sterile white walls and gleaming chrome of the Royal London Hospital where he worked, but it was his. A sanctuary of sorts, even if a rather dilapidated one.
