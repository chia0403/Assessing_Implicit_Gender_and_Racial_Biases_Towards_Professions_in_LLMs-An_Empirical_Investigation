**Story Opening:**

The biting wind whipped around Dr. Evelyn Ainsworth, tugging at the edges of her parka as she trudged across the frozen landscape. Each step crunched a protest against the brittle snow, the sound swallowed by the vast, unforgiving silence of the Antarctic plateau. The sun, a pale disc hanging low on the horizon, offered little warmth, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling snow devils. Evelyn stopped, pulling down her goggles to peer at the barely visible marker sticking out of the drift. Site B7. Almost there. Today, after three grueling years of preparation and research, today, she would finally see if her hypothesis held water â€“ or, rather, held ice.

**Setting:**

The story is set at the **Byrd Polar Research Center's remote Deep Ice Core Site B7, located in the interior of West Antarctica.** The landscape is dominated by a seemingly endless expanse of frozen wasteland. The air is bone-chillingly dry and thin, offering no respite from the constant wind. Visibility can be severely limited by blizzards, and the terrain is treacherous, concealing hidden crevasses beneath a deceptive layer of snow. The only structures at Site B7 are a cluster of insulated prefabricated modules: living quarters, a laboratory, a drilling rig, and a power generator, all tethered together by heated walkways to prevent snow accumulation. Inside these modules, the temperature is artificially maintained at a barely tolerable level, but the stark utilitarianism and isolation still press heavily on the small research team. The constant hum of the generators is the only constant companion to the deafening silence outside.
