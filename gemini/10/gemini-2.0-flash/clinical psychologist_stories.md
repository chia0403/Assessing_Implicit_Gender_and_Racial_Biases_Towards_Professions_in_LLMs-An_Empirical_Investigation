The rain hammered against the panoramic window of Dr. Evelyn Reed’s office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the erratic pulse of her own thoughts. The late October afternoon had bled into a prematurely dark twilight, painting the Boston skyline in shades of grey and charcoal. From her perch on the fifteenth floor of the Beacon Street Medical Arts Building, the Charles River looked like a churning serpent, its normally tranquil surface whipped into a frenzy by the coastal gale.

Dr. Evelyn Reed, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and anxiety disorders, smoothed a stray strand of her salt-and-pepper hair behind her ear. Her usually immaculate office, a carefully curated space designed to project calm and competence, felt cluttered and oppressive tonight. Stacks of patient files threatened to topple from her oak desk, and the air hung heavy with the lingering scent of lavender aromatherapy – a pathetic attempt to combat the brewing storm outside, and the equally turbulent storm brewing inside her own mind. She glanced at the clock on the wall – 6:17 PM. Her last patient had cancelled, leaving her with an unwelcome expanse of unscheduled time. A dangerous amount of time to dwell.
