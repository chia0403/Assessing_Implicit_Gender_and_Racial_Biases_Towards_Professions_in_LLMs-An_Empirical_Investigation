The aroma of lavender and eucalyptus clung to the air like a comforting fog, a constant presence in the sanctuary that was Serenity Now Massage Studio. Inside, the muted tones of the walls, the trickling fountain in the corner, and the soft glow of Himalayan salt lamps all contributed to a sense of profound calm. But today, that calm was shattered, at least within the mind of Eleanor Rose Davenport.

It was a Tuesday, usually a gentle day with a steady stream of weary office workers seeking relief from cramped shoulders and aching backs. But Eleanor’s schedule was empty. A rare, and unsettling, anomaly. This morning, instead of kneading knots and loosening tension, she was pacing the polished wooden floors, her brow furrowed, the rhythmic click of her bare feet against the wood the only sound breaking the silence. Her usually meticulously styled auburn hair was pulled back in a messy bun, tendrils escaping and clinging to the sweat forming at her temples. She checked her phone for the tenth time in as many minutes. No new appointments. No cancellations. Just… silence.
