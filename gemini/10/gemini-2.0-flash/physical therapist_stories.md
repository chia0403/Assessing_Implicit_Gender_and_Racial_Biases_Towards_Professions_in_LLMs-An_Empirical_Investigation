## Story Opening:

The squeak of the therapy ball deflated slowly, a mournful sigh in the otherwise sterile silence. Amelia Grace Carter sighed along with it, leaning back against the cool, vinyl-covered examination table. Outside, a relentless November rain hammered against the frosted windows of Carter Rehabilitation Clinic. It was five minutes past closing, her last patient had hobbled out an hour ago, and Amelia was still staring blankly at the exercise schedule taped to the wall, her mind churning a million miles an hour and achieving nothing of substance.

The schedule itself mocked her. Hand-drawn stick figures contorted into various stretches and lifts, all promising strength and mobility. But what good were they when her own motivation felt as limp as a disused resistance band?

## Setting:

The Carter Rehabilitation Clinic occupied a small, ground-floor space in a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine. The walls were painted a calming, yet ultimately uninspiring, pale green. Sunlight, when it dared to break through the perpetually overcast sky, streamed through the oversized windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

The clinic comprised three main rooms: a reception area with uncomfortable, mismatched armchairs and a stack of outdated magazines; a treatment room filled with various pieces of equipment, including the aforementioned deflating therapy ball, a weight machine that looked suspiciously like it belonged in a 1980s gym, and a set of resistance bands of varying strengths that hung precariously from a hook on the wall; and a small, cramped office that Amelia used for paperwork and private consultations. The aroma of antiseptic, old liniment, and a faint hint of her grandmother's lavender potpourri (a well-intentioned but ultimately cloying gift) permeated every corner, a constant reminder of the decades of healing – and stagnation – that had preceded her in this space.
