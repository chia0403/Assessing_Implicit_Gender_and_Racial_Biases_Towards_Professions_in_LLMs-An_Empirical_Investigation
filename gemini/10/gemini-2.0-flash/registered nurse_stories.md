## Story Opening:

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was a persistent, unwelcome counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Amelia Grace Thatcher, RN, pressed her stethoscope a little harder against Mrs. Henderson's chest, trying to discern any change over the din of the rain lashing against the windows. Nothing. Just that faint, raspy wheeze that had been plaguing the older woman all night.

Amelia straightened, pulling the stethoscope from her ears. Her own breath hitched in her throat, a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Three hours left until the end of her shift, three hours to keep this woman, and the other twenty-odd souls under her care, alive and stable in this isolated corner of the world.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the **St. Jude's Community Clinic**, nestled in the remote Alaskan town of **Hope's End**. The town, population dwindling to just over a hundred residents, is accessible only by a treacherous, single-lane road that snaked through the unforgiving Chugach Mountains, or by bush plane, weather permitting. St. Jude's, the sole medical facility for miles, is a ramshackle, single-story building constructed of sturdy, albeit aged, timber. The interior is sparsely furnished with outdated equipment and well-worn furniture, reflecting the clinic's limited budget and the community's reliance on resourceful improvisation. Tonight, the clinic feels especially isolated, the darkness outside thick and impenetrable, amplified by the relentless storm that threatens to cut Hope's End off from the outside world completely.
