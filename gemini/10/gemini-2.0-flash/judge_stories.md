Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a judge as the main character:

**Setting:** The setting is a small, aging courthouse in the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. The building itself is a stoic brick structure, built in the early 1900s. Its paint is peeling in places, and ivy creeps up its sides, a testament to the slow, relentless march of time. Inside, the air hangs heavy with the scent of old paper, dust, and a faint, lingering aroma of pipe tobacco - a habit of Judge Mallory's predecessor. The courtroom, while still holding a degree of somber grandeur, betrays its age. The mahogany benches are worn smooth by years of use, the velvet drapes are faded, and the single, large window behind the judge's bench looks out onto a perpetually gray and misty town square.

**Opening:**

Judge Eleanor Abigail Mallory adjusted her spectacles, the silver frames pinching the bridge of her nose. The flickering fluorescent lights of the Havenwood County Courthouse seemed determined to cast her face in perpetual shadow, highlighting the lines etched by years of dispensing justice – or, more often in Havenwood, settling disputes over stray livestock and property lines. Outside, the November rain drummed a mournful tattoo against the grimy windowpanes, a sound that mirrored the low hum of unease that had settled in her stomach ever since Sheriff Brody had called her late last night. This wasn’t a stray livestock kind of morning. This morning, a body had been found. And not just any body. This morning, Havenwood had lost one of its own, and Judge Eleanor Mallory knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that the quiet, isolated peace of Havenwood was about to be shattered.
