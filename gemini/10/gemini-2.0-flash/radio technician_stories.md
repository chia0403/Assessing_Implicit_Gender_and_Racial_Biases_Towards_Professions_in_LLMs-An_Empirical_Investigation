## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A creaking, dust-choked cabin perched atop the lonely peak of Mount Seraphim, a place more rumour than landmark on the western edge of the Appalachian Mountains. The cabin, affectionately (and ironically) nicknamed "The Hum" by locals, was a relic of a forgotten government experiment in long-range radio communication. Inside, wires snaked across peeling wallpaper, the air thick with the scent of ozone and old vacuum tubes. Rain lashed against the single, cracked window, blurring the world into a chaotic smear of green and grey.

**Opening:**

Elara Juniper, her fingers stained a permanent shade of grease and soldering flux, leaned back in the worn-out swivel chair. The chair, once a plush executive model, now emitted a mournful squeak with every slight movement. Elara, a wiry woman with a cascade of auburn hair perpetually escaping its messy bun, ignored it. She was focused on the flickering oscilloscope in front of her, its green line dancing erratically like a nervous spirit. For three days, she'd been chasing a ghost, a faint signal bleeding through the static on a frequency no earthly transmitter should be using.

"Come on, you little bastard," she muttered, adjusting a dial on a hulking receiver that looked more like a Frankensteinian monster than a piece of radio equipment. "Give me something, anything." The mountain wind howled outside, a mournful counterpoint to the static that crackled through the headphones clamped to her ears. Elara shivered, not from the cold, but from the unsettling feeling that she wasn't just listening to noise. She was listening to somethingâ€¦ listening back.
