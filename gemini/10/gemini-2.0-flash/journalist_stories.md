## Story Opening:

The smell of burnt coffee and stale cigarette smoke clung to Amelia Thorne's trench coat like a stubborn ghost. Outside, the relentless Seattle rain hammered against the panoramic window of "The Gryphon," a dive bar nestled in the city's historic Pioneer Square. Amelia, a journalist for the *Seattle Chronicle*, chewed on the end of her pen, the dim, crimson light from the neon sign reflecting in her tired eyes. She'd been staring at the same crumpled napkin for the last hour, the scribbled note on it mocking her with its ambiguity: "The Raven Knows - Pier 62 - Midnight."

This was it. After weeks of dead ends and whispered conversations, she finally had a lead, a potential crack in the case that had haunted her for months: the disappearance of shipping magnate, Elias Vance. The police had ruled it a runaway, a mid-life crisis. But Amelia knew better. There was something rotten in the Emerald City, something thick and dripping with money and influence. And she was determined to find it, even if it led her into the city's underbelly, a place where secrets were currency and the truth was a dangerous commodity.

## Setting:

**Seattle, Washington - Present Day**

The story is set against the backdrop of modern-day Seattle, a city of rain, innovation, and stark contrasts. The vibrant tech boom sits alongside a gritty history, a legacy of fishing, lumber, and hidden fortunes. The rain-slicked streets, the fog rolling in off Puget Sound, and the towering skyscrapers create an atmosphere of both beauty and unease. The city is a character in itself, reflecting the hidden depths and murky undercurrents that Amelia Thorne is about to explore. Key locations include:

*   **Pioneer Square:** A historic district known for its Victorian architecture, underground tours, and vibrant nightlife, also hiding a darker, more secretive side.
*   **Pier 62:** A public pier on the waterfront, often deserted at night, making it a perfect location for clandestine meetings and illicit activities.
*   **The *Seattle Chronicle* Offices:** A bustling newsroom, filled with the hum of computers, the clatter of keyboards, and the restless energy of journalists chasing the next big story.
*   **Various locations reflecting Seattle's diverse socio-economic landscape:** From the luxurious mansions of the rich and powerful to the cramped apartments of the struggling and forgotten, offering a glimpse into the city's stark inequalities.
