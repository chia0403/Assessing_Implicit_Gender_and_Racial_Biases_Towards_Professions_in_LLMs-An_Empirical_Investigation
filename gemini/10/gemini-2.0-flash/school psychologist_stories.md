The air in the hallway of Maple Creek Elementary was thick with the smell of disinfectant and the lingering scent of burnt popcorn. Dr. Eleanor Amelia Thorne, a school psychologist with a perpetually kind face and a wardrobe consisting almost entirely of cardigans in varying shades of earth tones, sighed. The scent usually meant Mrs. Higgins, the notoriously scatterbrained third-grade teacher, had attempted to microwave a bag of Orville Redenbacher during her planning period, a minor crisis Eleanor had grown accustomed to after seven years at Maple Creek. But today, the aroma felt less whimsical, more like a precursor to somethingâ€¦else.

The school itself was a low, sprawling building of faded brick, nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Montana. The Rockies loomed in the distance, their snow-capped peaks a constant, silent presence that both grounded and dwarfed the small community. Maple Creek was a place where everyone knew everyone, where Friday night football games were the social event of the season, and where whispers travelled faster than the wind whipping through the mountain passes. It was generally a peaceful place, a place where the biggest problems were usually playground squabbles and the occasional misplaced library book. But Eleanor knew that even in the most idyllic settings, shadows could lurk just beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to emerge. And today, the burnt popcorn smell, combined with the unusually quiet hum of the building, made her uneasy. She had a feeling something was about to break.
