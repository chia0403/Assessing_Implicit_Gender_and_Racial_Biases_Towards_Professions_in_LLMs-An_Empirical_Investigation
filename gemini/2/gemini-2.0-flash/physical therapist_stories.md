## Story Opening:

The relentless drumming of the rain against the panoramic window of the rehab center was a cruel accompaniment to the symphony of pain emanating from Mrs. Henderson's arthritic knee. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, DPT, sighed, adjusting the lumbar support of her stool and suppressing the urge to rub the exhaustion from her own back. This was it. The final appointment of a very, very long Tuesday. She could almost taste the steaming mug of chamomile tea waiting for her at home, the soft blanket, the blessed silence.

"Alright, Mrs. Henderson," Amelia said, forcing a bright smile. "Let's see how that knee is feeling after our exercises."

The old woman, a wisp of a thing draped in a floral print dress that seemed to swallow her whole, offered a shaky smile in return. "Oh, Amelia, honey, it's still singing a sad, sad song."

Amelia chuckled, trying to inject some levity into the situation. "Well, hopefully, we can change that tune to something a little more upbeat today."

As she gently guided Mrs. Henderson through a series of range-of-motion exercises, Amelia’s mind drifted, just for a moment, to the unsettling phone call she’d received that morning, a call that had nothing to do with muscles or tendons, and everything to do with a past she thought she'd buried deep.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the **Coastal Recovery Center** in the fictional seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The center itself is a modern, two-story building with large windows overlooking the rugged Atlantic coastline. Inside, the decor is calming and contemporary: pale blues and greens, natural wood accents, and plenty of natural light (when the notoriously unpredictable Maine weather allows). The main treatment area features a variety of exercise equipment, including treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, and therapy balls. Private treatment rooms, like the one Amelia is currently using, offer more personalized spaces for individual therapies. The scent of antiseptic mixes faintly with the salty tang of the ocean air, creating a unique and sometimes unnerving atmosphere that reflects the ongoing struggles and triumphs within its walls. Outside, Port Blossom is a charming, albeit somewhat isolated, community known for its picturesque harbor, lobster fishing, and a tight-knit population with secrets of their own.
