## Story Opening:

The antiseptic scent of rubbing alcohol did little to mask the lingering aroma of stale microwave popcorn.  Eleanor Beatrice Albright winced as she unlocked the door to her tiny, cramped office at the Willow Creek Nursing Home.  Across the hall, a resident was singing a slightly off-key rendition of "You Are My Sunshine" at a volume that suggested the sunshine in question was located somewhere in the next county.  Eleanor sighed, a familiar ache settling between her shoulder blades. Another Tuesday, another day of battling geriatric picky-eaters and apathetic kitchen staff.

## Setting:

Eleanor's office, while theoretically a private space for consultations and paperwork, felt more like a neglected storage closet.  A single, flickering fluorescent light hummed above a metal desk cluttered with pamphlets on heart-healthy diets, half-finished meal plans, and a precarious stack of requisition forms.  The walls, painted a depressing shade of institutional beige, were adorned with a motivational poster depicting a vibrant fruit bowl and the overly optimistic caption, "Eat the Rainbow!"  Beyond the desk, a chipped ceramic mug, perpetually stained with Earl Grey tea, sat beside a framed picture of Eleanor's dearly departed, and significantly healthier, cat, Clementine. Through the grimy window, she could just make out the skeletal branches of the ancient willow tree for which the nursing home was named, a fittingly melancholic backdrop to her daily struggles. Willow Creek Nursing Home, with its linoleum floors and pervasive smell of disinfectant and despair, was a far cry from the gleaming wellness centers Eleanor had envisioned when she first graduated with her degree in Dietetics. But, it was her job, and she, Eleanor Albright, was determined to make a difference, one pureed carrot at a time.
