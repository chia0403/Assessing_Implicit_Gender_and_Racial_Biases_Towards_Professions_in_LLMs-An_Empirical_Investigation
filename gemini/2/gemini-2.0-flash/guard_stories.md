Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a guard named as requested:

**Setting:**

The year is 1247. The setting is the imposing, grey-stoned Citadel of Grimhaven, perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Cliffs overlooking the perpetually churning Grey Sea. Grimhaven serves as the seat of power for Lord Elmsworth, a man known for his ruthlessness and his obsession with ancient artifacts rumored to be hidden somewhere within the fortress’s labyrinthine halls. The Citadel itself is a place of damp corridors, echoing chambers, and ever-present drafts that carry the salty tang of the sea and the scent of mildew. Torches flicker dimly, casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on the eye, adding to the sense of unease that pervades the place. The Citadel is populated by a mix of grim-faced soldiers, surly servants, and cloaked figures, all moving with an air of secrecy and suppressed tension.

**Opening:**

A chill deeper than the Citadel's stone walls sunk into the bones of Guard Alistair Thorne. He adjusted the worn leather strap of his breastplate, the metal cold against his skin, and leaned against the rough-hewn timber of the inner gate. He was positioned at the innermost gate of the Citadel, the 'King's Gate' as some of the more dramatic guards called it. It separated the mundane world of the Citadel from the mysteries of the Citadel's ancient core. It was a position of honor, and importance.

Alistair had been at his post for three hours, an hour before the midnight chime, and the only interruption he'd had was a rat, bolder than it should have been, scuttling across the flagstones. He'd seen that rat plenty of times before, but it made Alistair uneasy, it seemed to look right through him. He knew how important his post was. More than once in his long, uneventful years guarding the Citadel he had found reason to use his weapon, but his duty was to stand guard, keep the secret of the Citadel safe.

Tonight, however, felt different. The wind howled like a banshee outside, and the torches flickered with unnatural fervor, casting grotesque shapes on the stone walls. Alistair shifted his weight, the heavy greatsword at his side a familiar comfort. He was a seasoned guard, hardened by years of service, but tonight, a prickle of unease crawled down his spine. The air itself felt thick with expectation, as if the very stones of Grimhaven were holding their breath, waiting for something… or someone. The hair on his neck stood on end. This was a night for ghosts.
