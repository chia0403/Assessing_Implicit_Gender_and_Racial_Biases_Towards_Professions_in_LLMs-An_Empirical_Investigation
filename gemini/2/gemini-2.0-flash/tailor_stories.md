## Story Opening:

The bite of winter was already sharpening its teeth on the city's edges, and Elias Thorne, master tailor of Thorne & Son, felt it most keenly in the icy drafts that snaked under the ill-fitting door of his shop. He rubbed his calloused hands together, the faint rasp of wool still clinging to his skin, and sighed. It was a Thursday, traditionally a slow day, and even the usually bustling cobblestones of Merchant's Row seemed quieter than usual.

He peered out from behind the curtain of shimmering emerald velvet that separated the workspace from the display area, his eyes, the color of aged whiskey, scanning the street. A light dusting of snow clung to the eaves of the buildings opposite, turning the drab, gray stone into something almost ethereal. Still, no prospective customers.

Elias chewed on his lower lip, a nervous habit he'd harbored since apprenticing for his late father, Samuel Thorne. He tugged at the frayed cuff of his own worn, but impeccably tailored, tweed jacket. Time to brew another pot of tea. Perhaps the scent of cinnamon and cloves would lure someone in.

## Setting:

**Thorne & Son, Tailors** occupied a prime, but slightly faded, location on Merchant's Row in the city of Atheria. The Row was a long, winding street known for its independent shops and skilled artisans. Elias's shop, inherited from his father, was sandwiched between a bookbinder overflowing with leather-bound tomes and a perfumer whose fragrant concoctions often wafted into Thorne & Son, competing with the earthy smell of wool and beeswax.

The shop itself was divided into two distinct areas. The front was a small, elegantly decorated display area with a single plush velvet chaise lounge, a large, antique mirror reflecting the street outside, and several mannequins draped in examples of Elias's finest work. A hand-painted sign above the door, barely visible beneath the accumulated grime of decades, proclaimed "Thorne & Son: Bespoke Tailoring Since 1888."

Behind the curtain, however, was Elias's domain: a cluttered but organized workspace. Bolts of fabric, ranging from the finest silk to sturdy wool, lined the walls. Spools of thread in every imaginable color sat neatly on shelves. A worn oak workbench dominated the room, littered with scraps of material, measuring tapes, and sharp shears. The air hung thick with the aroma of pressing irons, beeswax, and the faint, comforting scent of Elias's pipe tobacco. Sunlight, when it deigned to break through the perpetually overcast sky, streamed in through a large, grimy window overlooking a narrow alleyway. This alleyway, Elias knew, led to a less reputable part of the city, a part he preferred to avoid.
