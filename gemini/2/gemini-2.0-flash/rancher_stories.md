The wind, a constant, unseen hand, whipped across the endless expanse of the Montana sky, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and the distant rumble of thunder. Dust devils danced in the parched earth like restless spirits, mirroring the unease twisting in the gut of Jedediah Silas Tanner. He leaned against the weathered fence post, his worn leather gloves offering little purchase against the splintered wood. The setting sun painted the horizon in bruised hues of purple and orange, beautiful, yet ominous. He watched his cattle, a black Angus herd dotted across the rolling hills, their silhouettes stark against the fiery backdrop.

Jedediah Silas Tanner, a man etched with the harsh beauty of the land he called home, knew in his bones something was coming. He'd been ranching in the valley for forty years, since he was a boy barely old enough to wrangle a calf, and he'd learned to listen to the land. The sky held a storm, and Jedediah had a feeling it wasn't just the meteorological kind.
