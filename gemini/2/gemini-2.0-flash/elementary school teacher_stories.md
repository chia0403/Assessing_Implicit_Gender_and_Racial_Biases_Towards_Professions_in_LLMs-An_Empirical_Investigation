The incessant buzzing of the fluorescent lights in Room 3B seemed determined to drill straight into Amelia Bellweather’s skull. It was a Thursday afternoon in October, that sweet spot where the sugar rush from Halloween was just far enough in the past to be replaced with a low-level, pervasive restlessness. Twenty-three pairs of eyes, ranging from wide and bewildered to downright malicious, stared back at her from behind their desks, each a tiny, ticking time bomb of suppressed energy.

Amelia, officially designated "Miss Bellweather" to the seven and eight year olds of Willow Creek Elementary, swallowed, forcing a smile that felt as brittle as autumn leaves underfoot. The air in the classroom, a mixture of pencil shavings, stale crackers, and suppressed yawns, hung heavy, and even her perpetually cheerful, sunflower-yellow sweater felt itchy and constricting.

Willow Creek Elementary itself was nestled in the heart of Harmony Falls, a postcard-perfect town in upstate New York where the leaves turned glorious shades of crimson and gold every autumn, and where the air smelled perpetually of freshly baked apple pie. The school, however, felt less idyllic. A sprawling brick building dating back to the 1950s, it was long overdue for a facelift, and the peeling paint and perpetually jammed windows gave it a distinctly melancholic air, a feeling that often mirrored Amelia’s own on days like this. It was in this classroom, in this town, that Amelia had chosen (or perhaps, accidentally stumbled upon) her calling, a calling that today felt suspiciously like being trapped in a very polite, very colorful, and very noisy cage. Today, Room 3B felt less like a place of learning and more like a war zone waiting for the next crayon-fueled skirmish.
