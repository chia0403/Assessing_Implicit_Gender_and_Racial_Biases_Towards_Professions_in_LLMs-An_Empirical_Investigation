The antique grandfather clock in the hallway chimed six times, each resonant bong echoing through the mostly empty shell of what was once a grand Victorian mansion. Eleanor Abigail Beaumont, her face smeared with a mixture of charcoal dust and weariness, barely registered it. She knelt amidst a swirl of discarded paint samples and crumpled mood boards, her fingers tracing the intricate floral carving on a salvaged oak door frame. This hallway, with its soaring ceilings and faded elegance, was her Everest. Her client, the eccentric and decidedly difficult Baroness Von Strauss, expected nothing short of a miracle to transform this dilapidated relic into a showcase of "modernized vintage."

The mansion itself, Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a craggy cliff overlooking the turbulent Cornish coast. The sea wind howled relentlessly, rattling the leaded windows and whispering secrets of centuries past through the crumbling stone walls. It was a beautiful, imposing, and profoundly daunting challenge for Eleanor, who preferred the clean lines of mid-century modern to the fussy ornamentation that dripped from every corner of Blackwood Manor. But the Baroness paid well, and Eleanor had a mortgage to think about. The scent of damp plaster, mingled with the faint, lingering fragrance of mothballs and something indefinably ancient, permeated the air, adding to the feeling that Blackwood Manor was more than just a building; it was a living, breathing entity with its own stubborn will.
