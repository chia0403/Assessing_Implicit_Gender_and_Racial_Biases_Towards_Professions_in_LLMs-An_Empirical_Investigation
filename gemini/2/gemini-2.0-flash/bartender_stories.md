The clinking of ice against glass was a familiar comfort to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather. It was a steady rhythm in the chaotic symphony of the Rusty Mug, the dive bar perched precariously on the edge of Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, California. Salt spray kissed the windows almost nightly, and the scent of brine mingled with the stale aroma of cheap beer and regret that perpetually clung to the low-hanging rafters. Amy surveyed her domain: a motley crew of weathered fishermen nursing their woes, tourists looking for a cheap thrill and a side of salty stories, and a scattering of locals who seemed to have taken up permanent residence on the worn leather barstools. The neon Budweiser sign flickered intermittently above her head, casting an unflattering red glow on the chipped formica countertop. It was 7:17 PM, according to the cracked clock above the liquor shelf, and Amy braced herself. This was the hour the tide truly turned, when the Rusty Mug shifted from weary to wired, from subdued sorrow to boisterous belligerence. And Amy Bellweather, with her quick wit and even quicker hands, was the only one who could navigate it.
