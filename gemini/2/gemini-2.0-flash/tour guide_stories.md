Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a tour guide as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The oppressive Bangkok humidity clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Finch like a second skin, plastering his meticulously combed silver hair to his forehead.  He adjusted his microphone, the tiny click echoing unnervingly in the cavernous Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan, better known as the Temple of Dawn.  Barty hated this stop. Not because it wasn't breathtaking – the shimmering porcelain mosaics practically radiated heat, even at this early hour – but because it was *always* packed.  And today, it was worse than ever.  A sea of pastel linen shirts and selfie sticks threatened to engulf him and his dwindling tour group of six.

“Alright, everyone!” Barty boomed, his practiced tour guide voice cutting through the din. “If you could just gather a little closer, I’ll regale you with the legend of how this magnificent temple earned its name…” He could already feel the trickle of sweat snaking down his spine. This was going to be a long day. He just hoped Mrs. Higgins didn't faint again.

**Setting:**

The story opens at **Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan (The Temple of Dawn)** in Bangkok, Thailand.  The temple complex is situated on the west (Thonburi) bank of the Chao Phraya River. It's an iconic landmark known for its ornate decoration of colourful mosaic tiles and its towering prangs (towers).

**Details of the Setting:**

*   **Visual:** The temple is a vibrant spectacle of color, primarily white and adorned with countless pieces of coloured glass and Chinese porcelain. The main prang is the largest and highest, flanked by four smaller ones. The riverside location provides stunning views of the Chao Phraya River.
*   **Atmosphere:**  Bustling with tourists, the air is thick with humidity, the scent of incense, and the murmur of multiple languages.  The sun beats down mercilessly, reflecting off the shimmering surfaces of the temple.
*   **Sound:** The constant buzz of tourists talking, interspersed with the chimes from the temple and the occasional long-tail boat speeding along the river. The rhythmic chanting of monks can sometimes be heard in the distance.
*   **Cultural Significance:** Wat Arun is one of Thailand's most important and recognizable landmarks. It's not only a temple, but a symbol of the country's rich history and artistic heritage.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Bartholomew "Barty" Finch
*   **Occupation:** Tour Guide

This opening establishes the setting, introduces the main character, and hints at potential conflicts or challenges he might face (the heat, the crowds, demanding tourists). Let me know if you'd like me to develop this further!
