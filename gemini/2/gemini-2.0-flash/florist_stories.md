The bell above the door of "Petals & Prose" chimed a delicate, almost melancholic tune, a sound Elsie adored despite the fact it usually heralded a customer who would invariably ask for a rose that "looked exactly like the ones in *Beauty and the Beast*." Elsie's shoulders slumped, ever so slightly, as she carefully arranged a handful of lavender sprigs in a chipped, robin's egg blue pitcher.

Elsie Magnolia Willowbrook, proprietress of Petals & Prose, breathed in the calming scent of the lavender. She was surrounded by the fragrant chaos she cultivated so carefully. Her shop, nestled on a quiet, cobblestone street in the old quarter of Ashwood, Massachusetts, was an assault on the senses in the most delightful way. Roses, lilies, carnations, and orchids jostled for space in overflowing vases and buckets. Hanging baskets, heavy with ferns and trailing petunias, dripped life onto the checkered tile floor. Interspersed amongst the floral bounty were stacks of well-worn novels, poetry collections, and the occasional forgotten journal, lending the shop a unique, bookish charm.

Sunlight streamed through the large, arched window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and highlighting the vibrant hues of the flowers. Outside, the cobblestones were slick with the remnants of a morning rain, reflecting the muted colors of the antique shops and cafes that lined the street. A lone robin, puffed up against the lingering damp, perched on the window box outside, chirping a cheerful counterpoint to the interior's more muted serenity. Ashwood, a town steeped in history and nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, was a place where time seemed to slow, where secrets lingered in the shadows, and where Elsie, with her green thumb and a heart full of unpublished stories, felt strangely at home.
