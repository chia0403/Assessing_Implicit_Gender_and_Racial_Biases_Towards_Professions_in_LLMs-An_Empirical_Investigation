The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to Mrs. Higgins' notoriously questionable brewing skills. It clung to the beige walls, the overflowing in-trays, and even, she suspected, to her own sensible cardigan. Beatrice Willowby sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard. 

It was Monday morning at the offices of Pemberton & Sons, a venerable law firm specializing in wills, estates, and the occasional disgruntled neighbor dispute. Beatrice, at the ripe old age of twenty-seven, had been Secretary to Mr. Alistair Pemberton, the elder partner and resident grump, for the past five years. Pemberton & Sons, a sprawling, maze-like warren of dusty legal books and forgotten precedents, occupied the second floor of a stately, albeit slightly crumbling, building on Wellington Street, a street that had seen better days and likely more glamorous businesses than wills and estates. The ornate, wood-paneled reception area, with its brass plaques and hushed atmosphere, was a world away from the vibrant, buzzing city outside. It was a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, where the most exciting event of the day was the arrival of the post, and where Beatrice Willowby often felt like a forgotten bookmark tucked between the pages of a very dull novel.
