The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Dr. Eleanor Marie Peterson's cheeks as she hurried from her Jeep. The clinic's neon sign, promising "Compassionate Care for Creatures Great & Small," flickered against the pre-dawn gloom of Port Serenity, Wisconsin. Eleanor could already hear the plaintive meow of the stray she'd promised to see before her official opening hours. 

Port Serenity was a town clinging to its past, a tapestry of weathered clapboard houses and fishing docks that still hummed with activity, though increasingly overwhelmed by tourist trinket shops and pricey lakefront condos. Eleanor had inherited the clinic from her grandfather, a man whose gruff exterior hid a heart as soft as a newborn kitten. She felt the weight of his legacy every time she stepped through the worn wooden door, a legacy she desperately hoped to uphold, even as the pressures of modern veterinary medicine threatened to drown her in paperwork and rising overhead costs.
