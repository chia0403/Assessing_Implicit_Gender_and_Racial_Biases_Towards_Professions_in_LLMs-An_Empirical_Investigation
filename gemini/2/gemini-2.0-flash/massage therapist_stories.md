## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The bell above the door chimed, a cheerful little sound that was immediately swallowed by the muted hum of the air purifier. Cassandra "Cassie" Bellweather sighed, her fingers still sticky with lavender oil. She’d been meticulously cleaning down the massage table for the third time that afternoon. Cancellations. It was always the same story this time of year - end-of-summer blues, last-minute vacations, and the creeping dread of back-to-school.

Cassie stretched, her own shoulders tightening in protest. She needed a massage herself, a long, luxurious one where someone else did all the work. But needs and reality were two different things in the life of a self-employed massage therapist, especially in a town as transient and unpredictable as this one.

Pushing aside the lingering feeling of frustration, Cassie turned to greet the newcomer, hoping they wouldn’t be yet another face bearing the news of a postponed appointment. A slim figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, their features obscured by the afternoon sun. As they stepped inside, a familiar wave of perfume, something sharp and citrusy, hit Cassie’s nose. This was going to be interesting.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a small, somewhat bohemian town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, named "Willow Creek." The town is known for its art galleries, quaint cafes, and a general air of "healing and wellness." Many residents are artists, retirees, or work remotely, attracted by the natural beauty and slower pace of life.

Cassandra Bellweather's massage studio, "The Willow Touch," is located just off the main street, in a converted Victorian house painted a calming shade of sage green. The interior is decorated in earth tones with natural materials like wood and stone, creating a tranquil atmosphere. Soft lighting, aromatherapy diffusers, and the gentle sound of a trickling fountain contribute to the overall sense of relaxation and rejuvenation. The studio consists of a small reception area, a changing room for clients, and two massage rooms, each equipped with a high-quality massage table, heated blankets, and a selection of essential oils. The windows offer views of the surrounding trees and the occasional glimpses of the distant mountains.
