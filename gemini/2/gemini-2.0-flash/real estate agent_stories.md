## Story Opening:

The scent of stale potpourri and simmering fear clung to the air as Amelia Grace Thornton navigated the cluttered hallway of 3 Ravenwood Court. Sunlight, weak and watery even for November, struggled to penetrate the grimy windows, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the dust motes suspended in the air. Amelia swallowed hard, her professional smile feeling brittle and thin. The open house was supposed to start in twenty minutes, and frankly, she doubted she could stand being alone in this decaying monstrosity for twenty *seconds* longer.

## Setting:

The setting is a dilapidated Victorian mansion, located on the outskirts of a small, dwindling town called Havenwood. 3 Ravenwood Court was once a grand estate, the jewel of the community, built by a wealthy lumber baron in the late 1800s. Now, it stands as a testament to neglect and decay. Paint peels from the intricate gingerbread trim, the once-lush gardens have choked into an overgrown jungle, and the foundation seems to groan under the weight of years and secrets. The inside is even worse. The carpets are stained and threadbare, the wallpaper is peeling in long, disconcerting strips, and a general feeling of oppressive gloom permeates every room. There's a palpable chill in the air, even with the ancient, temperamental furnace chugging away in the basement. The house has been on the market for nearly a year, and Amelia Grace Thornton, with her relentlessly optimistic attitude and unwavering belief in the potential of every property, is Havenwood Realty's last, desperate hope for a sale.
