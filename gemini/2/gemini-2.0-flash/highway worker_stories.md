Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and introduction of our main character:

**Setting:** A desolate stretch of Interstate 80, about 30 miles east of Battle Mountain, Nevada. It's a Tuesday in late October. The sun is a bruised orange, sinking below the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the Joshua trees that stubbornly cling to the harsh desert landscape. The air is sharp, carrying the scent of sagebrush and the metallic tang of dust. A relentless wind whips across the barren plains, making the flimsy reflective vests of the highway workers ripple like flags in a storm. A single, tired highway patrol car sits idling, its lights a comforting beacon against the encroaching darkness.

**Story Opening:**

The wind howled like a banshee, tugging at Clarence Bartholomew "Bart" Malloy's hard hat as he wrestled with a stubborn "Road Work Ahead" sign. Heâ€™d been at it for a good ten minutes, the rusted bolts refusing to yield to his wrench. The damn thing had been knocked over by a semi last week, and now it was his job to get it upright before nightfall. Bart grunted, pushing his weight against the signpost, his joints protesting with a symphony of pops and creaks. He was fifty-seven, pushing sixty, and these Nevada highways were starting to feel a whole lot longer these days. He spat a wad of chewing tobacco onto the dusty shoulder, the brown stain instantly absorbed by the parched earth. He glanced towards the setting sun, the fiery orb disappearing behind a jagged range of mountains. Another day, another dollar... if he could just get this damn sign fixed before Officer Davies started breathing down his neck. The cop was alright, as cops went, but he had a schedule to keep, and Bart was holding him up.
