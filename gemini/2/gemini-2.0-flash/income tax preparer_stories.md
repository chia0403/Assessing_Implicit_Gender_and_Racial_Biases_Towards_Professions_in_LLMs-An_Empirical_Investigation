The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune that echoed the drumming anxiety in Arthur Percival Finch’s chest. It was mid-March, and the annual tax-prep frenzy was in full, suffocating bloom. Stacks of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts threatened to topple from his overflowing desk, a precarious papier-mâché mountain range erected on a foundation of deductibles and credits.

Arthur Percival Finch, all fifty-two years of him, sat hunched over a particularly gnarly Schedule C, his brow furrowed in concentration. He ran a small, independent tax preparation business, "Finch Financial," tucked away on the second floor of a slightly dilapidated building in the heart of Maplewood, Ohio, a town known more for its annual pumpkin festival than its robust economy. The office itself was a study in muted beige, from the carpet that had seen better decades to the perpetually lukewarm coffee brewing in the corner. A single framed print of a rather melancholy-looking accountant clutching a calculator hung on the wall, a silent testament to the joys (or lack thereof) of Arthur's profession. Outside, the early spring rain pattered against the window, adding a melancholic soundtrack to Arthur's ongoing battle with the Internal Revenue Code.
