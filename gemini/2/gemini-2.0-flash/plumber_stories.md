The insistent bleating of Beatrice "Bea" Bellweather's phone shattered the pre-dawn quiet of her tiny, cluttered apartment. Bea, nestled amidst a nest of mismatched pillows and tangled sheets, groaned and fumbled for the device. The glow illuminated her sleep-creased face, highlighting the smudge of pipe grease stubbornly clinging to her cheek from yesterday's overflowing garbage disposal.

The exposed brick walls, a trendy feature when the building was renovated, were now adorned with haphazardly hung tools â€“ pipe wrenches, plungers, and an embarrassingly large collection of rubber ducks, a quirk Bea couldn't quite explain. The air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and the faintest metallic tang of her trade. Sunlight, though still weak, streamed through the single, grime-coated window, illuminating dust motes dancing above a mountain of invoices stacked precariously on her kitchenette counter. Outside, the rumble of the elevated train echoed, a constant reminder of the city's relentless energy.
