## Opening:

A shiver ran through Elias Thorne, not from the biting morning air, but from the weight of the granite beneath his hands. The grey giant, ripped from the heart of the Widow's Peak mountain, lay before him, cold and unyielding. Elias, his face etched with the familiar lines of dust and weariness, blew on his gloved hands, the breath misting in the predawn gloom. He could feel the faint tremor of the quarry as the day's first blasts were set further up the slope, a constant reminder of the mountain's power and the precariousness of his profession. He squinted at the raw, jagged face of the stone, searching for the perfect grain, the hidden flaw that would dictate his first cut. Today's task was a particularly daunting one - a baptismal font for the new church in Oakhaven. A simple basin, they'd said. But Elias knew better. Every stone held a story, and this one, he suspected, would demand to be coaxed out with patience and a steady hand.

## Setting:

The Widow's Peak Quarry, nestled at the foot of the towering mountain it was named after, was a place of harsh beauty. Scars of industry marred the landscape; sheer cliff faces sliced raw, piles of rubble and discarded stone forming miniature grey mountains around the working areas. The air, thick with the metallic tang of dust and the ever-present scent of explosives, hung heavy even on clear days. Rows of rough-hewn wooden sheds served as workshops and storage, their roofs weighted down with stones against the persistent winds that howled down the mountainside. Beyond the immediate chaos of the quarry, the view was breathtaking: rolling hills dotted with forests stretching to the distant, shimmering ribbon of the Silverstream River. The village of Stonemark, where Elias lived, clung precariously to the lower slopes, its houses built from the very stone that sustained it. The quarry was not just a workplace; it was the lifeblood of Stonemark, a testament to the enduring strength and skill of its people, and a constant, looming presence in their lives.
