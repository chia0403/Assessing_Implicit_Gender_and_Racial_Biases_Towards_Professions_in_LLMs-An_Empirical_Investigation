The biting November wind howled through the skeletal steel frame of the soon-to-be Skyrise Plaza, a concrete and glass behemoth clawing its way into the Chicago skyline. Dust swirled, a gritty, cold dance that stung the eyes and made breathing feel like inhaling sandpaper. For **Arthur Bartholomew "Art" Kowalski**, the discomfort was just Tuesday. He gripped a wrench, his knuckles white, and wrestled with a stubborn bolt, the rhythmic clang of metal echoing against the unfinished walls.

The setting was the 27th floor of the Skyrise Plaza construction site. To the north, Lake Michigan stretched out like a bruised steel sheet, capped with angry, white-tipped waves. To the south, the grid of Chicago spread out, a tapestry of rooftops and twinkling lights already preparing for the long winter night. Cranes loomed like giant, slumbering insects, their cables swaying gently in the wind. Scattered around Art were stacks of rebar, palettes of bricks, and the ever-present debris of a construction site: discarded gloves, crushed hard hats, and the husks of empty energy drink cans. Above, the sky was a dull, gunmetal grey, promising snow before the week was out. It was a harsh, unforgiving place, but for Art, it was home. At least for the next eight hours.
