## Story Opening:

The scent of disinfectant and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a bizarre, yet familiar, cocktail that always clung to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance after a long shift. The fluorescent lights of the surgical observation room hummed a monotonous tune, doing little to soothe the tremor in her hands. She scrubbed them raw, the aggressive motion mirroring the battle raging in her mind. It had been a close call, too close, and the phantom weight of the scalpel felt heavier than ever.

She peeled off her surgical cap, the clinging hairs tugging at her scalp, and tossed it into the overflowing blue bin. Through the window, she could see the recovery room, the rhythmic beeping of the monitors a fragile promise. The patient was stable, for now. But the lingering image of the blood, the desperate scramble to control the unexpected hemorrhage, wouldn’t leave her. It replayed in her mind, a brutal loop she couldn't rewind.

Turning away, she headed towards the hospital's rooftop garden, a sanctuary she desperately needed. Maybe the cool night air, the scent of jasmine blooming precariously in the concrete jungle, could finally clear the operating room from her head.

## Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens at **St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital**, a sprawling, modern complex nestled in the heart of **downtown Boston, Massachusetts**. The hospital is renowned for its cutting-edge surgical facilities and its dedication to serving the underprivileged communities that surround it. It's a place of constant activity, a microcosm of life and death playing out on a daily basis. The rooftop garden, a small, carefully cultivated oasis of green on the tenth floor, offers a stark contrast to the sterile, high-tech environment inside, providing a much-needed escape for the weary staff.
