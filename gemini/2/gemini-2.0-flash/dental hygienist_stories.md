The rhythmic whir of the Cavitron scaler, a familiar comfort even after twelve years, buzzed in Dr. Ramirez's small but immaculate dental practice. Outside, a thin February sun struggled to pierce the perpetual Seattle drizzle, casting long shadows across the perpetually damp streets. Inside, however, the air was warm and smelled faintly of minty fluoride and the nervous anticipation that clung to most dental patients.

This morning, the anxiety seemed particularly thick, almost palpable. And Eleanor Mae Prescott, R.D.H., felt it settle on her shoulders like a damp wool blanket. It wasn't the patient in the chair, Mrs. Higgins, a sweet, chatty woman whose biggest dental transgression was an over-reliance on Werther's Originals. No, it was the silence coming from Dr. Ramirez's office. The kind of tense, pregnant silence that often preceded bad news. Eleanor had overheard snippets of a phone conversation earlier - something about insurance red tape and a potentially devastating cut to their reimbursement rates. This practice, with its cozy atmosphere and genuine care for its patients, was Eleanor's lifeline. It was more than just a job; it was her community.
