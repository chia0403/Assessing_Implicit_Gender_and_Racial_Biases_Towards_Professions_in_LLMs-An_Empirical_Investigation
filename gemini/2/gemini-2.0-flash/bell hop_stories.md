Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a bellhop as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, at 3:00 AM, wasn't exactly teeming with life. Instead, it held a peculiar, almost ghostly stillness, punctuated only by the rhythmic *tick-tock* of the grandfather clock near the concierge desk and the faint, far-off wail of a lone saxophone player from some unknown corner of the city. Arthur Bartholomew Finch, bellhop extraordinaire (at least, that's what he told his mother), leaned against one of the ornate, velvet-roped stanchions, pretending to polish a brass button on his uniform for the tenth time in the last half hour. Sleep tugged at his eyelids, a heavy, insistent hand threatening to pull him under. He fought it back with a sigh, the scent of lavender air freshener and old money doing little to stimulate his already lagging senses. He hated the graveyard shift. He hated the lack of tips. And tonight, especially, he hated the nagging feeling that something… unusual… was about to happen.

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel stands on a prominent corner in the heart of the city's historic district. Built in the late 1920s during the Art Deco boom, it's a masterpiece of geometric designs and opulent materials. Gleaming chrome accents the dark, polished wood panelling in the lobby. Massive chandeliers hang from the elaborately painted ceiling, casting a warm, golden light across the plush carpets and meticulously arranged floral displays. The hotel boasts multiple restaurants, a rooftop bar with panoramic city views, and a legendary ballroom that has hosted countless gala events and celebrity weddings. The rooms are individually decorated, each reflecting a different era or artistic style, contributing to the hotel's reputation as a luxurious and unforgettable destination. However, beneath the surface of polished perfection, whispers of the hotel's past – rumours of illicit affairs, secret meetings, and even untimely deaths – linger in the shadows, adding an air of mystery to its grandeur.
