The turbulence hit like a rogue wave, tossing the Boeing 777 around like a paper airplane in a hurricane. Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez braced herself against the galley counter, a half-finished pot of coffee threatening to slosh onto the already chaos-strewn floor. Outside, the inky black of the Atlantic night clawed at the windows.

Izzy’s heart hammered against her ribs. Years she’d flown, crisscrossing continents and battling every kind of weather, and still, the sheer unpredictability of the skies could send a shiver down her spine. This particular flight, transatlantic flight 747 from London Heathrow to New York’s JFK, had started innocently enough. Polite passengers, a slightly delayed takeoff, the usual hum of engines promising a smooth journey. Now? Now, they were trapped inside a metal tube, hurtling through a storm that seemed to be actively trying to tear them apart.

The setting was a pressurized bubble of relative comfort, desperately clinging to the sky. Inside, the mood was anything but comfortable. The cabin lights flickered erratically, casting dancing shadows on the pale faces of the passengers. Cries of fear mingled with the muffled prayers escaping from under hastily pulled-down blankets. The scent of stale air and nervous sweat hung heavy, a stark contrast to the antiseptic cleanliness Izzy usually fought so hard to maintain. Outside, only the deafening roar of the engines and the howling wind offered any clues to the battle being waged against the elements. Izzy Rodriguez knew, with a certainty that settled heavy in her stomach, that this was going to be a very, very long night.
