## Opening and Setting:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan and stung Daniel Thomas Riley's cheeks as he leaned against the cold steel railing of his condo balcony. It was early - 5:15 AM - too early for even the most ambitious day traders, but Daniel couldn't sleep. The pre-market numbers were already flickering nervously across his phone screen, painting a bleak picture for the rest of the day.

Daniel lived in a high-rise, glass-and-steel edifice that dominated the Chicago skyline, a testament to his successes (and excesses) in the volatile world of high-frequency trading. His 48th floor condo, typically a haven of modern elegance with its panoramic city views and minimalist decor, felt more like a gilded cage in moments like these. He could see the faint glow of distant office buildings, a silent reminder of the relentless machine of capitalism that never truly slept.

He took a long drag from his Marlboro Light, the orange tip glowing like a defiant ember in the pre-dawn gloom. The acrid smoke burned his throat, a familiar discomfort he barely noticed. He wasn't just worried about his clients' portfolios; he was worried about his own. A bad day on Wall Street could be a bad day for everyone, but for Daniel Riley, it could be the end of everything he'd built.
