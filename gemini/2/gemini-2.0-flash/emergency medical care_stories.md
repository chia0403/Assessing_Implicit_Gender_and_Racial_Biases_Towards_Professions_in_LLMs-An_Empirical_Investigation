Okay, here's a story opening and setting that fulfills your request:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent beeping of the heart monitor was the only sound that cut through the oppressive silence of the ambulance. Sergeant Major Evelyn Riley, her brow furrowed with concentration, carefully threaded a needle into the collapsed lung of the young man sprawled on the gurney. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the chaotic rhythm of the boy's shallow breaths. "Come on, kid," she muttered, her voice tight with focus, "don't you dare give up on me now." She glanced at the driver, a young volunteer named Ben who looked paler than the fading headlights slicing through the storm. "ETA?"

Ben swallowed hard. "Five minutes to County General, Ma'am. Road's getting worse, though."

Evelyn grunted, her gloved hands moving with practiced precision. Five minutes. It might as well be an eternity. This kid, barely out of high school, was bleeding internally from God-knows-where, a mangled mess after his motorcycle tangled with a logging truck on County Road 17. She secured the chest tube, a grim satisfaction settling over her. He had a fighting chance. She just hoped five minutes was enough.

**Setting:**

The story opens inside a Type III ambulance, late at night, in the midst of a violent thunderstorm. They are traveling on a winding, two-lane country road somewhere in the rural, mountainous region of Western North Carolina.  The roads are poorly maintained, often narrow and slick with rain. The surrounding landscape is dense forest, broken occasionally by small, isolated homes or the darkened hulks of logging operations. The nearest town is a sleepy, economically depressed place known more for its moonshine and bluegrass festivals than its modern medical facilities. The ambulance itself is well-equipped, but it's older and showing its age, the wear and tear of countless calls evident in the faded upholstery and the persistent rattle of loose equipment. The weather is crucial to the story, enhancing the sense of isolation, danger, and urgency.

**Main Character:**

**Sergeant Major Evelyn Riley** - An experienced and highly skilled Emergency Medical Care provider. She is a former medic with the US Army, now working for a small, underfunded ambulance service in her home county after a combat injury forced her retirement.
