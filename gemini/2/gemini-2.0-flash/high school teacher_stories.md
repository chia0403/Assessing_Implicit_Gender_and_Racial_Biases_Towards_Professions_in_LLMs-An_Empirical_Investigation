The clock on the wall of Room 212 ticked with a maddening, almost taunting, precision. Ms. Elara Beatrice Finch, Advanced Placement English Literature teacher and resident champion of the semicolon, tapped a crimson-lacquered nail against the edge of her desk. The rhythmic *click-click-click* was a futile attempt to drown out the cacophony brewing in her head: student essays, departmental budget cuts, and the persistent, gnawing feeling that she was failing to ignite a passion for Dickens in anyone under the age of seventeen.

The setting was Northwood High, nestled in the sleepy, affluent suburb of Oak Haven, Connecticut. The school itself was a brick behemoth, attempting to look collegiate with its faux-gothic archways and manicured lawns. Inside, however, it was a warren of linoleum-floored hallways and perpetually overheated classrooms. Room 212 was Elara's domain, a sanctuary she had tried, with varying degrees of success, to imbue with warmth. Posters of classic novels lined the walls, battling for space with student artwork and carefully curated quotes. Books overflowed from shelves, threatening to topple at the slightest provocation. It was a space that felt both intensely personal and desperately overcrowded, much like Elara's own mind. The late afternoon sun, slanting through the grime-streaked windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the empty desks, a visual reminder that the bell had rung ten minutes ago, and she was, once again, the last one standing.
