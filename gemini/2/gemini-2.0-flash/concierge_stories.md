The polished brass plate gleamed under the recessed lobby lights: "Concierge - Mr. Alistair Finch." Alistair, a man whose hairline was receding faster than the tide at low tide, straightened his perfectly knotted crimson tie and adjusted his spectacles, perched precariously on his nose. He could feel the hum of The Grand Majestic Hotel vibrating through the soles of his meticulously polished shoes, a constant thrum of expectation and, frankly, absurdity.

The Grand Majestic, a five-star behemoth nestled smack-dab in the heart of London's Mayfair, was a symphony of marble, mahogany, and muffled conversations. It catered to the discerning – and often eccentric – clientele, from Saudi princes with falcons requiring bespoke miniature jetpacks (a request he'd miraculously fulfilled last Tuesday) to aging Hollywood starlets with an insatiable craving for pickled onions at 3 AM (thank you, Sainsbury's). The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies, expensive perfume, and the faint, almost tangible, air of entitlement.

Alistair, despite his outwardly composed demeanor, harbored a secret desire to escape the gilded cage of The Grand Majestic. He dreamt of a quiet life in the Cotswolds, surrounded by books, birdsong, and absolutely no requests for taxidermied squirrels wearing bowler hats. But for now, he was Alistair Finch, the concierge. The man who knew everything, could arrange anything, and always, always, maintained a professional smile, even as the absurdity of his existence threatened to swallow him whole.
