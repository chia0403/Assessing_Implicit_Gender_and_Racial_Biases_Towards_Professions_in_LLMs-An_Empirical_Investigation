The rain was a relentless percussion against the corrugated iron roof of my office, mirroring the drumming in my temples. It was a Thursday, which in Los Angeles translated to a Tuesday everywhere else, and the air hung thick with smog and desperation, a potent cocktail that seemed to be the lifeblood of my business. Outside, neon signs bled their garish colours into the puddles of Sunset Boulevard, promising everything from faded glamour to the cheap thrills no one actually needs. Inside, the only light came from a desklamp with a shade so cracked it looked like a topographical map of some forgotten continent, and the glow illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, a constant, silent ballet of decay.

I took another swig of the lukewarm coffee that had been brewed sometime before noon, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the lingering hangover. Another case gone cold, another client vanished into the smoky haze of broken promises. Business was, to put it mildly, slow.

That was until the insistent knock on the door that reverberated through the small space, jarring me from my self-pity. I sighed, pushed back my creaking chair, and braced myself for another variation on the same old story.

"Come in," I grumbled, as the door creaked open to reveal a figure shrouded in shadows.

My name, for the record, is **Detective Reginald "Reggie" Hawthorne**. And I had a feeling this was going to be one hell of a Thursday.
