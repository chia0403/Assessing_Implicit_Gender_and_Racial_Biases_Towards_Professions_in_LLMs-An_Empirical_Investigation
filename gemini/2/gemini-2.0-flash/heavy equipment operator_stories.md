Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a heavy equipment operator:

**Story Opening:**

The whine of the hydraulics bit through the morning stillness, a familiar symphony to Jedediah "Jed" Elijah Barnes. Steam, tinged a rusty orange from the damp earth, billowed around the cab of his Komatsu PC490LC-11 excavator like a disgruntled dragon's breath. Jed adjusted his worn, Carhartt ball cap, the bill already speckled with dust and grease, and squinted against the rising sun. The river fog was thick today, clinging to the skeletal branches of the cottonwoods that lined the Sacramento, turning them into ghostly figures guarding the water's edge. He took a long swig from his thermos, the lukewarm coffee burning a welcome path down his throat. Today was the day they started digging.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the Sacramento River delta region of California, specifically on a sprawling, privately-owned ranch just north of Isleton. The ranch, once a thriving asparagus farm, had fallen into disrepair. The owner, a land developer with grand (and some would say, foolhardy) visions, hired Jed and his crew to begin clearing land and building foundations for a planned luxury resort.

The delta landscape is a crucial element of the setting:

*   **Environment:** Flat, marshy land crisscrossed by sloughs and irrigation canals. Fertile soil, but prone to flooding. Willows, tules, and reeds thrive along the waterways.

*   **Atmosphere:** Humid, often foggy, with a distinct scent of river silt and decaying vegetation. The air hums with the drone of insects in the warmer months. The Sacramento River itself is a dominant presence, a wide, sluggish current that dictates the rhythm of life in the area.

*   **Socioeconomic:** The area is a mix of struggling agricultural communities and encroaching suburban development. There's a tension between those who want to preserve the rural character and those who see the delta as a potential goldmine for tourism and real estate.
