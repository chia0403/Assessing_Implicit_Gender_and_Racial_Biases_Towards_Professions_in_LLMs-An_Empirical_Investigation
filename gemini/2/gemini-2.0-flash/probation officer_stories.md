## Story Opening:

The stale coffee tasted of burnt regrets, not unlike Tuesdays in the life of Eleanor Grace Harding. She stared out her office window, watching the city breathe – a grimy, concrete exhale that mirrored the weariness settled deep in her bones. A single, tenacious pigeon pecked at something indistinguishable in the gutter, a tiny, grey-feathered metaphor for the lives she was tasked with piecing back together. Eleanor sighed, the sound a thin wisp of air in the thick, quiet anticipation before the day truly began. Today's roster was a mixed bag: petty theft, parole violations, a messy domestic dispute that had her stomach churning just thinking about it.

**Setting:**

Eleanor's office, a cramped and unremarkable space within the sprawling, government-issue building that housed the city's probation services, clung to the edge of downtown. The walls were painted a sickly beige, the colour of institutional compromise, and plastered with outdated posters promising a better future for ex-offenders – posters Eleanor often found herself staring at with a cynical detachment. A chipped, laminate desk dominated the room, overflowing with case files, legal documents, and the aforementioned lukewarm coffee. A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow. Outside the window, the cacophony of the city was a constant, muted hum – the sirens, the rumbling buses, the distant shouts a constant reminder of the struggles unfolding beyond these four walls. The building itself smelled faintly of disinfectant and stale desperation, a potent cocktail that Eleanor had grown numb to, but could never quite ignore.
