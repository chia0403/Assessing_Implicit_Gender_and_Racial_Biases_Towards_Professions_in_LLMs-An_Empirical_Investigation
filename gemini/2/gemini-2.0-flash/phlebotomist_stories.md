Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, introducing our phlebotomist protagonist:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet chaos of pre-dawn shift. Amelia Rowan, her name embroidered in faded blue thread on her crisp white lab coat, surveyed the bustling triage area of St. Jude’s General.  The faint smell of disinfectant, that ever-present hospital perfume, clung to the air, battling with the wafts of stale coffee emanating from the breakroom.  Outside, the sky was just beginning to bleed a tentative pink around the edges, but in here, time felt different, compressed, urgent. It always did.

Amelia adjusted the strap of her mask, her gloved hands already twitching with anticipation.  A veteran of countless early mornings, she knew what was coming: a tidal wave of patients, each carrying their own story of pain, hope, and fear. She was ready. She was always ready.  But today, a niggling unease settled in her stomach, a cold dread that had nothing to do with the usual Monday morning rush. A new directive had been issued. Every patient admitted for respiratory issues would need not one, but *three*, ABGs. And Amelia Rowan had a very bad feeling about it.
**Setting:**

*   **St. Jude’s General Hospital, a medium-sized, urban hospital located in the fictional city of Havenwood, Minnesota.** Havenwood is a diverse city, known for its harsh winters and a surprisingly vibrant arts scene. The hospital serves a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds, from affluent suburbanites to underserved inner-city populations.

*   **Specifically, the story opens in the hospital's Triage and Phlebotomy Lab area.**  This is a high-traffic, brightly lit space filled with gurneys, vital signs monitors, rolling IV poles, and the constant murmur of hushed conversations. There are several phlebotomy stations, each equipped with comfortable chairs, supplies, and a computer for inputting patient data. The lab is efficient but often feels cramped, a testament to the hospital's consistently high patient volume. The breakroom is just down the hall, a small, utilitarian space offering a brief respite from the intensity.
