## Story Opening:

The rhythmic scratching of Amelia Willowbrook's graphite pencil against the vellum was a comforting lullaby, a familiar soundtrack to the quiet desperation of her Thursday afternoon. Sweat beaded on her brow, not from the heat, but from the sheer force of concentration required to translate the architect's vague musings – "something vaguely gothic, but with… panache?" – into concrete, buildable reality. The intricate network of lines representing the proposed gargoyle perched precariously on the building's southeast corner was threatening to devolve into a chaotic tangle, a metaphor, Amelia thought, for her entire life right now. She paused, her hand hovering over the drawing, the scent of cedarwood and old paper thick in the air, and took a deep, steadying breath. This gargoyle, this ludicrous, stone-faced guardian, needed to be perfect. Because if she failed here, if she couldn't even get the damn wing span right, what hope did she have for anything else?

## Setting:

The year is 1928. Amelia Willowbrook works as a junior drafting worker for "Stone & Finch Architects," a respectable, if somewhat stuffy, firm nestled in the heart of Boston's Financial District. The firm's drafting room is located on the third floor of a brick building, overlooking a perpetually bustling cobblestone street. Sunlight, filtered through the sooty windows, casts long, dusty beams across the room. Rows of drafting tables, each cluttered with blueprints, rulers, pencils, and half-empty coffee cups, fill the space. The air is thick with the aforementioned aroma of cedarwood drafting boards and aged paper, mingled with the faint, metallic tang of ink and the lingering scent of Mr. Finch's ever-present pipe tobacco. The walls are adorned with framed architectural renderings of the firm's past successes, imposing buildings in the classic Beaux-Arts style that Amelia secretly finds terribly boring. The room is a haven for precision and order, a stark contrast to the chaotic anxieties churning within Amelia's own heart.
