## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Willow Creek Pharmacy" tinkled a mournful little song, a sound Elias Thorne hadn't noticed in at least a decade. He was too busy staring at the faded "Open" sign, a faded echo of the vitality this town once possessed. The sign was practically begging to be replaced, just like everything else in Willow Creek, including Elias himself. The problem wasn't that the bell was announcing a customer; it was that it was announcing *another* customer asking for something he couldn't provide. This time, Elias braced himself, it would probably be another desperate mother looking for powdered baby formula, or a worried wife needing a refill on a medication that was backordered indefinitely. He pasted on his most reassuring smile, the one that felt more like a grimace these days, and turned to face his fate. "Good morning," he began, his voice already laced with the subtle weariness of a man carrying a town's anxieties on his shoulders. "How can I help you?"

**Setting:**

Willow Creek Pharmacy is located in the heart of Willow Creek, Montana, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. Once a bustling logging community, Willow Creek is now a shell of its former self, its main street lined with boarded-up storefronts and faded memories. The pharmacy itself is a relic, a building that probably saw its prime in the 1950s. The exterior is painted a pale, chipped green, and the large window displays a slightly sun-bleached collection of travel-sized toiletries and dusty first-aid kits. Inside, the air smells faintly of menthol, old paper, and something indefinably sterile. The shelves are crammed with medications, vitamins, and a surprisingly large selection of greeting cards that haven't been updated in years. A small, cluttered counter sits at the back, where Elias spends most of his days, dispensing medication, offering advice, and trying to hold together the threads of a community that seems to be unraveling with each passing year. Sunlight streams through the window in the mornings, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a stark reminder of the slow decay that has settled over Willow Creek.
