**Opening:**

The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in her waiting room was the only sound Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth could hear over the frantic hammering of her own heart. She smoothed the creases in her navy pencil skirt, a futile attempt to regain control she desperately craved. This wasn't a typical Tuesday. This wasn't just another session with a client struggling with anxiety or a difficult childhood. This was different. This felt… ominous. The note, delivered by a courier just an hour ago, lay face down on her mahogany desk, its crisp white surface mocking her with its inscrutable promise of revelation. It was addressed simply: "For Eleanor." And beneath that, a single, unsettling word: "Remember."

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's practice, "Ainsworth Psychological Services," occupied the second floor of a meticulously maintained Victorian brownstone in the heart of Beacon Hill, Boston. The building itself was a testament to old money and established success, and Eleanor had painstakingly cultivated a similarly refined atmosphere within her suite. The waiting room was bathed in the warm glow of Tiffany-style lamps, casting intricate patterns on the plush Persian rug beneath the feet of nervous clients. Overstuffed armchairs, upholstered in a calming teal velvet, invited relaxation. A small, antique table held a carefully curated selection of magazines – scholarly journals interspersed with issues of *The New Yorker* and *Architectural Digest*. The scent of sandalwood and lavender wafted from a discreet diffuser, a subtle attempt to soothe frayed nerves.

Eleanor's office, located just beyond a pair of heavy oak doors, was a more personal space. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined one wall, crammed with textbooks, research papers, and well-worn copies of her favorite novels. A large, antique desk dominated the room, its surface cluttered with files, research notes, and a framed photograph of Eleanor and her late husband, smiling radiantly on their wedding day. A comfortable leather chaise lounge provided a space for clients to recline and delve into their deepest anxieties. A window overlooked a small, private garden, a splash of green amidst the urban landscape, offering a glimpse of serenity in a world often riddled with chaos. While meticulously crafted to inspire trust and promote healing, today, the carefully curated tranquility felt suffocating, a gilded cage holding Eleanor captive in her own unease.
