## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting air of late October clung to the valley of the Skagit River, Washington State. Ancient Douglas firs, their crowns lost in the perpetual mist, stood like silent sentinels guarding secrets whispered only on the wind. Mud, thick and clinging like a jealous lover, coated everything â€“ boots, axes, and the massive, yellow logging trucks that rumbled through the narrow, rutted logging roads. The perpetual damp had permeated everything, seeping into the bones and breeding a constant, low-grade chill. The smell of wet earth, decaying leaves, and the sharp, acrid tang of chainsaw exhaust hung heavy in the air.

**Story Opening:**

The jarring clang of steel against steel ripped through the stillness of the predawn, a rude awakening for the mountains and the men who dared to tame them. Standing knee-deep in a muddy clearing, silhouetted against the faint, grey light creeping over the eastern ridge, was **Jedediah "Jed" Silas Hawkins**. His thick, calloused hands, roughened by years of gripping axes and wrestling timber, gripped the handle of his double-bit axe, the well-worn steel glinting faintly in the dim light. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the mud, the brown stain a stark contrast to the grey clay. Jed squinted, his weathered face a roadmap of deep lines etched by sun, wind, and hard living. The early morning mist clung to his salt-and-pepper beard, making him look like a mountain man lost in time. He surveyed the towering fir slated for felling, a giant that had stood sentinel for centuries. A flicker of something akin to regret crossed his eyes, quickly replaced by the grim determination born of necessity. He had a family to feed, and this ancient giant was just another tree, another paycheck. "Alright, you old bastard," he muttered to the towering fir, his voice gravelly and low, "let's see what you're made of."
