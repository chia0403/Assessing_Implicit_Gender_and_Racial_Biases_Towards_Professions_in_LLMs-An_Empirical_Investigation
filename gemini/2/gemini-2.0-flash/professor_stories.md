## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of cardamom and old paper clung to Professor Eleanor Ainsworth like a familiar shroud. She ran a hand through her perpetually dishevelled grey bun, scattering a few more stray strands that refused to be tamed. Outside, the Glasgow rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of her office in the West Quadrangle of the University, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in her head. Not from the storm, but from the letter crumpled in her hand, its crisp cream paper now softened with the residue of anxious sweat.  It was addressed to her directly, in a spidery script she both recognised and dreaded, and the first line alone was enough to send a chill down her spine: "Eleanor, dear Eleanor, they're back. And this time, they're looking for *you.*"

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily in Glasgow, Scotland, with a specific focus on the **University of Glasgow's West Quadrangle**. The university, a gothic masterpiece of sandstone and stained glass, is a character in itself. Eleanor's office, a small, cluttered space overflowing with books, maps, and forgotten artifacts, is located on the third floor. The room is crammed with shelves that groan under the weight of centuries of accumulated knowledge. Sunlight, when it manages to pierce the perpetual Scottish gloom, filters through the stained glass, casting dancing patterns on the dust motes that swirl in the air. The air is thick with the scent of old books, leather, and a faint, lingering hint of pipe tobacco â€“ a ghost of professors past.  The city itself, with its hidden alleyways, bustling markets, and brooding industrial heritage, provides a vibrant and potentially dangerous backdrop to the unfolding events.
