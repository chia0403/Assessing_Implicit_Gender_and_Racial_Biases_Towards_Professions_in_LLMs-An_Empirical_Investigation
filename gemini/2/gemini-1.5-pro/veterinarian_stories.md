The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles as he trudged across the frozen farmyard, the crisp December air stinging his cheeks.  A thin layer of snow crunched under his heavy boots, the only sound competing with the mournful lowing of cattle in the nearby barn.  The sprawling McGregor farm, nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, was usually a picture of rustic charm.  Today, however, a palpable tension hung in the air, thick and heavy like the gathering storm clouds overhead.  Agnes McGregor, her face etched with worry lines deeper than the furrows in her fields, met him at the barn door, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  "Dr. Thorne, thank God you're here.  Something's terribly wrong with Bessie."
