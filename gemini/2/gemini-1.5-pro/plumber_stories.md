The biting November wind whistled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, rattling the frosted panes of Mrs. Periwinkle's bay window. Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Flanagan, his knuckles raw and chapped despite his thick work gloves, wrestled with the ancient plumbing beneath her antique porcelain sink.  The air in the cramped space was thick with the scent of pipe sealant and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Periwinkle's lavender potpourri, a strangely comforting contrast to the frigid air seeping in from the cracked windowpane above. Barty, his brow furrowed in concentration, muttered to himself, "Stubborn old girl, just like her owner," as he tightened a rusted compression fitting. Sycamore Street, a quiet, tree-lined haven in the otherwise bustling town of Oakhaven, was Barty's bread and butter. He knew every leaky faucet and temperamental boiler from number one to one hundred and twelve.  And while he often grumbled about the antiquated plumbing and the eccentric personalities of his clientele, a quiet affection for the street and its inhabitants ran deep within him.
