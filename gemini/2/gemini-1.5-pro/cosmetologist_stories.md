The pungent aroma of acetone and hairspray hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Genevieve "Gen" Dubois barely registered anymore. Her salon, "The Painted Lady," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery on Bleecker Street, was a vibrant splash of color against the grey November backdrop of Greenwich Village.  Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon. Inside, the warm glow of Edison bulbs cast long shadows across the vintage barber chairs and ornate mirrors, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering fairies. Gen, with a smudge of cherry-red lipstick on her cheek and a tangle of bobby pins clinging precariously to her messy bun, surveyed her domain with a weary sigh.  Tuesday afternoons were always slow, a lull before the weekend rush, leaving her alone with her thoughts and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the back room â€“ a constant reminder of the ever-growing list of repairs the old building demanded.
