The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, plastering his dark hair against his forehead as he stared up at the imposing Victorian mansion.  Wisteria, now withered and skeletal, clung to the grey stone walls like grasping fingers.  The windows, dark and reflecting the stormy sky, gave the impression of vacant eyes staring back at him.  Rain, mixed with sleet, began to fall, coating the already slick cobblestone driveway with a treacherous layer of ice.  This was Blackwood Manor, nestled deep in the woods outside the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts, and the site of a tragedy so gruesome it had sent ripples of unease even through Elias's professionally detached psyche.  He adjusted his briefcase, the leather cold against his gloved hand, and took a deep breath, the crisp air carrying the faint, metallic tang ofâ€¦something. He couldn't quite place it, but it set his teeth on edge.  This was not going to be a simple consultation.
