The stale recycled air hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the gentle shudder of the 747 as it taxied towards the runway at Narita International Airport.  Sakura blossoms, a vibrant blush against the grey Tokyo sky, framed the window view. Inside, Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez smoothed down her crisp navy uniform, adjusted the silk scarf knotted at her throat, and plastered a professional smile on her face.  It was 6:00 am, and flight NH107 to Los Angeles was already forty minutes behind schedule. A mechanical issue, the captain had announced, a vague explanation that did little to soothe the restless passengers already fidgeting in their cramped seats. Mia took a deep breath, the faint scent of cherry blossom hand lotion clinging to the air around her.  This was her third transpacific flight in five days, and the exhaustion was starting to settle deep in her bones. But the rent in her tiny Brooklyn apartment wasn't going to pay itself, and the thought of the Californian sunshine at the other end of this thirteen-hour flight was enough to keep her going, at least for now.  Little did she know, the delay wasn't just a mechanical issue. It was the first domino in a chain of events that would change her life forever.
