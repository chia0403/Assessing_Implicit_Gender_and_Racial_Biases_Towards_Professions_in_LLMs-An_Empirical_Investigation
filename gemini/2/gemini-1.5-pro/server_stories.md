The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, otherworldly glow on the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the passing headlights into streaks of white.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, sighed and wiped a damp rag across the counter, her gaze fixed on the empty booths.  It was nearing 2:00 am, the graveyard shift was almost over, and the only company she had was the rhythmic drip of the leaky roof and the crackling static of the ancient jukebox in the corner.  The Starlight, a beacon of greasy hope in the desolate stretch of highway between Harmony Creek and nowhere, wasn't exactly bustling on a Tuesday night, especially not one as stormy as this.
