The clatter of pans, the sizzle of butter, the fragrant steam of rosemary and garlic â€“ these were the sounds and scents that filled the tiny galley kitchen of "The Salty Spoon," a perpetually rocking diner moored to a dilapidated pier in Port Blossom, Maine.  Eliza June Hawthorne, a woman whose weathered face and capable hands spoke volumes about years spent battling the capricious moods of both the sea and hungry patrons, flipped a perfect pancake with a flick of her wrist. Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, whipping the slate-grey waves into a frenzy against the barnacle-encrusted pilings. The sky, the same color as the churning sea, promised snow before nightfall. Inside, the warm yellow glow of the diner's single hanging lamp illuminated a handful of regulars huddled over steaming mugs of coffee, oblivious to the approaching storm.  Eliza, however, felt it in her bones, the same way she felt the subtle shift in the wind before a squall hit. And she knew, with a certainty that came from a lifetime spent on these shores, that something more than just a snowstorm was brewing in Port Blossom.
