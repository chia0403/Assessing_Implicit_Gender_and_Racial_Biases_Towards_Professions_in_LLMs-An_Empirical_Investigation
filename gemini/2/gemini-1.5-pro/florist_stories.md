The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic November rain lashing against the shop's front window.  Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from conditioning a fresh delivery of hydrangeas, looked up, a welcoming smile already forming on her face.  Petal & Stem, nestled between a bustling Italian deli and a dusty antique bookstore on Sycamore Street, was Eliza Jane's sanctuary, a vibrant splash of color in the otherwise muted palette of the small, coastal town of Seabrook, Oregon.  The air inside was thick with the perfume of lilies, roses, and damp earth, a fragrance Eliza Jane found infinitely more comforting than any manufactured scent.  Outside, the grey sea roiled and churned, mirroring the turbulent emotions brewing beneath Eliza Jane's carefully composed exterior.  This November wasn't just bringing the usual chill winds and shortening days to Seabrook; it was bringing the tenth anniversary of the storm that had changed everything.
