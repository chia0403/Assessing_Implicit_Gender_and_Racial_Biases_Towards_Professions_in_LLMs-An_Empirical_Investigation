The fishing boats, bobbing gently against their moorings, were frosted with a thin layer of ice, a stark reminder that winter's icy grip was tightening its hold on this quaint, seaside town. Eleanor clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – a set of antique dental instruments passed down from her grandfather – clinking softly with each hurried step.  The setting sun cast long shadows that stretched and distorted across the square, transforming familiar landmarks into something almost sinister. Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold, but from a growing unease that had settled in her stomach ever since the mysterious new patient had booked an appointment for that very evening.
