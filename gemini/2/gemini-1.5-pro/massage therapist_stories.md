The insistent drumming of rain against the large bay window mirrored the throbbing ache in Elias Thorne's temples. He kneaded his knuckles into the tense muscles, a futile attempt to soothe the pressure that had been building all day. Outside, the grey November sky pressed down on the small town of Oakhaven, Oregon, shrouding the usually vibrant autumn foliage in a dreary mist. Inside his cozy, book-lined massage therapy studio, "The Knotty Pine," the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the damp earthiness permeating the outside world.  The last client of the day, a particularly demanding Mrs. Periwinkle, had left only moments ago, her parting words a litany of complaints about the firmness of his thumbs. Elias sighed, the gentle clinking of wind chimes hanging by the door the only sound now accompanying the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  He glanced at the antique clock ticking steadily on the wall, its hands pointing to a quarter past six.  Time to lock up and head home, but the thought of his empty apartment offered little solace.
