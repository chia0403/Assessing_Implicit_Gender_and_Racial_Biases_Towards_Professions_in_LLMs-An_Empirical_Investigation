The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity.  Crystal chandeliers, each a miniature galaxy of refracted light, glittered above a chessboard floor of polished marble.  The scent of lilies, strategically placed throughout the vast space, mingled with the faintest whisper of chlorine from the rooftop pool.  This was Amelia Hawthorne’s domain.  Her name, embroidered in elegant script on the discreet brass plaque of her mahogany concierge desk, was as much a promise of efficiency as it was a mark of distinction.  Outside, the relentless New York City summer sizzled on the sidewalks, but within these hallowed, air-conditioned walls, Amelia, impeccably dressed in her navy suit and pearl earrings, remained the picture of serene composure.  It was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays usually meant theatre tickets and dinner reservations, not international conspiracies and stolen Fabergé eggs.
