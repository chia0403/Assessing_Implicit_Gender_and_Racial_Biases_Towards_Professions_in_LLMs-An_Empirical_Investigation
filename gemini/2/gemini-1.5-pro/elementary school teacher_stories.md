The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorne's ankles as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's School parking lot.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt caramel and bruised plums, skittered around her worn brown boots. The air smelled of woodsmoke and the faintly sweet decay of autumn. Nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains, St. Jude's was a small, single-story brick building, more reminiscent of a cozy cottage than an institution of learning. Its brightly painted red door, however, offered a vibrant splash of color against the otherwise muted palette of the late fall landscape. Inside, a warm, buttery glow emanated from the windows of Mrs. Hawthorne’s second-grade classroom, promising a refuge from the encroaching cold.  The day's lessons – fractions and the life cycle of the monarch butterfly – were still scribbled on the chalkboard, waiting for the arrival of her rambunctious, inquisitive students. But today, an unusual stillness hung in the air, a premonition that this Tuesday would be unlike any other.
