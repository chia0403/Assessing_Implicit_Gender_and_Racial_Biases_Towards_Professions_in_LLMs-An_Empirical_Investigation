The rusty tang of iron oxide hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma for Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez.  Her garage, "Bea's Bolts and Bodywork," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the sun-baked town of Harmony Springs, Arizona.  It wasn't much – cracked concrete floor, a perpetually leaking roof patched with mismatched tarps, and walls adorned with a chaotic collage of pin-up calendars and faded award ribbons from local demolition derbies – but it was hers.  The late afternoon sun, a fiery orb sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Diablo Mountains, cast long shadows across the yard, illuminating a graveyard of rusted-out pickups and disemboweled engines. Bea, grease smudged across her cheek and a wrench tucked behind her ear, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her equally greasy hand.  A battered '67 Chevy Impala, its once-cherry-red paint now a faded, peeling whisper of its former glory, sat on the lift, its engine compartment gaping like a metallic maw.  This was Bea's current project, a resurrection job she'd affectionately nicknamed "Lazarus."  And Lazarus, like everything else in Harmony Springs, held a story waiting to be unearthed.
