The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, rattling the reinforced steel door that stood sentinel against the encroaching Arctic night.  Dr. Elias Thorne, his breath clouding in the frigid air, punched in the final digits of the access code, the green light above blinking in confirmation. He pushed open the heavy door, the metallic screech echoing through the concrete tunnel that burrowed deep into the permafrost-laden mountain. Inside, the air was still and cold, a constant 18 degrees Celsius, preserving the world's agricultural heritage within its icy embrace.  Elias shivered, not entirely from the cold, but from the weight of responsibility he carried.  He was alone, the sole scientist on duty for the next 72 hours, guardian of millions of seed samples, the silent promise of future harvests entrusted to his care. Tonight, however, something felt different. A low hum resonated through the vault, a sound Elias had never heard before, a sound that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the mountain itself.
