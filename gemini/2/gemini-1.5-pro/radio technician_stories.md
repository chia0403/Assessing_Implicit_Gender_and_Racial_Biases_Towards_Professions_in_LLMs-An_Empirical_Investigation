The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, whistling through the rusted guy-wires of the KWVA radio tower.  Amelia “Amy” Reyes, her breath clouding in the frigid pre-dawn air, tightened the wrench on the final bolt securing the new transmitter.  Beneath her thick work boots, the corrugated metal roof of the small, prefabricated building creaked ominously.  KWVA, broadcasting from a point halfway between nowhere and absolutely nothing, was Amy's domain.  Five hundred watts of middle-of-the-road country and western, interspersed with the occasional public service announcement about livestock auctions and lost dogs, radiated outwards from this lonely outpost.  The closest town, Harmony Springs, was a forty-mile drive down a dirt road that turned treacherous after even a light rain.  Today, the sky was a bruised purple, promising snow.  Amy hoped she'd finished the repairs before it hit. This new transmitter was vital; the old one had been sputtering for weeks, its signal fading like a dying star.  For the scattered ranchers and truckers who relied on KWVA for news, weather, and a little bit of company, Amy was their lifeline to the outside world.
