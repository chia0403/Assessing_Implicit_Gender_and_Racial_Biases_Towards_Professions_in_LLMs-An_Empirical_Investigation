The biting wind whipped through the Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune that echoed the gnawing emptiness in Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's gut.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, the sky a bruised purple canvas streaked with thin, icy clouds.  Frost crunched under Jed's heavy work boots as he trudged through the logging camp, the air thick with the scent of pine resin and woodsmoke.  Camp Nowhere, they called it. A fitting name, Jed thought, for a place that felt miles from anywhere and even further from anything resembling hope.  The ramshackle collection of plywood shacks and canvas tents huddled at the base of Mount Blackwood, ironically named after Jed's ancestors, who had logged these very slopes generations ago. Now, only Jed remained, the last Blackwood clinging to the mountain, to the trees, and to a way of life that felt as precarious as the brittle branches above him.
