The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her worn leather satchel bumping against her hip. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, the whitewashed houses of Oia clinging to the slopes like a dusting of snow.  The late afternoon sun cast long, dramatic shadows, painting the caldera in hues of burnt orange and deep violet.  Elara, her fingers stained with charcoal, squinted at the scene through half-closed eyes, trying to capture the ethereal light on her sketchpad. The wind whipped strands of her dark hair across her face, momentarily obscuring her view of the breathtaking panorama that had captivated her for weeks and promised to inspire a masterpiece.
