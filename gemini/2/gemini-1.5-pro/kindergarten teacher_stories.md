The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill outside her classroom, roused Amelia Iris Thorne from her grading stupor.  The setting sun cast long, orange fingers across the miniature tables and chairs scattered around the brightly colored room, illuminating the glitter-bombed artwork clinging to every available surface.  Room 2B of Sunny Meadow Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, was usually a hive of frenetic energy.  But now, at 6:17 pm on a crisp October evening, the only sounds were the scratching of Amelia's pen and the persistent robin, seemingly demanding its share of the leftover animal crackers Amelia had forgotten on her desk.  The scent of dried paint, play-dough, and the faint, lingering aroma of naptime apple juice hung in the air, a comforting, if slightly sticky, perfume that Amelia had come to associate with home.
