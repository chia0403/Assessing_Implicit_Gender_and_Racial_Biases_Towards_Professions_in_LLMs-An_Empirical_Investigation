The clatter of the horse-drawn trams outside echoed faintly through the dusty panes of Mademoiselle Elodie Beaumont’s atelier.  It was a small, cluttered space tucked away on Rue de l'Aiguille, a narrow lane in the heart of Montmartre, Paris, 1888. Bolts of silk and velvet, in shades ranging from deepest indigo to the palest blush rose, tumbled from shelves that lined the walls.  Pins and needles, thimbles and tape measures, lay scattered across the worn wooden work table, catching the weak winter sunlight that filtered through the window.  A half-finished gown of emerald green silk, destined for a celebrated actress at the Moulin Rouge, lay draped over a dress form, its intricate beading shimmering like captured starlight. Elodie, her dark hair pulled back in a severe chignon, frowned at the garment, her nimble fingers pausing mid-stitch.  The air in the atelier, thick with the scent of lavender and fabric dye, crackled with a nervous energy.  Something wasn't right. Not with the dress itself, but with the quiet that had settled over the bustling city outside.  A quiet that felt…omenous.
