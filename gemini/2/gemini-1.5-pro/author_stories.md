Rain lashed against the attic window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elias Thorne, author of the critically acclaimed but commercially disastrous novel, "The Cartographer of Whispers." He sat hunched over his ancient typewriter, the only sound besides the downpour the rhythmic clack of keys and the occasional frustrated sigh that escaped his lips. Elias's attic room, usually a haven of creativity, felt more like a prison tonight. Dust motes danced in the single beam of light cast by a bare bulb dangling precariously from the rafter, illuminating the cluttered chaos of his workspace.  Stacks of manuscripts, rejection letters, and half-empty coffee mugs littered every surface, creating a fortress around the small island of cleared space where his typewriter reigned supreme. The air was thick with the smell of old paper, stale cigarette smoke, and the faint, lingering scent of lavender that clung stubbornly to the faded floral wallpaper.  The storm outside seemed to be feeding Elias's inner turmoil, each gust of wind a whisper of doubt, each raindrop a reminder of the words that wouldn't come.
