The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal steel frame of the "Apex Tower," whistling a mournful tune through the exposed girders.  Fifty stories above the bustling Chicago streets,  Elias Vance shivered, pulling his hard hat lower over his ears.  The sun, a weak, watery disc in the hazy sky, offered little warmth.  Elias’s breath plumed out in white puffs, quickly snatched away by the wind.  He adjusted the thick leather gloves clinging to his calloused hands and surveyed the partially completed floor, a concrete wasteland strewn with rebar, plywood, and coils of electrical cable. The city stretched out beneath him, a dizzying tapestry of skyscrapers and brownstones, the distant rumble of traffic a dull roar in the crisp air.  Today’s task: securing the massive steel beams that would support the next floor's platform.  A job that, on a day like this, felt less like construction and more like tightrope walking in a wind tunnel.
