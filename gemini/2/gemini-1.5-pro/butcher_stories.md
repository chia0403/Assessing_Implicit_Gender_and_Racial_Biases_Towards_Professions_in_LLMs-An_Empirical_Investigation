Elias, his apron stained crimson, cleaved a hefty pork loin with practiced ease, the rhythmic thud of his cleaver a counterpoint to the howling wind.  Grimsborough, a town perpetually shrouded in a low-hanging mist and whispered to be built upon the bones of an ancient battlefield, wasn't known for its cheer, but tonight, it felt particularly ominous.  The flickering gas lamps cast long, distorted shadows across the butcher's block, making the hanging carcasses of game and fowl seem to sway and twitch in the dim light.
