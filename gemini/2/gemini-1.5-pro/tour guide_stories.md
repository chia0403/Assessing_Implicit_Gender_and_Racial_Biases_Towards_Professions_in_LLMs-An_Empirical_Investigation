The midday sun beat down on the cobblestones of Prague's Old Town Square, baking the tourists clustered around the Astronomical Clock like ants around a dropped sugar cube.  Amelia Catherine Hoffman, her auburn hair escaping its braid in the humidity, adjusted the microphone clipped to her linen blouse.  A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, mirroring the steady drip from the gargoyle perched high above on the Tyn Church's gothic spire.  This was Amelia's favourite spot in the whole city, even in this suffocating July heat. The vibrant energy of the square, the hushed awe as the clock's figures jerked to life each hour, the centuries of history whispering from every chipped stone â€“ it never failed to captivate her. Today, however, a ripple of unease disturbed the usual tourist buzz.  A low, guttural chanting echoed from the narrow alleyway that snaked beside the clock, growing louder with each passing second, a sound wholly out of place amidst the clicking cameras and the murmur of multiple languages.
