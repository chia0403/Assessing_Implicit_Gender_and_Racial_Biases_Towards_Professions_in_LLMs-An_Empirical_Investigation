The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of the converted stable that housed his practice.  The wrought iron sign above the oak door creaked rhythmically, proclaiming "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness."  Leaden clouds hung low over the picturesque Vermont town of Maplebrook, threatening the first snow of the season.  Inside, the waiting room, usually bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun, was dim and shadowy.  A single lamp illuminated a dust mote ballet in the air, disturbed by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner. The only other sound was the gentle crackling of the fire in the hearth, struggling to fight off the encroaching chill.  Elias rubbed his hands together, a faint pop echoing in the quiet, and wondered why his 4:00 appointment, Mrs. Periwinkle, was so uncharacteristically late.
