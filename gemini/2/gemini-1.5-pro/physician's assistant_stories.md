The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of frozen algae and city exhaust.  Inside the fluorescent-lit warmth of the Lakeshore Free Clinic, Emilia Reyes, PA-C, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck and sighed.  It was 6:45 p.m., fifteen minutes before the clinic officially closed, but the waiting room still buzzed with a restless energy.  Cracked vinyl seats groaned under the weight of weary bodies, and the air hung thick with the mingled aromas of antiseptic and simmering despair. Emilia had been on her feet for nine hours, her sensible shoes protesting with every step.  Tonight, like most nights at the free clinic, felt like a losing battle against a tide of unmet needs.  Chicago winters were harsh, especially on the vulnerable, and Emilia knew tonight was just a preview of the long, cold months ahead.
