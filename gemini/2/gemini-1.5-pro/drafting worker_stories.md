The flickering fluorescent lights of Henderson & Sons Architectural Firm hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Reyes, a tune she’d become intimately familiar with over the past five years.  The air in the drafting room was thick with the scent of pencil shavings, blueprint ink, and the faint metallic tang of the aging T-squares clinging to the drawing boards. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the large, grime-streaked windows that offered a fragmented view of the city's towering skyline – a skyline Amelia had, ironically, helped shape, one painstaking line at a time. It was a Friday afternoon in late November, the kind of grey, bone-chilling day that seeped into your very marrow, and the only thing Amelia looked forward to more than escaping the oppressive glow of the drafting room was the warmth of her tiny apartment and the promise of a hot cup of tea.  But escape was still hours away.  A half-finished blueprint for a new luxury condominium complex lay spread across her board, its intricate lines a testament to weeks of meticulous work.  And Mr. Henderson, a man whose jowls seemed to perpetually quiver with barely contained impatience, had just dropped another rush job on her desk.
