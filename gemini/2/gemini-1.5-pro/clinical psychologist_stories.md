Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading twilight into a smear of grey.  His mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in the controlled chaos of his life, was littered with files â€“ the messy remnants of a particularly grueling afternoon.  Elias, his dark hair threaded with silver at the temples, rubbed the bridge of his nose, the faint scent of old books and pipe tobacco clinging to his tweed jacket.  His practice, nestled in a converted brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined street in Brooklyn Heights, usually offered a sense of calm, a refuge from the anxieties that plagued his patients. But tonight, the storm raging outside seemed to mirror the tempest brewing within him.  A new patient, one with a particularly perplexing and disturbing case, was due any minute, and Elias, for the first time in his long career, felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that this encounter would be unlike any other.
