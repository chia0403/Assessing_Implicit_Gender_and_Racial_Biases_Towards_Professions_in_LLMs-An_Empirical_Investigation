The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office cast long, dancing shadows on the beige walls.  A faint, almost imperceptible hum emanated from the ancient, oversized air conditioner, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Eleanor's fingers on the worn surface of her desk.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – car horns, distant sirens, and the ceaseless drone of construction – bled into the sterile quiet of the room.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a practiced calm, observed a young man across the polished mahogany desk.  He was dressed in a faded band t-shirt and jeans, his posture slumped, his eyes nervously darting around the room.  His name was  Liam O'Connell.


The cramped office, located on a quiet side street in the heart of bustling downtown Chicago, served as a refuge from the chaos of the urban landscape.  Tiny succulents in mismatched terracotta pots sat clustered on the windowsill, struggling to thrive amidst the pale, filtered light.  A half-eaten apple core lay abandoned amidst a pile of clinical paperwork, a testament to the unpredictable flow of time within those four walls.  Eleanor, with her carefully curated collection of vintage psychology texts lining the shelves, seemed to be a lone island of order in a swirling sea of urban anxieties.  The room itself, though functional, hinted at a subtle melancholy, a quiet hum of unspoken struggles that echoed in the spaces between the words Liam whispered, struggles that Eleanor knew she was about to confront.
