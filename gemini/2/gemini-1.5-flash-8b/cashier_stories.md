The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" general store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Dust motes danced in the weak, filtered light, mirroring the swirling thoughts in her head.  Another Tuesday, another barrage of misplaced shopping carts, mumbled complaints about the price of chipped porcelain frogs, and the ceaseless, irritating chime of the register.  Amelia, twenty-two years old and perpetually tired, wiped a smudge of spilled grape juice from the plastic countertop with a sigh.  The store, a sprawling cavern of beige walls and hastily-organized shelves, reeked of old coffee and discounted air freshener.  Stacked high above the aisles were overflowing bins of gently used books, their spines cracked and their covers faded, whispering stories of forgotten adventures.  From the far corner, the clatter of the bulk candy bins – a symphony of multicolored sugar – echoed around her. This was her world, her prison, and her paycheck.
