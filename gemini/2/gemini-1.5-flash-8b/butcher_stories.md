The aroma of roasted chestnuts and simmering stew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of freshly cut meat.  Barnaby "Barnacle" Butterfield, a butcher with hands calloused and stained the deep crimson of his craft, wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.  The flickering gaslight of "Butterfield's Bloody Bonanza" cast long, dancing shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening array of haunches, ribs, and sides of beef that lined the shelves.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the Southwark district echoed with the rhythmic clang of blacksmith's hammers and the boisterous cries of vendors hawking their wares.  Snow, the consistency of coarse sugar, dusted the rooftops and glistened under the feeble glow of the streetlamps.  It was a frigid December evening in 1888, and Barnacle, despite the warmth of the shop's fire, felt a bone-deep chill.
