The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Elara Nightingale's face, highlighting the faint dusting of freckles across her nose.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, fried onions, and something vaguely floral, probably from the wilting bouquet on the bar counter.  Elara, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of stormy seas, adjusted the microphone stand, the metal cold against her palm.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was a mausoleum of hushed conversations and the clinking of glasses.  The only music was the low hum of the jukebox, playing a mournful ballad.  Tonight was a night for whispers, not for songs.

Elara's full name was Elara Nightingale Starcourt, though most people just called her Elara.  She was a singer, a fledgling performer in a town that seemed to have forgotten the sound of music.  The small, dusty town of Oakhaven, nestled amongst the whispering pines and ancient oaks, existed in a quiet slumber, a place where the days unfolded like pages in a well-worn book.  The Rusty Mug was its heart, its soul, its only heartbeat.  And tonight, Elara felt the weight of that quiet destiny pressing down on her.  Tonight, she had to sing.
