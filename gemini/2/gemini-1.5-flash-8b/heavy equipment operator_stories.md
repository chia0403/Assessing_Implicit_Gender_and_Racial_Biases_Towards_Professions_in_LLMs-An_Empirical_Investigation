The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Badlands, stinging Amelia "Milly"  Stone's cheeks and rattling the metal cage of her cab.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the horizon in a hazy, sun-baked blur.  Milly gripped the worn leather steering wheel of her Caterpillar 990G, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine a constant drumbeat in the oppressive silence.  Around her, the vast, undulating landscape of the South Dakota badlands stretched endlessly, a panorama of eroded mesas and jagged canyons carved by eons of wind and water.  Rust-coloured sandstone formations, sculpted by nature into bizarre and fantastical shapes, rose like ancient sentinels, their shadows lengthening as the sun dipped towards the horizon.  She was alone, miles from any sign of civilization, her only companions the unforgiving terrain and the relentless, whispering wind.  This was her world, the unforgiving, beautiful world of heavy equipment and unforgiving rock.
