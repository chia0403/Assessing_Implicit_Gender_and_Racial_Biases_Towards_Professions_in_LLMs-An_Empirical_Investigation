The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Institute hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of Elias Thorne's broom against the linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, swirling like tiny, spectral gnats.  Elias, a man whose uniform shirt, faded navy blue, seemed to absorb the gloom of the place as much as the grime, moved with practiced efficiency.  He was, as the Institute’s hushed hallways whispered, a silent guardian of its secrets, a custodian of its forgotten knowledge.  His name, Elias Thorne, echoed only in the rustle of papers, the clatter of discarded equipment, and the faintest sigh of air conditioners.

The Institute, a sprawling behemoth of glass and steel, stood perched on a windswept plateau overlooking the city.  Below, the cityscape shimmered in a tapestry of lights, a vibrant contrast to the sterile, almost clinical environment within.  Sharp angles and polished surfaces reflected the pale dawn sky, mirroring the meticulous order of the research conducted within.  But in the labyrinthine corridors, where Elias worked, shadows clung to corners, and whispers of forgotten experiments and suppressed breakthroughs seemed to linger in the air, carried on the faint scent of ozone and something almost metallic, something…unnatural.
