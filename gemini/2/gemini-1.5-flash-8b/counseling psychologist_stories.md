The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, reflecting the anxious tremor in Amelia’s hand as she clutched her worn leather purse.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, a stark contrast to the suffocating humidity clinging to the air in the small, cluttered room.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of city traffic – honking taxis, screeching brakes, the distant wail of a siren – hammered against the quiet desperation building within Amelia.

Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a practiced calm etched into her face, noted the subtle shift in Amelia’s posture, the way her shoulders had slumped further, mirroring the weariness in her eyes.  She’d known Amelia for three sessions now, and the pattern was predictable – the initial hesitant attempts at conversation, the carefully constructed walls around her pain, the fragile trust that was always on the brink of collapse.

This particular Wednesday was no different.  Eleanor leaned back in her worn armchair, her gaze soft yet steady. The small, cluttered office,  a testament to a lifetime of accumulated papers, journals, and half-consumed mugs of lukewarm coffee, held a strange comfort.  This was her sanctuary, her space to dissect the complexities of human suffering, to hold a flickering flame for others, even if it felt as though the flame burned ever so faintly within her own heart.
