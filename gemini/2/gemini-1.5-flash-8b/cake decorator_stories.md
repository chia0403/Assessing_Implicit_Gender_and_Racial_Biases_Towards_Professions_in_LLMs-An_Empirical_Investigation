Amy, perched on a wobbly stool, meticulously piped a delicate spiral of frosting, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, illuminating the faintest traces of flour that dusted her cheeks.  Outside, the bustling city of Veridian hummed with the rhythmic clatter of streetcars and the cheerful chatter of pedestrians. This particular Tuesday, the hum of the city seemed to vibrate within the walls of Sweet Surrender, louder than usual, and an uneasy feeling settled in Amy's stomach.  It had been a particularly difficult week, starting with a rogue client demanding a cake shaped like a tyrannosaurus rex made entirely of chocolate.  Her latest anxiety was tied up with an impending deliveryâ€”one that felt suspiciously weighty, and the unusual circumstances surrounding it.
