Professor Amelia "Amy" Blackwood, a renowned astrophysicist at the prestigious Blackwood Institute of Cosmology, stared out the panoramic window of her office.  The swirling nebulae projected onto the glass mirrored the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind.  It was a Tuesday, the usual Tuesday, yet today felt different.  A persistent hum, almost a thrumming, vibrated through the otherwise quiet building, a sound oddly familiar and deeply unsettling.  The institute, perched atop a secluded mountain ridge overlooking the vast, star-studded expanse of the Colorado plains, normally felt profoundly isolated.  But today, that isolation felt suffocating, like a lid was about to snap shut on the universe itself. The crisp autumn air, usually invigorating, felt heavy and pregnant with unspoken things. Outside, the aspen trees, in their fiery autumnal blaze, seemed to shudder in the invisible wind.  Below, the small town of Stargazer, nestled in a valley bathed in the golden light of the late afternoon sun, appeared utterly serene.  This was her sanctuary, her domain, but within its walls, Amy felt a gnawing unease, a premonition of something utterly beyond comprehension.
