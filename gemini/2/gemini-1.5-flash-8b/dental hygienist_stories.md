The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a constant, sterile drone that seemed to amplify the quiet rustling of the plastic bibs and the faint scraping of instruments.  Rain lashed against the windows of the small, second-floor dental practice, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Anya Sharma's X-ray machine.  Anya, a dental hygienist with a precise, almost surgical, attention to detail, meticulously arranged the next patient's dental charting forms.  Her name, Anya Sharma, echoed in the practiced routine of her morning, a silent mantra in the quiet before the flood of patients.  The antiseptic smell of chlorhexidine hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the sometimes overwhelming chaos of her profession.

The setting:  A small, unassuming dental practice tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling city of New Haven, Connecticut.  Sunlight barely penetrated the slightly overcast sky, casting long shadows across the street.  Anyaâ€™s office, while functional, lacked the glamour of the extravagant practices downtown.  The worn, but meticulously clean, vinyl flooring was a testament to years of use, echoing the quiet dedication of Anya's work.  A small, potted fern struggled to thrive beside her workstation, a silent emblem of hope and resilience in the antiseptic world she inhabited.
