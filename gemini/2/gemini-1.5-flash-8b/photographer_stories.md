The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she adjusted the strap of her battered Leica.  The desolate landscape stretched before her, a panorama of ochre-hued hills that seemed to swallow the last vestiges of sunlight.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  This was the Badlands of the Arizona Territory, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where legends were born and dreams died.  Amelia, a photographer renowned for her stark, evocative images, had come seeking a story buried beneath the relentless sun and forgotten whispers.  Her mission: to capture the essence of the place that had consumed so many, to unearth the truth in the silence.  The year was 1897.
