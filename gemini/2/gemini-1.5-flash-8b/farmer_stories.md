The biting wind, a relentless hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's worn wool coat, whispering tales of frost and barrenness across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of his farm.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling the remnants of last year's harvest into the frigid air.  He hunched deeper into his weathered coat, the icy grip of the November dawn seeping into his very bones.  This was the land of Ashwood Vale, a valley carved by centuries of wind and water, now clinging to a precarious life in the face of a creeping drought.

Elias Thorne, 47 years old, was a farmer, though a farmer more accustomed to coaxing a meagre living from the earth than reaping bountiful harvests.  His fields, once a vibrant mosaic of green and gold, now whispered stories of lost hope.  The once-fertile soil was a stubborn, cracked canvas, bearing testament to the relentless grip of the drought.  Each furrow, each weed, every crevice in the dry earth, held a silent accusation of the capricious sky and the stubbornness of Mother Nature.  The farmhouse, a weathered clapboard structure clinging precariously to a rocky outcrop, seemed to shrink beneath the oppressive grey sky, its windows like vacant eyes staring blankly into the desolate landscape.
