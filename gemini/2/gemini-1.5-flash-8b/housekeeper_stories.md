The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten teaspoons, reflected Elara Blackwood's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of the sprawling, Victorian manor.  The air, thick with the scent of aged wood and something faintly floral, clung to her like a second skin.  Elara, her name whispered on the breeze like a forgotten melody, sighed, the sound lost in the echoing halls.  The grand house, known throughout the sleepy town of Ashwood as Blackwood Manor, felt as vast and oppressive as a cathedral during a thunderstorm.  It was, after all, her job to keep its suffocating beauty in check.

The setting was Blackwood Manor, a colossal, ornately-decorated Victorian house perched atop a hill overlooking the rolling green hills of Ashwood.  Ivy clawed at its stone facade, clinging to the decaying grandeur like a hungry vine.  Inside, the echoing silence, punctuated by the creak of ancient floorboards and the occasional whisper from unseen rooms, was a constant companion to Elara.  Cobwebs draped like ghostly lace over furniture and portraits depicting long-dead Blackwood ancestors.  The house held a palpable sense of history, a weight that settled on Elara's shoulders, a weight she was expected to bear, along with the heavy expectations and hushed whispers of the town.
