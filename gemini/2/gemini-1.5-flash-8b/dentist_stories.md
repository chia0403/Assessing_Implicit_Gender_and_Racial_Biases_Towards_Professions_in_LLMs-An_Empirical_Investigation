The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Evelyn Ainsworth's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her instruments.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the chipped porcelain of a dental chair, a testament to countless whispered anxieties and the occasional, explosive outburst of terror.  Evelyn, a woman of thirty-seven with eyes that held the wisdom of a seasoned observer, meticulously cleaned a cavity, the antiseptic tang of the solution filling the sterile air. Outside, the city thrummed with a cacophony of sirens and distant car horns, a constant reminder of the world beyond the walls of her practice, "Ainsworth Smiles," a name that felt both ironic and stubbornly hopeful.  The afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the waiting room, where a single magazine, open to a glossy spread of celebrity smiles, lay abandoned on a cracked vinyl chair.  This was her routine, a quiet ballet of drills and fillings, conversations and anxieties.  Today, though, something felt...off.
