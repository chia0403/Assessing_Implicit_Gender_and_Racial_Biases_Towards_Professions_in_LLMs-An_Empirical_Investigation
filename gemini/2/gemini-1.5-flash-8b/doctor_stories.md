Dr. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose sharp intellect seemed perpetually at odds with her perpetually tired eyes, stared at the skeletal remains of a once-vibrant rhododendron bush.  The overgrown garden surrounding the crumbling Victorian mansion, nestled deep within the mist-shrouded hills of Blackwood Hollow, felt like a suffocating shroud.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun filtering through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks, illuminating the decaying grandeur of the house.  A palpable stillness clung to the air, a silence broken only by the occasional rustle of unseen creatures in the undergrowth and the faint, almost imperceptible, drip, drip, drip of water seeping through a gaping hole in the roof.  The oppressive humidity was thick enough to taste, clinging to the already musty scent of decay that permeated the air.  This was not the Blackwood Hollow she'd remembered from her childhood.  Not the Blackwood Hollow she'd envisioned before accepting this seemingly simple assignment from the enigmatic Dr. Alistair Thorne.
