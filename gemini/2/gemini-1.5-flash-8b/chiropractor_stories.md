The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a symphony of muted coughs and the rhythmic click-clack of high heels on linoleum, was almost a comforting lullaby to Dr. Alistair Finch, DC.  He leaned back in his ergonomic chair, a half-eaten granola bar nestled in a crumpled napkin beside him, and watched the swirling patterns of dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun slanting through the frosted glass windows.  Outside, the bustling cityscape of Neo-Kyoto, a metropolis built on the slopes of volcanic mountains, stretched out, a tapestry of shimmering skyscrapers and emerald green rice paddies.

Alistair, a man of meticulous order and quiet intensity, found a certain solace in the predictable rhythm of his practice, “Finch Chiropractic & Wellness.”  The small, but well-maintained, clinic was situated on a quiet side street in the burgeoning Higashiyama district, known for its traditional teahouses and artisan workshops.  The aroma of freshly brewed matcha wafted from a nearby shop, a fragrant counterpoint to the lingering scent of antiseptic that clung to the air within.  He knew his patients, recognized their individual anxieties and hopes reflected in their hunched shoulders and tense jaws. Today, however, a certain restlessness, a palpable sense of unspoken unease, hung heavy in the air, even through the usual murmur of the waiting room.
