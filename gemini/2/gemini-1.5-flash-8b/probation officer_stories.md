Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.  Posters of community service opportunities, plastered haphazardly across the walls, seemed almost mocking in their cheerful optimism.  Outside, the city pulsed with a frenzied energy, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within these sterile walls.  Amy knew the city intimately, its hidden alleys and forgotten corners, the labyrinthine streets that whispered tales of broken dreams and shattered hopes.  These were the streets where she patrolled, where she tried, often failing, to navigate the treacherous currents of lives spiralling out of control.
