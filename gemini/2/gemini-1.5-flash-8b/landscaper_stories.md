Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire, squinted against the swirling snow.  His thick wool coat, though expensive and well-made, offered little protection against the raw force of the February gale.

The estate, Blackwood Manor, loomed before him, a brooding fortress of grey stone, its many windows like cold, empty eyes staring out into the storm-lashed landscape.  The estate's reputation preceded it, whispered in hushed tones by the villagers.  A place of secrets, of sorrow, and of a chilling beauty that had somehow managed to endure even the ravages of time and neglect.  Elias, despite his meticulous nature and aversion to gossip, found himself drawn into the mystery surrounding Blackwood Manor, a place that whispered tales of a family's tragic history through its very stones.  He was just a landscaper, a man whose hands knew the language of the earth, but the whispers of Blackwood Manor were tugging at something deeper within him, something that resonated with a disturbing familiarity.
