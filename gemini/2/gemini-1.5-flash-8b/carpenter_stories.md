The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks as she hammered the last nail into the weathered oak beam.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of late afternoon sun filtering through the gaps in the scaffolding surrounding the grand manor house.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faintest whisper of the sea, a constant reminder of the looming Atlantic just a few miles away.  Amelia, a carpenter known throughout the coastal village of Oakhaven for her meticulous craftsmanship and unwavering resolve, surveyed her work.  The newly constructed dormer window, a precise jewel against the crumbling facade, was now complete.  The house, a testament to a long-lost grandeur, was slowly, painstakingly, coming back to life.


Setting: The coastal village of Oakhaven, nestled amongst rolling hills and overlooking the churning Atlantic. The year is 1888. The manor house, a sprawling edifice of faded grandeur, stands as a monument to a bygone era, its once-proud facade now marred by the ravages of time and neglect.  The air is heavy with the salty tang of the sea and the earthy aroma of the surrounding woodland.  The village itself is a picture of quiet resilience, its inhabitants bound by generations of shared history and a strong-willed spirit.
