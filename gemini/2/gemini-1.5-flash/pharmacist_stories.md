The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering gas lamp above the counter, danced in the stagnant air of "The Gilded Mortar," a pharmacy as old as the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven itself.  Outside, a November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windowpanes and whispering secrets only the centuries-old building seemed to understand.  The scent of dried herbs and aged parchment hung heavy, a comforting aroma that did little to mask the underlying chill that settled deep in Elara's bones â€“ a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of Oakhaven was replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the old sign swinging above the doorway, promising remedies and solace, but offering none to the growing unease tightening in Elara's chest.
