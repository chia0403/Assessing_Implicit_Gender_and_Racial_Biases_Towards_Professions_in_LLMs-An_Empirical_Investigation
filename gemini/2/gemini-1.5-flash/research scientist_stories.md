The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song, whipping Dr. Aris Thorne’s parka around him like a frantic bird.  He hunched deeper into the collar, the icy breath frosting his beard.  Before him, the Vostok Station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the vast, white expanse of the East Antarctic plateau, looked more like a stranded spaceship than a human habitation.  The air, thin and frigid, crackled with static electricity, a constant, low hum that mirrored the persistent thrum of anxiety in Aris’s chest.  His research, years in the making, hung precariously on the next few hours, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving elements and the relentless, unseen forces buried deep beneath the ice.  The discovery, if successful, could rewrite everything he knew about the history of Earth… or it could bury him under a mountain of frozen secrets.
