The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Lockheed C-130 Hercules, rattling the fuselage like a shaken maraca.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, clung to the wings, obscuring the already limited visibility.  Below, the endless, white expanse of the Ronne Ice Shelf stretched to the horizon, a frozen ocean punctuated only by the occasional, ominous crack revealing the abyssal depths below.  Evie gripped the controls, her knuckles white against the worn leather, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the turboprops a counterpoint to the storm's furious symphony.  Her breath plumed out in ghostly white puffs, instantly freezing in the frigid air.  This wasn't just another cargo run; this was a fight for survival.
