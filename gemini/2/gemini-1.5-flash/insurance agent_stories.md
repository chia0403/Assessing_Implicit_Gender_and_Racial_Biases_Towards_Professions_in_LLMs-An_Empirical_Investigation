The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled around her small, cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window overlooking the perpetually grey harbor of Port Blossom, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Maine coastline.  Amelia, a woman whose age was as elusive as the precise shade of her auburn hair (somewhere between fiery ginger and autumn leaves), sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of the storm.  The scent of salt and damp wool hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, lingering aroma of burnt coffee – a testament to her early-morning attempt at a caffeine fix.  Her desk, a chaotic landscape of policy forms, half-eaten candy wrappers, and a slightly unnerving collection of miniature ceramic owls, was a reflection of her current state of mind: overwhelmed, but stubbornly persistent. Tonight, however, even Amelia's usual resilience felt strained.  The storm, she felt, mirrored the tempest brewing within her own life.
