The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener, battling valiantly against the underlying aroma of stale coffee and desperation.  Amelia, meticulously arranging a display of suspiciously bright-orange gummy worms, sighed.  Another slow night.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct streetlights outside, mirroring the fog that seemed to perpetually cloud her own outlook.  The only sounds besides the humming lights were the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her pen against the countertop and the occasional distant wail of a siren.  Tonight, even the usual cacophony of the highway seemed muted, swallowed by the downpour.
