The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually a comfort to Dr. Elias Thorne, felt suffocating tonight.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of his penthouse apartment, blurring the city lights of Chicago into a shimmering, indistinct tapestry.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the city’s heartbeat, usually a soothing background hum, felt intrusive, a relentless percussion against the fragile silence of his grief.  Elias, his face etched with exhaustion deeper than any surgical scar, stared out at the storm, a half-empty glass of amber liquid – the only thing he’d touched since the call – sweating in his hand. The elegant apartment, usually a haven of calm, felt like a mausoleum, every meticulously chosen piece of furniture a stark reminder of a life irrevocably altered.
