The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Thistlewick's salon, "The Snip & Stitch," could produce.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane of her tiny, cobbled-street shop in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  Amelia herself, a woman whose age was as indefinable as the precise shade of auburn in her perpetually messy bun, hummed a melancholic Czech folk tune as she meticulously sharpened her shears, the rhythmic rasp a counterpoint to the distant clang of a tram.  Outside, the city thrummed with life – the chaotic symphony of tourists, vendors hawking trinkets, and the rumble of ancient cobblestones underfoot – but inside The Snip & Stitch, a quiet, almost sacred stillness reigned, broken only by the snip-snip-snip of Amelia's shears and the hushed whispers of her clientele.
