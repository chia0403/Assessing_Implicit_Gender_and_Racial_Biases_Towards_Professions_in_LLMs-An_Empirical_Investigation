The air hung thick and humid, a miasma of garlic, ginger, and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Chef Aurelia “Rella” Blackwood, her brow slick with sweat despite the relentless whir of the industrial-strength air conditioning, surveyed the chaos of her kitchen.  This wasn’t the pristine, gleaming haven depicted in glossy culinary magazines.  Rella’s kitchen, the heart of “Spice & Smoke,” a hole-in-the-wall restaurant tucked away in the labyrinthine alleyways of Bangkok’s Chinatown, was a vibrant, slightly terrifying explosion of colour and flavour.  Woks sizzled, spatters of oil painting impromptu still lifes on the stainless steel counters, and the rhythmic clang of knives against chopping boards created a percussive soundtrack to the controlled pandemonium.  Tonight’s special, a fiery rendition of Gaeng Som Pla, was proving particularly challenging – the balance of sour, spicy, and sweet a delicate dance on the precipice of culinary disaster.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a countdown to the arrival of their first customer, a notorious food critic known for his withering gaze and even more withering reviews.
