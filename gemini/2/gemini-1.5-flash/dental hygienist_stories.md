The fluorescent lights of the Aspen Creek Dental Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the polishing tool in Seraphina "Sera"  Montgomery's hand.  The scent of peppermint and something faintly metallic – a familiar blend of antiseptic and anxiety – hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the Colorado sun blazed, turning the snow-capped peaks a brilliant, almost unreal white, a stark contrast to the sterile beige of the clinic’s interior.  Sera, her fingers nimble and precise, worked on Mr. Henderson's molars, the old man's gentle snores a comforting rhythm to her usual morning chaos.  Today, however, the usual hum of the office was punctuated by a persistent, low-level thrum of unease that Sera couldn't quite place.  It felt like the quiet before a very large storm, a storm that had nothing to do with the unpredictable Colorado weather.
