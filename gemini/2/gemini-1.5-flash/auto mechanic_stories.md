The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume in the cavernous, dimly lit garage that had been her sanctuary for the past fifteen years.  Fluorescent lights hummed a discordant chorus above, casting long shadows across the cluttered workspace where disassembled engines lay like metallic skeletons awaiting resurrection.  Tools – wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers – hung neatly organized, a testament to Amelia’s meticulous nature, a stark contrast to the chaotic landscape of parts scattered across the concrete floor.  Outside, the humid Louisiana air hung heavy, the cicadas’ drone a persistent counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Amelia's hammer as she tapped a stubborn bolt loose on a vintage Mustang’s engine block.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of the garage was overshadowed by a silence heavier than the oil-stained air.  Tonight, something felt…off.
