The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorne's cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn, grey cloak, the rough wool doing little to ward off the penetrating cold that seeped into his bones.  Xylos, once a jewel of the Sunstone Empire, was now a forgotten husk, its once-grand cities reduced to crumbling ruins, its fertile fields choked by windswept sand. Valerius stood guard at the crumbling gatehouse of what was once the opulent city of Porthaven, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape. The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional crunch of his boots on the frost-covered ground.  His hand rested lightly on the hilt of his longsword, a familiar weight offering scant comfort against the gnawing unease that settled in his gut â€“ a feeling as cold and desolate as the plains themselves.
