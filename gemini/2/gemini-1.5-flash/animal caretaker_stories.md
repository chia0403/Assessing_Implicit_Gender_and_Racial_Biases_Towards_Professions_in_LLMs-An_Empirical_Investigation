The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne’s thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  Frozen ground crunched under her worn wellies, the sound swallowed by the mournful bleating of the sheep huddled in the far corner of the paddock.  Grey light, the kind that seeped into your bones and chilled you to the marrow, clung to the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, painting the ancient stone walls of Cotswold Farm Sanctuary a somber grey-blue.  Mia, her breath misting in the frigid air, ignored the ache in her shoulders and the numb fingers clinging to the rough twine.  This wasn't just a job; it was a calling, a life woven into the rhythms of the rescued animals under her care – each bleat, each snuffle, each hesitant step a testament to her dedication.  The sanctuary, a sprawling haven nestled amongst whispering willows and murmuring streams, was her kingdom, and today, as always, she was its queen.
