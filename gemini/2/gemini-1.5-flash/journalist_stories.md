The chipped paint of the windowsill flaked onto Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s worn leather notebook, a fine dust mirroring the grit settling in her gut.  Rain lashed against the single-pane glass of her tiny, perpetually damp office, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled alley below.  The air, thick with the smells of coal smoke, roasting chestnuts, and something vaguely unsettling – perhaps decaying fish – clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a journalist for the *Manchester Chronicle*,  hunched deeper into her threadbare coat, the collar scratching at her neck, a familiar discomfort compared to the gnawing unease that had driven her to this forsaken corner of the city, to this dimly lit, almost forgotten office above a butcher shop,  where she was about to begin the investigation that could make her career… or break it.
