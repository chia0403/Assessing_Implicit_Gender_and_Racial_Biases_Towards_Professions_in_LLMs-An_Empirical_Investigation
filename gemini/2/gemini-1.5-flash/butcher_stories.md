The air hung thick and cloying, a miasma of blood and sawdust and the faintly sweet, almost sickening scent of rendered fat.  A single bare bulb, swinging precariously from the high, beamed ceiling of Bartholomew "Barty" Croft's butcher shop, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flitting dust motes.  Barty himself, a man whose hands were as gnarled and seasoned as the oak chopping block before him, stood hunched over a side of beef, his cleaver a blur of polished steel.  The shop, "Croft's Cuts," was a relic of a bygone era, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight heart of Grimsborough, a town clinging stubbornly to its Victorian past despite the encroaching sprawl of modernity just beyond its ancient, crumbling walls.  The only sounds were the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of his cleaver, the occasional squeak of a floorboard, and the distant, mournful wail of a foghorn, a constant reminder of the unforgiving sea that clawed at the edges of Grimsborough.
