The scent of lilies, heavy and intoxicating, hung in the air like a humid shroud.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of "Petals & Promises," blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, amongst the riot of colour – the defiant crimson of roses, the shy blush of peonies, the deep, velvety purples of irises –  Amelia Katherine Hawthorne, owner and sole florist, carefully snipped the stem of a particularly stubborn calla lily.  Her brow, usually relaxed and pleasant, was furrowed in concentration, a stray strand of auburn hair escaping the neat bun at the nape of her neck.  The shop, nestled on the quieter, less fashionable side of  Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was a haven of warmth and fragrant chaos, a stark contrast to the relentless November downpour hammering against its ancient brick façade.
