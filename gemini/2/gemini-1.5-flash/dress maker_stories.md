The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the warped windowpanes of  Number 7, Thistle Lane.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the erratic beat of Aurelia Clementine Finch's heart.  Aurelia, a woman whose nimble fingers could coax breathtaking gowns from the most unyielding fabrics, sat hunched over her workbench, a half-finished ballgown of shimmering emerald silk draped across her lap.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows that danced with the shimmering threads, turning the small, cluttered workshop into a stage for her solitary performance.  Outside, the cobblestones of Thistle Lane gleamed slickly under the downpour, reflecting the hazy gaslight in a kaleidoscope of shimmering puddles.  Tonight, however, the usual charm of her quiet corner of Victorian London felt oppressive, a suffocating weight pressing down on Aurelia's already burdened soul.  The emerald silk, usually a source of joy, felt like a mocking reminder of a promise she wasn't sure she could keep.
