The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as gumbo, clinging to Elias Thorne's sweat-soaked shirt.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening symphony from the cypress trees lining the bayou, their chirps a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of Elias’s own heartbeat, a frantic tattoo against his ribs.  The air smelled of mud, decaying vegetation, and something faintly metallic – a scent that, to Elias, spoke of frayed wires and impending danger. He wiped a hand across his brow, leaving a grimy streak on his already dust-coated face.  The rickety wooden planks beneath his feet groaned a protest as he navigated the makeshift walkway leading to the dilapidated shack, the only structure for miles along this stretch of the Atchafalaya Basin.  His worn leather work boots crunched on broken glass and scattered debris, a testament to the storm that had ravaged the area just a week before.  This wasn't just any electrical job; this was a lifeline.
