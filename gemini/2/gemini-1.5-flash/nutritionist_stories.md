The air hung heavy with the unspoken weight of the confidential file sitting unopened on her mahogany desk, its crisp white surface a stark contrast to the storm raging both outside and within.  Eleanor, a nutritionist renowned for her holistic approach and unflappable demeanor, felt a tremor of fear she hadn't experienced since her residency.  This wasn't just another challenging client; this feltâ€¦ different.
