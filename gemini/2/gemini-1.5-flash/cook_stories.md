The only light came from the gas ovens casting an orange glow on his flour-dusted apron, highlighting the worry lines etched deep around his usually jovial eyes. Tonight, however, the usual satisfaction he found in his work was absent, replaced by a knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach, heavier than any lobster he'd ever prepared.
