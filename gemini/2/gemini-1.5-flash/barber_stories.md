The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne's Traditional Barbershop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, weak bulb dangling precariously above the chipped porcelain sink, danced in the afternoon gloom.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a Seattle November hammered against the grimy windowpanes, a soundtrack to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elias's shears.  His worn leather barber's chair creaked a mournful protest with each slight shift of his client, a grizzled fisherman with a beard as tangled as a ship's rigging.  The shop itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street, felt like a relic from a bygone era, a small island of quiet competence in the churning tide of modern Seattle.
