The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather as her own heartbeat.  Rain lashed against the large, slightly crooked window of “Sera’s Nail Nook,” a tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  The gaslight flickering outside cast a warm, amber glow on the chipped porcelain sink and the faded floral wallpaper, creating a cozy contrast to the tempest raging outside.  Sera, humming a melancholic blues tune under her breath, carefully buffed a client's nails, the rhythmic rasp a soothing counterpoint to the drumming rain.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of her work felt punctuated by a nervous energy that thrummed beneath the surface, a feeling as unsettling as the storm brewing outside.
