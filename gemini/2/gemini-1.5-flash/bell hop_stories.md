Barty, a bellhop whose uniform was as rumpled as his usually cheerful demeanor, sighed, the sound swallowed by the plush, heavy carpets that muffled every sound except the faint, rhythmic *clink* of ice in the hotel bar's glasses. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic lobby, a relentless percussion accompanying the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  The air, thick with the scents of pipe tobacco, expensive perfume, and something vaguely unsettling – perhaps damp wool and impending doom – clung to the opulent but decaying grandeur of the hotel, a once-proud titan now slipping slowly into a state of faded glory.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet melancholy of the late hour was punctuated by a nervous energy, a palpable tension that prickled Barty's skin even more than the persistent damp chill.
