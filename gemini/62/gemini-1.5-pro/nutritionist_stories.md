The insistent London drizzle seemed determined to seep into the very bones of Dr. Elias Thorne, Registered Dietitian. He hurried along the slick cobblestones of Shad Thames, clutching his battered briefcase tighter against his chest.  The aroma of roasting coffee beans from a nearby warehouse warred with the pungent scent of the Thames at low tide. Elias tugged the collar of his tweed jacket higher, casting a wary eye at the looming shadows cast by the converted warehouses that lined the street. His destination, number 17, was sandwiched between a trendy riverside pub and a suspiciously quiet antique shop. Its darkened windows and peeling paint gave the impression of secrets held tightly within, a fitting description for the clientele Elias was about to face â€“ the enigmatic members of the exclusive and notoriously secretive Gastronome Society.
