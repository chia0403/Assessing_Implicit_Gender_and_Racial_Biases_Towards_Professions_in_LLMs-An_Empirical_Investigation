The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Ashworth Manor, whistling a mournful tune that echoed the hollowness in Elsie Mae Cartwright’s heart.  A thick, swirling fog had rolled in from the sea, clinging to the jagged cliffs and shrouding the sprawling, gothic mansion in a spectral embrace. Elsie Mae, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick woolen gloves, tugged her shawl tighter and surveyed the grounds from the kitchen window.  Ashworth Manor, perched precariously on the Cornish coast, was a beast of a house, all dark stone and shadowed turrets, its grandeur faded and tarnished like an old silver locket.  It had been her domain, her prison, for the past five years, ever since she'd arrived with nothing but a battered suitcase and the weight of a secret nestled deep within.  Today, however, something felt different. The air crackled with an unfamiliar energy, a tension that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck.  It was as if the manor itself was holding its breath, waiting for something… or someone.
