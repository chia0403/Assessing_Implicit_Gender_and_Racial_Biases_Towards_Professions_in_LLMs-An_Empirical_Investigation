The insistent buzz of the intercom, a shrill B flat that gnawed at Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s nerves, punctuated the otherwise tranquil stillness of the Hawthorne and Hemlock Funeral Home.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slanting through the stained-glass window depicting a particularly mournful-looking dove. Amelia, perched on her high-backed stool behind the polished mahogany reception desk, sighed.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the kind of day where the air hung heavy with the scent of decaying leaves and impending rain, a fitting atmosphere, she supposed, for her place of employment.  Hawthorne and Hemlock wasn’t just any funeral home; it was the oldest, and arguably the most prestigious, in the quaint, fog-wreathed town of Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the misty valleys of the Appalachian Mountains.
