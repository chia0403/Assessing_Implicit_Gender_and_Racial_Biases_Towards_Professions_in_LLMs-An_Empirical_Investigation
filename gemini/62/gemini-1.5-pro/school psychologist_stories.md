The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the quad of Ashwood Preparatory Academy.  Dead leaves, the color of burnt caramel, swirled around his ankles. Grey stone buildings, gothic and imposing, loomed over him, their leaded windows reflecting a sky the colour of a bruise. Ashwood, nestled in the forested hills of Vermont, was a place of privilege and hushed secrets, a place where old money whispered through the halls like a phantom draft. Elias, with his worn tweed jacket and perpetually rumpled appearance, felt perpetually out of place amidst the polished veneer.  He clutched a file folder against his chest, the name "Clementine Bellweather" typed neatly on the label.  It was Clementine's recent, disturbing artwork that had summoned him to Ashwood on this particularly bleak afternoon, and a knot of unease tightened in his stomach. He’d dealt with troubled teens before, of course, but something about this case felt… different.  Colder.
