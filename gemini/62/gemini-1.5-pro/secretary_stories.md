The insistent clatter of the typewriter keys was the only sound in the otherwise silent office of Grimshaw & Sons Importers, save for the occasional sigh escaping the lips of Miss  Eloise Periwinkle.  It was a Tuesday in late November, 1957, and a damp chill permeated the air, clinging to the heavy velvet drapes that framed the window overlooking the bustling London street below.  Fog, thick as pea soup, swirled around the lampposts, casting an eerie orange glow into the room. Eloise shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her.  The gas fire in the corner sputtered feebly, offering little warmth against the encroaching cold.  Grimshaw & Sons, purveyors of fine teas and exotic spices, occupied a somewhat dilapidated building on a side street just off the Strand.  The faded grandeur of the high ceilings and mahogany paneling hinted at a more prosperous past, a past that now seemed as distant and shrouded in mist as the city outside.
