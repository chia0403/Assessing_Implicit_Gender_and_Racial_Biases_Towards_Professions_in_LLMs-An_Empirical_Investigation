The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Reyesâ€™s charcoal-smudged fingers, tugging at the edges of her oversized canvas.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, she ignored the biting chill that seeped through her worn wool coat.  Below her, the tiny fishing village of Port Blossom, Newfoundland, clung to the rocky coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  Its brightly painted houses, usually cheerful beacons against the somber landscape, were muted today beneath a brooding, iron-grey sky. Amelia squinted, her dark eyes tracing the jagged silhouette of the cliffs against the horizon, searching for the precise line where the granite met the churning foam.  This was her canvas today, not the stretched linen before her, but the raw, untamed beauty of the Newfoundland coast.  It was a landscape that echoed the tempestuous emotions swirling within her, a landscape that both challenged and inspired her art.
