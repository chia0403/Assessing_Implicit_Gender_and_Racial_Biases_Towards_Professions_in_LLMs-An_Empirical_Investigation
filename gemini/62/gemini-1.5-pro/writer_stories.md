Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the staccato tapping of Elias Thorne's fingers on the worn keys of his typewriter. The single bare bulb hanging from the rafters cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped space, illuminating dust motes swirling in the air like miniature galaxies.  Elias, huddled in a threadbare armchair beneath the eaves of his grandmother's Victorian house in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, shivered despite the thick wool blanket draped over his shoulders. The scent of salt and decaying leaves drifted in through the gaps in the window frame, a pungent reminder of the autumnal storm raging outside.  He stared at the half-finished manuscript in the typewriter carriage, the words blurring through the film of exhaustion that clung to him like cobwebs.  "The Raven's Lament," he muttered, the title tasting like ash in his mouth.  It was supposed to be his magnum opus, the gothic thriller that would finally catapult him from obscurity, but after months of relentless work, the story felt as cold and lifeless as the November wind howling outside.
