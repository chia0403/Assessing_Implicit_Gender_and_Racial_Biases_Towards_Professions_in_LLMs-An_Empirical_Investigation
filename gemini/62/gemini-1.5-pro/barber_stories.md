The biting wind whipped down Bleecker Street, swirling gritty snow against the warm, inviting glow of Figaro's Fine Cuts.  Inside, amidst the comforting aroma of bay rum and talcum powder, Elias Thorne meticulously honed his straight razor.  The late afternoon sun, already sinking behind the brownstones across the street, cast long shadows across the checkered tile floor.  Figaro's was a relic of a bygone era, a small, wood-paneled sanctuary in the heart of Greenwich Village, stubbornly resisting the encroachment of trendy salons and hipster barbershops.  Elias, with his neatly trimmed grey mustache, crisp white shirt, and black waistcoat, was just as much a part of the shop's old-world charm as the antique barber chairs and the faded boxing posters on the wall.  He adjusted the brass lamp above his workstation, its light glinting off the polished steel of his razor, and waited for his next customer, the rhythmic scrape of the strop a steady pulse in the quiet shop.
