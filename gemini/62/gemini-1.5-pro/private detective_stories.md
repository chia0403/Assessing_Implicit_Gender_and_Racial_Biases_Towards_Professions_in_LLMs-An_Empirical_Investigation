Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, mirroring the turbulent state of his own life.  Neon signs from the street below painted flickering streaks of lurid colour across the worn mahogany desk, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air. Silas Corvus Finch, Private Investigator, sat hunched in his threadbare armchair, the springs groaning beneath his considerable weight. His office, perched above a twenty-four-hour laundromat in the less salubrious end of Los Angeles’ Koreatown, offered a panoramic view of urban decay – overflowing bins, graffiti-tagged walls, and the perpetual hum of distant traffic. The aroma of stale coffee and cheap cigarettes clung to the air like a persistent ex-lover, a scent Silas had long ceased to notice. It was a Wednesday night, or possibly Thursday morning; Silas had lost track somewhere between the third lukewarm cup of coffee and the fifth unanswered phone call. The only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic thump of the washing machines below, a relentless pulse that mirrored the anxiety gnawing at his gut.  He knew, with a certainty that settled heavy in his bones, that tonight was going to be different.
