The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, the cries of street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present scent of coal smoke formed the familiar symphony of Elias Finch's mornings. His small tailoring shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually dusty bookshop on Bellweather Lane, was a haven of quiet precision in the heart of the chaotic, ever-churning city of New Birmingham.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, illuminated swirling dust motes that danced around the worn wooden mannequins draped in half-finished garments. Elias, a man of compact build with meticulous silver hair and eyes the precise blue of a cornflower, meticulously threaded a needle, his brow furrowed in concentration as he worked on the intricate embroidery of a nobleman's waistcoat. The gas lamps, though unlit in the day, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered workspace, a constant reminder of the long hours Elias often poured into his craft. The year was 1888, and the world, at least Elias's corner of it, seemed on the cusp of some great, undefined change.
