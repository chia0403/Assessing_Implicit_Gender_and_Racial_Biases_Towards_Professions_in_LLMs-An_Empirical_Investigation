The biting wind whipped off the Aegean Sea, tugging at Isabella "Izzy" Costas's brightly patterned scarf and plastering stray strands of her dark hair across her face.  Below her, the whitewashed village of Oia, Santorini, clung to the caldera's rim like a flock of startled doves.  The sun, a molten orb sinking towards the horizon, painted the sky in fiery hues of orange and violet, reflecting in the sapphire-blue domes that dotted the hillside. Izzy adjusted her microphone, a familiar buzz of anticipation thrumming through her. Twenty eager faces, a mix of nationalities and ages, looked up at her expectantly, cameras poised to capture the famed Santorini sunset.  This was Izzy's favourite part of the day, the moment when the breathtaking beauty of the island stole the breath from even the most jaded traveller. Tonight, however, a different kind of anticipation prickled at the edges of her awareness. Something feltâ€¦off. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a silent hum that resonated deep within the ancient volcanic rock.
