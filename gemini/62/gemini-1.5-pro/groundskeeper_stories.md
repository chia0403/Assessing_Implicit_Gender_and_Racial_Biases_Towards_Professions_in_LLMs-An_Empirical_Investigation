The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his tweed cap and sending brittle oak leaves skittering across the manicured lawns of Athelney Manor. Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots, a familiar symphony accompanying the dawn chorus of unseen birds. Athelney, nestled deep within the Somerset countryside, was a place of ancient quiet, its sprawling grounds a tapestry of emerald lawns, gnarled topiary, and a whispering wood that bordered the silver ribbon of the River Parrett.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the last twenty years, knew every inch of the estate, every dip and swell of the land, every secret the whispering wood kept close. This morning, however, a different kind of secret lay waiting for him, not amidst the rustling leaves or beneath the ancient oaks, but in the formal rose garden, where the first blush of sunrise revealed something far more unsettling than a late frost.
