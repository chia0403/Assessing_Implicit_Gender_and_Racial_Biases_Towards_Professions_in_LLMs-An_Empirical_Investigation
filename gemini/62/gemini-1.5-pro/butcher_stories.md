The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and something faintly metallic that clung to the cobblestones of Grimsby.  It was a smell Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne's Fine Meats, knew intimately.  It was the smell of his trade, the smell that permeated his thick wool coat, his leather apron, even, he suspected, his very pores.

A frost had settled on the windowpanes, obscuring the view of the deserted marketplace beyond, but inside, the air was thick with the warmth of the coal stove and the rhythmic thud of Elias's cleaver against the heavy wooden chopping block.  Today was market day, and Elias, a man built like an oak barrel with hands like seasoned hams, had a mountain of work ahead of him.
