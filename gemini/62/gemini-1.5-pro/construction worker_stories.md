The pre-dawn chill bit through Elias Vance's worn Carhartt jacket as he watched the sodium lights paint the skeletal frame of the new high-rise a sickly yellow.  Dust devils danced across the concrete slab that would eventually become the ground floor, whipped up by a biting wind that swept down from the Allegheny Mountains and funneled through the half-built shell. Pittsburgh in November was never pretty, but up here, twenty stories above the still-sleeping city, it felt positively hostile. Elias stamped his boots, a well-worn pair of steel-toed Red Wings, against the concrete, the sound echoing through the empty structure.  He tugged his hardhat lower, the brim brushing against the knit cap pulled tight over his ears, and squinted at the cityscape slowly emerging from the darkness.  Another day, another floor to pour. Another step closer to finishing this behemoth and moving on to the next.  He just hoped this one didn't try to kill him before he got there.
