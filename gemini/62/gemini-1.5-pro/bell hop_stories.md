The brass-plated spittoon in the corner of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby gleamed, reflecting the flickering gaslight like a malevolent eye.  Dust motes danced in the weak illumination, swirling around Silas Finch, whose name tag, pinned precariously to his worn maroon uniform, announced his lowly position: Bell Hop. Silas, barely seventeen with a shock of unruly ginger hair that perpetually threatened to escape his cap, sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous silence. It was well past midnight in the drowsy seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The usually bustling lobby, a cacophony of chattering guests and the clatter of luggage just hours before, was now deserted, save for Silas and the ever-present scent of stale cigar smoke. Outside, the fog rolled in thick and heavy from the Atlantic, muffling the distant clang of a buoy and wrapping the Grand Majestic in a damp, ghostly embrace.  Tonight, it felt less grand and more like a mausoleum.
