The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, puffed out into the pre-dawn chill. November in the small town of Aisling, Vermont, was a symphony of crisp air, the rustle of dying leaves, and the ever-present scent of woodsmoke.  The library, a squat, stone building nestled amongst towering pines at the edge of town, was still dark, its mullioned windows reflecting the bruised hues of the approaching sunrise. Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat and a hand-knitted scarf the color of burnt umber, fumbled with the heavy iron key, its teeth biting into the aged lock with a satisfying *clunk*. He pushed the heavy oak door inward, the hinges groaning a mournful welcome.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old paper and leather, a comforting aroma that Elias had come to associate with sanctuary.  This morning, however, a faint undercurrent of something metallic, something almostâ€¦ *wrong*, prickled his senses.
