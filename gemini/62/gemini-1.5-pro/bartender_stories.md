The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a sound that usually soothed Elias Thorne. Tonight, however, it felt like an angry fist pounding on his already frayed nerves.  The air inside the bar, thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation, hung heavy and stagnant.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn, red vinyl booths and the scarred mahogany bar.  Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead by the humidity, wiped down the sticky surface with a practiced hand, his gaze fixed on the swirling patterns the rain made in the puddles gathering outside the cracked window.  The Rusty Mug sat hunched on the edge of Highway 17, a lonely sentinel against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Mojave Desert, and tonight, like most nights, it was Elias's sole domain.
