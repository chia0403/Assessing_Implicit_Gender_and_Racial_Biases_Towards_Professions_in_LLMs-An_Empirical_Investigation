The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, carrying the scent of pine and the low rumble of distant thunder.  Jasper "Jax" Blackwood, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka that swallowed his lean frame, squinted at the bruised sky.  Rain threatened, and not the gentle kind.  He adjusted his hard hat, the plastic cold against his forehead, and spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dry ditch.  Around him, the Arizona landscape unfolded in a tapestry of rust-colored mesas and scrub brush, punctuated by the stark black asphalt ribbon he was tasked with repairing.  A pothole, the size of a small dog, gaped open in lane two, a testament to the unforgiving desert climate and the constant pounding of eighteen-wheelers.  Jax sighed, the plume of his breath momentarily obscuring his view of the flashing arrow signs warning approaching traffic of his presence.  This was his life: patching up the broken pieces of a road that stretched endlessly towards a horizon he rarely had time to admire.
