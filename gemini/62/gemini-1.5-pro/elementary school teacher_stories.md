The chipped paint on the windowsill of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom vibrated with the low hum of the school bus idling outside.  St. Michael’s Elementary, a squat brick building nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley, was slowly waking up.  The October air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke from nearby farms, seeped in through the cracked pane, raising goosebumps on Eleanor’s arms.  Sunlight, still pale and watery, slanted across the rows of empty desks, illuminating the glitter-dusted construction paper pumpkins adorning the bulletin board. It was 7:15 am, a full forty-five minutes before the chaos of second graders would descend, and Eleanor cherished this quiet prelude to the day. The only sounds were the distant rumble of the bus and the gentle scratching of her pencil as she finalized her lesson plan on the life cycle of a butterfly.
