The biting pre-dawn chill gnawed at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's exposed cheeks as he stoked the sputtering fire in his wood stove.  Smoke, thick and pine-scented, curled towards the low ceiling of his cabin, escaping through cracks in the chinking.  Outside, nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains of Washington State, the towering Douglas firs stood like silent sentinels, their branches heavy with a fresh dusting of snow.  Winter had arrived early in the Skagit River Valley this year, promising a harsh season for Jed and the other loggers who braved the elements to wrest their living from the ancient forest.  The rhythmic clinking of Jed's axe sharpening against the whetstone echoed through the stillness, a familiar prelude to the day's hard labor.  The forest, usually alive with the chatter of birds and the rustling of squirrels, was eerily quiet, blanketed by a thick layer of snow that muffled every sound.  This stillness, however, didn't bring peace to Jed, but a sense of foreboding, a feeling like the mountains themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something to happen.
