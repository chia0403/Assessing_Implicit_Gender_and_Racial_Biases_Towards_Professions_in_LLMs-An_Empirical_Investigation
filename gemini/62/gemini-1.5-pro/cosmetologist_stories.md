The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" buzzed erratically, casting a purplish glow across the rain-slicked streets of Zenith, Pennsylvania. Inside, amidst the scent of hairspray and the hum of dryers,  Elara Juniper Bellweather meticulously cleaned her workstation.  It was a Tuesday night, usually slow, but tonight a strange stillness hung in the air, thicker than the usual post-workday lull. Elara, with her vibrant turquoise hair pulled back in a neat bun, felt a prickle of unease she couldn't quite place. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the large plate-glass window showcasing a mannequin with an impossibly perfect perm.  Zenith, a town usually content in its quiet rust-belt slumber, felt different tonight, charged with a restless energy that mirrored the storm brewing outside.  Something was about to happen.
