The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes, stinging her cheeks even through the layers of fleece she wore under her Carhartt jacket.  Crystallized frost crunched under her steel-toed boots as she trudged across the frozen gravel of the Peterson Salvage Yard.  Towering stacks of rusted metal loomed over her, casting long, skeletal shadows in the late afternoon sun.  Above, a raven croaked a mournful greeting from its perch atop a crushed Cadillac, as if lamenting the fate of the metal graveyard below.  Amy, however, had little time for sentimentality. She was here to fix the faulty wiring that had plunged the yardâ€™s floodlights into darkness, a task made considerably more unpleasant by the plummeting temperature and the unsettling quiet of the place.  The only sound aside from the raven and the wind was the jingle of her tool belt as she approached the main electrical box, a dented metal monstrosity bolted to a decaying wooden post.
