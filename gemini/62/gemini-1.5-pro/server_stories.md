The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Busy Bee Diner, a sound that usually soothed Elara Juniper Bellweather. Tonight, however, it only amplified the gnawing anxiety in her stomach.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the red vinyl booths and checkered linoleum floor.  The scent of stale coffee and frying onions hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the crisp petrichor that promised relief from the summer humidity outside. Elara, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp turquoise uniform, nervously wiped down the already spotless counter, her eyes darting to the clock above the pie display.  11:57 pm. Three minutes until closing, and only one customer remained, hunched over a bowl of chili in the furthest booth, a fedora pulled low over his eyes.  The bell above the door chimed, a discordant clang in the near-empty diner, and Elara's hand instinctively flew to the order pad tucked into her apron pocket.
