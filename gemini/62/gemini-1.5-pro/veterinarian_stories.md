The biting wind whipped snow against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's veterinary clinic, rattling the panes in their frames. The "Happy Tails Animal Clinic" sign, usually a cheerful beacon in the small town of Cedarwood, Vermont, was barely visible through the swirling blizzard. Inside, the waiting room, typically abuzz with the chirps of anxious puppies and the comforting murmurs of their owners, was eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional crackle of the fire in the hearth broke the silence. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, stared out the window, a frown creasing her brow. This was the worst blizzard Cedarwood had seen in a decade, and she worried about the animals out in the cold, both wild and domestic.  The sudden, sharp ring of the telephone startled her, jolting her back to the present.  A frantic voice on the other end spoke of a stranded horse out on Old Man Hemlock's farm, and Eleanor knew, despite the perilous conditions, she couldn't refuse.
