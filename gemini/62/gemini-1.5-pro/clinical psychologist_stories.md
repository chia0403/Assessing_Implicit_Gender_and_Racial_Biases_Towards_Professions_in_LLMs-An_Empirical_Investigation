The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her newest patient.  Her office, nestled in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the historic district of Ashwood, Massachusetts, usually offered a sense of calming serenity. Tonight, however, the flickering gaslight sconces seemed only to amplify the shadows that danced in the corners, reflecting the unease radiating from the man sitting across from her. He nervously twisted a silver signet ring, the only ornamentation on his otherwise impeccably tailored charcoal suit. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful cry that seemed to echo the unspoken anxieties hanging heavy in the air. Ashwood, usually a picture of New England charm, felt cloaked in a palpable sense of foreboding.
