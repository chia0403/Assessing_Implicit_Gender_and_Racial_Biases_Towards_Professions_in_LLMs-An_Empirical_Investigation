Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the click-clack of his adding machine. The air in the small, cluttered room, nestled above Mrs. Miggins' bakery in the perpetually damp town of Hollow Creek, smelled of vanilla, yeast, and the faint metallic tang of old ink. Barty, a man of precise habits and even more precise partings in his thinning brown hair, hunched over a ledger, his brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the sign that proclaimed "Finch & Sons Bookkeeping - Est. 1888" – a somewhat grandiose title considering Barty was the sole remaining Finch, and the "Est. 1888" referred more to a hopeful aspiration than an actual founding date.  Hollow Creek itself wasn’t much to look at, a collection of grey stone buildings huddled around a perpetually overcast market square, but it was Barty's home, and within its predictable rhythm, he found a certain, if somewhat damp, comfort.  This, however, was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were usually quiet. The insistent rapping at his door, therefore, was most unusual.
