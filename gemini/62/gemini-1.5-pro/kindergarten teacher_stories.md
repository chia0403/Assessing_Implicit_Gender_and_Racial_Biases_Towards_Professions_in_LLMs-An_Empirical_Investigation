The damp chill of a Seattle November morning clung to Miss Eleanor Vance like a damp wool coat. Tiny droplets of rain, too fine to be called a drizzle, kissed her cheeks as she unlocked the bright yellow door of Room 2, the kindergarten classroom at Evergreen Elementary.  Inside, the air smelled faintly of finger paint and the sweet, almost cloying scent of the class pet hamster, Mr. Nibbles.  Sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to pierce the overcast sky, casting long shadows from the paper cut-out leaves Eleanor had painstakingly taped to the windows.

The room, usually a whirlwind of vibrant chaos, was still and quiet, awaiting the arrival of its twenty tiny tornadoes.
