The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and carrying with it the scent of brine and distant coal smoke.  Greystone, a small fishing village perched precariously on the Yorkshire cliffs, was a place of stark beauty and quiet desperation.  The colourful cottages huddled together as if for warmth against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the ocean, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Inside his cramped surgery, heated by a sputtering coal fire, Elias stared out at the churning grey waves.  The fishing boats were still out, tiny specks swallowed by the gloom, and a knot of worry tightened in his chest. He knew the sea.  He respected its power, but he also feared its capricious nature, a nature that had claimed more than its fair share of Greystone's sons and fathers.
