This was the third antique she'd salvaged for the renovation of the historic Van Derlyn mansion, a project that could either make or break her fledgling interior design business.  The mansion, a crumbling testament to Hudson's gilded age, loomed over her, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out onto the turbulent river.
