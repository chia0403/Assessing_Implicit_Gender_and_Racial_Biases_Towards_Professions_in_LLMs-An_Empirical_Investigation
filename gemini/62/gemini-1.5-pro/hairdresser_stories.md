The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed a tired, blueish light onto the rain-slicked streets of Harmony Creek.  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her name stitched in elegant cursive on her crisp white smock, sighed and glanced at the clock.  10:47 pm. Another late night at the salon, the scent of hairspray hanging heavy in the air like a forgotten promise. Harmony Creek, population 2,486 (give or take a few tumbleweeds), wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, but Amelia, with her deft touch and an uncanny ability to coax even the most stubborn cowlicks into submission, had carved out a loyal clientele. Tonight, however, her only companion was the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large picture window, and the insistent hum of the aging hairdryer she was using to clean up stray clippings. Outside, the only movement was the swaying of the lone streetlight, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to stretch and yawn like restless spirits.
