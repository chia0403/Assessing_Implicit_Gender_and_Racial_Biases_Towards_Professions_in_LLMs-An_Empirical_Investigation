The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Moreau's parka, stinging her cheeks despite the layers of fleece.  Glacier-carved peaks, shrouded in swirling snow, loomed over the small, frozen airstrip.  Broken Tooth, Alaska, population 148 (not counting the huskies), wasn't much to look at.  A handful of weather-beaten cabins huddled together against the elements, a general store doubling as a post office, and Sally's Saloon, its neon sign flickering weakly against the perpetual twilight.  Ace, her breath clouding the frosty air, adjusted her fur-lined aviator cap and surveyed her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, its skis nestled securely in the packed snow.  This was her life â€“ flying supplies and the occasional eccentric passenger into the remote corners of the Alaskan wilderness.  Today's cargo was less glamorous than usual: twenty sacks of potatoes, a crate of live chickens, and a mysterious package addressed simply to "The Old Man of the Mountain."
