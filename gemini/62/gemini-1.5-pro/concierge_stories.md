Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, mirroring the storm brewing inside Beatrice “Bea” Aurelia Cartwright.  The lobby, usually a symphony of hushed voices and the tinkling of crystal chandeliers, was tonight a cacophony of disgruntled guests. A delayed flight from Milan had landed a flock of fashionably furious Italians in Bea’s domain, all demanding suites with views of the nonexistent ocean and clamoring for linguine at 2:00 a.m.  The Grand Majestic, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic in the remote Irish coastal town of Ballynahown, was rarely this chaotic.  Bea, normally unflappable in her impeccably tailored midnight blue uniform, felt a flicker of panic.  This was only her second week as head concierge, and already she was starting to understand why her predecessor, a man known only as “Murdock,” had mysteriously disappeared three days into the annual herring festival.
