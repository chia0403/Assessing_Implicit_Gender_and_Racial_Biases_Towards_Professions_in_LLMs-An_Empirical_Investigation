The recycled air hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's life.  Fluorescent lights glinted off the polished galley as she prepped the beverage cart, the pre-takeoff ritual a familiar ballet of juice cartons, miniature liquor bottles, and plastic cups. Outside, the Los Angeles International Airport tarmac shimmered under the brutal July sun, heat waves rippling off the asphalt like water. Flight 427 to Honolulu was delayed, a mechanical issue they said, though Mia suspected it was more likely air traffic control.  The passengers, a mix of honeymooners buzzing with anticipation and families wilting in their vacation attire, were growing increasingly restless in the cramped cabin of the aging Boeing 757. Mia plastered on her best customer service smile, a skill honed over five years of dealing with everything from crying babies to demanding CEOs. Little did she know, the delay wasn't just an inconvenience; it was the prelude to a journey far more turbulent than any she'd encountered at 30,000 feet.
