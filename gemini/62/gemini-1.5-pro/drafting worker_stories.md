The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kingston & Sons Drafting office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes' Tuesday morning.  The air, thick with the scent of blueprint ink and stale coffee, hung heavy in the room. Outside, the late April rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked windows, blurring the view of the Chicago skyline into a hazy watercolour. Amelia, hunched over her drafting table, meticulously rendered the cross-section of a suspension bridge, the fine nib of her Rapidograph pen scratching delicately against the vellum.  She was dressed in her usual work attire: a practical, charcoal-grey pantsuit, sensible flats, and a crisp white blouse â€“ a stark contrast to the chaos of lines and angles that littered her workspace.  This was her world: a world of precise measurements, exacting details, and the silent satisfaction of bringing grand designs to life, one painstaking line at a time. Today, however, a different kind of blueprint was about to be unfurled before her, one that promised to shake the foundations of her carefully ordered existence.
