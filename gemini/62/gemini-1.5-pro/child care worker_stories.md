The fluorescent lights of the Little Wonders Daycare hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the rhythmic thwack of a ceiling fan’s lazy rotation.  Eleanor Vance, her sunflower-yellow cardigan slightly askew, knelt amidst a swirling vortex of brightly coloured building blocks.  The air, thick with the mingled scents of crayon wax, playdough, and the faint, lingering aroma of naptime apple juice, vibrated with the chaotic energy of two dozen toddlers. Outside, a blustery November wind rattled the large bay windows overlooking Mrs. Peabody’s prize-winning rose garden, its once vibrant blooms now withered and brown. Inside, however, spring reigned eternal, plastered across the walls in cheerful murals of anthropomorphic animals and rainbow-arched landscapes.  This was Eleanor’s kingdom, a realm of glitter glue, finger-painted masterpieces, and the constant, demanding chorus of small voices. Today, however, a different kind of energy pulsed beneath the usual cheerful chaos, an unsettling hum that prickled Eleanor’s skin and made the hairs on her arms stand on end.
