The fluorescent lights of the Kivlighan & Associates law offices hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes had become tragically accustomed to.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the twenty-second-story windows and spitting pellets of sleet against the glass.  Amelia, huddled in a worn cardigan despite the blast of the office's overzealous heating system, squinted at the dense contract on her monitor.

The city lights glittered below, a cold, indifferent constellation mirroring the tiny, flickering hope in Amelia’s own weary eyes.  Another Tuesday.  Another mountain of paperwork.  Another gnawing feeling that her life was slowly, inexorably, turning into a genetically modified petunia itself.
