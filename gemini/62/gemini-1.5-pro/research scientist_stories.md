The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging any exposed skin and rattling the metal scaffolding of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  The sun, a pale ghost in the perpetually twilight sky, offered no warmth.  February, technically summer in this desolate land, felt little different from the deep freeze of July. Aris, her breath clouding the air in front of her visor, adjusted the dials on the neutrino detector, its massive bulk a stark contrast to the pristine white expanse surrounding it.  IceCube, they called it â€“ a cubic kilometer of glacial ice instrumented with thousands of optical sensors, designed to catch the faintest whispers from the cosmos.  For five years, Aris had poured her life into this project, chasing a signal, a particle, a flicker of something *beyond*. Something that could rewrite everything humanity knew about the universe. And tonight, she had a feeling, tonight was the night.
