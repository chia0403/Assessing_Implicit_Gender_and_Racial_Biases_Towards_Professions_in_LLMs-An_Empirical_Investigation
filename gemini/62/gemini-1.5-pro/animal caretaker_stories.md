The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Yorkshire Moors, stinging Amelia "Amy" Shepherd's cheeks as she trudged towards the Raptor Rehabilitation Centre.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the sky, mirroring the steel-grey enclosures that housed the Centre's feathered residents.  Rusting chain-link fences, reinforced with thick wire mesh, stretched across the windswept moorland, creating a patchwork of enclosures that held everything from majestic Golden Eagles nursing broken wings to tiny, fierce kestrels recovering from collisions with wind turbines.  Amy, her breath clouding the frigid air, pulled her thick wool cap lower over her ears and tucked her gloved hands deeper into her pockets.  The metallic tang of blood, faintly carried on the wind, hinted at the day's first patient â€“ a buzzard, most likely, judging by the frantic calls she'd received earlier from a concerned hiker.
