The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping emanating from the various machines lining the walls of the Phlebotomy Lab.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp white coat, tapped a gloved finger against a stainless steel tray, the metallic ping echoing in the otherwise quiet early morning.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky above Cincinnati was a bruised purple, the faintest hint of rose creeping along the horizon. It was 5:30 AM, and Amy was already on her second pot of coffee, bracing herself for the daily influx of patients needing blood drawn.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something else, something metallic and indefinably organic, a smell Amy had come to associate with both life and death, inextricably linked within the walls of this place.
