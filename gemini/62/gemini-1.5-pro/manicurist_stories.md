The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's, jingled merrily.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy glow. Inside, amidst the scent of acetone and hibiscus-infused hand lotion, Eliza Jane Hemlock sighed, carefully placing a tiny rhinestone onto Mrs. Gable's already heavily-bejeweled pinky finger. Outside, the twilight of a November afternoon deepened into a premature night.  The Charleston air, usually thick with humidity, felt sharp and cold, a precursor to the winter that clung stubbornly to the edges of this Southern city.  Eliza glanced at the clock â€“ 5:58 pm.  Two more minutes and she could lock up, escape the incessant chatter of Mrs. Gable, and head home to her quiet apartment overlooking the harbor.  Two minutes until she could indulge in the blessed solitude that fueled her creativity, the kind that didn't involve tiny painted flowers or glitter gradients.
