The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Eloise "Ellie" Cartwright, her flour-dusted apron tied tight around her waist, hummed a tuneless melody as she wrestled a particularly stubborn batch of brioche dough.  Her bakery, "The Sugarplum & Spice," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat on Lavender Lane in the heart of Alderhaven, was her sanctuary.  Alderhaven itself was a town steeped in quiet charm, a place where gossip travelled faster than the old milk float and where everyone knew everyone else's business â€“ especially the business of Ellie's exquisitely decorated cakes and pastries. The windows of her shop, still dark against the inky sky, promised warmth and sweetness within, a beacon against the encroaching grey of another November morning.
