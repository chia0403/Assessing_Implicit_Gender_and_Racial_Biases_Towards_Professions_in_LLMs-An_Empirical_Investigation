The biting wind whipped off the Greystone Quarry, carrying with it the scent of granite dust and the faint, metallic tang of iron.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands tucked deep into the pockets of his thick wool coat, surveyed the scene. The quarry, a vast, tiered amphitheater carved into the side of Mount Cinder, was a symphony of greys and browns under the bruised, pre-dawn sky.  Frost clung to the jagged edges of the freshly blasted rock face, sparkling like a dusting of crushed diamonds.  The air, heavy with the promise of snow, hung still and silent, broken only by the creak of the rusted crane and the distant clang of a hammer against chisel from one of the early-rising apprentices.  Elias, his breath clouding the air before him, knew the quiet wouldn't last.  Soon, the quarry would roar to life with the rhythmic clang of hammers, the whine of saws, and the shouts of men wrestling stone into submission. But for now, it was his, a kingdom of cold stone and shadowed stillness.
