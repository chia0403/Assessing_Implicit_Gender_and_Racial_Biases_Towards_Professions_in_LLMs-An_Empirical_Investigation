The biting November wind whipped around Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, plastering strands of her dark hair across her face.  Frozen rain, the kind that stung like needles,  pelted the worn brick of the abandoned textile mill, its skeletal windows gaping black holes in the otherwise grey afternoon.  Hawthorne, Massachusetts, a town clinging stubbornly to its fading industrial past, rarely saw weather this vicious so early in the season. Izzy shoved her gloved hands deeper into the pockets of her thick parka, the chill seeping into her bones despite the layers. The yellow crime scene tape, flapping violently in the wind, cordoned off an area near the mill’s rusted loading dock, its vibrant color a stark contrast to the bleak backdrop.  A single, harsh spotlight illuminated a shape beneath a stained tarp – a shape that Izzy knew all too well. This was Hawthorne's third body in as many weeks, and a gnawing sense of dread told her this was just the beginning.
