The rusty diner sign, barely clinging to its post, creaked rhythmically in the relentless Nevada wind.  It promised "World Famous Chili" and "Hot Coffee 24/7," promises Delilah "Del" Jones highly doubted as she pulled her rig, a beat-up Kenworth W900 she affectionately called "The Duchess," into the gravel lot. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling around the pumps and the lone, flickering gas light. The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and sagebrush, a familiar perfume on this desolate stretch of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America."  Del, her knuckles raw from gripping the wheel for the last eight hours, killed the engine and the silence that descended was almost as oppressive as the wind had been. It was 3:17 AM, the kind of predawn darkness that felt thick enough to choke on, and Del was bone-tired, craving caffeine and something greasy to line her stomach before the final leg of her haul to Carson City.
