The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the neglected grounds of Blackwood Manor.  Iron gates, rust-eaten at the hinges, groaned open to reveal a drive choked with weeds that snaked around a once-magnificent fountain, now dry and crumbling.  The manor itself, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone, loomed against the bruised sky, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the overgrown wilderness that had claimed its once-pristine lawns. Milly, clad in worn work boots, thick canvas trousers, and a fleece jacket that had seen better days, inhaled the sharp scent of decaying leaves and damp earth. This was her inheritance, her burden, and her canvas. She had returned to Blackwood Manor, not to live the life of a lady of the manor, but to resurrect the sleeping beauty within the brambles, one thorny vine at a time.
