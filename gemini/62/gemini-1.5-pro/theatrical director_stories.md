The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her worn, wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against the silk scarf sheâ€™d knotted haphazardly around her neck. Above her, the marquee of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre creaked ominously, its once-vibrant paint now peeling like sunburnt skin.  Dust devils danced across the cracked pavement of Bleakwater Avenue, a desolate stretch on the outskirts of Chicago, a million miles away from the glittering lights of the Loop where Eleanor had once dreamed of making her name.  Tonight, however, her grand stage was this crumbling relic, its faded grandeur a mirror to her own flagging hopes.  The Grand Majestic hadn't seen a proper performance in decades, and the only audience Eleanor anticipated for her audacious revival of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" were the ghosts that, according to local legend, still roamed the dusty balconies.
