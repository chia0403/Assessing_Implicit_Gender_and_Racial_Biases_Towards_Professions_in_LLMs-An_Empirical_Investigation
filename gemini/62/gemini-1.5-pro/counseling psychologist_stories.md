The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  His office, nestled on the third floor of a converted brownstone on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, usually felt like a sanctuary, a warm, inviting space filled with the comforting aroma of old books and the soft glow of a Tiffany lamp.

Her name, he'd learned, was Sarah Jenkins, and her knuckles were white as she clutched a worn leather-bound journal.  This was their first session, and Elias, despite years of experience, felt a prickle of unease.
