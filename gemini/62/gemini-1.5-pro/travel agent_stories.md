Sunlight, thick as honey, already dripped through the gaps in the hotel curtains, painting stripes across the worn terracotta tiles of her room. Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Rose Finch, groaned and fumbled for the offending device.  She was a travel agent, not a superhero, and even superheroes needed sleep. This was supposed to be a "familiarization trip," an industry perk designed to acquaint her with the Costa Blanca's hidden gems.

Outside, the rhythmic clatter of a street sweeper provided a strangely soothing soundtrack to her misery.  The air, even at this early hour, thrummed with the promise of heat.  Alicante, nestled between the azure Mediterranean and the craggy peaks of the Serra Grossa mountains, was undeniably beautiful. But right now, all Amelia wanted was a strong cup of tea and a return ticket to her perfectly ordinary, perfectly quiet life in Bath.
