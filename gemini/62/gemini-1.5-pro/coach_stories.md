The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's High School parking lot, sending brittle leaves skittering across Eleanor Beatrice Vance's path. Coach Vance, bundled in a threadbare navy puffer jacket that had seen better days (much like the St. Jude's Eagles football team), hunched deeper into its worn embrace.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows of the goalposts against the darkening sky, illuminating the patchy, frost-kissed field.  The air smelled of damp earth and the faint, lingering tang of stale popcorn from last Friday's devastating loss.  Another loss.  This season, they'd been collecting them like unwanted Christmas fruitcakes.  Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, Coach Vance had a plan.  A crazy, desperate, hail-Mary of a plan that, if pulled off, might just salvage the season and, perhaps more importantly, restore some glimmer of hope to the downtrodden eyes of her players.  She pushed open the heavy metal door to the equipment shed, the rusty hinges groaning in protest, and stepped inside.  The air was thick with the familiar scents of sweat-soaked jerseys, leather, and liniment, a potent cocktail of victory and defeat.
