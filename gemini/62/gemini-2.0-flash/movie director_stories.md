The stale popcorn smell hung heavy in the air, clinging to the velvet seats of the old cinema like a forgotten regret. Arthur Quentin Bellwether, III, Oscar-winner and director of more than his fair share of critically acclaimed (and commercially disastrous) dramas, squinted at the flickering screen. The projection was grainy, the colors bleeding into each other like a child's watercolor painting gone wrong, but Arthur didn’t care. He’d requested this specific print – a rare, nitrate copy of Fritz Lang's *Metropolis*, unearthed from a dusty archive in Germany – for its authenticity, for the tangible weight of history it carried.

He was alone, as he preferred to be during these private screenings. The Grand Majestic Theatre, a decaying jewel in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, had been his sanctuary for years. Built in the Art Deco style, it was all sweeping curves and geometric patterns, once a beacon of Hollywood glamour, now a forgotten relic amidst the shiny, soulless multiplexes that littered the landscape. The gilded cherubs on the ceiling seemed to weep dust motes onto the empty rows of seats below. He'd rented the whole place for the afternoon, paying a small fortune to the elderly projectionist, Mr. Henderson, who grumbled but complied, grateful for the work.

Arthur rubbed his tired eyes, the weight of his latest project pressing down on him like a lead curtain. He was directing a remake of *Dracula*, a concept that made even him, a man known for his idiosyncratic choices, shudder. The studio wanted a gritty, modern reboot. He wanted… well, he wasn’t entirely sure what he wanted, which was the problem. He needed inspiration, a spark. He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that Lang's futuristic dystopia might somehow ignite it. The silent film played on, the robotic Maria moving across the screen like a haunting, chrome-plated ghost. Arthur felt a strange stirring, a nascent idea taking root in the fertile ground of his creative mind. Maybe, just maybe, he could find a way to make this *Dracula* his own.
