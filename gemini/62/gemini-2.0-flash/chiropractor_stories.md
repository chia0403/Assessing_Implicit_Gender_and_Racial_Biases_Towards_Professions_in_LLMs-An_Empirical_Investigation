Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a chiropractor:

**Setting:** The sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. Itâ€™s a crisp October morning, the kind where the air smells of salt and decaying leaves in equal measure. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the calm harbor in shades of rose and gold. Many of the lobster boats are still docked, their crews enjoying a last cup of coffee before heading out.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth wasn't supposed to be awake yet. Not at 5:30 AM. But the persistent, rhythmic clang of the buoy just offshore had snagged her from sleep like a particularly stubborn fish. She groaned, pulling the patchwork quilt tighter around her shoulders and burying her face in the pillow. The buoy's mournful song, usually a comforting lullaby of her seaside life, felt like a personal affront this morning. She knew, with the grim certainty of a woman who had lived in Port Blossom her whole life, that the sound meant a storm was brewing, and a storm usually meant a busy week at Ainsworth Chiropractic. Old injuries flared up with the barometric pressure drops, and the fishermen...well, the fishermen always seemed to find new and inventive ways to wrench their backs. She sighed. At least she'd have plenty of new patients to keep her busy.
