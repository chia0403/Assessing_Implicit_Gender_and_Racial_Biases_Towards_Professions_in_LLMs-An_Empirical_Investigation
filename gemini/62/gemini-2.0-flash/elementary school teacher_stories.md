The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Ms. Eleanor “Ellie” Mae Harding’s modest classroom, turning the dusty chalkboards and faded construction paper snowflakes into shimmering mirages. It was the last week of school at the Willow Creek Elementary, a small, single-story building nestled between a sun-baked arroyo and a sprawling cactus farm on the outskirts of Tucson. Ellie, a woman whose kind smile and penchant for floral dresses belied a spirit tougher than a desert tortoise, sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. The air conditioning unit, affectionately nicknamed "Ol' Wheezy," had decided to stage its annual pre-summer revolt, sputtering and wheezing like a geriatric marathon runner.

Some were diligently working on their end-of-year art projects – glitter, glue, and feathers exploding across the tables in a chaotic, beautiful mess. Others were engaged in hushed, conspiratorial whispers, undoubtedly planning their epic summer adventures. Ellie loved them all, even little Timmy, who had a disturbing habit of bringing pet grasshoppers to class. This was her sanctuary, her purpose, and the reason she braved the scorching heat and the unpredictable antics of nine-year-olds every year. But today, a nagging unease, a faint tremor of premonition, pulsed beneath the surface of her usual cheerful composure. Something felt… different. The air, thick with the smell of Elmer's Glue and youthful excitement, crackled with a strange, almost electric energy.
