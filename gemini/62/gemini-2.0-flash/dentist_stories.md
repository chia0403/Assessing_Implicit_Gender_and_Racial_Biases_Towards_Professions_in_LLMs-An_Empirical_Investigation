The oppressive Miami heat clung to Dr. Anya Sharma like a damp shroud as she wrestled her oversized, monogrammed tote bag out of her dented Volvo's passenger seat. The vinyl interior, baking under the relentless sun, practically burned her bare thighs. Across the street, palm trees, normally symbols of breezy paradise, hung listless, their fronds offering little respite. It was Tuesday, which meant "Tooth Extraction Tuesday" at Sunshine Smiles Dental, and Anya was already regretting her choice of a crisp linen blazer. It wouldn't survive the day.

Sunshine Smiles, a squat, pastel-pink building that desperately needed a fresh coat of paint, sat nestled between a pawn shop boasting questionable gold chains and a brightly colored daiquiri bar where the music was always just a little too loud. The neon sign above the door flickered intermittently, spelling out "SUNSHI--- SMI-ES" in a way that Anya found both endearing and deeply unprofessional. Despite its less-than-glamorous exterior, Sunshine Smiles was her baby, the culmination of years of grueling study and crippling student loan debt. And today, like most Tuesdays, it promised a potent cocktail of anxiety, Novocain, and the faint scent of fear. Anya straightened her blazer, adjusted her mask, and braced herself to face the day.
