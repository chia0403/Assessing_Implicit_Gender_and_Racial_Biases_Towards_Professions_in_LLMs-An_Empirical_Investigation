The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office on the 37th floor of the Gallagher Building, blurring the already indistinct skyline of downtown Chicago. The rhythmic drumming was a low, insistent counterpoint to the knot tightening in her stomach. From this vantage point, overlooking the city she knew so well, she felt utterly detached, as if watching a movie instead of living her life. The office itself was a carefully curated sanctuary - calming blues and greys, a worn leather Chesterfield sofa, and shelves lined with psychology texts and case files. It was a space designed to encourage vulnerability, to coax out the darkest secrets, but tonight, it felt more like a gilded cage. Eleanor swiveled in her ergonomic chair, the leather creaking softly, and stared at the flashing red light of her answering machine. Another message from Detective Harding. She knew what it would say, even before she pressed play. The same plea, the same desperate tone that had become all too familiar over the past three weeks. He needed her help. He needed *her* to get inside the head of the monster terrorizing the city. The kind of monster Eleanor had dedicated her career to understanding, but increasingly feared she couldn’t stop.
