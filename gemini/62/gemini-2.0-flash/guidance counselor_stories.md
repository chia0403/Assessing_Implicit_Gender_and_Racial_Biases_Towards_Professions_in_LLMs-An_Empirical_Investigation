## The Story Opening:

The stale scent of instant coffee and nervous teen sweat hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Evelyn Rosewood. It was Tuesday, 8:15 AM, and her first appointment, a nervous junior named Kevin, was already ten minutes late. Evelyn tapped her pen against the manila folder on her desk, a folder overflowing with Kevin's increasingly lackluster grades and a recent note from his English teacher regarding "uncharacteristically disruptive behavior."

She sighed, the sound lost in the gentle hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. Kevin wasnâ€™t usually one to buck the system. He was, in fact, a meticulously organized, painfully polite young man whose greatest crime was probably over-scheduling himself. Something was clearly brewing beneath the surface, and Evelyn, as head guidance counselor, was determined to find out what.

Another chime from the grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence, a sound she usually found comforting but which now grated on her nerves. She glanced at the framed photo on her desk: her grinning husband, Peter, holding their ridiculously fluffy Samoyed puppy, Nimbus. A pang of guilt twinged in her chest. This was her third late night this week, and Peter had been looking increasingly weary. Balancing the emotional weight of three hundred high school students with the demands of her marriage was becoming a Herculean task.

Just as she was about to call Kevin's homeroom, a hesitant knock scratched at the door. "Come in," Evelyn called, her voice carefully modulated to be both welcoming and firm. The door creaked open, revealing not Kevin, but a small, wiry girl with fiery red hair and eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world. "Dr. Rosewood?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. "I... I need to talk to you."

## The Setting:

The story is set in the sprawling, brick-clad building of **Northwood High School**, nestled in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. Northwood boasts manicured lawns, a state-of-the-art gymnasium, and a reputation for academic excellence. However, beneath the glossy veneer of success lies a complex ecosystem of anxieties, pressures, and teenage dramas.

Dr. Evelyn Rosewood's office is located on the second floor, tucked away in a quiet corner near the library. It's a relatively small room, painted a soothing shade of pale green and furnished with an overstuffed armchair, a sturdy wooden desk, and a overflowing bookshelf filled with everything from college brochures to self-help guides for teenagers. The room is meant to be a sanctuary, a safe space where students can confide in her their hopes, fears, and the burdens they carry. But today, it felt less like a haven and more like a pressure cooker, ready to burst.
