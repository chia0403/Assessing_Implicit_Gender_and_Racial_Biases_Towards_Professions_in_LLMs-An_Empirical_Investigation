The oppressive Louisiana humidity clung to everything, even inside the supposedly air-conditioned kitchen of "Le Canard Sauvage" (The Wild Duck), a restaurant nestled deep in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Sweat trickled down the temples of **Jean-Luc Thibodeaux**, pasting strands of his dark, curly hair to his forehead. He didn’t mind, though. This was his element. The controlled chaos, the sizzling of duck fat confit in the pan, the clatter of pans – it was a symphony he’d orchestrated for years, a symphony that masked the discordant jangle of his thoughts.

The setting was a whirlwind of culinary activity. Stainless steel gleamed under harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the frantic movements of the kitchen staff. Jacques, the perpetually flustered saucier, furiously whisked a roux, his face a mask of concentration. Marie, the pastry chef, a woman built like a sturdy brick oven, meticulously piped delicate swirls of lemon cream onto miniature tarts. The air was thick with the intoxicating aromas of garlic, thyme, and the rich, gamey scent of the namesake dish – the roasted wild duck, a specialty of the house, hanging, glistening, above the prep station, waiting to be carved.

Jean-Luc, however, wasn't focused on the grand symphony of the restaurant tonight. He was at the oyster station, shucking each plump, grey-green bivalve with practiced ease, his movements almost hypnotic. He wasn't thinking about the upcoming rush, the demanding palates of the tourists, or even the crippling rent. He was thinking about her – Evangeline – and the lingering scent of jasmine that always clung to her hair, a scent that now seemed to taunt him in the humid air, mixing with the brine of the oysters and the sharp tang of lemon.
