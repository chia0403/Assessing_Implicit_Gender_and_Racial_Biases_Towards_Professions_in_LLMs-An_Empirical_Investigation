The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Eliza Mae Devereux like a damp shroud. Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring her vision as she wrestled with a stubborn roller shade in the window of "Eliza Mae's Curl Up & Dye." The shop, a cheerful canary yellow Victorian with gingerbread trim, sat nestled on a quiet side street just off King Street. Eliza Mae had poured her heart and soul, not to mention a significant portion of her inheritance, into restoring the building, transforming it from a dilapidated antique store into her dream salon.

But the dream was currently being obscured by this blasted shade, refusing to acknowledge that it was nearly noon and customers, hopefully, would be arriving soon. Eliza Mae, a wisp of a woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping her perfectly pinned updo, grumbled under her breath. "Now, be nice, you old son-of-a-button," she muttered, giving the shade another forceful tug. Just then, the bell above the shop door jingled, announcing the arrival of her first client, and Eliza Mae froze, the shade still clenched in her fist, a sheepish grin spreading across her face.
