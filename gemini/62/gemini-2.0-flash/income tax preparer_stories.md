## The Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Honest Abe's Tax Emporium" buzzed with a frantic energy, a symphony of shuffling papers, frustrated sighs, and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of calculators. It was mid-April, the air thick with the anxiety of overdue deductions and the looming threat of the IRS. Amidst this chaos, stood Abner Cornelius Bumble, his shoulders slumped just a little, his tie loosened, and a half-eaten tuna sandwich precariously balanced on the corner of his overflowing desk. He was a beacon of (mostly) calm in a sea of financial despair, a man dedicated to deciphering the intricate code of Form 1040.

Abner squinted at the smudged W-2 form clutched in his hand, his brow furrowed in concentration. It belonged to Mrs. Mildred McMillan, a sweet, elderly woman who insisted on bringing him freshly baked lemon bars every year, regardless of his protestations about his waistline. This year, however, her lemon bars were accompanied by a particularly perplexing series of deductions related to "research and development" stemming from her supposed attempt to invent self-watering geraniums. Abner sighed. It was going to be a long night.

## The Setting:

**Honest Abe's Tax Emporium** was a small, family-owned business nestled in the heart of downtown Willow Creek, Ohio. It was a two-story building, painted a patriotic (though slightly peeling) red, white, and blue. A faded portrait of Abraham Lincoln hung above the entrance, his stern gaze seemingly judging the financial choices of every person who dared to enter.

Inside, the Emporium was a monument to organized chaos. Tax forms overflowed from every conceivable surface. Stacks of receipts threatened to topple over like precarious towers of paper. Ancient adding machines sat side-by-side with modern computers, a testament to the slow, reluctant embrace of technology. The air was perpetually thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap printer ink, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. McMillan's lemon bars.

Abner's desk, situated in a small, cramped office at the back of the building, was a microcosm of the Emporium itself. Piles of files towered around him, each labeled with a name and the corresponding year. A framed picture of his prize-winning petunias sat precariously on the edge of his desk, a reminder of a life outside the endless cycle of tax season. And, of course, there was the half-eaten tuna sandwich, a testament to his dedication, or perhaps, his lack of time management.
