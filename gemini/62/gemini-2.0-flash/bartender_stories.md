The flickering neon sign outside, a drunken flamingo perpetually losing its balance, cast a sickly pink glow across the rain-slicked street. Inside, the air hung thick and heavy, a cloying cocktail of cheap whiskey, stale cigarette smoke, and desperation. The clatter of dice, the low rumble of murmured secrets, and the mournful twang of a country song bleeding from the jukebox were the soundtrack to another Tuesday night at The Rusty Nail.

Behind the scarred and sticky surface of the bar, **Genevieve "Gen" Eleanor Moreau** wiped down a particularly stubborn ring of condensation with practiced ease. Her movements were economical, almost balletic, honed from years spent navigating the cramped space and the even more cramped psyches of the Nail's regulars. Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a tight braid, had loosened around her face, framing sharp cheekbones and eyes that held a weariness that belied her thirty years. She knew every crack in the linoleum floor, every off-key note the jukebox stubbornly clung to, and every sad story that walked through that flamingo-lit doorway. This was her kingdom, her penance, and for tonight, at least, her sanctuary.
