## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The perpetually overcast city of Portland, Oregon, specifically a small, cluttered office tucked above a vintage typewriter repair shop on Hawthorne Boulevard. The air smells faintly of motor oil and dust, mixed with the comforting aroma of stale coffee and the sharper tang of lavender hand lotion. Rain patters against the grimy window, blurring the neon glow of "Powell's City of Books" across the street.

**Opening:**

The low hum of the adding machine was a soothing, almost maternal, sound to Agatha Miriam Finch. It was the sound of order in a chaotic world, the rhythmic tick-tock of numbers finding their proper place. Agatha, a woman of forty-seven years with perpetually tired eyes and a penchant for floral-print dresses, tapped a meticulously manicured fingernail against the ledger page, her brow furrowed in concentration. The aroma of her lavender hand lotion, her signature scent, mingled with the dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light.

She was balancing the accounts for "The Velvet Vortex," a local burlesque club known more for its sparkly tassels than its financial stability, and as usual, something wasnâ€™t adding up. Another mysterious expenditure, this time labelled simply as "Feathers & Fury," had thrown the entire spreadsheet into disarray. Agatha sighed, adjusted her spectacles, and reached for another cup of lukewarm coffee. "Feathers and Fury," she muttered to herself, the words echoing softly in the cramped space. "More like feathers and fiscal irresponsibility."
