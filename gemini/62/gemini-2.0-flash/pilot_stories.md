The biting wind, smelling of salt and crushed ice, whipped at Amelia Irene Harding’s face as she wrestled the Cessna 172 Skyhawk into position on the short, snow-dusted airstrip. Her breath puffed out in visible clouds, momentarily obscuring the already bleak landscape. The sky above Bethel, Alaska, was a dull, pewter gray, promising more snow before the day was out. Another perfect day for flying, she thought grimly, tightening her scarf against the Arctic chill.

Amelia loved flying, truly loved it, the freedom and responsibility of holding a piece of the sky in her hands. But today, the romance felt buried under a thick layer of practicality and an even thicker layer of dread. Today wasn't about soaring; it was about delivering desperately needed medicine to the remote village of Quinhagak, a dot on the map clinging to the edge of the Bering Sea, where a particularly nasty strain of the flu was making its rounds.

Few people chose to live out here, a harsh testament to nature’s indifference. But those who did, relied on the ingenuity and, more often than not, the daring of pilots like Amelia to connect them to the outside world. And right now, Quinhagak was counting on her.
