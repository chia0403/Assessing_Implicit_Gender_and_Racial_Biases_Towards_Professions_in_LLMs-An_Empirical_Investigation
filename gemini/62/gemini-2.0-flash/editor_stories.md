## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The perpetually drizzling city of Seattle, Washington. Specifically, a cluttered and aroma-infused corner of the Pike Place Market, near a stall overflowing with colorful dahlias and the tantalizing scent of freshly baked piroshkies.

**Story Opening:**

The damp Seattle air, thick with the mingled scents of coffee, seafood, and damp wool, did little to soothe Eleanor Maeve Davies' frayed nerves. Another rejection letter. Another manuscript consigned to the overflowing "Darlings, but Doomed" pile that threatened to topple off her desk and bury her alive. Eleanor, senior editor at "Emerald Ink," a small, independent publishing house clinging precariously to relevance in the digital age, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. The neon glow of the "Flying Fish" sign across the market cast a lurid orange light across the manuscript, mocking its already dismal chances. This particular submission, a sprawling epic fantasy about a race of sentient squirrels battling a tyrannical badger king, had potential, sheâ€™d admitted even to herself. But potential, as Eleanor knew all too well, didn't pay the bills. It certainly didn't stop her boss, Mr. Abernathy, from pacing outside her cubicle, humming a vaguely menacing rendition of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat," a sure sign he was about to deliver another lecture on the dire state of their finances. Eleanor braced herself. Another day, another deluge of paperwork and the relentless pressure of keeping Emerald Ink afloat. Today, it seemed, the squirrel kingdom would have to fall.
