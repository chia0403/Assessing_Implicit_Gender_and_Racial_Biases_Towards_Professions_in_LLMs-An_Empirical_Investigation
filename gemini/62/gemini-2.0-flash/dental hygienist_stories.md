The fluorescent lights hummed a familiar, irritating song, reflecting harshly off the polished steel instruments laid out neatly on the tray. Amelia Katherine Davies sighed, adjusting the angle of the overhead lamp and smoothing the crisp, disposable bib she'd be placing around Mrs. Gable's neck in approximately three minutes. Outside, the wind howled a late-March song, rattling the windows of the Smile Solutions clinic. Amelia, however, was insulated, both by the thick brick walls and her own professional calm.

Smile Solutions wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis. Located in the sleepy, postcard-perfect town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, the clinic offered a comforting, if predictable, rhythm. Tuesdays and Wednesdays were dominated by the senior crowd, Thursdays were braces adjustments with the orthodontist who visited from Asheville, and Fridays, blessedly, were mostly pediatric.

Amelia loved Havenwood, its slow pace a welcome change from her hectic college days. But sometimes, like this morning with the wind threatening to rip the roof off and Mrs. Gableâ€™s appointment looming like a cavity waiting to be filled, she felt a restless twitch. A longing for something more than perfectly scaled teeth and polite small talk about the weather.
