## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The clock above the meat slicer ticked with a maddening precision, each second echoing in the near-empty shop like a dripping faucet in a cathedral. **Bartholomew "Bart" Augustine Thorne**, proprietor of Thorne's Prime Cuts and sausage enthusiast, watched the minute hand inch forward, each tick a hammer blow against the anvil of his mounting anxiety. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful symphony playing out on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Willow Creek. The storm, brewing since dawn, had finally unleashed its fury, and the shop, usually bustling with Saturday morning regulars, was eerily still. He hadn't seen a single customer in over an hour, and the prime cuts of Angus beef, neatly arranged in the refrigerated display case, were starting to look accusingly at him.

**Setting:**

Thorne's Prime Cuts occupied a prime corner location on Willow Creek's historic Main Street. The shop was a testament to old-world craftsmanship, a living museum of butchery. The building itself, a two-story brick structure, had housed a butcher shop for over a century, each generation adding its own layer of character. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of cured meats, sawdust, and a hint of ozone from the ever-humming refrigeration units. Gleaming white tiles lined the walls, punctuated by vintage advertisements for locally-sourced pork and award-winning sausages. A long, scarred counter, worn smooth by decades of use, separated Bart from his customers. Behind the counter, a gleaming array of knives, cleavers, and hooks adorned the wall, each tool a silent testament to Bart's skill and dedication. Wooden beams crisscrossed the high ceiling, lending a rustic charm that clashed pleasingly with the modern, stainless-steel equipment Bart had reluctantly invested in. The whole place felt imbued with history, a comforting anchor in a rapidly changing world, and Bart felt a profound responsibility to keep the tradition alive, even when the howling wind outside seemed to threaten to blow it all away.
