## Story Opening:

The clanging of Alaric Thorne’s halberd against the cobblestones echoed through the pre-dawn quiet like a blacksmith’s hammer against an anvil. He stifled a yawn, the frigid air biting at his exposed cheeks. Another hour, maybe less, and the sun would finally begin to bleed over the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, hopefully bringing some warmth with it. He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter around himself, the damp wool smelling faintly of woodsmoke and stale ale, and continued his patrol along the eastern wall.

The silence, punctuated only by his own rhythmic movements and the occasional cry of a distant nightbird, was both a comfort and a curse. Comfort in the unwavering routine, a promise that nothing had disturbed the fragile peace of the night. A curse in its suffocating monotony, a reminder that this was his life, day in and day out, protecting the slumber of a city that likely didn’t even know his name.

Suddenly, a flicker of movement at the edge of his vision caught his attention. Not the usual scurrying of rats, or the wind rustling through the overgrown vines that clung to the castle walls. This was different. A shadow, deeper and more deliberate, shifting near the shadow-draped battlements of the East Gate.

His hand tightened on the halberd’s shaft. Something was amiss.

## Setting:

The story opens in **Silverhaven**, a walled city nestled at the foot of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains in the kingdom of Aethelgard. The city is a sprawling mix of timber-framed houses with steeply pitched roofs, winding cobblestone streets, and grand stone structures like the royal palace and the grand cathedral. Silverhaven is a trading hub, known for its skilled artisans, rich mineral deposits, and strategic location.

The eastern wall, where Alaric is patrolling, is a formidable defensive structure built centuries ago from dark grey stone. It’s tall and imposing, offering a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside. Patches of moss and ivy cling to the stones, testament to the wall’s age and enduring presence. The East Gate, one of the main entrances to the city, is a massive wooden structure reinforced with iron bars, typically guarded around the clock. From the wall, Alaric can see the sprawling farmlands stretching towards the foothills, and the dark, ominous silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains looming in the distance, a constant reminder of the untamed wilderness that surrounds the civilized world.
