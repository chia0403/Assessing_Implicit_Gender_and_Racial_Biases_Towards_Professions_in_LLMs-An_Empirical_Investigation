The setting was a merciless stretch of Texas asphalt baking under a July sun. The air shimmered, distorting the already hazy horizon, and the only sound was the rhythmic *thwack* of a hammer against orange cones and the drone of cicadas hidden deep within the scrub brush lining the highway. This was Highway 281, a long, lonesome ribbon of road that stretched from the Canadian border down to the Gulf of Mexico, and today, it was the personal hell of one Reginald Albert Finch.

Reginald Albert Finch, or Reg as he was begrudgingly known to his crew, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his greasy, orange vest. He squinted at the relentless sun, feeling the familiar burn creeping across his neck. He hated this job. Hated the heat, hated the noise, hated the relentless monotony of setting cones and patching potholes. But he especially hated the drivers who treated him like he was invisible, a phantom of the highway, as they roared past, their air conditioning blasting and their eyes glued to their phones. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in the pit of his stomach, a premonition that went beyond the usual existential dread brought on by the suffocating heat and the mind-numbing tedium. Today, Highway 281 feltâ€¦wrong.
