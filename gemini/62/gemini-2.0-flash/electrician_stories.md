The biting wind, smelling of ozone and salt, whipped against Eleanor Marie Dubois' face as she clung precariously to the platform of the old lighthouse. The year was 2042, and the North Sea was a particularly unruly beast tonight, its waves crashing against the granite base of the structure like enraged fists. Eleanor, a small woman with perpetually wind-chapped lips and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand electrical currents, wasn't bothered by the spray. She'd seen worse, much worse, in her twenty years as a self-employed electrician.

Her setting was North Point Lighthouse, a relic from a bygone era perched on the very edge of the crumbling Yorkshire coastline. Once a vital navigational aid, it had been decommissioned thirty years ago, left to the ravages of the elements and the odd thrill-seeking tourist brave enough to ignore the numerous "DANGER: KEEP OUT" signs plastered around its perimeter. Now, it was Eleanor's current client, a eccentric millionaire named Alistair Finch, who had the fantastical (and, frankly, insane) idea of turning it into a luxury eco-retreat.

The flickering gas lamp, temporarily jury-rigged to provide some semblance of light, cast long, dancing shadows on the peeling paint of the lantern room. Eleanor squinted, shielding her eyes with a gloved hand as she wrestled with a tangle of corroded wiring. This wasnâ€™t just about fixing a faulty bulb. This was about bringing a century-old beacon back to life, a task as daunting as it was deeply, deeply satisfying. And tonight, with the storm raging outside, she was battling not only the elements, but also the ghosts of generations of lighthouse keepers, their stories woven into the very fabric of the building, whispering warnings in the howling wind.
