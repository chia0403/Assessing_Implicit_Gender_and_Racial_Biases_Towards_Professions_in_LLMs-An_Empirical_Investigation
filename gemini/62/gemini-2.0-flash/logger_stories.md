## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He took a long, slow drag from his thermos, the bitter coffee a necessary jolt against the pre-dawn chill. Mist clung to the skeletal fingers of the towering Douglas firs, obscuring their lofty crowns. Today, Elias was going to face down one of the giants.

He could hear the rhythmic thump of other loggers arriving, the rumble of engines spitting to life further down the muddy track. But here, in his little clearing, a pocket carved into the dense heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State, it was still just him, his tools, and the looming presence of the old-growth timber he was about to bring down.

## Setting:

The **Gifford Pinchot National Forest, Washington State, 1987**. The area Elias Thorne is working in is a small clearing carved into the forest, dense with towering Douglas firs, some estimated to be hundreds of years old. The ground is a thick carpet of fallen needles, decaying wood, and tangled undergrowth. The air is perpetually damp, heavy with the scent of pine and earth. It is a harsh, unforgiving landscape, where nature reigns supreme, but one that Elias has grown to respect, even love. The year is 1987, a time when logging was still a major industry in the Pacific Northwest, but whispers of conservation and sustainable forestry were beginning to gain traction. This tension hangs in the air, as tangible as the morning mist.
