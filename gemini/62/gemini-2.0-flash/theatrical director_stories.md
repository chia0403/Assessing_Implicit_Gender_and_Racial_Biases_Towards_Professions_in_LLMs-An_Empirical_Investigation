The air in the old Globe Theatre replica hung thick and heavy with the scent of sawdust, stale coffee, and the ghosts of a thousand performances. Sunlight, weak even for a late November afternoon, struggled to pierce the grime-streaked glass of the oculus, casting long, distorted shadows across the bare wooden stage.

The stage itself was a battlefield, littered with crumpled scripts, half-empty water bottles, and the forgotten casualties of the day's grueling rehearsal. The actors had dispersed hours ago, their faces etched with exhaustion and, if Director Alistair Finch was being honest with himself, a fair dose of resentment. He hadn't been his best self that day.

Alistair Bartholomew Finch, a man whose name sounded more suited to a stuffy barrister than a theatrical visionary, slumped against one of the sturdy wooden pillars that supported the gallery. He rubbed his temples, the greasepaint stains from a misguided attempt to demonstrate a villainous sneer smudged across his fingers. He felt the familiar sting of self-doubt, a persistent critic lurking in the wings of his own mind. His production of "Macbeth," ambitious and deeply personal, felt less like a triumphant return to his theatrical roots and more like a slow-motion train wreck barreling toward opening night. The witches were dreadful, Duncan kept forgetting his lines, and Lady Macbeth... well, let's just say Alistair had seriously underestimated the actress's commitment to her gluten-free diet.
