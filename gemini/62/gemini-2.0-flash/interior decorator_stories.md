Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character who is an interior decorator:

**Opening:**

The scent of lemon verbena and fresh paint hung in the air, a fragrant battle for dominance that Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne usually relished. Today, though, it only amplified the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. Her perfectly manicured fingers, usually dancing across fabric swatches and design boards, nervously fidgeted with the silver charm bracelet her grandmother had given her, each tiny trinket representing a milestone in Amelia's life, each a testament to her unwavering pursuit of beauty. She took a deep breath, trying to channel the serene elegance she cultivated in her designs. Today was the day. The unveiling of the Thornewood Library, a project that could make or break Hawthorne Interiors, and, by extension, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne.

**Setting:**

The Thornewood Library wasn't just any library; it was a legacy. Situated in the heart of Oak Haven, a wealthy, historical New England town, it was a sprawling Victorian mansion, meticulously preserved and now, finally, being opened to the public after decades of private ownership. The building itself was breathtaking: stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature, intricately carved woodwork, and soaring ceilings that demanded reverence.

The libraryâ€™s main reading room was Amelia's biggest challenge and her greatest triumph. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, made of rich mahogany, lined the walls, filled with a curated collection of rare first editions and timeless classics. Amelia had chosen deep jewel-toned velvet armchairs, strategically placed near crackling fireplaces, inviting patrons to lose themselves in the pages. Antique brass lamps cast a warm, inviting glow, highlighting the hand-painted murals that Amelia had commissioned, depicting scenes from local folklore.  The overall effect was a seamless blend of old-world charm and modern comfort, a space designed to inspire and enchant.
