Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and details you requested:

**Setting:** A cozy, dimly lit massage therapy studio in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, nestled between a quirky bookshop and a vintage clothing store. The air is thick with the calming scents of lavender and sandalwood, a soft flute melody drifts from hidden speakers, and the only light comes from flickering Himalayan salt lamps.

**Opening:**

The soft chime of the entrance bell barely registered over the rhythmic kneading of her hands. Seraphina Willowbrook, all of 32 years and with hands that could coax knots out of granite, hardly paused in her work. "Just a moment," she murmured to the prone figure on the table, a tense software engineer named Brad, whose shoulders were permanently hunched in protest against his sedentary life.

Seraphina continued working, her fingers finding the stubbornly tight muscles along Brad's spine. She could practically *feel* the stress radiating off him. The Asheville rain pattered softly against the windowpane, a soothing counterpoint to the interior tranquility of "The Willow's Touch," her little sanctuary. Finally, she stepped away, draping a warm towel over Brad's back. "That should do it for now, Brad. Take a deep breath. How does that feel?"

"Like I might actually be able to touch my toes," he groaned happily, a hint of wonder in his voice.

As Brad sat up, stretching gingerly, Seraphina turned towards the front, wiping her hands on her apron. A woman stood just inside the doorway, shaking the rain from a bright yellow umbrella. She was tall and striking, with a cascade of fiery red hair and a hesitant look in her emerald green eyes. Something about her screamed "trouble," but Seraphina had learned long ago that everyone carried their own kind of burden. And sometimes, all they needed was someone to help lighten the load.

"Hello," Seraphina said, offering a warm smile. "Welcome to The Willow's Touch. How can I help you?"
