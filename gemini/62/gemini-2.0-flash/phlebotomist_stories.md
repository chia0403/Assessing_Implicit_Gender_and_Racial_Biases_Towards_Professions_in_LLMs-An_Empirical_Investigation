Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Eliza Maeve Carter:

**Setting:** A bustling, slightly overcrowded outpatient clinic waiting room in the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The walls are a faded shade of institutional green, punctuated by outdated posters about healthy eating and the benefits of regular checkups. A television in the corner blares a daytime talk show, its volume competing with the low hum of hushed conversations and the rhythmic cough of a man in a threadbare cardigan. Worn vinyl chairs are arranged in neat rows, filled with a diverse mix of patients: young mothers with fidgeting toddlers, elderly couples holding hands, and weary-looking individuals staring blankly into the middle distance. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic, stale coffee, and a hint of anxiety.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Maeve Carter paused just inside the door to the phlebotomy lab, a small sanctuary tucked away at the back of the Havenwood Clinic. She took a deep breath, the sharp tang of rubbing alcohol a familiar comfort. Outside, the symphony of nervous energy in the waiting room was reaching a crescendo. Inside, however, it was her domain. Stainless steel counters gleamed under fluorescent lights, rows of meticulously labeled vials lined the shelves, and the gentle hum of the centrifuge was a steady, almost meditative drone.

Eliza glanced at the schedule taped to the counter. Mrs. Henderson for a lipid panel, followed by young Timmy O'Malley for a CBC. Just another Tuesday in Havenwood, another series of tiny pinpricks to help unravel the mysteries hidden within human blood. But today felt different. A subtle unease, a prickle at the back of her neck, had been dogging her since she'd woken up. It wasn’t the usual pre-lunch hunger pangs, or the lingering frustration from a near miss with a particularly difficult vein yesterday. No, this was something else. Something she couldn’t quite put her finger on, something… ominous. She pushed the feeling aside, chalking it up to too much caffeine and not enough sleep. After all, what could possibly go wrong with drawing blood?
