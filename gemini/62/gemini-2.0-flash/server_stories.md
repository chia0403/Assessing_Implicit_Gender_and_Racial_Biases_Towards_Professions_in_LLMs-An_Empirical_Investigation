The clatter of cutlery was a constant, grating symphony that reverberated through "The Mariner's Catch," a seafood restaurant perched precariously on stilts above the churning grey waters of Port Blossom. Salt spray kissed the panoramic windows, occasionally obscuring the view of the perpetually overcast sky. The air, thick with the scent of fried cod and desperation, was a familiar perfume to Evangeline "Eva" Riley.

Eva, her brown hair pulled back in a tight bun that emphasized the smattering of freckles across her nose, expertly navigated the crowded dining room, a tray laden with steaming clam chowder balanced precariously on one hand. Her worn Converse squeaked against the damp wooden floor as she dodged a gaggle of tourists snapping photos with their phones. The Mariner's Catch wasn't just a restaurant; it was a living, breathing embodiment of Port Blossomâ€™s hardscrabble existence, a place where the ocean provided, but also demanded a steep price in return. And Eva, with her quiet resilience and knack for remembering every customer's order (even the notoriously picky Captain Archibald), was as much a fixture here as the rusty anchor hanging above the bar. Tonight, however, the usual rhythm felt off. A low, almost imperceptible hum of unease vibrated through the air, like a premonition carried on the salty breeze.
