The oppressive August heat clung to the humid air outside, mirroring the thick anxiety swirling in the pit of Seraphina Marguerite Dubois’ stomach. She gripped the antique mahogany desk in her dimly lit office, the smooth surface offering a meager reassurance against the coming storm. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn Persian rug and the overflowing stacks of case files that were her constant companions.

Seraphina, a partner at the small, family-run firm of Dubois & Sons, a legacy her grandfather had established decades ago, found herself more often than not feeling like she was drowning in the tepid waters of small-town legal battles. Divorces, petty thefts, and contract disputes were the bread and butter, a far cry from the glamorous, high-stakes courtroom dramas she’d envisioned during law school.

Her office, tucked away in the historic district of quaint, Louisiana bayou town of Belle Rose, was a reflection of this bittersweet reality. The building, a once-grand Victorian home, was slowly succumbing to the relentless humidity and the creeping tendrils of Spanish moss that draped its aging facade. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, beeswax, and a faint whiff of Seraphina’s perpetually brewing chicory coffee. The town itself was a sleepy place, steeped in tradition and secrets, where everyone knew everyone, and gossip spread faster than the morning mist rolling off the bayou. And now, a new case, more complex and unsettling than anything she'd handled before, was threatening to unravel the fragile peace of Belle Rose.
