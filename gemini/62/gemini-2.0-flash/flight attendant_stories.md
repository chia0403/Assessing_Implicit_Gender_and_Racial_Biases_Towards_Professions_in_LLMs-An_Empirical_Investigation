The overhead lights in the galley flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the stainless steel surfaces. Outside, the turbulence was a low, rhythmic rumble that rattled the drink carts like nervous skeletons. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her impeccably coiffed blonde hair escaping its tight bun strand by defiant strand, adjusted her scarlet lipstick in the reflection of a coffee pot. She hated turbulence. Not the actual shaking, mind you. Years of flying had numbed her to that. It was the *uncertainty* of it, the feeling of being utterly at the mercy of forces beyond her control, that scraped against her perfectly maintained veneer.

She was on the final leg of a red-eye from Seattle to Miami, United Flight 287. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, recycled air, and a disconcerting hint of desperation. Most of the passengers were mercifully asleep, their faces slack and vulnerable under the dim reading lights. A few, however, were wide awake, their eyes darting nervously around the cabin, gripping armrests as if they were life rafts. Those were the ones Amelia had to worry about. Those were the ones who needed to believe she was in control, even when she wasn't.

Miami loomed, a hazy glow on the horizon. Amelia glanced at her watch. Just another hour. Just one more hour of pretending she wasn't as bone-tired as she felt. Just one more hour of being Amelia Rose Hawthorne, flawless flight attendant, mistress of calm in the face of chaos.
