## Story Opening:

The screech of rusty pipes was nothing new to Arthur Reginald Peabody. He knew that sound intimately, like a mournful cello played by a particularly clumsy poltergeist. This particular cello, however, was coming from Mrs. Higgins’ upstairs bathroom, and Arthur Reginald Peabody, plumber extraordinaire, was dreading it. He tightened his grip on his wrench, its cool metal a small comfort against the prickle of sweat forming on his forehead. He’d had his fill of Mrs. Higgins, and her… eccentric plumbing.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a Tuesday morning in the sleepy, slightly mildewy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air is thick with the briny smell of seaweed and the faint, persistent scent of fried clams, emanating from Salty's Diner just down the street. The house Arthur is approaching is a two-story Victorian, painted a faded, almost offensive, shade of salmon pink. Sea salt crusted the windowpanes, and the porch sagged precariously on one side, like a weary smile threatening to collapse. Overgrown hydrangeas, in various stages of bloom and decay, clawed at the peeling paintwork. It was the kind of house that whispered stories, not all of them pleasant, and Arthur, with his years of experience fixing the innards of Port Blossom's aging plumbing system, was a master interpreter of those whispers.
