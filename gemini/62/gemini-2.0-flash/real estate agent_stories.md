## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** Palm Springs, California. The sun beats down mercilessly, even in mid-October, baking the stucco walls of the mid-century modern homes into shimmering mirages. The air is thick with the scent of blooming bougainvillea and the faint hum of a distant air conditioning unit straining against the heat.

**Opening:**

Margaret Elizabeth Abernathy squinted against the glare, pulling down the visor in her BMW. The turquoise paint job, a vintage nod to the neighborhood she represented, felt more like a punishment under this desert sun. She’d promised herself she’d get it repainted a sensible beige, but then another bidding war erupted, another commission landed, and the turquoise stayed. Besides, it got her noticed. And in this town, dominated by million-dollar mansions and retirees with deep pockets, being noticed was half the battle.

Margaret took a deep breath, adjusted the strap of her oversized designer sunglasses, and checked the address scrawled on the back of a business card. "The Sinatra Estate," it read, followed by a phone number that looked suspiciously like it was missing a digit. She'd taken a chance on this lead, gleaned from a dusty old "Palm Springs Legends" tour brochure. It was a long shot, sure, but after a month of showing sterile, cookie-cutter McMansions to clueless influencers, she was desperate for something, *anything*, with character.

This could be it. This could be the deal that catapulted her from 'successful real estate agent' to 'Palm Springs royalty.' Margaret Elizabeth Abernathy straightened her shoulders, smoothed down the skirt of her linen dress, and killed the engine. The air conditioning, her only solace, sputtered and died with a mournful sigh, leaving her face-to-face with the shimmering possibility - and the oppressive heat - of Palm Springs.
