## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The early morning sun, still shy and hesitant, cast long, pale shadows across the polished linoleum floors of Maple Creek Assisted Living. The air hung thick with the scent of lemon-scented disinfectant, battling a losing war against the faint, persistent odor of aging and institutionalized life. The dining room was a cavernous space, normally bustling with activity, but at this hour, only a skeleton crew of staff prepared for the day. Outside, a light drizzle pitter-patted against the panoramic windows, promising another gray, melancholic day in the heart of rural Ohio.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne took a deep breath, the sharp scent of the cleaning products stinging her nostrils and jolting her fully awake. The sleep clinging to her eyelids felt like a stubborn film she couldn't quite scrub away. 5:30 AM. Too early, as always. She knew she shouldn't arrive before the sunrise, knew that the residents were still peacefully slumbering in their beds, dreaming their fragmented dreams. But Amelia had learned, after five years as an occupational therapist at Maple Creek, that getting a head start was the only way to stay ahead of the chaos. The clock was ticking, and today, that clock held more weight than usual. Today was Mr. Henderson's assessment, and his future, in a very real way, rested in her hands.
