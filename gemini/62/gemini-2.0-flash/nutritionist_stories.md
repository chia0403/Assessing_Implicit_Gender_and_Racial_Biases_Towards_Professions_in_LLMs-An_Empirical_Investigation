Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a nutritionist:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and simmering kale choked the air of the breakroom. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth pinched the bridge of her nose, a familiar throbbing building behind her eyes. Sheâ€™d traded the tranquil hum of her private practice for the chaotic clatter of the city hospital cafeteria, ostensibly to revolutionize their patient menu, but the reality was a far cry from her idealized visions of vibrant, nourishing meals. Instead, she was met with mountains of processed carbohydrates, bottomless vats of suspiciously orange "cheese" sauce, and a stubborn head chef named Bruno who believed that a proper vegetable was one that had been deep-fried and salted.

This morning, though, the olfactory assault was especially egregious. Bruno, humming off-key to an Italian aria, was manhandling a crate of day-glo pink hot dogs. Eleanor knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in her stomach, that those hot dogs were destined for the pediatric ward. She sighed. This was going to be a long, long day.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the grimy, bustling kitchen and the equally depressing cafeteria of *Saint Jude's General Hospital* in the heart of *Philadelphia, Pennsylvania*. Eleanor's own office, a small, brightly lit space with overflowing bookshelves and posters advocating for mindful eating, is a stark contrast to the hospital environment and serves as a sanctuary. The story may also venture into Eleanor's well-ordered apartment in the gentrified neighborhood of Fishtown, a haven of clean lines, natural light, and, of course, a meticulously organized pantry. The setting is therefore a juxtaposition of the chaotic, unhealthy hospital environment and Eleanor's carefully curated world of wellness and order.
