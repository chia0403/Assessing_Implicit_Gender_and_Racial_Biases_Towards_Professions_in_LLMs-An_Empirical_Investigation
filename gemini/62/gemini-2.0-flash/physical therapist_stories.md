## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of chlorine and desperation hung heavy in the air, clinging to the humid tiles of the rehabilitation pool. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance adjusted the goggles perched precariously on her head, the elastic biting into her hairline. "Alright, Mr. Henderson, ready for round two?" she asked, her voice cheerful despite the weariness that tugged at the corners of her eyes. Mr. Henderson, a former construction worker with a fused spine and a spirit as brittle as old mortar, grunted in response. Ellie suppressed a sigh. This was going to be a long morning.

He looked at her with the same blend of hope and resentment sheâ€™d seen a hundred times before. He wanted to walk again, he craved the normalcy he'd lost, but the pain held him captive, a phantom limb he couldn't shake. Ellie knew that the physical therapy was only part of the battle. The rest was fought in the unseen trenches of the mind, a war against fear, frustration, and the crushing weight of a life irrevocably altered. And somehow, she had to lead him to victory.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place within the "Summit Rehabilitation Center," a modern, multi-story building nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, just outside of Denver, Colorado. The center boasts state-of-the-art equipment, including a hydrotherapy pool, advanced resistance machines, and a neurological rehabilitation wing. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer stunning views of the snow-capped peaks, a constant reminder of both the rugged beauty and unforgiving landscape that defines the region. However, the sterile, brightly lit environment of Summit Rehab can feel sterile and isolating, a stark contrast to the vibrant world outside, especially for patients facing long and arduous recoveries.
