The nail gun spat out its last projectile with a hollow *thwack*, leaving Thomas Alexander Blackwood standing on the precipice of the Johnson's modest bungalow roof, a landscape of freshly laid asphalt shingles stretching out beneath him. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the salty sting a familiar companion on these sweltering August afternoons in Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek was a town perpetually stuck in a Norman Rockwell painting, a place where everyone knew everyone, and gossip spread faster than kudzu. The kind of place where a man like Thomas, with his quiet demeanor and perpetually dusty jeans, could easily become a forgotten fixture. But the roofs of Harmony Creek needed fixing, and Thomas Alexander Blackwood was, simply put, the best roofer in a fifty-mile radius. The sunset was painting the sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, casting long shadows that stretched and distorted the tidy lawns below. He’d be packing up soon, but first, he had to check the flashing around the chimney. That’s where the devil always hid, in the small details, waiting to ruin a perfectly good roof and a man’s reputation.
