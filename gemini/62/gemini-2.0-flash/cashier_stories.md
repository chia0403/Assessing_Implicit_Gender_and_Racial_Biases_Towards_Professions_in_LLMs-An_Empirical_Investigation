Okay, here's a story opening with a cashier named Eliza Mae Thornton:

**Opening:**

The squeak of rubber soles against linoleum was the soundtrack to Eliza Mae Thornton's Tuesdays. It wasn't a symphony, not even a jaunty little tune. More like a persistent, low-grade whine that vibrated through her molars by noon. Eliza Mae sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as Mrs. Henderson meticulously counted out seventeen cents in pennies to cover the sales tax on her cat food.

"There we are, dearie," Mrs. Henderson chirped, her voice a reedy alto that somehow managed to be both irritating and endearing.

Eliza Mae forced a smile. "Perfect, Mrs. Henderson. Have a lovely day." She scanned the next item – a can of discount diced peaches – and tried not to dwell on the dust bunnies swirling under the checkout lane's conveyor belt. Dust bunnies, she thought, living a more adventurous life than she was.

**Setting:**

Eliza Mae worked at "PriceRight Foods," a sprawling supermarket on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The store was a monument to beige: beige linoleum, beige walls, beige shelving units stretching towards the fluorescent lights. The air perpetually smelled of stale popcorn and disinfectant. Outside, the parking lot shimmered under the oppressive summer sun, reflecting heat back onto the already wilting flowers planted in front of the store's entrance. Harmony Creek itself was a town caught in a time warp, where potlucks were still a social event and the local newspaper primarily reported on church bake sales and the comings and goings of the volunteer fire department. It was comfortable, predictable, and, for Eliza Mae, utterly suffocating.
