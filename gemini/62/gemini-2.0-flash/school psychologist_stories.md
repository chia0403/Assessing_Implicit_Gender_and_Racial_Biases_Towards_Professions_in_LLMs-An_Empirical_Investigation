Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on our school psychologist:

**Setting:** The story opens in the brightly lit, yet subtly chaotic, main office of Northwood Heights Elementary School. Papers stacked precariously threatened to topple from the secretary’s desk. Posters advertising the upcoming school play, "The Enchanted Forest," were slightly askew on the bulletin board. The air hummed with the combined energy of ringing phones, chattering teachers, and the occasional burst of excited laughter from passing children. It was a typical Tuesday morning in late October, just a week before the Halloween parade.

**Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and cinnamon rolls hung heavy in the air as Dr. Eleanor Victoria Hawthorne navigated the obstacle course of parent volunteers and forgotten lunchboxes in the Northwood Heights Elementary main office. Her tweed blazer, usually a symbol of professional calm, was rumpled, and a stray strand of auburn hair had escaped her meticulously styled bun. She gripped her worn leather briefcase tighter as Mrs. Higgins, the school secretary, a woman known for her encyclopedic knowledge of everyone's business, intercepted her.

"Dr. Hawthorne, just the person I wanted to see!" Mrs. Higgins exclaimed, her voice a tad too loud for the enclosed space. "Little Timmy Henderson is having… well, a *moment* in the principal's office. Said he won't go back to class without talking to you first. Seems the Enchanted Forest auditions didn't go so well. Something about a squirrel costume and stage fright, I believe." She tapped a manicured finger on a stack of permission slips. "And Principal Thompson is about to pull his hair out. Again."

Eleanor sighed, a silent prayer escaping her lips. She loved her job, truly, but some days, like today, it felt like she was single-handedly trying to hold back a tidal wave of childhood anxieties. "Thank you, Mrs. Higgins. I'll go see what I can do. And perhaps," she added with a weary smile, "we could look at a sensitivity training workshop for the audition process? Just a thought." She adjusted her briefcase and headed toward the lion's den, otherwise known as Principal Thompson's office, bracing herself for another day in the wonderfully unpredictable world of elementary school psychology.
