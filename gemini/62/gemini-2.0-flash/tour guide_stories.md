## Story Opening:

The smell of damp earth and ancient stone clung to the air, a perfume Amelia Rowan had come to associate with "Tuesday." Tuesday was always the "Catacomb Combers" tour, a claustrophobic crawl through the Roman underbelly that left her with more than just a lingering scent. This Tuesday, however, felt different. The usual murmur of nervous chatter from her group was replaced by an almost palpable silence, thick with anticipation. Even the flickering candlelight seemed to burn a little dimmer, casting elongated, unsettling shadows on the crumbling walls. Amelia, adjusting the microphone nestled against her cheek, swallowed and forced a cheerful smile.

"Alright everyone, welcome to the Catacombs of Priscilla! I'm Amelia Rowan, your guide for this evening, and I promise you, this is going to be an experience you won't soon forget... literally." She chuckled, hoping to break the tension. Only a few forced smiles returned her effort. *Wonderful,* she thought. *Dead Romans and a room full of mutes. Just what I needed.* Today, even the dead felt judgmental.

## Setting:

The Catacombs of Priscilla, Rome. A sprawling network of underground burial chambers carved from tufa rock, centuries ago, to house the remains of early Christians. The tunnels are narrow and winding, barely wide enough for two people to pass comfortably. The air is cool and damp, the temperature a constant 15 degrees Celsius year-round. Walls are adorned with ancient frescoes, many faded and damaged, depicting scenes from the Bible and early Christian life. The only light source comes from flickering electric candles placed strategically along the route, casting long, dancing shadows that play tricks on the eye. The air hangs heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying stone, and a faint, almost metallic odor that Amelia Rowan has always attributed to the presence of countless human remains buried within these very walls. The weight of history, and the bodies beneath, is palpable.
