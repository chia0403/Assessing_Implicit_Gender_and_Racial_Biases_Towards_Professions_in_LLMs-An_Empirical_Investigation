The chipped porcelain mug warmed Clara Beatrice Montgomery's hands, even though the lukewarm tea inside did little to soothe the knot of anxiety in her stomach. Rain lashed against the wide, bay window of her salon, "The Gilded Shear," blurring the vibrant colors of the autumn leaves clinging stubbornly to the trees lining Oak Street. Inside, the salon was a refuge from the grey downpour: warm, softly lit by vintage lamps, and smelling faintly of lavender and hairspray â€“ a comforting aroma that usually calmed Clara, not agitated her.

Clara exhaled slowly, steeling herself. It was only a haircut. Just another head of hair. Except, in Havenwood, some heads of hair were more significant than others.
