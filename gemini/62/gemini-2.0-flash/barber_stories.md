Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, thick with the honeyed dust of August, slanted through the grimy window of "Gavin's Gents" in the heart of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania. The town, once a bustling hub for coal mining, now wore its faded glory like a threadbare coat. The bell above the shop door jingled intermittently as customers entered and exited, a symphony of weary sighs and mumbled greetings filling the air. The scent of sandalwood aftershave hung heavy, mingling with the faint metallic tang of freshly sharpened razors and the comforting aroma of old leather from the worn barber chairs. Photographs of baseball teams from decades past lined the walls, their sepia tones a stark contrast to the chipped, emerald green paint.

**Story Opening:**

Gavin Alexander Bellwether wiped his brow with a slightly frayed, checkered towel, the gesture more out of habit than necessity. The oscillating fan, perched precariously on a stack of old magazines, did little to alleviate the oppressive heat. He surveyed his handiwork â€“ a neat, albeit slightly receding, hairline on Mr. Henderson, the town's retired postman. "There you go, Art," Gavin said, turning the chair with a practiced flick of his wrist. "Looking ten years younger."

Art Henderson chuckled, a dry, papery sound. "If only that were true, Gavin. If only." He squinted at his reflection in the cracked mirror. "You always do a good job, though. Best barber this side of the Susquehanna."

Gavin offered a thin smile. "Just trying to keep Oakhaven looking sharp, Art. One head at a time." He watched as Art fumbled for his wallet, the clink of loose change echoing in the mostly-empty shop. Gavin knew most of his regulars were struggling, just like him. The coal mine had shut down twenty years ago, taking the town's prosperity with it. But Gavin Alexander Bellwether, barber of Oakhaven, was stubborn. He'd keep Gavin's Gents open, come hell or high water, even if it meant giving more haircuts on credit than he did for cash. It was more than just a business; it was a connection, a lifeline to a community that was slowly fading away. And Gavin, more than anything, wanted to keep the flame alive.
