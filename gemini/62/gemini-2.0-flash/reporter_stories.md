## Story Opening:

The incessant ringing of the phone clawed its way into Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's consciousness, dragging her from a fitful sleep littered with shredded documents and dead ends. She slapped blindly at the nightstand, finally silencing the shrill intrusion just as the sun, a blood orange smear on the horizon, began to pierce the gap in her heavy curtains.

Amy groaned, pulling the threadbare blanket higher over her head. She knew who it would be. It always was.

The phone rang again, a short, impatient burst. Defeated, Amy snatched it up. "Hawthorne," she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.

"Get down to the docks, Amelia. Now. There's something you need to see." The voice on the other end was gravelly, urgent. It belonged to Detective Inspector Thomas O'Malley, and Amy knew better than to argue. When O'Malley called, it meant the story of a lifetime - or the end of one. Either way, she couldn't afford to miss it.

With a sigh that could rival the bellows of a dying whale, Amy hauled herself out of bed. Whatever it was, it was waiting for her down at the water's edge.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Port Blossom, Maine**, a once-thriving fishing town clinging to the edge of the Atlantic. Years of overfishing and economic downturn had left their mark, turning the bustling harbor into a graveyard of rotting docks and rusted hulls. The air is thick with the scent of salt, decaying seaweed, and the faint, metallic tang of diesel fuel. The town itself is a patchwork of weathered clapboard houses, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin, interspersed with the occasional brightly painted tourist trap, desperately trying to lure visitors with promises of authentic "Maine experience."

Despite the decay, Port Blossom retains a rugged beauty. Jagged cliffs plunge into the unforgiving sea, and dense forests of pine and fir stand sentinel on the hills overlooking the town. The people are hardy and fiercely independent, wary of outsiders but fiercely loyal to their own. They hold their secrets close, and the sea holds even more. It's a place where whispers carry on the wind, and shadows dance in the corners of every alleyway, making it the perfect breeding ground for secrets, lies, and maybe, just maybe, a story worth dying for.
