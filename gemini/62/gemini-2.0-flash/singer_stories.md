## Story Opening:

The humidity hung heavy in the air, thick and sweet like overripe mangoes. Even at 10 PM, the neon glow of Havana throbbed, a pulse of salsa rhythms and rum-fueled laughter that seeped through the cracks in the crumbling colonial walls.  Inside the dimly lit bar, "El Sonido del Mar," the band was already well into their second set, the mournful cry of the trumpet threading its way through the crowd like a silver needle.  The stage, barely larger than a generous rug, felt miles away from the worn-out velvet armchair where  **Gabriela Esperanza Flores**, her eyes closed, tried to find the courage to sing.

## Setting:

**El Sonido del Mar**, Havana, Cuba.  The bar is a dimly lit, smoky establishment clinging precariously to the edge of the Old Havana district.  Its peeling turquoise paint is barely visible under a thick layer of grime and years of cigarette smoke. String lights, missing half their bulbs, cast an uneven glow across the mismatched furniture -  rickety wooden chairs, threadbare velvet armchairs scavenged from wealthier homes, and tables stained with years of spilled rum and coffee.  The walls are adorned with faded posters of legendary Cuban musicians, their images cracked and worn like ancient maps.  A single, dusty fan whirs overhead, offering little respite from the sweltering heat.  The air is thick with the smells of cheap cigars, salty sweat, and the faint, lingering scent of sea air.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the Malecon offers a constant, mournful counterpoint to the lively music within. El Sonido del Mar isn't glamorous, but it's authentic, a place where the spirit of old Cuba clings stubbornly to life, a place where dreams are made, and more often, broken.
