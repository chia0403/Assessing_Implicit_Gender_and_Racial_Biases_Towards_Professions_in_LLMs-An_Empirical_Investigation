## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance's face, a familiar caress that usually soothed her soul. Today, though, it felt more like a sharp rebuke. She squinted against the harsh Atlantic light, her fingers numb despite the thick wool gloves, and adjusted the heavy tripod planted precariously on the jagged cliff edge. The wind, a relentless beast this morning, whipped strands of her auburn hair across her cheek, blurring her vision just as the perfect wave, the one she'd been waiting for all week, began to crest.

Damn it.

Eleanor swallowed the frustrated curse rising in her throat. Patience. She needed patience. Capturing the raw power of the North Sea was never a quick or easy task. She lowered her eye to the viewfinder of her trusty Hasselblad, its battered body a testament to years spent chasing light and shadow across every corner of the globe. The wave was still building, a monster of emerald and white, poised to crash against the unforgiving rocks below. This was it. This was the shot she'd been after. She just needed the wind to give her a break, just for a moment.

## Setting:

The story opens on the rugged coastline of the Isle of Skye, Scotland. Eleanor is perched on a precarious outcrop of volcanic rock, overlooking a turbulent stretch of the North Sea. Towering cliffs, sculpted by centuries of wind and waves, form a dramatic backdrop, their grey surfaces streaked with vibrant green patches of hardy vegetation. The air is thick with the smell of salt and seaweed. The sky is a canvas of swirling grey clouds, occasionally pierced by shafts of brilliant sunlight that illuminate the churning water. The closest landmark is a lonely, dilapidated lighthouse perched on a distant headland, its beam a faint and flickering presence against the encroaching gloom. The soundscape is dominated by the roar of the ocean, the shriek of gulls circling overhead, and the mournful wail of the wind. It is a landscape of stark beauty and untamed power, a place that both captivates and intimidates.
