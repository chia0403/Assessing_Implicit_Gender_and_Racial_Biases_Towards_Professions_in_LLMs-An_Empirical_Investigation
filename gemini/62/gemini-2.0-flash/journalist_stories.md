## Opening:

The flickering neon sign of the 'Last Stop Tavern' cast a sickly green glow across Anna Moreau's face, highlighting the deepening lines etched around her eyes. She took another long drag from her cigarette, the cherry burning a defiant crimson in the gloom. The rain, a relentless drizzle that had plagued Port Providence for the past three weeks, dripped from the brim of her fedora onto the already damp collar of her trench coat. This wasn't her usual beat. Anna Moreau, investigative journalist for the Port Providence Herald, usually chased city hall corruption and unraveled corporate conspiracies. Tonight, however, she was chasing a ghost, a whispered rumour that had clung to the salty air of the docks for decades. The kind of rumour that could either make her career or break her sanity.

## Setting:

**Port Providence, Maine, late October.**

Port Providence was a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic, a place where the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged coastline was a constant, almost suffocating lullaby. Its history was etched into the weathered clapboard houses that lined its narrow streets, a testament to generations of fishermen, sailors, and shipbuilders who had dared to wrest a living from the unforgiving sea. The air hung thick with the scent of brine, diesel, and decaying seaweed. By day, the town was a picturesque postcard of New England charm. By night, however, when the fog rolled in from the ocean, blanketing everything in a ghostly shroud, it transformed into a place of shadows and secrets, a place where old legends whispered on the wind. The Last Stop Tavern, a dimly lit watering hole on the outskirts of the docks, was a microcosm of this duality - a place where grizzled fishermen swapped tall tales and weary longshoremen drowned their sorrows, a place where the truth was often more murky than the bottom of a trawler's hold. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and cheap tobacco, a comforting, familiar aroma that did little to dispel the unease that had settled in Anna's gut.
