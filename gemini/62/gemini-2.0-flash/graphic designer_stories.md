The Tuesday morning light, typically a welcome guest in Amelia Quinnâ€™s Brooklyn apartment, felt more like an invasive interrogation under the weight of the looming deadline. It sliced through the gaps in her worn blinds, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air above her overflowing desk. Spread across the scarred surface were mood boards plastered with Bauhaus imagery, half-eaten bagels crusted with everything seasoning, and enough Pantone swatches to wallpaper a small room. Amelia rubbed sleep from her eyes, her fingers smudging a stray charcoal mark across her cheek. The caffeine from her lukewarm coffee wasn't quite kicking in, and the weight of the "Revolutionize Robotics" campaign for OmniCorp, due Friday, felt like a physical presence pressing down on her chest. Outside, the city was already roaring to life, a cacophony of car horns and distant sirens, a symphony of stress Amelia usually found invigorating. Today, it just amplified the pressure.
