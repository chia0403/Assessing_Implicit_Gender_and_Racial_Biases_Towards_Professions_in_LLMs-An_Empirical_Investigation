The aroma of toasted almonds and cardamom clung to Elara Magdalena Johansson like a second skin. It followed her through the cobbled streets of Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s Old Town, and wafted out from her bakery, “Elara’s Kanelbullar,” a beacon of warmth against the crisp November air. Today, however, the scent felt more like a suffocating blanket than a comfort. Elara, her apron dusted with flour, stared out the rain-streaked window, watching tourists huddle under umbrellas and the grey sky swallow the colourful buildings whole. The morning rush had ended hours ago, leaving the shop eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. She should be prepping for the afternoon fika crowd, shaping delicate semlor buns filled with almond paste and whipped cream. Instead, her hands lay idle, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. The annual ‘Best Baker of Stockholm’ competition was only a week away, and for the first time in five years, inspiration had completely deserted her.
