## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless percussionist on the corrugated iron roof of my office, each drop a tiny hammer against the fragile remnants of my sanity. Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a hazy shroud around the flickering neon sign outside, which stubbornly insisted on illuminating my door despite the general air of gloom clinging to the city like a damp shroud. I nursed the last swallow of lukewarm coffee, the grounds a bitter testament to another day spent staring at the phone, waiting for a case, any case, that wouldn't involve a missing chihuahua or a philandering husband.

The chimes above the door, long silent, suddenly jingled, slicing through the rhythmic downpour and my own morose contemplation. A figure, slick with rain and radiating an uneasy energy, stood silhouetted in the doorway. He looked like a storm cloud in human form, and I instinctively knew this was no chihuahua enthusiast.

"Mr. Archibald 'Archie' Fitzwilliam," the figure announced, his voice a gravelly rumble that resonated with the rain, "I need your help."

## Setting:

Archibald "Archie" Fitzwilliam's office is located above a dingy pawn shop in the heart of Rain City, a fictional metropolis perpetually shrouded in mist and melancholia. The neighborhood, once vibrant and bustling, is now a patchwork of boarded-up storefronts and flickering neon signs, a testament to the city's slow decline.

Archie's office itself is a testament to his own dwindling fortunes. The walls are peeling, revealing layers of faded wallpaper from previous tenants. A stained leather armchair sits opposite his desk, worn smooth by countless nervous clients. A half-empty bottle of cheap whiskey sits on a side table, a frequent companion during the long, silent nights. The only attempt at decoration is a framed black and white photograph of his late father, a decorated police detective, his face etched with a stern, unwavering sense of justice - a constant reminder of the legacy Archie struggles to live up to. Outside, the city groans under the weight of the rain, its symphony of despair a constant backdrop to Archie's solitary existence.
