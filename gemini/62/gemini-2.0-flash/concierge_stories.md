## Story Opening:

The scent of polished mahogany and jasmine tea hung heavy in the air of the St. Augustine Hotel's lobby, a fragrant shield against the humid Miami heat seeping in from the revolving doors. Bartholomew "Barry" Finch, impeccably dressed in his bespoke navy suit and perpetually shining shoes, straightened the already perfect stack of *New York Times* on the concierge desk. His tie, a tasteful paisley silk, was precisely aligned with the center of his crisp white shirt.

He hummed a low, almost imperceptible tune, a snippet from a Debussy prelude, as he scanned the lobby. The usual mix of tanned tourists in linen shirts and expensively dressed business executives dotted the plush velvet seating areas. A bored-looking child was attempting to scale a towering ficus tree in the corner, its branches dripping with Spanish moss. All was, as Barry preferred it, meticulously ordered and under control.

Then, the revolving doors spun open, and a whirlwind of vibrant color and frantic energy shattered the carefully constructed tranquility.
## Setting:

**The St. Augustine Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida, present day.**

The St. Augustine Hotel is a legendary establishment, a relic of Miami Beach's golden age, meticulously preserved. Think Art Deco grandeur meets modern luxury. It boasts:

*   **Exterior:** A towering white edifice adorned with intricate geometric patterns, catching the sunlight and gleaming like a pearl.
*   **Lobby:** Sprawling, with soaring ceilings, polished marble floors, and original Art Deco fixtures. Intricate murals depicting scenes of Florida flora and fauna adorn the walls.
*   **Concierge Desk:** Situated prominently near the entrance, a dark mahogany masterpiece cluttered with meticulously organized brochures, reservation books, and a discreetly hidden supply of Barry's preferred herbal teas.
*   **Atmosphere:** Sophisticated and refined, but with a touch of sun-drenched relaxation. The air is thick with the scent of expensive perfumes and the gentle murmur of polite conversation.
*   **Clientele:** A mix of wealthy tourists, high-powered executives, and the occasional celebrity seeking anonymity. They expect the highest level of service and discretion.
