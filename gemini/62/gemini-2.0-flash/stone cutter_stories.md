## Story Opening:

The rasp of iron against granite was the soundtrack of Thomas Ashton's life. Each scrape and grind, each tiny shard of stone that flew and stung his cheek, was a note in a symphony heâ€™d composed for himself, a melody both beautiful and brutal. He knelt, the morning sun warming the back of his thick neck, his calloused hands guiding the chisel with practiced ease. The air, still crisp with the promise of autumn, carried the scent of damp earth and the faint, lingering sweetness of late-blooming honeysuckle. He paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his leather-gloved hand, and squinted at the progress he'd made on the angel's wing. It was coming, slow and painstaking, but it was coming.

## Setting:

The setting is a small, family-run stone yard nestled at the foot of the Black Mountains in rural Wales. The yard, simply named "Ashton & Sons, Stone Masons," has been in Thomas Ashton's family for three generations. It's a chaotic but organized jumble of granite blocks, marble slabs, half-finished statues, and various tools of the trade. A ramshackle wooden shed, serving as both workshop and office, leans precariously against a stack of gravestones. The yard is flanked on one side by a rushing stream and on the other by a field where sheep graze, their bleating a constant, comforting backdrop. The closest village, Llangollen, is a few miles down the winding mountain road, a place where Thomas occasionally ventures for supplies or a pint at the local pub, "The Dragon's Breath." The entire area is imbued with a sense of timelessness, of ancient stories carved into the very landscape itself.
