The August humidity clung to Officer Isabella “Izzy” Rossi like a second skin. She pulled at the collar of her uniform shirt, the stiff fabric chafing against her neck. The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the smells of stale beer, greasy street food, and the faint, metallic tang of the Bronx River which sluggishly wound its way through the neighborhood.

Izzy stood on the corner of Tremont Avenue and Arthur Avenue, the heart of the Bronx's Little Italy. Neon signs sputtered promises of authentic pasta dishes and cannoli, their vibrant glow doing little to pierce the deepening twilight. The evening was usually a vibrant hum, a cacophony of Italian chatter, lively music spilling from open doorways, and the clatter of silverware on ceramic plates. Tonight, however, a palpable tension hung in the air, heavier even than the humidity. A low thrum of unease vibrated beneath the surface of the familiar sounds, a ripple of anxiety that Izzy could feel prickling at the back of her neck.

She took a deep breath, trying to center herself. This wasn't unusual. Little Italy had its share of low-level crime - petty theft, the occasional bar fight, the even rarer mob rumble. But tonight felt different. Tonight felt like something was brewing. And Izzy, a third-generation Italian-American cop, knew that feeling intimately.
