The prairie wind, a constant, mournful sigh, whipped at Jedediah "Jed" Tanner's worn felt hat as he surveyed the parched land stretching before him. The sun, a merciless eye in the vast blue sky, beat down on the cracked earth, turning the normally vibrant green of the buffalo grass to a brittle, straw-like yellow. Dust devils danced on the horizon, malevolent spirits mocking his efforts to coax life from this unforgiving landscape.

He stood on the porch of his weathered, two-story ranch house, its peeling paint a testament to the relentless elements and his own dwindling resources. The house, a square, solid structure built by his grandfather generations ago, stood as a lonely sentinel on the high plains of eastern Montana, a few miles south of the small, dwindling town of Grass Creek. Jed, all six-foot-four of him, leaned heavily against a porch post, his tanned face etched with worry lines that spoke of droughts, blizzards, and the constant struggle to keep Tanner Ranch afloat. This summer was proving to be the worst yet, and Jedediah Tanner knew in his gut that this drought could break him, and everything his family had worked so hard to build.
