Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a stockbroker as the main character:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

**Setting:** A sleek, modern apartment overlooking Central Park in New York City. It’s a Tuesday morning in late October. The air outside is crisp, a promise of fall's full embrace. The apartment is minimalist, decorated in shades of grey and steel with splashes of vibrant modern art – expensive, carefully curated, and cold. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air, a stark contrast to the pristine surfaces.

**Story Opening:**

The screech of the espresso machine ripped through the otherwise silent apartment, followed by a long sigh as it completed its task. **Jonathan Maxwell Sterling III** stared blankly at the dark, rich liquid dripping into his favorite ceramic mug. He wasn’t sure he could face another day like yesterday. Another barrage of calls from increasingly desperate clients, another internal battle between conscience and commission, another wave of nausea churning in his gut. He rubbed a hand across his tired eyes, the sharp, city skyline blurring slightly behind the smudges on his designer glasses. 

Jonathan knew, deep down, that this life – the life he’d meticulously crafted, the life his family had practically demanded he inhabit – was slowly killing him. He just didn't know how much longer he could pretend it wasn't. He took a long, deliberate sip of the espresso, the bitterness echoing the taste in his mouth. The market was a monster, and he was just one more cog in its insatiable machine. And today, he suspected, the monster was hungry.
