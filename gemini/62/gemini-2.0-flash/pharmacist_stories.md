The fluorescent lights of the "Discount Drugs Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of suburban despair that Elias Thorne had grown intimately familiar with. He glanced up at the clock, a stark, digital display flashing 7:58 PM. Two more minutes until he could escape. Two more minutes of fielding questions about generic brands versus name brands, the endless droning complaints about escalating drug prices, and the occasional, unsettlingly flirty cough syrup request from Mrs. Henderson from down the street.

Elias Thorne, Pharm.D., ran a weary hand through his thinning brown hair. He'd envisioned something grander for his career, something more akin to cutting-edge research or contributing to groundbreaking medical advancements. Instead, he was here, surrounded by shelves stacked high with pain relievers, antihistamines, and the fading dreams of a small-town pharmacist in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio.

Harmony Creek, population just shy of ten thousand, was the kind of place where everyone knew your business, and Elias was acutely aware that his business was, well, strictly business. He'd arrived five years ago, fresh out of pharmacy school, filled with naive optimism. Now, the optimism had been thoroughly scrubbed away by the realities of insurance claims, demanding patients, and the soul-crushing monotony of filling prescriptions. The only excitement Harmony Creek offered was the occasional bake sale at the Methodist church and the annual "Corn on the Cob" festival, both of which Elias actively avoided.
