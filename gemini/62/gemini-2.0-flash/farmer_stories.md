## Story Opening:

The dust devil snaked across Ezekiel Silas Thorne’s newly tilled field like a mischievous spirit, mocking his efforts. Zeke squinted, wiping a gritty film from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. The sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down with the unwavering intensity of a creditor demanding payment. This late in July, they should have seen rain. Should have felt the cool kiss of a summer storm instead of this suffocating, bone-dry heat. He tasted the metallic tang of worry in his mouth, a flavor he’d become intimately familiar with these past three years. He glanced over at his scarecrow, a patchwork effigy he'd lovingly named Silas, and a humorless smile tugged at the corner of his lips. "Looks like you're earnin' your keep today, old friend," he muttered, the words lost to the whisper of the relentless wind. But the crows, perched on the barbed wire fence, remained stubbornly unmoved, their obsidian eyes glinting with a knowing, unsettling intelligence.

## Setting:

The story opens on the edge of Dust Bowl Country, specifically, a struggling farm located in **Harmon County, Oklahoma**, in the year **1936**. Ezekiel Silas Thorne's farm, a meager spread carved out of unforgiving land, consists of approximately 160 acres. The land is predominantly flat, cracked and parched earth stretching as far as the eye can see. A dilapidated farmhouse, weathered grey by decades of sun and wind, sits precariously on its foundation, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. A rusty windmill, desperately trying to catch even the faintest breeze, creaks and groans a mournful song. Patches of scraggly corn stalks stand in the fields, stunted and yellowed, a testament to the lack of rain. The only vibrant color comes from the stubborn weeds that refuse to yield, their tenacity a painful reminder of what the land should be. In the distance, the hazy blue of the Wichita Mountains provides a stark and desolate backdrop. The air is thick with dust, the ever-present threat of another storm looming large, a storm that will bring no life, only more hardship.
