**Story Opening:**

The scent of lemon and despair hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail in the opulent, yet subtly decaying, halls of Blackwood Manor. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, her hands red and raw from scrubbing, straightened her back, a small groan escaping her lips. She surveyed the polished, albeit slightly scratched, parquet floor in the Grand Ballroom, the faint reflection of the enormous, dust-laden chandelier shimmering above. It was nearly perfect, nearly gleaming, nearly ready to deceive the next round of potential buyers into believing this monstrous estate wasn't slowly collapsing under the weight of its history and the neglect of its sole inhabitant.

**Setting:**

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the Cornish coast, was a testament to a bygone era of wealth and influence. Built in the late 18th century, its granite walls were now stained with sea salt and clinging ivy. The interior, once a showcase of imported marble and priceless artwork, was now a shadowy labyrinth of echoing hallways and forgotten chambers. Cobwebs draped like macabre lace from the vaulted ceilings, and the silence was broken only by the mournful cry of gulls and the creak of the house settling on its foundations. Most of the furniture was covered in heavy, embroidered cloths, preserving the illusion of grandeur while hiding the decay beneath. The grounds, once meticulously manicured gardens, had succumbed to the wildness of the Cornish landscape, a tangled mess of overgrown rose bushes and windswept grasses. Blackwood Manor was a place where secrets festered in the shadows and the past refused to stay buried.
