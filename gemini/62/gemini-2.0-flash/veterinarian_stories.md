The biting wind whipped snow into Dr. Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red. Dusk was quickly turning to night, painting the stark Wyoming landscape in shades of indigo and charcoal. The headlights of her battered Ford pickup sliced through the blizzard, illuminating the swirling white chaos just long enough to keep her from driving into a snowdrift. The rhythmic thump of the tires against the icy road was a monotonous lullaby, a stark contrast to the frantic bleating of the sheep she was currently hurtling towards.

Amelia, a woman whose calloused hands and perpetually windswept hair belied her gentle touch, gripped the steering wheel tighter. This wasn't how she'd imagined spending her Saturday evening. She'd been halfway through a meticulously planned spaghetti Bolognese when old Mrs. Olsen had called, her voice thick with panic, reporting that one of her ewes was down and struggling, likely with lambing complications.

Amelia sighed, the condensation fogging the windshield. This was the life she'd chosen, the life she loved: serving the small, isolated communities scattered across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Bighorn Basin. She'd traded the sterile, predictable environment of a city practice for the grit and grime of ranch life, for the raw, untamed beauty of the Wyoming wilderness, and for the profound satisfaction of bringing new life into a world that often felt harsh and unforgiving. But tonight, battling the elements with only her veterinary bag and a whole lot of grit, that satisfaction felt a million miles away.
