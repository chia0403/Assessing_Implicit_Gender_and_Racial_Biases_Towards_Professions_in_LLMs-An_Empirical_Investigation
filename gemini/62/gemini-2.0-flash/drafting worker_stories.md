## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The year is 1958. The city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a symphony of steel and grit. Smoke billows from the towering mills that line the Allegheny River, staining the sky a perpetual twilight. Narrow streets, paved with cobblestones worn smooth by decades of industry, climb precariously up steep hills. The air hums with the relentless clang and roar of production, a constant reminder of the city's heartbeat. Within a cramped, dimly lit office on the fifth floor of the "Ironclad Building" in the Strip District, dust motes dance in the weak sunlight filtering through a grimy window.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic scratching of graphite on vellum was the only sound accompanying the rumble of the city outside. Margaret Eleanor Hawthorne, a young woman barely past twenty, leaned intently over her drafting table, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her neatly bobbed brown hair, usually styled to perfection, was starting to come undone, a testament to the hours she'd already poured into this particular blueprint. The scent of sharpened pencils and old paper hung heavy in the air, a comforting, almost maternal aroma to Margaret, who had practically grown up in this very office. Outside, the noon whistle shrieked, a piercing sound that signaled lunchtime to the thousands of workers scattered across the city. Margaret barely registered it. She was lost in a labyrinth of lines and angles, a world of meticulously measured dimensions and the silent promise of something grand being built from her designs. This wasnâ€™t just a job to Margaret; it was a calling. It was a chance to leave her mark on a city defined by iron and ingenuity, even if that mark was only visible in the fine print of a blueprint. But today, something was off. A niggling feeling, like a splinter under her fingernail, kept pulling her attention away from the delicate arc of the crane's support beam she was drawing. The feeling wasn't new; it had been building for weeks, a quiet unease that shadowed her every move. And Margaret, with the precise mind of a draftsman, knew that unease, like a misplaced decimal point, could unravel everything.
