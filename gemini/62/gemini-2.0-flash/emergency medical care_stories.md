**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill clung to the air in Oakhaven, a small, rural town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The main street, usually bustling with farmers and shopkeepers, was deserted save for a stray dog scavenging through an overturned trash can. The sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the sunrise to come, but the darkness still held sway, casting long, eerie shadows. The rain from the previous night had left the pavement slick and glistening under the weak streetlights, and the scent of damp earth permeated the air. In the distance, the mournful wail of a train whistle echoed through the quiet valley.

**Story Opening:**

The harsh, insistent bleat of the emergency dispatch radio ripped through the pre-dawn quiet of the Oakhaven Volunteer Ambulance station, jolting Dr. Eleanor Rose Thornton awake. She groaned, burying her face deeper into the thin, scratchy pillow of the cot she used for overnight shifts. The red numbers of the digital clock beside her blared 4:17 AM. She cursed under her breath, throwing her legs over the side of the cot and reaching for her boots. This was exactly why she hated overnight calls. The darkness always seemed to amplify the tragedy, making everything feel heavier, more desperate.

"Oakhaven Medic One, respond to a reported structure fire. Address is 14 Maple Street. Possible entrapment."

Eleanorâ€™s heart lurched. 14 Maple Street. That was Mrs. Henderson's house, the sweet old woman who always had a plate of cookies ready during the summer street fair. Eleanor shoved her feet into her boots, adrenaline coursing through her veins. She grabbed her medic bag, its familiar weight a comfort in the face of the unknown, and scrambled towards the ambulance bay.
