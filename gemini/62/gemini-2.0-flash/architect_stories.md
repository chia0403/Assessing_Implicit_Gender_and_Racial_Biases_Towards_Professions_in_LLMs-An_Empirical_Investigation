The biting wind whipped around Elias Vance's ankles, stinging his exposed skin even through the thick wool socks. He jammed his hands deeper into the pockets of his worn, tweed overcoat, hunching his shoulders against the onslaught. The early November air, thick with the scent of brine and impending snow, hung heavy over the skeletal remains of what had once been the Grand Majestic Hotel. 

The setting was Port Blossom, a seaside town clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of northern Maine. Its heyday of roaring twenties glamour and celebrity summer vacations had long faded, leaving behind a quiet melancholy that clung to the salt-laced air. The Grand Majestic, once the town's shining jewel, was now a hollowed-out shell, gutted by a fire ten years prior and left to rot, a jagged silhouette against the stormy sky.

Elias, a man etched with the lines of tireless work and quiet contemplation, gazed up at the crumbling facade. The charred wood groaned under the pressure of the wind, a mournful song that echoed the silence in Elias's own heart. He pulled a well-worn leather-bound notebook from his coat pocket, the pages filled with sketches and annotations, each a testament to his unwavering belief in the possibility of breathing life back into this forgotten landmark. This was his sanctuary, his obsession, his second chance. He was Elias Vance, architect, and he was going to resurrect the Grand Majestic.
