**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance surveyed the overflowing waiting room with a practiced calm that belied the churning in her stomach. The Tuesday afternoon crowd was particularly dense. It was the anniversary of the Westbridge Bridge collapse, she realized, a local tragedy that still cast a long shadow over the close-knit community. She recognized Mrs. Hathaway, whose insomnia always spiked around this time of year, and young Liam Peterson, the high school quarterback, whose performance anxiety had worsened since the incident. Each face held a story, a weight, a silent plea she was entrusted to unravel. Eleanor took a deep breath, straightened the lapel of her tweed jacket, and summoned her most empathetic smile. "Right then," she murmured to herself, "Let's get to work."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the quaint, historically-rich town of Westbridge, Massachusetts, nestled along the banks of the Merrimack River. Dr. Vance's office is located in a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, just a few blocks from the town square. The building, painted a calming shade of sage green, houses "The Westbridge Wellness Center," a small, private practice she co-owns with a physical therapist and a massage therapist. Inside, Eleanor's office is a sanctuary of tranquility. Sunlight streams through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating bookshelves overflowing with texts on psychology, philosophy, and literature. Comfortable armchairs flank a small, antique coffee table where tissues and a selection of herbal teas are always within reach. Soft classical music plays quietly in the background, creating an atmosphere of safety and openness, a stark contrast to the underlying anxieties that often fill the room. Outside, the sounds of Westbridge - the distant chime of the church bell, the rumble of an occasional delivery truck, the chatter of schoolchildren - provide a constant reminder of the world outside, a world her patients are struggling to navigate.
