Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, centered around a salesperson named Alistair Finch:

**Setting:** The biting November wind whipped down Chicago's Magnificent Mile, swirling fallen leaves and half-eaten hot dogs into miniature tornadoes around Alistair's ankles. The imposing facades of luxury retailers gleamed under a bruised, pre-storm sky, their windows reflecting Alistair's own grim determination. He stood outside "Exquisite Timepieces," a haven of gleaming steel and meticulously crafted movements, feeling a knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.

**Story Opening:**

Alistair Finch straightened his tie, the silk feeling suddenly scratchy against his skin.  He could taste the lukewarm coffee he’d choked down that morning, laced with the bitterness of looming deadlines. His quota for the month of November was brutally high, a figure that danced mockingly in his head every time he checked his dashboard.  He took a deep breath, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace. Today, Alistair was determined to conquer "Exquisite Timepieces." He had a pitch, a promise, and a brand of revolutionary watch insurance – the kind that covered everything from deep-sea diving mishaps to the existential dread of owning a Rolex that just wasn't *quite* right – that he believed would be a perfect fit for their clientele. He just needed to get past Ms. Dubois, the notoriously frosty store manager who, according to office legend, once made a grown man cry by pointing out a microscopic imperfection on his tie. Alistair Finch adjusted his briefcase, picturing the commission, picturing the leaderboard… and steeled himself. The wind howled again, seeming to urge him forward. “Showtime,” he muttered under his breath, and pushed open the heavy glass door.
