## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the Evergreen Mental Health Clinic hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the rain drumming against the windowpane. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, steepled her fingers and leaned forward. Across the worn, floral patterned armchair sat Mr. Herbert Finch, a wiry man with eyes that darted like trapped birds. He hadn't spoken in ten minutes, only picked at a loose thread on his tweed jacket. Eleanor let the silence stretch, a familiar tool in her arsenal, a way to encourage the unspoken to surface.

"Mr. Finch," she finally said, her voice a calm, measured tone. "You mentioned last week that the dreams were…changing."

Mr. Finch flinched, his gaze snapping to hers before quickly averting back to the thread. "They... they're getting clearer, Doctor. Too clear. And they're..." He swallowed hard, a visible tremor running through his frame. "They're starting to bleed into the waking world."

Eleanor felt a chill prickle her skin, despite the warm, stale air of the clinic. "Bleed?" she echoed, carefully keeping her voice neutral. "Can you elaborate on that, Mr. Finch?"

The air crackled with unspoken anxieties. Eleanor knew, with a sinking feeling, that this wasn't just another case of insomnia-fueled nightmares. This felt different. This felt…wrong.

## Setting:

The Evergreen Mental Health Clinic occupied the second floor of a nondescript brick building in the heart of Oakhaven, a small, perpetually overcast town nestled in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Oakhaven was a town steeped in a quiet, almost oppressive, melancholy. The air always felt damp, the moss grew thick on the rooftops, and the evergreens seemed to whisper secrets into the wind. The Clinic itself was a product of good intentions, but strained resources. The waiting room featured mismatched furniture, dog-eared magazines, and a faint, lingering smell of disinfectant. Eleanor's office, while tidy, was similarly unpretentious, furnished with the aforementioned floral armchair, a sturdy oak desk piled high with files, a framed diploma from the University of California, Berkeley, and a small, struggling fern on the windowsill, a testament to Eleanor's persistent, if often unsuccessful, attempts to bring a little life into the sterile environment. The overall atmosphere was one of muted hope, tinged with the pervasive weight of the stories held within its walls. Outside, the relentless rain mirrored the emotional downpour that often flooded the clinic's halls.
