## Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Wanderlust Dreams Travel" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's fingers on her mahogany desk. Outside, the Seattle rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows, blurring the postcard-perfect images of sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains displayed within. Eleanor sighed, a sound as subtle as the rustle of the meticulously organized travel brochures piled around her. It was Tuesday, 2:17 PM, and she hadn’t had a single client since Mr. Henderson canceled his Alaskan cruise after "realizing he gets seasick even in the bathtub." Eleanor chewed on the inside of her cheek. Sales were down, Mr. Hawthorne, the notoriously grumpy owner, was breathing down her neck, and all she wanted was to be *on* one of those beaches, not booking someone else’s escape.

## Setting:

The year is 2023. "Wanderlust Dreams Travel," tucked away on a slightly-too-quiet street in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, is a microcosm of organized chaos. The walls are painted a calming teal, meant to evoke the ocean, but the effect is somewhat lost under the sheer volume of travel posters and maps plastered everywhere. A world clock hangs precariously above Eleanor's desk, showing the time in various tourist hotspots around the globe. The air is thick with the scent of lavender air freshener and the faint, lingering aroma of stale coffee. A perpetually half-empty water cooler gurgles in the corner, and a stack of "Deal of the Week" flyers, featuring discounted trips to Myrtle Beach, sit abandoned on the reception desk. Despite its aspirational name and colorful decor, "Wanderlust Dreams Travel" feels a little like a forgotten corner of the world, a place where dreams are processed, packaged, and sold, but rarely lived.
