The fluorescent hum of the high school corridor vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's worn-out sneakers.  The beige linoleum floor reflected the harsh overhead lights, making the entire space feel sterile and slightly suffocating.  Dust motes danced in the scant rays of sunlight filtering through the grimy windows of Northwood High, a school clinging to the edge of the city, its decaying brick facade a testament to neglected dreams.  Amelia Blackwood, a school psychologist with tired eyes and a perpetually rumpled cardigan, adjusted her worn-out shoulder bag, the weight of unspoken anxieties pressing down on her.  Today, a new student, a transfer from a seemingly idyllic prep school, was supposed to be her first official case.  Whispers followed her, soft and insidious, like the rustle of autumn leaves in a graveyard.  Northwood High had a reputation for whispers, for the unspoken traumas that clung to its hallowed—or rather, hallowed-less—halls like an unwelcome shroud.  She knew, from the cryptic notes scrawled by the office staff, that Ethan "Echo" Vance, the transfer, had a history, a past that she had a chilling premonition would resonate with the silent pain of this particular school.
