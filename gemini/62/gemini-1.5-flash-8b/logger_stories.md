The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Cascade Range, stinging Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks.  Snow, already thick on the lower slopes, clung to the pines like petrified breath.  Elias, a grizzled logger with eyes the colour of weathered driftwood and hands that seemed permanently stained with pine resin, hacked at the trunk of a towering Douglas fir.  The rhythmic clang of his axe echoed through the silent forest, a lonely symphony against the mournful cry of the wind.

The year was 1928.  The logging town of Alder Creek, nestled in a valley carved by centuries of glacial ice, existed on the rhythm of the saw and the groan of the timber.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the dense canopy, illuminating the skeletal remains of felled giants that lay scattered across the forest floor like fallen gods.  Elias knew this forest intimately, its secrets woven into the very fibres of his being. He knew the subtle shift in the wind that heralded a storm, the telltale snap of a branch that whispered of danger.  He knew, perhaps more than anyone, the price of ambition and the unforgiving nature of the wilderness.
