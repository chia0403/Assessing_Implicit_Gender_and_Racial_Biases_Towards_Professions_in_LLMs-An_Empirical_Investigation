The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, orange glow across Amelia Stone's face, highlighting the faint dust motes dancing in the air above the mahogany bar.  The clinking of ice, the low murmur of conversation, and the occasional, sharp laugh of a patron formed a familiar, if sometimes jarring, symphony.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a perpetually tired smile, expertly poured a shot of whiskey, the rhythmic motion as precise as a practiced dance.  Tonight, the usual clientele was unusually quiet, a hush settling over the dimly lit tavern as if anticipation, thick and heavy, hung in the air.  The only other sound was the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a counterpoint to the quietude, a metronome marking time as Amelia waited for the next order.  The town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian mountains, held its breath, unaware of the storm brewing just beneath the surface of its sleepy facade.
