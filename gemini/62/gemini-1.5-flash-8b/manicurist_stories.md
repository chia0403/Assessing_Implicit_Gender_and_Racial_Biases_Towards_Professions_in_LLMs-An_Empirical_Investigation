The fluorescent hum of "Nails & Nonsense" vibrated through Amelia Hawthorne’s fingertips as she meticulously painted a delicate, coral-toned design on a client’s nail.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the perpetually overcast mood of the city.  Rain, a persistent, almost mournful drizzle, hammered against the small, single-pane windows of the cramped salon.  Amelia, with her perpetually-tangled auburn braid and the faint scent of lavender always clinging to her,  found herself lost in the rhythmic clicking of the electric file, the soft sigh of the air compressor, and the muted chatter of her clients.  The salon, tucked away on a side street near Brick Lane, was a tiny haven of pastel hues and the quiet hum of a thousand manicured desires.  Each meticulously-shaped nail, a tiny fortress of colour, was a microcosm of the city's restless energy.  It was a far cry from the bustling chaos she found herself increasingly drawn away from; the city was always calling, whispering promises of adventure.
