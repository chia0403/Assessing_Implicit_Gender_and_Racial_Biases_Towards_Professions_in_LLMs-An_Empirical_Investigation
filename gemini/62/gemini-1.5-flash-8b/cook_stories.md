The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the cobbled streets of  Oldport, stinging Amelia Cavendish's cheeks as she hurried towards the "Salty Siren."  The air, thick with the smell of brine and woodsmoke, was a familiar comfort, a scent she inhaled deeply, a balm against the chill.  Oldport, nestled between the jagged cliffs and the churning sea, was a town sculpted from the very heart of the Atlantic, a place where the rhythm of life was dictated by the tides and the creaks of ancient timbers.  Amelia, a cook renowned for her sea-faring stews and her tempestuous spirit, was already late.  The aroma of roasted scallops and sizzling chorizo from the Salty Siren, usually a symphony of tempting scents, was oddly muted tonight, a fact that worried her more than the icy wind.  Tonight, a particularly important feast was planned, a celebration for the sea captain's return from a perilous voyage.  Failure was not an option.
