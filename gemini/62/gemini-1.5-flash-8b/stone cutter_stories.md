The rasping screech of the chisel biting into stone echoed across the desolate plateau, a sound swallowed by the vast, ochre expanse.  Dust motes danced in the harsh, midday sun, illuminating the jagged peaks and swirling canyons that ringed the quarry.  This was the domain of Bartholomew Stoneheart, a stone cutter known throughout the fractured kingdom of Aeridor for his unwavering skill and, more ominously, his unsettling silence.  He was a man carved from the very rock he worked with, his weathered face and hands a testament to years spent in the relentless sun and the cold, unforgiving grip of the mountain.  Today, however, a tremor, barely perceptible to the seasoned eye, ran through the quarry walls, and Bartholomew felt it in the deep, hollow resonance that vibrated through his very bones.
