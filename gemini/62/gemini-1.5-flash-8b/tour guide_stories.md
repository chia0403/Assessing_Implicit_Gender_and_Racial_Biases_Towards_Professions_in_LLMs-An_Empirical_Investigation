The biting November wind whipped Amelia Ashworth's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Yorkshire Moors.  Below, the village of Grimstone huddled like a flock of frightened sheep, its few cottages barely visible through the swirling mist.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide with eyes that held the secrets of centuries past, adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel.  Today's tour, "Whispers of the Moors," was proving less than captivating.  The forecast had been relentlessly grim, mirroring the brooding history she hoped to unravel for her small group of tourists.  Usually, the moors hummed with the vibrant energy of the autumnal colours and the wild cries of curlews, but today, only the mournful howl of the wind echoed through the desolate landscape.  Her breath puffed out in visible clouds as she scanned the horizon, searching for some sign of the ancient, mystical places she had promised to reveal.  Her meticulous itinerary, meticulously planned around the scheduled arrival of the tourists, felt as unreliable as the weather itself.  This particular patch of the moors, the Whispering Dale, held a darker, more ominous history than she had initially anticipated.  A history that seemed to cling to the air itself, palpable and chilling.
