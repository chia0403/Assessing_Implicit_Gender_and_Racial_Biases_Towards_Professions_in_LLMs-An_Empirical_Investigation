The chipped paint of the chalkboard, a faded, cheerful yellow, reflected the muted light of the early morning.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the classroom, illuminating tiny, colourful drawings â€“ a sun with too many rays, a house with a crooked chimney, a rainbow that seemed to touch the ceiling.  This was Ms. Amelia Blackwood's domain, the heart of the Whispering Pines Kindergarten, a haven nestled in the quiet foothills of the Appalachians.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the faint whisper of the nearby creek.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, surveyed the room.  Empty tables, each adorned with a miniature flower pot filled with a single, wilting daisy, awaited the arrival of her little charges.
