The scent of lilies, jasmine, and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of Amelia Butterfield's little shop, "Blooms by the Bay."  Sunlight, fractured by the vibrant floral displays, painted fleeting patterns on the worn, polished wooden floor.  Amelia, a woman with hands as delicate as porcelain and eyes the colour of a summer sky, meticulously arranged a bouquet of deep crimson roses.  Each stem, each petal, seemed to hold a silent story.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the shipyard's cranes echoed across the bay, a constant, industrial counterpoint to the quiet artistry within.  It was a Tuesday morning, the kind where the gulls cried louder and the salty tang of the sea mingled with the sweet perfume of her flowers, a familiar melody in the life of this small coastal town.
