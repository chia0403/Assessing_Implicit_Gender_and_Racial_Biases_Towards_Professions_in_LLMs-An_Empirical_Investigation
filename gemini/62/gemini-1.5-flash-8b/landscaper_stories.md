The late afternoon sun, a bruised purple fading into the slate grey of the approaching Cornish storm, cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown rhododendron bushes.  Rain, fat and relentless, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, a constant, rhythmic drumming that accompanied the low, guttural sigh of the wind whistling through the gaps in the ancient stone walls. This was the domain of  Bartholomew "Barty"  Finch, self-proclaimed 'Landscaper of the Lost Gardens,' and today, he was facing a particularly thorny problem.  The overgrown, neglected estate of Trelawney Manor, nestled deep within the whispering woods, was his latest challenge.  The manor itself, a monolithic, ivy-clad structure looming like a forgotten giant, stood silhouetted against the encroaching darkness, a testament to the passing of generations and the capricious whims of nature.  Barty, with his weathered hands and a stubborn streak as resilient as the Cornish granite, was determined to reclaim its lost beauty, one meticulously pruned rose bush at a time.
