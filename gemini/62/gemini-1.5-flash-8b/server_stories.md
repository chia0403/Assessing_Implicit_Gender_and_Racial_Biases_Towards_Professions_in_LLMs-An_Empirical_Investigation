The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s face, highlighting the faint smudges of coffee already ingrained into her uniform.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal awning, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her own heart hammering against her ribs.  The air inside the diner, usually thick with the aroma of frying bacon and simmering coffee, was tonight thin and stale, like a forgotten breath.  Amelia, barely 20 but already bearing the weary weight of the night, wiped down a sticky counter, the greasy residue clinging to her fingers like a second skin. The diner, once bustling with the boisterous laughter of regulars, was now eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of a leaky faucet in the back.  This was Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, and tonight, it felt like the end of the world.
