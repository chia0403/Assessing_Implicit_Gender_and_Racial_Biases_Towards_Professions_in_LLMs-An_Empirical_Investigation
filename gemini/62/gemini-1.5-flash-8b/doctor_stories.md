Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Dr. Elara Nightingale's thoughts.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and something subtly metallic, a smell that clung to her, like a second skin.  The small, cluttered clinic, nestled in the heart of the impoverished district known as the Shadowlands, was more of a makeshift dispensary than a proper medical facility.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak sunlight piercing the gloom, highlighting the chipped paint and the faded posters advertising outdated remedies.  Elara, a woman of barely thirty with eyes the colour of stormy seas, hunched over a patient's chart, her brow furrowed in concentration. The patient, a young boy named Leo, lay on a threadbare examination table, his breathing shallow and ragged.  The rain outside intensified, threatening to flood the already sodden streets.  This was a common affliction in the Shadowlands, an affliction that often went unaddressed, an affliction that Elara felt a profound responsibility to fight against.
