The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was a constant, almost imperceptible drone, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  He hunched over his drafting table, the precise lines of a new bridge – the Aurora Bridge, the project whispered through the air – etched onto the translucent tracing paper.  Each carefully drawn curve and unwavering straight edge represented not just lines on paper, but hopes and anxieties, budgets and deadlines.  Elias, a drafting worker at the Consolidated Engineering Firm, was a master of the minutiae, the man who translated blueprints into reality.

The setting was a small, windowless room in the sprawling, steel-and-glass tower that housed Consolidated Engineering.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the almost-sweet tang of correction fluid, was oppressive.  Rows of drafting tables, each a miniature altar to precision, lined the room.  The rhythmic clicking of mechanical pencils, the hushed whispers of colleagues discussing structural integrity, and the occasional clang of a dropped tool were the only sounds that pierced the ambient hum.   Dust motes danced in the weak shafts of light filtering down from the high ceiling, highlighting the meticulous diagrams spread across the tabletops.  Elias's own table, a utilitarian slab of dark wood, was his personal battlefield, covered in layers of tracing paper, each one meticulously labelled with project details and revisions.
