The flickering neon sign of "Iron Will Fitness" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked pavement.  A lone figure, Amelia Josephine Hayes, stood silhouetted against the hazy city lights, her athletic form perfectly poised despite the chill wind whipping through the alley.  Rain beaded on her sculpted, grey workout leggings, glistening in the artificial light.  Amelia, 32, her usual vibrant energy tempered by the late-night gloom, adjusted the strap of her water bottle, the metallic clink echoing unnervingly in the deserted alley.  This was her quiet hour, the hour before the first sunrise workout class, a time for reflection and the quiet hum of preparation.  Tonight, however, that quiet hum was laced with a premonition â€“ a feeling of something amiss, of an unseen shadow lurking in the shadows of the city, a shadow that seemed to follow her even in the solitude of the alley. The fitness center, usually a hive of activity, was now eerily silent, its interior a dark, cavernous void.
