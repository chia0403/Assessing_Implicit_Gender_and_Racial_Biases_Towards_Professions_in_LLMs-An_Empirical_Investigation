The chipped Formica countertop reflected Amelia Nightingale's worried frown.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering fluorescent lights of the Personnel Department, danced in the air around her.  Ten-thirty AM.  Another Monday.  Another mountain of paperwork.  Her meticulously organized filing system, a testament to her meticulous nature, seemed to mock her.  Today, amidst the avalanche of performance reviews, expense reports, and new hire packets, lay a single, crumpled note.  It was addressed to her, in a scrawling hand that felt almost painfully familiar.  It was from Mr. Alistair Finch.

The setting:  The sprawling, beige-walled offices of "Global Zenith," a multinational corporation headquartered in the heart of downtown Metropolis.  The air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune, a constant companion to the rhythmic clicking of Amelia's keyboard and the hushed whispers of colleagues.  The cubicles, cramped and identical, resembled tiny, impersonal cages.  The scent of stale coffee and cheap disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of corporate life.  Amelia, a petite woman with a cascade of dark brown hair pulled back in a severe bun, felt a knot tighten in her stomach.  Mr. Finch.  He was notoriously difficult, notoriously demanding, and notoriously...well, a bit of a mystery.  This note, with its cryptic request, threatened to plunge her neatly organized world into chaos.
