The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast an oily, emerald glow on the rain-slicked streets of the Lower East Side.  A biting wind, sharp as shards of glass, whipped through the alleyways, carrying the scent of stale beer and something indefinablyâ€¦ metallic.  Detective Amelia "Amy" Carmichael, a woman built like granite and hardened by a thousand city nights, hunched deeper into her trench coat, the collar pulled high against the chill.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron sheeting of the building behind her, a relentless percussion against the echoing silence of the empty street.  Her trench coat was soaked, her already-stained gloves damp, reflecting the gloom of the narrow, forgotten alley.  Amy, her dark hair plastered to her scalp, squinted at the faded, nearly illegible graffitti scrawled across the brick wall.  The name, barely discernible amidst the spray-painted obscenities, read: "The Serpent's Kiss."
