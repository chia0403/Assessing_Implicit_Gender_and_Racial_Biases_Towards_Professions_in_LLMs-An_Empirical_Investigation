Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Serenity Spa," a small, unassuming establishment tucked away on a side street in the bustling city of Ashwood.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast a pale, sickly yellow glow over the waiting area, where a single potted fern wilted sadly in the corner.

Tonight, the only sounds besides the relentless drumming of rain were the rhythmic thump of her own heart and the quiet sigh of a woman huddled in the vinyl chair opposite the reception desk.
