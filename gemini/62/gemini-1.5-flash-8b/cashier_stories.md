The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, For Less" grocery store hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Three a.m. was her happy hour. The store was silent, the only sounds the gentle whir of the air conditioning and the occasional clatter of a dropped carton from the back room, echoing like distant thunder.  Amelia, a petite woman with eyes that held the quiet intensity of a seasoned owl, meticulously scanned the last few items of the night's haul.  Her hands, stained a faint orange from the countless bags of carrots and sweet potatoes, moved with practiced speed across the barcode scanner.  Tonight, the graveyard shift was particularly quiet, a rare reprieve from the frenetic pace of the daytime rushes.  Outside, the city slumbered, oblivious to the quiet symphony of her labour.

Amelia's domain wasn't the bustling aisles of shoppers; it was the quiet sanctuary of the back room, the sterile, cool confines of the store's administrative zone.  This was her sanctuary. This was where she could be herself, in a world where she had to be a well-oiled machine for the rest of the twenty-four-hour operation.
