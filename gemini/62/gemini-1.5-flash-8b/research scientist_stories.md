The humid air hung thick and heavy in the sterile, white-walled lab, clinging to Dr. Aris Thorne's sweat-slicked brow.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above him, casting a pallid glow on rows of meticulously organized test tubes filled with viscous, iridescent liquids.  Outside, the relentless South Florida sun beat down on the sprawling campus of the Institute for Advanced Biological Research, a complex shrouded in the mystery of its ambitious projects.  Aris, a research scientist specializing in bioluminescence, felt a creeping unease, a feeling that something was terribly amiss.  He adjusted the goggles perched precariously on his nose and peered into the microscope.  There, amidst the swirling, fluorescent light display, a single cell pulsed with an unnatural luminescence, a vibrant emerald green unlike any bioluminescent organism he had ever documented.
