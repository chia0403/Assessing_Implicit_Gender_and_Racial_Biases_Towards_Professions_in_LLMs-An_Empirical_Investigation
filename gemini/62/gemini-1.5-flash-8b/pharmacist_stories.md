The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Pill & Potion" pharmacy hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *clink-clink* of Amelia Nightingale's spatula as she meticulously weighed out a batch of magnesium tablets.  Dust motes danced in the pale, synthetic light, illuminating the intricate network of vials, jars, and boxes that filled the small, cluttered space.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, floral aroma of the herbal tinctures lining the back shelves.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, a time Amelia typically reserved for her most painstaking work â€“ compounding personalized medications, a task requiring both precision and patience, traits Amelia prized above all else.  Outside, the city bustled with a symphony of unfamiliar, noisy life, a stark contrast to the contained, predictable environment of the pharmacy.  Amelia, however, was deaf to the symphony, focused solely on the delicate dance between ingredients and their intended effect.
