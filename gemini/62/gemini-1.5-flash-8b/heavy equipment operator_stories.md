The crimson sun bled across the cracked asphalt of the abandoned quarry, painting the jagged edges of the mountainside in hues of fire.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, swirled around Amelia "Mac" MacIntyre's boots as she meticulously adjusted the controls of the CAT 336.  The quarry, once a roaring heart of extraction, now felt like a forgotten dream, its echoing silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of the excavator's hydraulics and the distant, mournful cry of a hawk circling high above.  Amelia, her face tanned and weathered to the colour of burnt umber, felt a familiar knot of melancholy tighten in her chest.  This was her domain, her sanctuary, her prison.  The quarry, a vast, scarred canvas where the raw power of industry met the stubborn resistance of the earth.
