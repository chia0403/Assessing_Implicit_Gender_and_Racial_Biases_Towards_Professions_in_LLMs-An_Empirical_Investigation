The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Tally Ho!" accounting firm cast long, distorted shadows across Amelia Peabody's meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, neatly stacked, resembled tiny, metallic soldiers guarding rows upon rows of invoices, receipts, and balance sheets.  Amelia, a bookkeeper with a name as precise as her ledger entries, sighed.  Another Tuesday, another mountain of paperwork.  Outside, the city hummed – a cacophony of sirens, car horns, and the distant rumble of subways.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and the quiet, rhythmic clicking of Amelia's mechanical calculator.  Her small, cluttered office, a cramped space on the fifth floor of a towering skyscraper in downtown Chicago, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her kingdom of numbers. This was Tuesday, October 26th, 2027, and Amelia knew, deep in her bookkeeper's soul, something was off.  One particular account, nestled amongst the others, seemed to whisper of trouble, a discrepancy subtly etched into the columns of figures.  It was like a misplaced decimal point – almost imperceptible, yet undeniably there.
