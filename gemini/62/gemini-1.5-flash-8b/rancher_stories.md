The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the cracked earth, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust devils danced like phantom cowboys across the desolate expanse of the Blackwood Ranch, a sprawling, sun-scorched empire of sagebrush and scrub oak clinging precariously to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.  Dust, the color of burnt cinnamon, coated everything:  Amelia's worn leather chaps, the weathered siding of the ranch house, even the ancient, gnarled oak tree that stood sentinel over the corral.  The year was 1887, and the drought, a relentless, creeping horror, had gripped the valley for three seasons.  Waterholes were shrinking, pastures withered, and livestock were dying.  Amelia, at twenty-seven, carried the weight of the ranch, the responsibility of her family's legacy, and the gnawing fear that the land, so fiercely loved, might finally yield to the cruel embrace of the desert.  This was her fight, and it was not yet over.
