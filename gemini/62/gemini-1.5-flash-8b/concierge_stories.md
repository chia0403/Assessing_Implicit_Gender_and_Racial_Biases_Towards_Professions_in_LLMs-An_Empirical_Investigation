The biting November wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the cobbled street outside the Grand Ashworth Hotel.  Rain, a persistent, grey drizzle, slicked the stones and reflected the pale gaslight glow from the hotel's ornate windows.  A chill, deeper than the air, settled in Amelia's bones, mirroring the unspoken anxieties she sensed humming beneath the polished veneer of the establishment.  She was the concierge, the silent guardian of the Grand Ashworth's secrets, and tonight, a particular weight pressed down on her, heavy as the gathering storm clouds.  

The Grand Ashworth, a sprawling Victorian monument overlooking the misty Thames, boasted opulent guest rooms, a legendary ballroom, and a history whispered in hushed tones.  Its very walls seemed to hold the echoes of countless stories, some whispered, some screamed, some simply…unresolved.  From the grand foyer, with its shimmering chandeliers and hushed conversations, to the dimly lit corridors that snaked through the hotel’s intricate labyrinth, Amelia, with her keen eyes and even keener ears, was the unseen thread connecting the hotel's disparate inhabitants.  Tonight, though, something felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the encroaching fog.  She knew, with a certainty that settled in her gut like a lead weight, that tonight's quiet was deceptive.
