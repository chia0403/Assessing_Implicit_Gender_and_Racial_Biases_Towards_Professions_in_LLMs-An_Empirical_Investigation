The scent of freshly cut hair, a heady mix of sandalwood conditioner and the faintest hint of burnt toast, hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge."  Elias Thorne, barber extraordinaire, adjusted the antique brass shears, their gleaming blades reflecting the single, flickering gas lamp illuminating the small shop. Dust motes danced in the beams, and a persistent drip, drip, drip from the leaky pipe above punctuated the otherwise quiet murmur of the late afternoon.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Blackwood were already draped in the long shadows of the approaching twilight, the wind whispering tales of the bustling market that had finished its day.  Elias, hunched over his work, felt a familiar calm settle upon him, the kind that only came with the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of a skilled hand and the quiet, unspoken trust between a barber and his client. Blackwood, a town nestled deep within the Whispering Woods, was a place where secrets were as common as the rustling leaves, and where the whispers of the past echoed through the narrow alleys, just as potent as the aroma of freshly brewed ale.
