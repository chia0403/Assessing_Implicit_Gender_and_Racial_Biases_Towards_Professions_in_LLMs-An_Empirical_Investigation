The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Transistor" cast a sickly yellow glow across Elias Thorne's face, illuminating the grime-coated workbench.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the small, cramped workshop.  A symphony of static crackled from the radio components scattered across the table – a constant, low hum that was both a soundtrack to Elias’s life and a constant reminder of the intricate, delicate machinery he tended.  Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire, or perhaps just a man drowning in the hiss of forgotten signals, was hunched over a vintage Zenith, its chassis a patchwork of soldered connections and faded paint.  Outside, the rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the tempest raging within Elias's mind.  The year was 1942.
