The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Butterfield's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, filtered through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the eastern edge of Blackwood Manor, painted the stone steps in a mosaic of gold and shadow.  Amelia, her worn gardening gloves tucked into her apron pocket, surveyed the meticulously manicured lawns.  A symphony of chirping crickets and the distant murmur of a conversation, probably from the grand house itself, filled the crisp morning air.

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Gothic edifice looming over the valley, was Amelia's kingdom.  She'd been its groundskeeper for fifteen years, a lifetime in the quiet solitude of its shadowed gardens and overgrown glades.  The estate, once a vibrant hub of aristocratic life, had fallen into a hushed silence, a stillness only punctuated by the rhythmic rustle of leaves and the occasional, melancholy creak of a forgotten window.  Amelia, though, found solace in the meticulous order she maintained within its grand decay. The manicured hedges, the meticulously trimmed boxwood, the perfectly placed flowerbedsâ€”they were her canvas, her silent testament to a world that had lost its vibrancy, yet clung to a fading grandeur.
