The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Time Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Peabody's relentless to-do list.  Paperwork, neatly categorized by client – the Smiths, the Joneses, the perpetually-confused Gonzalezes – lay scattered across her meticulously organized desk, a miniature battlefield of receipts, W-2 forms, and 1099s.  Amelia, a seasoned income tax preparer with five years under her belt, stared at a particularly baffling set of deductions for a small-business owner named Mr. Henderson.  He claimed to have used a significant portion of his deductible business expenses for "novelty teacups."  Her eyebrow arched.  This was going to be interesting.

The small office, located in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Oakhaven, was a study in muted efficiency.  Beige walls, linoleum floors, and the faint smell of stale coffee hung in the air.  A single potted fern, wilting slightly, stood sentinel beside a chipped ceramic coffee mug, a testament to the long hours and relentless deadlines that characterized this quiet corner of the tax preparation world.  Outside, the muted sounds of suburban life – the distant hum of traffic, the occasional barking dog – filtered through the thin walls, providing a subtle counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Amelia's keyboard.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in early April, the air thick with the anticipation of tax season's final stretch, and Amelia knew she had a lot of ground to cover before the deadline.
