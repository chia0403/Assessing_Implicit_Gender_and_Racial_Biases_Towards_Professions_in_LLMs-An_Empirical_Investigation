The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Nightingale, dressmaker extraordinaire.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass window of her workshop, illuminating intricate patterns laid out across the worn mahogany table.  Cobwebs, thick and golden as spun moonlight, clung to the rafters, undisturbed companions in the quiet hum of her busy sewing room.  Elara, a woman whose hands moved with the grace of a hummingbird, carefully pinned a delicate silk rose to a bodice.  Her workshop, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the sprawling city of Aethelgard, was a sanctuary, a haven from the relentless clamor of the marketplace and the gossiping whispers of the town square.  It was a space where fabrics whispered secrets, and needles sang their silent melodies. The year is 1487.
