The chipped Formica countertop, stained a dull beige from years of spilled coffee and lukewarm tea, felt cold beneath Dr. Amelia Petrovaâ€™s fingertips.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy window of her small, cluttered office, cast long shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the air.  A half-eaten bowl of granola, a forgotten notepad, and a stack of clinical files higher than her head dominated the space.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, stared at the latest intake form, the dense script of the troubled teenager almost indecipherable.  The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall seemed to mock the frenetic pace of her day.  Outside, the bustling city of Metropolis hummed, oblivious to the quiet storm brewing within the four walls of her practice.

Amelia, 42, a counseling psychologist specializing in adolescent trauma, had seen countless faces in that office. Faces etched with fear, frustration, and the silent whispers of pain.  Each patient, each story, a tapestry woven with the threads of their unique experiences, a complex tapestry she now had to unravel.  This one, however, felt different. It pulsed with a raw energy that sent a shiver down her spine, a tension that vibrated even through the layers of her professional detachment.


This was likely the case, she thought, because of her own personal history. It was only part of the job, of course.  But this one felt personal, like a mirror reflecting not just the troubles of the other person, but her own, too.
