The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's worn jacket, stinging her cheeks and rattling the loose rivets in the dilapidated chain-link fence that marked the edge of the highway construction zone.  Sunrise painted the eastern sky in hues of bruised purple and pale gold, casting long, skeletal shadows across the still-empty highway.  Dust motes, kicked up by the passing trucks that were already beginning to rumble into the pre-dawn hours, danced in the ethereal light.  Amy, her name barely a whisper against the encroaching roar, adjusted her safety glasses, already squinting against the glare.  This was her life, this pre-dawn ballet of concrete and steel, a symphony of jackhammers and the low groan of machinery, orchestrated by the relentless rhythm of the highway's relentless expansion.  

The construction site, nestled in the desolate heart of the Arizona desert, was a stark landscape of raw earth and half-built bridges.  Twisted metal skeletons of future overpasses clawed at the sky, like skeletal fingers reaching for a distant dawn.  Scattered temporary shelters, hastily assembled from corrugated metal and plywood, huddled like huddled sheep, offering a meager protection from the brutal Arizona sun.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel fumes and the sharp tang of freshly cut asphalt, hung heavy and still.  This wasn't the romanticized image of highway construction, not the heroic panorama.  This was the silent, gritty reality that Amy knew all too well.
