The flickering neon sign of "Dr. Alistair Finch, Chiropractor" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked pavement outside.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive ache in Elara's lower back.  The small, cluttered office, barely large enough for a single massage table and a battered reception desk, felt like a pressure cooker on a humid summer day.  A single, bare bulb overhead cast long, dancing shadows, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the faint light.  Elara, Dr. Alistair Finch, was wrestling with a particularly stubborn knot of tension in her own back, the familiar, dull ache a constant companion throughout the long evening.  Another patient, a disgruntled-looking man in a tweed jacket, paced restlessly in the waiting room, his frustration echoing the tension in the air.  Tonight, it felt like the whole world was pressing down on her.
