The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded, milky yellow, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the clinic's kitchen.  Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, a registered dietician with a meticulously-maintained, if somewhat severe, composure, meticulously weighed a handful of quinoa.  The sterile white walls, punctuated by stark posters outlining healthy eating habits, seemed to press in on her, amplifying the hum of the refrigerator and the incessant clicking of the digital scale.  Outside, the grey London sky threatened rain, mirroring the overcast mood of the small, cramped clinic, "Nourish Now," tucked away on a side street near the bustling Camden Market.  Eleanor had just finished a particularly disheartening consultation with a young woman struggling with disordered eating, a battle Eleanor was all too familiar with in this part of the city, a constant undercurrent to the steady rhythm of her work. This patient, Lily, seemed lost in a sea of conflicting information, her face pale and drawn, a stark contrast to the bright posters of colourful, healthy meals. The aroma of freshly brewed herbal tea, her favoured remedy in moments of frustration, hung faintly in the air, a small beacon of normalcy in the suffocating professional world.
