The biting wind whipped rain against the corrugated iron siding of the dilapidated warehouse, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic pounding of Captain Amelia “Em”  Charleston’s heart.  She hunched deeper into her soaked parka, the acrid scent of burning plastic and something indefinably metallic stinging her nostrils.  The warehouse, a forgotten relic of a bygone era, loomed like a monstrous, skeletal beast against the bruised twilight sky.  This wasn’t the typical blaze.  The fire here wasn't just consuming; it was… *eating*.  The flames danced in a grotesque ballet, twisting and contorting, feeding on the building with a hunger that unsettled even the seasoned firefighters.

**Setting:** The abandoned industrial district of Riverport, nestled between the jagged edges of the old port and the rusting remnants of a once-proud steel mill.  Rain lashed down relentlessly, blurring the already grimy streets, and the air hung heavy with the metallic tang of decay and the ominous smoke of the inferno consuming the warehouse.  Flickering streetlights cast long, distorted shadows, and the silence was broken only by the rhythmic crackle and roar of the flames, the urgent hiss of water pressure from the fire trucks, and the muffled cries of the unseen.
