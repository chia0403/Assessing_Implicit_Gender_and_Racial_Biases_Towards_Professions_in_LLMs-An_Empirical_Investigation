The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's tweed jacket around her as she surveyed the sprawling aviary.  The glass roof, shimmering under the relentless January sun, offered little protection from the chill that permeated the vast space.  From her vantage point on the observation deck, Amelia could see the snow-dusted peaks of the surrounding mountains mirroring the frosted feathers of the rare snow-peacocks, their iridescent plumage catching the pale light.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at the prestigious Blackwood Sanctuary for Endangered Fauna, felt a familiar pang of responsibility, a weight settling on her shoulders like the first snowfall. The sanctuary, a sprawling complex nestled deep within the remote Cairngorms, was her life, her passion, and her solace.  Each of the thousands of creatures entrusted to her care held a unique story, a silent plea for survival. Today, however, a particular hush hung heavy in the air, a hush that seemed to emanate not from the birds, but from the heart of the sanctuary itself.
