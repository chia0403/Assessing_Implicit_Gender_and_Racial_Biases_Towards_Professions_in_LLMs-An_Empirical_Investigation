The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Gutter Gremlin" plumbing shop hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's latest plumbing nightmare.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Barty, a man whose brow was perpetually creased in a frown that resembled a permanent question mark, hunched over a tangled mess of copper pipes, tracing the labyrinthine path of a stubborn leak.  Outside, the city thrummed with the restless energy of a sleepless beast, its roar a muffled counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip emanating from the bowels of the shop.

The Gutter Gremlin, a tiny, ramshackle building nestled on a side street in the heart of the perpetually damp city of Aethelgard, was a microcosm of Barty's life.  Its walls, stained with the remnants of countless plumbing disasters – rust, grime, and the occasional splash of unidentified fluids – were lined with rows of tools, each with their own story of a battle fought and won (or, more often, lost).  A pungent mix of mildew, disinfectant, and pipe solvent hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Barty, yet a potential foe to any visitor unfamiliar with the shop's peculiar charm.  Dusty, oversized porcelain figures of mythical creatures and gargoyles, remnants from a long-forgotten owner, stood as silent observers, their chipped eyes seeming to peer through the gloom.  Barty, with his worn overalls and calloused hands, was the only living soul amidst this silent army, his brow perpetually furrowed as he battled the relentless pressure of the city's plumbing woes.
