The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the faint smudges of mascara that had survived the relentless humidity of the humid South Florida night.  The air hung thick and heavy, laced with the aroma of fried plantains and something vaguely floral, likely jasmine from the overflowing planters that lined the sidewalk.  Amelia, her voice already hoarse from the relentless rhythm of the evening's gig, pushed through the throng of sweating patrons, a sea of brightly colored shirts and swaying hips.  She was a creature of the night, this Amelia Nightingale, a singer adrift in a city that seemed to breathe its own unique brand of relentless heat.  Tonight's gig at the Rusty Mug, a dimly lit dive bar tucked away in the heart of Little Havana, was meant to be just another stop on the long road to her next big break.  But tonight felt different.  A premonition, sharp as a shard of glass, danced in the periphery of her vision, warning her that this wasn't just another night. This night would change everything.
