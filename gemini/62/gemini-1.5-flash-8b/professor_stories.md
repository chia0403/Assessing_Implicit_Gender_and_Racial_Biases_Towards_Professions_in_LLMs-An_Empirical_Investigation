Professor Amelia Hawthorne, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine, grey residue of forgotten lectures and countless late-night philosophical debates, stared out the rain-streaked window of her study.  The pale, November light, filtering through the grime-coated panes, cast long, skeletal shadows across the room.  Books, stacked precariously high on shelves that groaned under their weight, whispered secrets in the damp air.  The scent of old parchment and decaying roses clung to the room, a constant reminder of the years that had passed within these walls.

Her study, a cramped sanctuary tucked away in a crumbling Victorian house on the edge of the university campus, held within its four walls a lifetime of intellectual pursuit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak sunlight, illuminating a half-eaten bowl of porridge and a half-finished manuscript â€“  the culmination of a decade of research on the enigmatic symbolism hidden within the carvings of a now-lost, ancient civilization.  The house itself seemed to sigh with the weight of untold stories, its very timbers resonating with the echoes of generations past.  This particular morning, however, whispered whispers seemed unusually distinct, punctuated by a persistent, almost unnerving drumming sound that emanated from the library below.
