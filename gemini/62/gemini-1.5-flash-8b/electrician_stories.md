The flickering neon sign of "Sparky's Electrical Repairs" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Old Town, illuminating the greasy puddles and the shadowed alleyways.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the small workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the low hum of a transformer nearby.  Inside, amidst the tangle of wires, tools, and half-finished electrical projects, stood Elias Thorne, a wiry man with eyes that darted around the cluttered space like trapped lightning bugs.  Elias Thorne, 32, a seasoned electrician, a master of the arcane language of electricity, was wrestling with a particularly stubborn fuse box.  His thick, calloused fingers traced the frayed wires, his brow furrowed in concentration. The faint scent of burnt toast from the bakery down the street mingled with the metallic tang of solder and insulation. The air itself seemed to vibrate with the unseen currents that coursed through the ancient, stone-walled buildings. This was no ordinary electrical repair job. This one feltâ€¦ different.
