The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Institute for Advanced Theoretical Astrophysics" hummed, a monotonous drone that was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the abandoned conference room. Elias, a man whose uniform – a faded navy blue polo shirt and inexplicably bright yellow pants – seemed to have absorbed the building's inherent dustiness, surveyed the room.  Empty coffee cups, discarded papers covered in scrawled equations, and a single, perfectly preserved, half-eaten apple lay scattered like fallen stars on a concrete floor.  This was the tenth time he'd swept the room this week.  Tenth.


The Apex Institute, a monolithic glass and steel edifice perched precariously on the edge of the desolate, windswept plateau, held a strange energy.  It pulsed with an almost palpable, unseen activity, despite the unnerving quiet that hung heavy in its halls.  The air, usually thick with the scent of old books and forgotten experiments, was today strangely sterile, devoid of even the faintest hint of the usual chemical residue. The sheer scale of the building, with its spiraling staircases and labyrinthine corridors, was intimidating,  making Elias feel like a minuscule ant navigating a colossal anthill. His job, as the building's sole janitor, encompassed not just scrubbing floors, but a quiet, watchful surveillance of a place that felt strangely…alive.
