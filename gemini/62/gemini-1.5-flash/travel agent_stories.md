The chipped paint of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's desk was a microcosm of her life: faded grandeur, hinting at a past glory now somewhat obscured by the relentless tide of paperwork.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of "Wanderlust Travel," danced in the air like tiny, exhausted travellers themselves.  The agency, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the increasingly gentrified, yet still slightly seedy, district of Notting Hill, was a far cry from the exotic locales Amelia so expertly sold to her clients.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, slightly damp plaster, and a faint, lingering aroma of Earl Grey tea, a testament to countless hours spent pouring over brochures, maps, and the ever-changing whims of her demanding clientele.  Today, however, the usual hum of Amelia's efficient chaos was absent. A thick silence, broken only by the sporadic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, hung heavier than the London fog outside.  Something was amiss.
