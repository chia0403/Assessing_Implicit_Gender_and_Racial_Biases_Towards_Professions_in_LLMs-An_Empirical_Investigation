The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing ache behind his eyes.  The air hung thick and damp, smelling of stale coffee and something faintly metallic – a scent he'd come to associate with the less savoury corners of San Francisco's Tenderloin district.  Jack, or more formally,  Jackson "Jack" Stratton, III,  sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock his weary posture.  Outside, the city grumbled, a symphony of sirens and distant shouting lost in the downpour.  His office, a cramped room above a failing laundromat on the edge of Chinatown, was a reflection of his current state: cluttered, dimly lit, and desperately in need of a good cleaning – much like himself.  The only light in the gloom came from the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above his desk, illuminating a half-empty bottle of rye whiskey and a photograph, its edges softened with age, showing a smiling woman with eyes that held a depth of sadness that even the years hadn't been able to erase.
