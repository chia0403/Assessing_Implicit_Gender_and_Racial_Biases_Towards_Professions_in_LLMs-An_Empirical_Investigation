The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Anya Sharma, a scent that usually soothed her.  But today, the usual calming effect was lost in the cacophony of a leaky faucet, a persistent drip-drip-drip that echoed unnervingly in the otherwise silent, early morning hours of Aspen Dental.  Outside, the pre-dawn Colorado sky bled from bruised purple to hesitant streaks of pale orange, a stark contrast to the clinical white of the office.  Anya, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun that betrayed the slight tremor in her hands, wrestled with the stubborn clasp of her sterile gloves.  The leaky faucet, a minor inconvenience in most settings, felt like a premonition in her gut, a discordant note in the usually predictable symphony of her workday. Today was particularly important; it was the day Dr. Ramirez was scheduled to evaluate her skills for a potential partnership.
