The scent of lavender and cedarwood hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the grit and grime clinging to the cobblestones outside.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for three days, plastered the narrow alleyways of  St. Giles-in-the-Fields to a glistening, muddy slick.  Inside, however, the workshop of Elias Thorne, Master Tailor, was a haven of warmth and meticulous order.  Rolls of vibrant silks, shimmering satins, and sturdy woolens were stacked neatly against the walls, their rich colours a stark contrast to the grey gloom outside.  Elias, a man whose face was etched with the fine lines of precision and years spent hunched over his work, meticulously hand-stitched a cuff, his needle flashing in the soft lamplight.  His spectacles, perched precariously on his nose, slipped slightly as he concentrated, but he didn't seem to notice. The only sounds were the rhythmic prick of his needle and the whisper of the rain against the leaded glass windowpanes.
