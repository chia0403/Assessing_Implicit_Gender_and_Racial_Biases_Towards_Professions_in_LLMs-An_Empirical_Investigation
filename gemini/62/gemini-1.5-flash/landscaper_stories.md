The dawn mist clung to the emerald slopes of the Mourne Mountains, a damp breath on Elias Thorneâ€™s weathered face as he surveyed his latest project.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and whose eyes held the patient wisdom of the earth itself, stood amidst a chaotic tangle of overgrown rhododendrons, their vibrant purple blooms a stark contrast to the grey stone walls that snaked across the hillside.  This wasn't some manicured suburban lawn; this was a wild, untamed garden, clinging precariously to the mountainside, a forgotten corner of beauty demanding rediscovery.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming heather, carried the distant bleating of sheep and the faint, melancholic cry of a curlew.  This was County Down, Northern Ireland, and for Elias Thorne, it was home.
