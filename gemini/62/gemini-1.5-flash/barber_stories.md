The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the damp November air, its faded lettering barely legible: "Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Master Barber."  Barty himself, a man whose face was a roadmap of wrinkles etched by years spent wielding a straight razor, sat hunched over a steaming mug of tea, the warmth doing little to penetrate the chill that seeped from the cracked windowpanes of his shop.  The air hung thick with the scent of Bay Rum and pipe tobacco, a familiar aroma that had permeated this tiny, almost forgotten barbershop on the corner of Bleecker Street and Mulberry Lane for over fifty years.  Outside, the relentless New York City rain hammered against the grimy storefront, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a hazy watercolour.  Inside, only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner offered any semblance of steady beat against the melancholic November drizzle.
