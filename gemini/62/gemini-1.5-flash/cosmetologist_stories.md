The scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois.  It clung to the plush velvet armchairs in her salon, "Shear Brilliance," nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of the historic French Quarter of New Orleans.  Gas lamps flickered, casting a warm, honey-colored glow on the peeling paint of the building, a stark contrast to the vibrant, jewel-toned hues of the hair dye bottles lining the antique vanity.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a street musicianâ€™s trumpet battled with the mournful cry of a distant steamboat whistle, a symphony only New Orleans could orchestrate.  Tonight, however, the usual cacophony was muted, replaced by a nervous energy that vibrated from Sera herself, as she stared at the appointment book, a single name circled in anxious red ink:  Madame Evangeline Moreau.
