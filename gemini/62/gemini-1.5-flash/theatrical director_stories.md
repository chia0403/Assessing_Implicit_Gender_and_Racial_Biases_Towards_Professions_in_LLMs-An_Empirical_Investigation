The biting November wind whipped at Eleanor Vance’s ankles as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of the dilapidated Théâtre des Ombres.  Fallen leaves, the colour of burnt umber and decaying rose petals, skittered across the uneven paving stones, mirroring the chaotic state of her life – and, more pertinently, the current state of her production of “Macbeth.”  Gargoyles, grotesque and rain-slicked, leered down from the crumbling facade of the theatre, their stone faces seeming to reflect the gloom settling over Eleanor’s heart.  The Théâtre des Ombres, once a jewel of Parisian theatre, now felt less like a place of artistic expression and more like a mausoleum, a fitting setting perhaps, given the creeping sense of doom that had overtaken her latest, and possibly final, directorial endeavour.
