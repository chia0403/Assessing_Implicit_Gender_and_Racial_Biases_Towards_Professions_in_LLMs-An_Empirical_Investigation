The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  It clung to her crisp, navy-blue uniform, mingling with the scent of jasmine and sandalwood from her own subtly applied perfume – a desperate attempt to combat the pervasive aroma of stale coffee and nervous sweat.  Sera adjusted her headset, the tiny microphone prickling her earlobe, and surveyed the cabin of Flight 747 from the galley.  The pre-dawn light filtering through the portholes painted the faces of the sleeping passengers in an ethereal, almost melancholic glow.  Outside, somewhere over the churning expanse of the Atlantic, the vast, dark ocean mirrored the turbulent emotions churning within her own chest.  This wasn't just another transatlantic flight; this was a flight back to *her* Atlantic, back to a life she'd left behind, a life she wasn't entirely sure she was ready to face.
