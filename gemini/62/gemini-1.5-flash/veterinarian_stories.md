The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the recalcitrant outboard motor.  The grey, churning waters of the Outer Banks clawed at the small fiberglass hull of her boat, the *Sea Biscuit*, threatening to swallow it whole.

This was a loggerhead sea turtle, stranded and injured, and its survival hinged on Eleanor reaching it before the storm broke.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and impending rain, vibrated with the urgent thrum of the approaching tempest.
