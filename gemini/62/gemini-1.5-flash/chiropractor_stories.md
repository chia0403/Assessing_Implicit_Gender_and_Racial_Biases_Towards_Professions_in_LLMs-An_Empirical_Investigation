Snow, driven by the relentless wind, piled high against the single, arched window, obscuring the already fading light of the late afternoon.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic, almost frantic, thump-thump-thump of Eleanor’s own heart, a frantic counterpoint to the unsettling silence of the usually bustling little clinic nestled at the edge of the desolate, windswept moors of Cornwall.
