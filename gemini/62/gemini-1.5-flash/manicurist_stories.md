The chipped turquoise paint on the windowsill matched the chipped turquoise polish clinging stubbornly to Esmeralda “Esme” Rodriguez’s cuticle.  Rain lashed against the glass of “Esme’s Nails,” a tiny salon wedged between a laundromat smelling perpetually of bleach and a bakery overflowing with the sugary scent of cinnamon rolls.  Esme sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  Inside, the salon was a haven of muted calm – a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.  Soft jazz played low on the radio, a single flickering candle on the small, cluttered reception desk casting dancing shadows on the walls adorned with faded posters of meticulously painted nails.  The air hung thick with the sweet, chemical scent of acetone and lavender, a familiar perfume Esme had worn for the past fifteen years, ever since she’d opened this little sanctuary. Tonight, however, the usual comforting aroma felt heavy, almost suffocating.  A single, flickering neon sign outside proclaimed, “Esme’s Nails: Where beauty blooms,” but the only bloom Esme felt was the prickly bud of anxiety blooming in her chest.
