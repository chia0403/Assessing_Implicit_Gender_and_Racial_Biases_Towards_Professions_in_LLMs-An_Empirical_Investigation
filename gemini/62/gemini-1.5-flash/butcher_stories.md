The chill wind, a razor-edged thing that sliced through even the thickest wool, whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as he wrestled a stubborn side of beef onto the rusty meat hook.  Barty’s breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the single flickering gas lamp that illuminated his butcher shop, "Butterfield's Best," a name that held more irony than pride these days.  The shop itself, nestled on the bleak, windswept edge of Grimsborough, was a ramshackle affair, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin and the windowpanes rattling a mournful tune in the gale.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood, a scent both familiar and unwelcome to Barty, mingling with the fainter, sweeter aroma of sawdust and aging spices.  Grimsborough, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the unforgiving moors, felt as though it was slowly freezing to death, both literally and figuratively, and Barty’s butcher shop seemed to be mirroring its decline.
