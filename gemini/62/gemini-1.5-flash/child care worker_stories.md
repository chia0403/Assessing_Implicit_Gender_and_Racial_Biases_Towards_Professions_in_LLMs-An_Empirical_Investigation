The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" daycare center's porch flaked onto Elara Vance's worn sneakers as she sat, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and watching the sunrise paint the sky in shades of bruised plum and apricot.  It was a Tuesday, which meant the usual chaotic symphony of tiny voices and sticky fingers was about to begin.  The air, still cool with the lingering remnants of night, carried the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet tang of honeysuckle from Mrs. Gable's overflowing garden next door.  Elara sighed, the scent a fragile contrast to the gritty reality of another day spent navigating the treacherous landscape of toddler tantrums and epic Lego battles.  Inside, the muffled sounds of awakening children were already beginning to build, a crescendo promising a day as colourful and unpredictable as the sunrise she was contemplating.
