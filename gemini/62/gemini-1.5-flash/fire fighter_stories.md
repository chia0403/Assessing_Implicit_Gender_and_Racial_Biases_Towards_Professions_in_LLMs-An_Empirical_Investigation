Evie squinted, the flickering orange glow of the inferno painting the night in a macabre, dancing light. The flames, fuelled by a relentless wind whistling down from the craggy peaks of the Greystone Mountains, licked hungrily at the edges of the small cluster of houses, their wooden siding already blackened and groaning under the assault.
