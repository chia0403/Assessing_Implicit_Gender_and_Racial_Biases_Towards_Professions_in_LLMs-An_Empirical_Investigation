The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finchâ€™s thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The late November air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a stark contrast to the pungent aroma of hay and animal musk that permeated the sprawling grounds of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary.  Whispering Pines wasn't exactly picturesque; its charm lay in the ramshackle collection of barns, repurposed sheds, and hand-built enclosures that sprawled across the gently sloping hillside, each a testament to years of tireless devotion from Amelia and her predecessors.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled oak trees that bordered the property, painting the already muted landscape in shades of grey and fading orange.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting quiet of the sanctuary was punctuated by an unsettling cacophony: the panicked bleating of a goat, the agitated clucking of hens, and a low, guttural growl emanating from somewhere deep within the wolf enclosure.  Amelia, her breath misting in the frigid air, knew this wasn't just a typical evening at Whispering Pines.
