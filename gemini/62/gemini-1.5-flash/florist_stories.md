The scent of rain-soaked petrichor and jasmine hung heavy in the air, a damp perfume clinging to the cobblestones of Rue des Fleurs.  Gaslights flickered, casting a hazy, amber glow on the overflowing window boxes of  "Fleur de Lys," a shop crammed with blooms of every imaginable hue and fragrance.  Inside, amongst the riot of colour,  Amelia Josephine Lancaster, her fingers stained a delicate shade of violet from handling irises, carefully arranged a bouquet of deep red roses.  The bell above the door jingled, a sharp metallic counterpoint to the gentle hum of the city outside, announcing the arrival of her first customer of the day.
