The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of roasting garlic, simmering tomatoes, and something indefinably…wild.  It wasn’t the usual comforting aroma that clung to the kitchen of  “Le Papillon Noir,”  Amelia Grace Blackwood’s restaurant tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais district of Paris.  Tonight, a sharper, almost feral edge cut through the familiar fragrances, a hint of woodsmoke and something faintly metallic that Amelia couldn't quite place.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, blurring the already dim gaslight glow of the Parisian street, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia herself.  The usually immaculate copper pots gleamed dully under the flickering light, reflecting her own anxious reflection back at her.  Tonight’s reservation was unlike any other she’d ever received;  a single name, scrawled in elegant calligraphy on a worn, cream-colored card:  Monsieur Dubois.  And the whispers surrounding this mysterious guest, whispers that slithered through the restaurant like the very shadows in the corners, were far more unsettling than the tempest raging outside.
