The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Reli" Cartwright, owner and sole stylist at "Snip & Sip," a salon nestled incongruously between a bustling laundromat and a dusty antique shop on Bleecker Street.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already fading neon sign outside, its flickering "OPEN" a defiant pulse against the gathering gloom.  Inside, Reli, her hands stained a kaleidoscope of colours from years of dye, hummed a low, bluesy tune as she meticulously swept stray strands of auburn hair from the worn wooden floorboards. The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome counting down to the evening's appointments, each one a potential disaster or a delightful triumph, depending on the client's mood â€“ and the condition of their hair.
