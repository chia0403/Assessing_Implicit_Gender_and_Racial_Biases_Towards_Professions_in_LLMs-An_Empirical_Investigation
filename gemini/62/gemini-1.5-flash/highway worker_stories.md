The rasping whine of the asphalt grinder was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne, a sound that had punctuated the dawn of countless summer days.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, mirroring the glistening sheen of the freshly-laid blacktop stretching before him like a river of midnight.  The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of hot tar and exhaust fumes, a cloying perfume unique to the I-70 corridor between Denver and Grand Junction.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and gravel, danced across the desolate, sun-baked landscape, occasionally spitting a fine spray against the hard hats of Elias and his crew.  The Colorado sun beat down mercilessly, a relentless hammer forging the day into a furnace.  This wasn't glamorous work, far from it, but for Elias, the endless ribbon of highway unfolding before him was a canvas, each meticulously patched pothole a testament to his quiet, essential contribution to the ceaseless flow of life across the state.
