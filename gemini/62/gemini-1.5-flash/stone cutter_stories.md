The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of the hammer.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, oil-stained lamp hanging above, danced in the air like tiny, petrified spirits.  Outside, the relentless Breton wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged wooden shutters of  Elias Thorne's workshop.  Elias, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by years spent battling unforgiving stone, paused his work, the sweat beading on his brow despite the chill in the air.  The unfinished sculpture before him – a defiant angel, its wings still half-hewn from the grey granite – seemed to mirror his own weariness.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet stone and something else… something acrid, like burnt metal and fear.
