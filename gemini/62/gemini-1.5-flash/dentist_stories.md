The midday sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, turning the small, single-story building into a shimmering oven.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced across the cracked asphalt of the deserted street outside.  Inside, however, the air was cool and sterile, the scent of antiseptic battling with the faint, sweet aroma of cinnamon emanating from the small, hand-carved wooden elephant perched on Elias's desk.  The elephant, a gift from a grateful patient years ago, was one of the few personal touches in the otherwise stark, functional office.  Outside, the relentless heat of the Kalahari desert pressed against the windows, a constant reminder of the isolation – and the unexpected cases – that came with being the only dentist for hundreds of miles.
