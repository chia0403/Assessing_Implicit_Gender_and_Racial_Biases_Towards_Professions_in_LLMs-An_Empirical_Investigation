The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the "Sea Serpent."  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered wood.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and something vaguely fishy – perhaps decaying seaweed, perhaps something less savory – clung to her like a damp shroud.  Eleanor, a dietician specializing in sustainable seafood and coastal community health, had traded her sterile, brightly lit office in Boston for this rickety research vessel, a decision she was beginning to question with every jarring roll of the boat.  The mission: to assess the nutritional content of the local catch and advise the dwindling fishing community of Port Blossom on ways to improve their diets – and perhaps, their fortunes.  The challenge: surviving the voyage itself.
