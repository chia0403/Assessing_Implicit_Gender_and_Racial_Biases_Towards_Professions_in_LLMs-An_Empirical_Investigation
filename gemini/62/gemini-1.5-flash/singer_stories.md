The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's face as the ferry churned through the choppy waters of the Irish Sea.  The grey sky mirrored the turbulent mood churning within her.  Ahead, the jagged silhouette of the Isle of Skye rose from the mist like a slumbering leviathan, its peaks shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  This wasn't the glamorous backdrop Sera was used to – the glitzy stages of London’s West End, the roar of adoring crowds – but it was where she'd come to escape.  To escape the suffocating pressure, the relentless scrutiny, the echoing ghost of a voice that wasn't her own.  The wind whipped her auburn hair across her face, momentarily obscuring the view of the island, a fitting metaphor for the uncertainty that lay ahead.  This was her sanctuary, or so she hoped.  It was on Skye, in the heart of its wild beauty, that Sera Nightingale intended to find her voice again.
