The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Amelia Katherine Hayes, whipping her already-tattered lab coat tighter against her thin frame.  The skeletal branches of the stunted spruce trees clawed at the sky, their silhouette a stark contrast against the bruised purple of the twilight.  Amelia, a physician's assistant at the remote clinic nestled precariously on the edge of the unforgiving Seward Peninsula, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The biting wind seemed to mirror the icy dread that had settled in her gut since the last medevac chopper had left, carrying its precious cargo of a critically injured fisherman â€“ leaving behind a silence broken only by the rhythmic crunch of snow under her boots.  The clinic, a single-story building made of weathered logs and patched-up plywood, looked more like a stranded shipwreck than a bastion of medical care, but tonight, it was her lonely fortress against the encroaching darkness and the creeping uncertainty of the long, brutal Alaskan winter.
