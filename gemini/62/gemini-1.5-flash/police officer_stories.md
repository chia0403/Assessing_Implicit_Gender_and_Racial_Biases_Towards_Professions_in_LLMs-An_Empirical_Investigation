The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged cliffs of Cornwall.  Below, the Atlantic churned a restless grey, the waves crashing against the rocks with a violence that mirrored the turmoil in Ava's gut.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and something else – something acrid and unsettlingly metallic – clung to her like a shroud.  She gripped the worn leather of her jacket tighter, the chill seeping through the fabric despite the multiple layers.  The isolated fishing village of Porthkerris, usually a postcard-perfect scene of quaint cottages and bobbing fishing boats, was tonight shrouded in an oppressive darkness, the only light emanating from the flickering emergency lamps illuminating the scene before her.  A scene that promised to be far from picturesque.
