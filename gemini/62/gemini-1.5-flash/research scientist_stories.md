The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorne's research station, a relentless, icy counterpoint to the whirring hum of the generators within.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, danced in the beam of Aris's headlamp as he navigated the treacherous, snow-covered path towards the remote seismic monitoring array.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and the almost imperceptible tang of something else… something metallic and unnervingly unfamiliar.  The station, a cluster of prefabricated modules clinging precariously to the glacier's edge, felt miles from civilization, a lonely outpost at the frozen bottom of the world – a fitting place, Aris thought grimly, to discover something that would shatter the fragile understanding of the planet he had dedicated his life to studying.
