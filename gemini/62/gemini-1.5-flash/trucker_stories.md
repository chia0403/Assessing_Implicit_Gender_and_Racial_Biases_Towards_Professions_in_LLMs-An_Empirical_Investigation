The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful tune around Silas "Buck" Blackwood's rig, a symphony of ice scraping against steel and the mournful groan of the aging engine.  He hunkered deeper into the worn leather of his driver's seat, the worn map of the I-80 corridor spread across his dashboard illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of the dash lights.  Outside, the snow fell thick and fast, blurring the already faint outline of the distant peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains into a hazy, ethereal landscape.  The air inside his battered Kenworth, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," was thick with the smell of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the lingering scent of yesterday's burnt bacon.  Buck, his face etched with the deep lines of countless miles and harsh winters, wrestled with the stubborn thermostat, a losing battle against the relentless cold.  The radio crackled with static, a fitting accompaniment to the desolate beauty of the Wyoming plains, swallowing him whole in a white, windswept oblivion.
