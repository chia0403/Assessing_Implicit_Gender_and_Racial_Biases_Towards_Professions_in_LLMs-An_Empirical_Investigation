The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool against Elara Vance's fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering gas lamp overhead, danced in the stagnant air of Blackwood Pharmacy.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined Blackwood Lane, their leaves long since surrendered to the encroaching winter.  Inside, the scent of dried herbs – chamomile, lavender, and something faintly acrid Elara couldn't quite place – battled with the metallic tang of blood, a lingering reminder of the unfortunate incident involving a runaway cart and a very unlucky butcher earlier that afternoon.  Elara, a woman whose life revolved around the precise measurements of powders and the careful compounding of remedies, found herself strangely calmed by the chaos. This was her sanctuary, Blackwood Pharmacy, and even the scent of blood couldn't quite dispel the quiet comfort it offered.
