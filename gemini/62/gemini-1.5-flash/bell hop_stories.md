The brass spittoon gleamed under the muted gaslight, reflecting the weary slump of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shoulders.  Barty, a bellhop at the Grand Majestic Hotel, hadn't seen a truly shiny penny all week, let alone a generous tip.  Rain lashed against the towering Gothic windows of the hotel lobby, each gust a mournful sigh against the opulent, yet somehow decaying, grandeur of the place.  Dust motes danced in the weak light cast by a single, flickering chandelier, illuminating the chipped marble floor and the faded velvet of the waiting area chairs.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of lilies, desperately trying to mask the underlying aroma of damp wool and stale cigar smoke.  Tonight, even the usual cacophony of the city – the rumble of horse-drawn carriages, the distant wail of a siren – felt muffled, swallowed by the oppressive silence of the Grand Majestic's cavernous lobby.
