The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the near-frozen practice field.  Breath plumed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of the Northwood High School football field.

Amy, head coach of the Northwood Knights, pulled her North Face jacket tighter, the embroidered "Knights" logo a small comfort against the encroaching chill.  The pre-game jitters weren't just from the weather; tonight's game against their undefeated rivals, the Eastview Eagles, held the fate of their season, and maybe even her job, in the balance.
