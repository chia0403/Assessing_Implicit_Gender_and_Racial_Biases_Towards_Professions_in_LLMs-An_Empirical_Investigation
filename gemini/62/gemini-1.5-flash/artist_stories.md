The salt spray stung Elara Vanceâ€™s face, a fine mist that clung to her paint-splattered overalls like a second skin.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped her unruly auburn hair across her vision as she perched precariously on the jagged edge of the cliff, the raw, untamed beauty of the Atlantic stretching before her in a breathtaking panorama.  Below, the waves crashed against the basalt columns that formed a natural amphitheatre, their rhythmic roar a constant, hypnotic soundtrack to her work.  Elara, a landscape artist known for her dramatic, almost violent renderings of nature's power, had sought out this remote cove on the windswept coast of Cornwall, England, hoping to capture the untamed spirit of the place on canvas.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, vibrated with a primal energy that she felt deep within her soul, an energy she desperately needed to translate into art.
