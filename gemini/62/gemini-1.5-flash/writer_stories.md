The chipped paint of Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s writing desk flaked onto the worn Persian rug, a miniature snowdrift mirroring the blizzard raging outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes of her attic room in the crumbling Victorian house, a relentless rhythm accompanying the frantic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keys.  The only light came from a single, flickering bulb dangling precariously above, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the meticulous order of the manuscript spread across the desk:  a historical fantasy novel, its pages filled with the intricate script that was Amelia’s signature – elegant, looping, yet somehow imbued with the frantic energy of a trapped bird.  The scent of old paper, damp wool, and brewing Earl Grey hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of her solitary existence. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a fitting soundtrack to the deadline looming like a guillotine.
