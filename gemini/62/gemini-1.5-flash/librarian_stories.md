The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Elara Vance's soul.  But tonight, the familiar fragrance of the Grand Blackwood Library felt thick, almost suffocating, mirroring the unease churning in her stomach. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the reading room, each gust rattling the panes like skeletal fingers tapping impatiently.  Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, perched on a wobbly stool behind the circulation desk, the only sound besides the storm her own ragged breathing and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall.  Outside, the city of Blackwood – a labyrinth of cobblestone streets and shadowed alleyways clinging precariously to the cliffside – was wrestling with a tempest that mirrored the turmoil brewing within the library's ancient walls.  Tonight, the usual quiet sanctuary felt less like a haven and more like a cage.
