The fluorescent lights of Millbrook & Sons hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the incessant tap-tap-tap of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured nails against the polished mahogany desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she reluctantly allowed a select few to call her, surveyed her kingdom: a spacious, if slightly dusty, reception area in a venerable, if slightly crumbling, law firm.  The air hung thick with the scent of aging leather and slightly stale coffee â€“ a fragrance as familiar to her as her own reflection in the brass nameplate that read, simply, *Reception*.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the gloom filtering through the tall, arched windows overlooking a cobbled courtyard, where a lone pigeon strutted with the air of a disgruntled barrister.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of the office was punctuated by a nervous energy, a low thrum of anticipation that even Penny, with her years of experience in absorbing the anxieties of others, couldn't quite ignore.  Something was brewing at Millbrook & Sons, and Penny, from her strategically placed throne of mahogany and unanswered calls, was about to be right in the middle of it.
