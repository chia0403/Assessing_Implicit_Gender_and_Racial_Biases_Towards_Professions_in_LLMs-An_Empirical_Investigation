The chipped paint of Amelia Jean Hawthorneâ€™s desk matched the chipped optimism in her heart.  Rain lashed against the single, dusty pane of glass overlooking the perpetually grey sky of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside her cramped office, above the sputtering radiator and the faint smell of damp wool clinging to the threadbare carpet, Amelia meticulously filed a claim for a water-damaged dachshund.  Another Tuesday. Another soggy, soul-crushing Tuesday in the life of an insurance agent whose clientele seemed to consist primarily of unfortunate pets and even more unfortunate pet owners. The town of Port Blossom, nestled between a perpetually moody ocean and a range of brooding mountains, felt as perpetually damp as the dachshund's unfortunate circumstances.  The only splash of color in the room was the vibrant, slightly faded poster of a sun-drenched beach in Hawaii pinned above her overflowing inbox; a constant, silent reminder of the escape she desperately craved.
