The insistent Chicago wind, sharp as broken glass, whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes's ankles as she navigated the slush-covered sidewalk.  Her breath plumed before her, momentarily obscuring the garish neon sign of "Big Tony's Pizzeria," its flickering glow the only splash of color against the greyscale of a late February afternoon. Amy clutched her battered briefcase tighter, the insurance policy files within rustling like dry leaves.  She was five minutes late to meet Mr. Stanislaw, the pizzeria’s owner, a man known for his punctuality and his even less forgiving temper.  Lincoln Park, normally vibrant with the laughter of children and the bustle of young professionals, was subdued by the biting cold. The wrought-iron fences of the stately brownstones lining the street wore icy fringes, and the trees in Lincoln Park itself stood bare and skeletal against the bruised twilight sky. Amy’s heels clicked a hurried rhythm on the pavement, a soundtrack to her growing anxiety.  This meeting, this policy renewal, was crucial.  It was the difference between hitting her quarterly target and facing another soul-crushing performance review with Mr. Henderson, her perpetually dissatisfied boss.
