The rusted hinges shrieked a protest that echoed across the desolate, snow-dusted fields of rural Vermont.  The air, thick with the scent of hay and manure, was warmed only slightly by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from a rafter.

He stamped the snow off his boots, the sharp clang echoing in the cavernous barn, and pulled on his thickest lambskin gloves, a knot of apprehension tightening in his stomach. He'd delivered countless foals in his career, but something about the urgency in Mr. Whittakerâ€™s voice had set his teeth on edge.
