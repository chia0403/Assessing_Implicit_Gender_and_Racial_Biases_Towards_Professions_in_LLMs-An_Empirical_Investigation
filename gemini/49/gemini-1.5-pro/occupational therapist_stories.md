The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the loose strands of her auburn braid.  She hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, the collar scratching pleasantly against her neck.  Greystone Manor loomed before her, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the churning slate-grey sea.  Gargoyles leered from the eaves, their stony faces slick with rain, and the ivy clinging to the stone walls rustled like whispered secrets.  Eleanor, a registered occupational therapist with ten years' experience under her belt, shifted the heavy bag containing her assessment kit from one hand to the other, her breath clouding the air. This wasn't her usual clientele; usually she worked with stroke survivors and children with developmental delays in the brightly lit, sterile environment of the city hospital.  But thisâ€¦ this was different.  She'd been summoned to Greystone to work with the manor's reclusive owner, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, who had suffered a mysterious accident that had left him debilitated.  The details were scant, the solicitor who contacted her tight-lipped and evasive.  Eleanor had a feeling she was stepping into something far more complicated than a simple rehabilitation case.
