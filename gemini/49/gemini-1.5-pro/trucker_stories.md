The cab of the Peterbilt 379, christened "The Wanderer" by its owner, vibrated with the low thrum of the diesel engine.  Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already fading neon signs of the Dixie Diner in Tupelo, Mississippi. Inside,  Dale "Mad Dog"  Magnusson stirred his lukewarm coffee, the chipped mug warming his calloused hands.  He was six days into a two-week haul from Los Angeles to Boston, a cross-country trek laden with frozen California produce destined for some fancy grocery stores up north. The diner, a beacon of greasy comfort in the storm-soaked night, was mostly empty. A lone waitress wiped down the counter, her movements slow and methodical, while a couple of weary-looking truckers hunched over plates piled high with biscuits and gravy in a far booth.  The air hung heavy with the smell of fried food, stale coffee, and the faint, sweet scent of magnolia blossoms struggling to perfume the rain-slicked asphalt outside.  Dale checked his watch, a heavy stainless steel piece his grandfather had given him.  He had a schedule to keep, and the storm showed no signs of letting up.  Boston was a long way off, and the road was calling.
