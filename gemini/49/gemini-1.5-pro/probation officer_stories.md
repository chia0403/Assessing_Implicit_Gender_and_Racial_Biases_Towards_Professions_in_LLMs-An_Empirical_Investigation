The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover Liquor" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Rain hammered against the cracked windshield of Evelyn Reed's decade-old Corolla, the rhythmic thump a counterpoint to the gnawing unease in her gut.  Evelyn Reed, a probation officer for the past five years, had seen enough broken promises and shattered lives to fill a small cemetery. Tonight, she was adding another potential headstone to the list. Her destination: a dilapidated two-story building on the edge of the dilapidated town of Port Blossom, Maine, a place where the salty tang of the sea air couldn't quite mask the underlying scent of decay and disappointment. She was there to see  Jeremy "Jaybird" Johnson, a repeat offender with a penchant for petty theft and a talent for slipping through the cracks of the justice system. He'd missed his last two check-ins, and the knot in Evelyn's stomach tightened with each wiper sweep. Port Blossom was a town that chewed up and spat out people like Jaybird, and she feared tonight she'd be picking up the pieces.
