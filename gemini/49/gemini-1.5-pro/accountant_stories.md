Rain lashed against the arched windows of Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her cramped office, tucked away on the fifth floor of the Grimshaw & Sons building in downtown Chicago, usually offered a comforting if somewhat drab view of the city.  Tonight, however, the skyscrapers were swallowed by the gloom, their twinkling lights blurred into a hazy orange glow.  Bea, a Certified Public Accountant with a penchant for cardigans and a deep-seated aversion to chaos, tapped a manicured nail against a stack of invoices.  The rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* was the only sound besides the relentless drumming of the rain and the low hum of the antiquated radiator in the corner.  It was 7:37 pm on a Friday, and Bea, unlike every other soul in the usually bustling building, was still at her desk.  Something wasn't adding up in the Peterson Plastics account, and until it did, Bea wouldn't be going anywhere.
