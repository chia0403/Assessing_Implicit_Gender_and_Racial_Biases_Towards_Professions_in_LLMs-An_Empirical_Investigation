The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Katherine Hawthorne's hair across her face, momentarily blinding her to the stark beauty of the Cornish coast.  Perched precariously on a granite outcropping known locally as the Raven's Perch, Mia clutched her worn leather-bound notebook tighter, the pages rustling like disturbed crows' wings. Below, the slate-grey Atlantic churned against the jagged cliffs, sending sprays of foam skyward.  The fishing village of Trevelyan Cove, nestled in a small, sheltered inlet, looked like a handful of pebbles thrown against the vastness of the ocean. Mia had come here seeking solitude, a place where the whispers of the crashing waves might drown out the deafening roar of writer’s block that had plagued her for months.  Her latest novel, a gothic thriller set in a crumbling Victorian mansion, lay abandoned on her laptop back in the tiny, stone cottage she’d rented, its blinking cursor mocking her lack of progress.  The cottage, with its uneven flagstone floors and a fireplace that smoked more than it warmed, was supposed to be her sanctuary, a place to reconnect with her muse.  Instead, it had become a prison of her own making.
