The biting wind whipped down Sycamore Street, whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining the road.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to fall, dusting the already frosted rooftops of the Victorian houses in Ashworth, Massachusetts.  Inside number 42, a burst pipe sang its own shrill, icy song, a counterpoint to the wind’s lament.  Eleanor Vance "Ellie" Fitzwilliam, her auburn hair tucked under a worn woolen cap, knelt before the offending copper monstrosity, a wrench clutched in her gloved hand and a grimace etched on her face.  The small, cramped bathroom, usually cluttered with the paraphernalia of a family of five, had been hastily cleared, leaving only the essentials: Ellie, her toolbox, and the relentless spray of freezing water that showed no signs of abating.  This was the third burst pipe this week, and Ellie was starting to suspect that Ashworth’s aging infrastructure was conspiring against her.
