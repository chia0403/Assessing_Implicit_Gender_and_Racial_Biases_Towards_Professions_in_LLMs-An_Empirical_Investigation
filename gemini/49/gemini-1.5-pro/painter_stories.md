The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned precariously from her attic window, squinting against the late afternoon sun.  Her paint-splattered fingers, still stained a vibrant cerulean, gripped the peeling window frame.  Below, the fishing boats bobbed in the turquoise harbour of Port Blossom, Maine, their brightly coloured hulls a stark contrast to the steely grey of the approaching storm. Port Blossom, a town more accustomed to the hushed whispers of the sea than the clamor of the outside world, clung to the rugged coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull. Amelia’s attic studio, perched atop the oldest house in town – a crooked, shingle-clad structure known locally as the Seawhisper House – offered her an unparalleled view of this isolated, windswept world, a view that both inspired and haunted her canvas.  This afternoon, however, the inspiration felt distant, replaced by a growing unease that mirrored the darkening sky.
