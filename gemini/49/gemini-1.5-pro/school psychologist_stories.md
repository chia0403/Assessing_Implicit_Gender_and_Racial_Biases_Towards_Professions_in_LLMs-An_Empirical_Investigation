The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the parking lot of Maplewood Elementary, her breath misting in the frigid air.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and burnt umber, swirled around her ankles like tiny, frantic dancers.  Maplewood was a sprawling, single-story brick building, nestled amongst the browning oaks and maples that gave the school its name.  It sat on the outskirts of Havenwood, a quaint, seemingly idyllic town in Vermont, a place where covered bridges spanned babbling brooks and the air usually smelled of pine needles and woodsmoke.  But beneath the picturesque facade, a disquiet had settled. A series of unsettling incidents – unexplained absences, sleep disturbances amongst the younger children, and a pervasive sense of unease reported by the staff – had cast a long shadow over the school.  It was this unease that had summoned Eleanor from the relative calm of her office at the district’s central administration building.
