The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the sanctuary.  Dawn was barely hinting at itself, a faint bruised purple staining the eastern horizon above the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains.  Frost crunched under her thick-soled boots, and the air, though crisp, carried the familiar, pungent aroma of hay, animal musk, and pine needles.  The Bitterroot Wildlife Rescue, nestled in a secluded valley in western Montana, was Amy’s domain, her responsibility, and, more than anything, her refuge.  Here, amidst the towering pines and whispering aspens, she cared for creatures great and small, from orphaned elk calves to injured hawks, each a precious life entrusted to her capable hands.  This morning, however, a different kind of urgency propelled her forward, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the usual routines of feeding and medicating. A single, high-pitched howl had echoed through the valley just before dawn, a sound that didn't belong to any of the sanctuary's residents.
