The biting wind whipped off the East River, carrying the metallic tang of rain and the distant, mournful cry of a tugboat.  It plastered Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she surveyed the scene from atop the Brooklyn Bridge Park’s overlook. Below, the DUMBO waterfront glittered, a constellation of repurposed warehouses now housing million-dollar lofts and trendy art galleries.  Amy, bundled in a worn leather jacket over a thick cable knit sweater, ignored the breathtaking cityscape. Her focus was entirely on the dilapidated pier jutting out into the churning black water, the setting for the climactic scene of her latest film, “The Ferryman’s Toll.”  It was perfect, desolate and dripping with a gritty, forgotten beauty that mirrored the soul of her protagonist. But there was a problem, a big one, and it was anchored just offshore – a monstrously bright, neon-pink party barge, blasting a distorted rendition of "Baby Shark."  Amy clenched her jaw, the vein in her forehead throbbing in time with the infernal music.  This was the third location ruined this week. Her budget was bleeding out faster than a stabbed extra in a slasher flick.
