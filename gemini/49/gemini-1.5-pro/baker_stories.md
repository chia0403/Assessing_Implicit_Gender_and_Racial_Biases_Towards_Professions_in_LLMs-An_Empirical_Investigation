The aroma of burnt sugar and rising dough hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Thistlewick.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven shimmered under a dusting of frost, the breath of early winter painting whimsical patterns on the bakery window. Elara's bakery, "The Whispering Oven," nestled between a dusty antiquarian bookshop and a perpetually bustling tailor's, was a beacon of warmth and golden light in the pre-dawn gloom.  Inside, copper pots gleamed, shelves overflowed with jars of candied ginger and dried lavender, and the massive brick oven, Elara's faithful companion, radiated a steady, comforting heat. This morning, however, the usual serenity of her baking ritual was edged with a nervous anticipation. Today wasn't just any Tuesday; today was the day the judges from the Great Hearth Bake-Off arrived in Oakhaven.
