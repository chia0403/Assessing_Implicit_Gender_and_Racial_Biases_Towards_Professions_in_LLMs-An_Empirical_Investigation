Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Clarion's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Beatrice "Bea" Amelia Thorne.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays.  Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a stale perfume clinging to the faded velvet drapes and threadbare carpet.  Ashford, Ohio, population barely clinging to 5,000, wasn't exactly a hotbed of breaking news, and Bea, the paper's sole investigative reporter, was drowning in a sea of obituaries and town council meeting minutes.  Tonight, however, the relentless drumming of rain on the glass seemed to be keeping time with a nervous flutter in her chest.  A crumpled, anonymous note sat on her desk, the ink bleeding slightly from the damp: "They're not telling the truth about the fire at the old canning factory.  Meet me at the Miller's Creek bridge at midnight."
