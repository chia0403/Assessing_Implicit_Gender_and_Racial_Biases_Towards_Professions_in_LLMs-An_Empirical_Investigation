The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the relentless drumming anxiety she knew resided in the hearts of many of her patients.  Her office, nestled in a converted Victorian house on the edge of the historic district of Ashworth, Maine, usually felt like a sanctuary.  Tonight, however, with the wind howling like a banshee and the shadows stretching long fingers across the Persian rug, a distinct chill permeated the air.  The scent of woodsmoke from the nearby fireplace usually brought comfort, but tonight, it only served to underscore the feeling of isolation that clung to Eleanor like the damp wool of her coat.  She glanced at the antique clock on the mantelpiece.  Almost 9 pm.  Her last patient, a troubled young artist named Daniel, had left nearly an hour ago, but the unease heâ€™d carried with him seemed to linger, a palpable presence in the room.  Eleanor sighed, rubbing her temples.  This small town, shrouded in the mysteries of its dense, surrounding forests and steeped in old, whispered legends, often felt like a pressure cooker of unspoken anxieties.  And tonight, it seemed those anxieties were seeping into her very bones.
