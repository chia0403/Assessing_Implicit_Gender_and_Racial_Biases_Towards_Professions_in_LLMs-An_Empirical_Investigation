Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a staccato note in the melancholic symphony of a San Francisco November.  The neon glow of the Golden Gate Liquor Store across the street painted flickering, lurid streaks across the worn mahogany desk, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the single beam cast by a battered desk lamp. Elias Vance Thorne, his trench coat still damp from the downpour, swiveled in his creaking chair, the springs groaning in protest.  His office, perched above a dimly lit herbalist shop in Chinatown, smelled of stale cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey, and the faint, lingering aroma of jasmine tea. He rubbed his tired eyes, the city lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of orange and red, reflecting the simmering unease in his gut. The knock on the door was hesitant, a timid rapping that barely registered over the drumming rain.
