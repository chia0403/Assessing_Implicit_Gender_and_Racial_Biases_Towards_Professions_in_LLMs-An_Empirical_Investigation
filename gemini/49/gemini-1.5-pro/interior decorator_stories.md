Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's studio apartment, blurring the already fading light of a late October afternoon in Greenwich Village. Her space, nestled above a bustling Italian deli, usually felt vibrant and inspiring â€“ a testament to Gen's eclectic design philosophy. Today, however, a palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the aroma of garlic and oregano wafting up from the street below. Swatches of silk and velvet lay strewn across her drafting table, a chaotic symphony of emerald, ruby, and sapphire, mirroring the turmoil churning within Gen.  A half-finished sketch of a grand, art deco living room sat pinned to a corkboard, mocking her with its unfinished elegance.  The phone call she'd received an hour earlier had thrown her meticulously planned world into disarray, and the rhythmic drumming of the rain only served to amplify the unsettling quiet in her usually buzzing creative haven.
