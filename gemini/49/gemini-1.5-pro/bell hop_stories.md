The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh as they ushered in the opulent and the ostentatious.  Crystal chandeliers dripped with light, illuminating the vast lobby paved with marble the color of clotted cream.  The air, thick with the perfume of lilies and the murmur of hushed conversations, vibrated with an almost palpable sense of wealth.  This was Elias Finch's domain. Not the marble or the lilies, of course, but the brass luggage cart he maneuvered with practiced ease, its polished surface reflecting the swirling patterns of the carpet like a miniature, mobile version of the ceiling above.  Elias, barely twenty and already weary beyond his years, tucked a loose strand of dark hair behind his ear and plastered a professional smile on his face as a woman draped in mink approached, her chihuahua nestled in a Louis Vuitton carrier. The Grand Majestic, a monument to excess nestled in the heart of Manhattan, was a place where dreams were bought and sold, and Elias Finch, bell hop extraordinaire, was a silent witness to it all.
