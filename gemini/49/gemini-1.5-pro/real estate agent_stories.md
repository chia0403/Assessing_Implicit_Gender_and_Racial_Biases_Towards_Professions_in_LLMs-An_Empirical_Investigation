The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she fumbled with the lockbox on the wrought-iron gates of Eventide Manor.  The sprawling, gothic-revival mansion perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, its many gables and turrets silhouetted against a bruised, twilight sky.  Located on the isolated, windswept peninsula known as Widow's Point, just outside the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, Eventide had sat vacant for over a decade, its reputation preceding it like a chilling draft. Amy, ever the pragmatic real estate agent, tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear and reminded herself that rumors of hauntings and eccentric previous owners were hardly conducive to a quick sale. This property, with its breathtaking ocean views and (admittedly dilapidated) grandeur, had the potential to be her biggest commission yet, if only she could convince someone to look past the whispers and see the potential beneath the cobwebs and creeping ivy.
