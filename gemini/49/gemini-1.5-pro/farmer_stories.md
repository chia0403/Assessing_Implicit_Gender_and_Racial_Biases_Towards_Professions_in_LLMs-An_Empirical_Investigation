A sliver of sun peeked over the serrated peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, casting long, skeletal shadows from the wind-battered cypress trees that lined the eastern edge of Silas Thatcher's farm.  Silas, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life lived outdoors, stood on the porch of his ramshackle farmhouse, the worn boards creaking beneath his heavy work boots. The air, crisp and biting, smelled of damp earth and the faint, sweet scent of  wild lavender that stubbornly clung to the hillsides. His farm, a patchwork of tilled fields and rambling orchards, sprawled across the valley floor, a testament to generations of Thatchers who had coaxed life from this harsh but beautiful land. This morning, however, a disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the usual morning mist. A stillness had settled over the valley, a stillness that Silas, attuned to the rhythms of the land as he was, found deeply unsettling.
