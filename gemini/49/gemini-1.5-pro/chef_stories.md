The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Ainsworthâ€™s ankles as she wrestled a delivery crate overflowing with knobbly celeriac onto the loading dock. Flakes of snow, the first of the season in Port Blossom, Maine, danced around her like frantic moths.  The salty air, usually a welcome balm, carried a sharp, icy edge that promised a long, hard winter. Eleanor, head chef and reluctant owner of "The Salty Spoon," a small but renowned seafood restaurant perched on the edge of the harbor, shivered and tugged her worn wool cap lower over her ears.  The restaurant, usually bustling with tourists in the summer months, was quiet now, the outdoor patio deserted, its brightly coloured chairs stacked and covered with tarpaulins.  Inside, a single lamp glowed in the window, illuminating the empty tables and casting long, dancing shadows on the polished wood floor. This tranquility, however, was deceptive.  In just a few hours, The Salty Spoon would host the annual "Catch of the Day" dinner, a crucial event for both the restaurant's reputation and its survival through the lean winter months. And this year, Eleanor had a secret ingredient she planned to unveil, one that she hoped would change everything.
