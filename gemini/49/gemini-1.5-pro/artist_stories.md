The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia "Stasia" Petrova, tugging at the edges of her oversized charcoal-grey scarf and plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips.  The salty air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, clung to everything – the cobblestones beneath her worn leather boots, the rough-hewn timber of the fishing shacks that lined the harbour, and the canvas satchel slung across her shoulder, heavy with paints and brushes. Port Blossom, a small, windswept town perched precariously on the cliffs of the Cornish coast, was Stasia's latest refuge.  She’d arrived just two days prior, drawn by the wild beauty of the landscape and the promise of solitude – a stark contrast to the bustling London art scene that had begun to feel more like a cage than a canvas.  The lighthouse, perched atop the highest cliff, its white paint chipped and faded, cast a long, lonely shadow over the churning grey sea. It was this precise scene, this melancholic beauty, that Stasia had come to capture.
