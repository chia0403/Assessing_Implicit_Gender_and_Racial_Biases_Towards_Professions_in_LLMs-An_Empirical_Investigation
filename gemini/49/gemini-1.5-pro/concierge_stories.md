The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum.  Crystal chandeliers scattered rainbow prisms across the polished marble floor, catching the glint of gold buttons on Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's impeccably tailored waistcoat.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the Art Deco windows, a dramatic counterpoint to the hushed elegance within.  Barty, the Grand Majestic's head concierge, stood at his mahogany podium, a small, knowing smile playing on his lips.  Heâ€™d seen it all in his thirty years at the hotel:  runaway royalty, clandestine affairs, diamond heists, and even a misplaced pygmy marmoset.  But tonight, the air crackled with a different kind of anticipation.  A sleek black car, dripping with rainwater, pulled up to the curb, and Barty knew, with a certainty that bordered on premonition, that tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
