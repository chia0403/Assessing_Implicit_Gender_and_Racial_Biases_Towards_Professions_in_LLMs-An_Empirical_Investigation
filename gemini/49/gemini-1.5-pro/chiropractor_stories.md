The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt spray kissed her cheeks, a familiar greeting in this seaside town she'd reluctantly come to call home. The colorful Victorian buildings, normally postcard-perfect, seemed to hunch against the approaching storm, their gingerbread trim like clenched teeth.  Eleanor tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the click of her heels echoing off the empty storefronts.  It was a Thursday evening in late November, the kind of night that emptied the streets and drove people indoors, huddled around fireplaces with mugs of hot cider.  But Eleanor wasn't headed home. She was on her way to the lighthouse, perched precariously on Widow's Point, where a stubborn old fisherman refused to let a bit of "weather" interfere with his appointment.  And Eleanor, ever the dutiful, if slightly exasperated, chiropractor, wouldn't dream of letting him down.
