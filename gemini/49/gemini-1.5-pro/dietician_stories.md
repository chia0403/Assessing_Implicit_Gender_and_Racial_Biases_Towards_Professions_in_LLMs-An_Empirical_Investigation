Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already fading October light into a dull grey soup.  Eleanor, a Registered Dietician with a penchant for cardigans and an even stronger one for meticulously organized meal plans, tapped a stray curl back behind her ear. Her office, nestled within the sprawling, slightly chaotic Community Wellness Center of Cedarwood, Maine, was a comforting haven of warm ochre walls, overflowing bookshelves, and the faint, perpetually brewing scent of herbal tea. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the brightly colored "Eat Your Greens!" poster taped to her door.  Cedarwood, typically a picture-postcard New England town, was bracing for the first Nor'easter of the season, and a strange tension hung in the air, thicker than the fog rolling in from the sea.  Eleanor had a feeling this wasn't going to be an ordinary Tuesday.
