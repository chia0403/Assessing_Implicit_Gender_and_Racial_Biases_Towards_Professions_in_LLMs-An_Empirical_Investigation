The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Eldoria, carrying with it the fine dust of pulverized granite that clung to everything, including the thick, calloused hands of Elias Thorne. He squinted, his grey eyes shielded by the brim of his worn leather hat, surveying the sheer cliff face that rose before him like a jagged tooth against the bruised twilight sky. This was the Quarry of Whispers, so named for the eerie moan the wind made as it snaked through the crevices of the rock, a sound Elias had come to find both unsettling and strangely comforting. For twenty years, this quarry had been his life, his livelihood, his prison, and his canvas.  The setting sun cast long, distorted shadows across the quarry floor, turning the scattered boulders into monstrous shapes that danced in Elias's peripheral vision.  His breath plumed white in the frigid air, a stark contrast to the deepening purple of the sky.  Tonight, Elias wasn't just cutting stone; he was searching for a stone, one whispered of in local legend â€“ the Heartstone of Eldoria, said to hold the warmth of a thousand suns.
