The gaslights flickered weakly against the encroaching darkness, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced across the fog-shrouded buildings of Arkham, Massachusetts.

Elias, a recent graduate of Harvard Dental School, had inherited his grandfather’s practice on Saltonstall Street, a dimly lit, two-story building that smelled perpetually of cloves and something faintly metallic.  He’d hoped for a quiet life, tending to the dental needs of the townsfolk, but Arkham had a way of subverting expectations. As Elias fumbled with the key to the practice, a guttural, almost inhuman shriek echoed from the direction of the Independence Square, sending a shiver down his spine.
