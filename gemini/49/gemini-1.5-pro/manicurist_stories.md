The bell above the door to "Nailed It," a small, but impeccably stylish nail salon tucked between a laundromat and a twenty-four-hour donut shop in Brooklyn, chimed merrily. Rain lashed against the large window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign. Inside,  Elizabeta "Ellie" Rodriguez, a woman whose hands moved with a balletic grace that belied the strength in her grip,  buffed a client's nails to a high shine. The salon, Ellie's own meticulously crafted haven, smelled of acetone, hibiscus tea, and the faint, sweet scent of almond oil.  Velvet-upholstered chairs in a vibrant teal lined one wall, facing a pristine white counter overflowing with neatly organized bottles of polish in every color imaginable.  Jazz, soft and mellow, drifted from hidden speakers.  It was a Thursday afternoon, usually slow, but the downpour had driven a few unexpected customers in, seeking refuge from the storm brewing both outside and, perhaps, within themselves. Ellie, with her warm smile and uncanny ability to sense what a person needed – be it a vibrant splash of color or a calming neutral – was ready to weather any tempest.
