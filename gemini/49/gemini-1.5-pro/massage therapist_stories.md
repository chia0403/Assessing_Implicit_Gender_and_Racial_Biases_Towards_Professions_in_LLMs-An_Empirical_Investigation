The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast stripes across Elias Thorne’s worn leather massage table. The air, thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, hummed with the low thrum of the electric blanket beneath the crisp white sheets. Outside, on Bleecker Street, the cacophony of Greenwich Village – the rumble of delivery trucks, the chatter of tourists, the distant wail of a saxophone – faded to a muted murmur. Elias, his hands calloused yet gentle, adjusted the dimmer switch, casting the small room in a softer, more inviting glow.  He glanced at the appointment book, his brow furrowing slightly.  Mrs. Petrov, his 4:00, was notoriously late. He hoped she wouldn’t cancel again; he was relying on her payment to finally fix the leaky faucet in his tiny apartment upstairs.
