The biting wind whipped across the desolate, snow-covered plains of northern Saskatchewan, rattling the windows of the small clinic and whistling a mournful tune through the gaps beneath the door. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, his hands chapped and raw from the constant scrubbing and the dry prairie air, stared out at the swirling blizzard. The single flickering fluorescent light above buzzed incessantly, casting long, skeletal shadows across the examination room, its pale glow barely reaching the corners where dust motes danced in the perpetual twilight.  The clinic, little more than a prefabricated box perched on concrete blocks, was the only sign of civilization for miles, a lonely beacon in a vast, frozen landscape. The nearest town, a speck on the map called Redemption, was a two-hour drive on a good day. Today, with visibility near zero and the temperature plummeting towards -40, Redemption might as well have been on the moon.  Elias sighed, rubbing the weariness from his eyes.  He hadn't seen a patient in three days, and the silence, usually a welcome respite from the hectic life he'd left behind in Toronto, was starting to gnaw at him.
