The rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Neon lights from the bustling Hong Kong streets below painted streaks of fuchsia and emerald across the polished mahogany desk, where a half-eaten bowl of wonton noodles sat growing cold.  Amelia, her tailored black suit jacket draped over the back of her chair, stared at the skyline, the jagged peaks of skyscrapers swallowed by the low-hanging clouds.  It was almost midnight, and the normally vibrant Central district was muted, the relentless energy of the city momentarily subdued by the downpour. This was Amelia's haven, the forty-seventh floor of the prestigious Li & Sung tower, a sanctuary of law books, meticulously organized files, and the faint scent of jasmine tea.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort felt oppressive, each legal tome a silent judge, each file a testament to a case won or lost.  Tonight, Amelia was facing her most challenging case yet, one that threatened not only her career but the fragile peace she had carved out in this frenetic city.
