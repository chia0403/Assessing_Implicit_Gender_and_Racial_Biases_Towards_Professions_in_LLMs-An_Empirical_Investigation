The wind, a constant companion in the high desert of Nevada, whipped at Amelia Grace Holloway's weathered face as she surveyed the endless expanse of the Rocking H Ranch.  The sky, a vast canvas of bruised purple and burnt orange, promised another spectacular sunset, but Amelia had little time to appreciate its beauty.  The barbed-wire fence, snaking its way across the ochre earth, was down again â€“ likely the work of a rogue bull or, worse, rustlers from the neighboring Diamondback Ranch.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, swirling red dirt up towards the jagged peaks of the distant Stillwater Mountains, the only real landmarks in this isolated, unforgiving, yet undeniably beautiful corner of the world. The year was 1958, and for Amelia, it was just another day in the life of a cattle rancher.
