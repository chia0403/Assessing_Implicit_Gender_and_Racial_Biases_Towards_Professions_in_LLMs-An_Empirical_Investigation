The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of the Ashton Estate, tugging at the brim of Elias Thorne's worn baseball cap.  Frost crunched beneath his steel-toed boots as he surveyed the grounds, his breath clouding in the crisp November air.  Towering oaks, their branches skeletal against the gunmetal sky, dominated the landscape, casting long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously trimmed hedges and vibrant, late-blooming chrysanthemums. The Ashton Estate, nestled in the heart of the Hudson Valley, was Elias's most prestigious client, a sprawling testament to old money and meticulous upkeep. He knew every inch of the twenty-acre property, from the capricious rose garden, currently slumbering beneath a layer of protective burlap, to the whispering willow that dipped its branches into the glassy surface of the estateâ€™s private pond.  This morning, however, something felt different. A stillness hung in the air, a quiet that went beyond the usual pre-dawn tranquility. It was the kind of quiet that prickled the back of his neck and made the hairs on his arms stand on end.
