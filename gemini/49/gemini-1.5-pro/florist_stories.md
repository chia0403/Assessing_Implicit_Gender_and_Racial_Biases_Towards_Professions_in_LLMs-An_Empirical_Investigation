The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the last customer, a flustered groom clutching a wilting boutonniere, hurried out into the drizzling Seattle evening.  Elara Rose Hawthorne sighed, the sound swallowed by the rustling of eucalyptus leaves hanging from the rafters.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon glow of the Pike Place Market sign across the street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lilies and damp earth, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Elara, but tonight only amplified the hollowness in her chest.  Surrounded by the vibrant hues of her floral creations, she felt oddly grey, a single muted petal in a riotous bloom.  This, her sanctuary, suddenly felt less like a haven and more like a beautifully decorated cage.
