The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre, a cigarette clutched between her gloved fingers.  Ash danced on the current, a tiny, frantic ballet against the backdrop of a bruised, pre-dawn Chicago sky.  Below her, the once-grand theatre huddled like a forgotten dowager, its terracotta facade chipped and stained, the ornate carvings around the entrance obscured by shadows and decades of grime.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of dust, mothballs, and the lingering ghost of greasepaint. Esme inhaled deeply, the familiar mix a bittersweet perfume that both invigorated and haunted her. The Rialto was her inheritance, a crumbling legacy from her flamboyant, larger-than-life grandmother, and the current battleground in Esme's war against apathy and dwindling finances.  This production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," opening in just three weeks, had to be a triumph. It had to be. The future of the Rialto, and perhaps Esme's own sanity, depended on it.
