The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center parking garage buzzed like angry wasps, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood as he pushed his cleaning cart.  It was 3:17 am, the coldest hour of a January morning in Chicago, and the wind whipped through the open levels of the garage, biting at the exposed skin on Zeke's face.  The city, usually a symphony of sirens and shouting, held its breath in the pre-dawn hush, the only sounds the rhythmic squeak of Zeke's cart wheels and the distant rumble of the El train.  Concrete pillars, stained with years of exhaust fumes and dotted with faded graffiti tags, rose like ancient monoliths around him, creating a cavernous, almost otherworldly atmosphere.  Tonight, though, Zeke didn't mind the solitude.  He preferred it, actually.  It was in the quiet hours, when the world slept and the hospital's secrets whispered through the ventilation shafts, that Zeke felt most at peace.  He had his routine, his own little kingdom of grime and shadows, and tonight, like every night, he was ready to reclaim it.
