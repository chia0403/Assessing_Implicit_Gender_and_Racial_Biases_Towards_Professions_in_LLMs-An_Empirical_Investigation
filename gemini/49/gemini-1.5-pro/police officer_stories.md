The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's rain-slicked trench coat. November in Alderwood, Washington, always felt like living inside a bruised plum â€“ perpetually twilight, damp, and chilled to the bone.  Rain hammered against the diner's large plate-glass window, blurring the already-hazy view of the deserted streets beyond. Inside, a lone waitress wiped down the counter with a weary sigh, the only sound competing with the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the low hum of the refrigerator. Izzy pushed open the diner's heavy door, the bell above it jingling a discordant welcome.  The blast of warm, coffee-scented air did little to thaw the icy knot in her stomach. She had a bad feeling about this call.
