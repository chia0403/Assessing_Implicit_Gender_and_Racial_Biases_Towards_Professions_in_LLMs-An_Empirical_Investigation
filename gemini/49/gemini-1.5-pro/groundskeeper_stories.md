The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Hawthorne's braid against her cheek as she surveyed her domain.  Wysteria Hall's gardens, usually a riot of color, now lay dormant under a thin frost.  The skeletal branches of the rose bushes clawed at the grey sky, and the once-vibrant herbaceous borders were reduced to brittle stalks.  Only the ancient yew hedge, a stoic, dark green wall bordering the west lawn, seemed impervious to the seasonal shift. Milly, her hands thrust deep into the pockets of her worn corduroy jacket, inhaled the crisp air, a familiar blend of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Wysteria Hall, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on a hill overlooking the windswept Cornish coast, had been her home, her livelihood, and her refuge for the past twenty years.  It was a grand old dame, full of secrets and stories, much like the gardens themselves.  And Milly, more than anyone, knew both intimately.
