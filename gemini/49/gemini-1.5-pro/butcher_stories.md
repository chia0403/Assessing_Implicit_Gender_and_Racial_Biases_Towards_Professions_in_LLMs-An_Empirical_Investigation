The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and something faintly metallic – the tang of blood, barely perceptible to anyone but Elias Thorne. He stood in the doorway of Thorne’s Quality Meats, his thick apron smeared crimson, the cleaver still warm in his hand.  Grimsby, a town clinging to the Lincolnshire coast like a barnacle to a hull, was waking up, the sky bruised purple and orange.  Fishing trawlers chugged back to the docks, their decks slick with the morning's catch.  The cobblestone street in front of Elias’s shop was damp and glistening, reflecting the weak glow of gas lamps fighting against the encroaching dawn. Elias, a man built like an oak barrel, with hands the size of dinner plates, watched the town stir, a familiar melancholic weight settling in his chest. This was his life, every sunrise a reminder of the same routine: the sharpening of knives, the rhythmic thud of the cleaver, the hushed reverence for the animals that passed through his hands.  And yet, something felt different this morning, a prickle of unease beneath his thick skin, like the premonition of a storm brewing far out at sea.
