The wail of the siren was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Rios.  It blended with the rhythmic thump of the windshield wipers fighting against the torrential downpour that had turned the streets of Philadelphia into swirling, black rivers. Reflections of flashing red and blue lights danced across the wet asphalt, painting the brick row houses in fleeting, surreal hues.  Inside the speeding ambulance, the air crackled with a tense energy.  Amy, a paramedic with five years under her belt, adjusted the oxygen mask on the elderly woman strapped to the gurney, her face etched with concern. The woman’s breathing was shallow, her skin clammy and pale.  Tonight, Halloween night, was proving to be anything but festive.  The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio, relaying a new call – a multiple vehicle collision on the Schuylkill Expressway.  Amy’s stomach clenched. This was going to be a long night.
