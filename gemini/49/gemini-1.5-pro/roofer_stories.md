The rusty tang of dawn hung heavy in the air, clinging to the dew-kissed rooftops of Cedarwood, Oregon.  A wisp of smoke curled from the chimney of Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s Victorian, a familiar beacon in the pre-sunrise stillness.  Daniel "Danny" Atticus Finch, perched precariously on the edge of her gabled roof, watched it rise, a mug of lukewarm coffee warming his calloused hands.  Cedarwood, nestled in the foothills of the Cascades, was a town built on lumber and grit, and Danny, with his sun-weathered skin and the ever-present scent of cedar shingles clinging to his clothes, was its embodiment.  He surveyed the town sprawling below him, a patchwork of slanted roofs and winding streets, already imagining the rhythm of his hammer against nail, the satisfying thud echoing through the awakening valley. Today was a re-shingling job on old man Hemlock's place, a notoriously difficult roof, but Danny relished a challenge.  He took a long swig of coffee, the bitter taste a welcome jolt against the creeping chill, and then, with a practiced grace, unfurled his roll of tar paper. The sky above was beginning to bleed into vibrant hues of orange and pink, promising another scorching summer day.
