Rain lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Voyages," blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign.  Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a rhythmic tattoo on her desk with a chewed-down pen.  The travel agency, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant in the damp heart of Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, usually buzzed with activity.  This Tuesday afternoon, however, was as quiet as a deserted beach in January.  The only sound besides the downpour was the rhythmic hum of the ancient space heater battling the chill that seeped in through the drafty window frames.  Amelia sighed, the fragrant steam from her mug of Earl Grey doing little to lift the grey mood that mirrored the weather outside. Another slow day, another missed sales target. She feared her own wanderlust might soon outstrip the agency's dwindling funds.
