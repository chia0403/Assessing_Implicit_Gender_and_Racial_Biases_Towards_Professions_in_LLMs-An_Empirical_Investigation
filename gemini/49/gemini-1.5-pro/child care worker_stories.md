The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking Mrs. Gable's prize-winning petunias, blurring the vibrant blooms into streaks of purple and pink.  Inside, the air crackled with the static electricity of tiny humans bundled in brightly colored rain gear.  Amelia, her curly brown hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, knelt amongst a group of four-year-olds, patiently explaining why rubber boots could not, in fact, be worn on one's head.  The linoleum floor, usually gleaming, was a minefield of discarded mittens, stray crayons, and the occasional rogue Goldfish cracker.  The aroma of stale apple juice and Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent Amelia had come to associate with both chaos and comfort.  Today, however, a faint metallic tang underlay the usual nursery perfume, a scent so subtle it might have been her imagination.  But Ameliaâ€™s imagination rarely conjured smells.  Something wasn't quite right.
