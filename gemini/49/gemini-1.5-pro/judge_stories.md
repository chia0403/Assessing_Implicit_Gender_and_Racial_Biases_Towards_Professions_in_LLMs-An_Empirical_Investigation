Inside, the warm glow of electric lights spilled out onto the landing, promising a temporary respite from the harsh reality waiting just beyond the heavy oak doors. A case of arson and potential homicide, the details still murky and unsettling, awaited her attention. And Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, that this one would be anything but straightforward.
