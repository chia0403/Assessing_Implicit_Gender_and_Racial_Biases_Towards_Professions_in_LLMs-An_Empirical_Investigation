Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau’s thirty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of the Chicago skyline.  The city lights, usually a dazzling tapestry woven with gold and ruby threads, were muted, swallowed by the storm’s grey maw.  Cassie, Chief Operating Officer of  Moreau Industries, a legacy built on steel and grit by three generations of her family, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, a rhythmic counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain.  Her office, a testament to minimalist elegance, was dominated by stark white walls, a polished ebony desk, and a single, striking piece of abstract art – a swirling vortex of blues and greys that seemed to mirror the tempest raging outside.  The air hung heavy with the scent of impending change, a tension Cassie couldn’t quite place, but one that prickled at the back of her neck like a phantom draft.  The insistent buzz of her phone broke the silence, the caller ID flashing a name that made her stomach clench:  "Unknown Number."
