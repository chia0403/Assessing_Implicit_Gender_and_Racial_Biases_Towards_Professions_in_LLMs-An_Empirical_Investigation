The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Amelia Reyesâ€™s cheeks as she hurried across the ice-slicked parking lot of St. Ignatius Community Hospital.  The sky, a bruised purple, promised more snow.  It was already past seven on a January evening in Marquette, Michigan, and the skeletal trees lining the shore rattled like maracas in the gale. The emergency room doors hissed open as Amelia entered, the blast of warm, antiseptic air a welcome reprieve.  Flu season was in full swing, and the waiting room, usually a quiet expanse of beige and muted blues, buzzed with the low murmur of illness and anxiety.  The triage nurse, a seasoned veteran named Marge, glanced up from her charting, her expression a mixture of exhaustion and grim determination. "Reyes, you're a sight for sore eyes," she said, her voice raspy. "We've got a waiting room full of sniffles, a suspected appendicitis, and a snowmobiler who thinks he broke his femur.  Pick your poison."
