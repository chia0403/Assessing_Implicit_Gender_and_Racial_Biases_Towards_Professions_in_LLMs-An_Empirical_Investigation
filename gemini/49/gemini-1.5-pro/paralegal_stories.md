Rain lashed against the arched windows of Brennan & Crowley, Attorneys at Law, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Boston.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, paralegal extraordinaire (at least in her own mind), shivered despite the warmth radiating from the ancient radiator hissing beneath her desk.  The mahogany-paneled office, usually imbued with a hushed sense of dignified purpose, felt oppressive tonight, the silence broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the frantic tapping of Amelia’s fingers on her keyboard.  She was racing against a looming deadline, a mountain of documents related to the Peterson antitrust case threatening to avalanche onto her already overloaded desk.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the glass panes and mirroring the anxiety churning in Amelia’s stomach. Something felt wrong, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with billable hours or looming deadlines.  It was a feeling she’d learned to trust, honed during her years navigating the murky waters of Boston’s legal world.
