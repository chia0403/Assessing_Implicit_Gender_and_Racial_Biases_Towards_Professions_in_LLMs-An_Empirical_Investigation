The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's County Hospital hummed a low, sterile song, reflecting in the polished linoleum floor.  Rain lashed against the windows of the phlebotomy lab, blurring the pre-dawn cityscape of Scranton, Pennsylvania into a watercolour wash of greys and blues.  Inside, Eliza Jane Holloway, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp white coat, adjusted the tourniquet on her own arm, practicing her venipuncture technique.  It was 5:45 am, fifteen minutes before her shift officially started, but Eliza preferred the quiet solitude before the daily influx of patients and the accompanying cacophony of beeping machines, hurried footsteps, and hushed conversations.  The rhythmic pulse of blood whooshing into the small vacuum tube was strangely calming to her, a tangible reminder of the hidden, vital currents that flowed beneath the surface of every life.  This morning, however, a different kind of current, a prickle of unease, ran beneath Eliza's practiced calm.  Something feltâ€¦ off.
