The chipped paint on the door of Room 3, "Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Kindergarten," whispered of countless tiny hands that had pushed it open, eager to explore the wonders within.  Sunlight, filtered through the paper maple leaves Eleanor had painstakingly cut out with her students last autumn, cast dappled shadows across the brightly coloured rug. The rug itself depicted a whimsical town, complete with a crooked ice cream parlour, a library overflowing with books, and a fire station housing a smiling Dalmatian.  It was a Tuesday in early October in the small town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the kind of day where the air held the crisp promise of autumn and the scent of burning leaves drifted in on a gentle breeze. Eleanor, humming a tuneless melody, surveyed her kingdom with a mixture of exhaustion and quiet satisfaction.  Glitter clung to her cardigan like morning dew, and a faint smudge of blue finger paint adorned her cheek, a badge of honour earned during the morning's art lesson.  This was her world, a kaleidoscope of sticky fingers, infectious laughter, and the boundless energy of five-year-olds.  And today, that world was about to be turned upside down.
