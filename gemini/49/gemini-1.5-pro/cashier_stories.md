The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the single pane window, blurring the neon glow of the Gas-N-Sip across the street into a hazy, pulsating blob.  Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, chewed thoughtfully on the end of a Bic pen, her gaze fixed on the rhythmic sweep of the windshield wipers on a battered Ford pickup parked at pump number three.  Inside the Quick Stop, nestled between the dusty shelves of potato chips and the lukewarm refrigerator buzzing with questionable energy drinks, time seemed to move at the glacial pace of molasses in January.  The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs perpetually rotating on a greasy roller, and the faint, lingering perfume of Mrs. Henderson, the octogenarian who bought a single lottery ticket every Tuesday and Thursday.  This was Amelia's kingdom, a seven-by-ten-foot plexiglass castle where she reigned supreme over the crumpled bills, sticky penny trays, and the endless stream of customers who drifted in and out, leaving fleeting ripples in the stagnant pool of her day.
