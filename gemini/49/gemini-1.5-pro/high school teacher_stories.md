The fluorescent lights of Mr. Theodore Finch's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of Ashwood High.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams slanting through the grimy windows, illuminating the rows of empty desks and the faded world map tacked crookedly above the whiteboard.  Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, nestled between the Cascade foothills and the Willamette River, was still shrouded in the misty breath of early autumn.  Leaves the color of rust and burnt orange clung to the branches of the towering Douglas firs that ringed the school's perimeter, whispering secrets to the crisp morning air.  Mr. Finch, his tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, hunched over a stack of essays, a mug of lukewarm coffee growing cold beside him. He was already weary, and the school bell hadn't even rung yet.  This Tuesday, October 27th, promised to be just another day in the seemingly endless cycle of grading, lesson planning, and teenage angst. But little did Theodore Finch know, this Tuesday was about to be anything but ordinary.
