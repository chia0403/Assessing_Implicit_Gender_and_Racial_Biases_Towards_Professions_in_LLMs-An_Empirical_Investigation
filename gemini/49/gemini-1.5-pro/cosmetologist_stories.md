The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a purple glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Magnolia Street.  Inside, amidst the hum of hair dryers and the scent of coconut oil and hairspray,  Elara Vivienne Dupree, a cosmetologist with a flair for the dramatic and an even greater talent for transforming frizzy disasters into flowing masterpieces, sighed dramatically.  It was a Tuesday night in Cypress Creek, Louisiana, the kind of humid, stagnant evening that made even the perfectly coiffed question their life choices.  Rain lashed against the large front windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara. Her last client, Mrs. Henderson, had stormed out ten minutes earlier, muttering about uneven layers and the audacity of charging extra for "volumizing mousse."  Elara, perched on a velvet stool behind the reception desk, tapped a perfectly manicured, crimson-tipped fingernail against a worn copy of  "Vogue." This wasn't how she'd envisioned her Tuesday evening.  She'd planned on experimenting with a new balayage technique, not mediating a hair-related meltdown.  But Cypress Creek, with its gossipy grapevine and penchant for the predictable, rarely offered up what one envisioned.
