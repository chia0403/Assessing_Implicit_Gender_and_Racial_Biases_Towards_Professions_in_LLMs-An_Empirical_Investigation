The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Klondike Plateau, stinging Adeline “Addie” Dubois’s cheeks even through the thick layers of fleece and wool.  A thin crust of ice crackled under the treads of her D11 bulldozer, the behemoth’s engine a rumbling counterpoint to the howling wind.  Around her, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, slowly bleeding into a reluctant orange on the eastern horizon. The air, sharp and clean, carried the metallic tang of frost and the faint, earthy scent of the thawing permafrost.  Addie, her breath clouding in front of her face, adjusted her hardhat and surveyed the site. This was Claim 17, a desolate patch of frozen earth slated to become the foundation for a new hydroelectric dam, a project so massive it felt like wrestling a glacier into submission. Today, Addie’s job was to clear the topsoil, a task as delicate as it was brutal in this unforgiving landscape.  Every scrape of the blade, every rumble of the engine, was a negotiation with the ancient, frozen earth – a land that didn't give up its secrets easily.
