The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Grimshaw Alley.  It was a narrow, forgotten lane tucked between a fishmonger’s and a perpetually shuttered apothecary in the oldest part of Lower Lidgate, a city that perpetually smelled of brine, coal smoke, and secrets. Inside, amidst the comforting scent of bay rum and the rhythmic snip of shears, Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose face resembled a kindly walnut, was meticulously sculpting the sideburns of a portly gentleman whose snores punctuated the otherwise silent shop. The only other illumination came from a single bare bulb hanging precariously above Finnian’s worn leather barber chair, casting long, distorted shadows that danced on the chipped tile floor.  Rain lashed against the windowpane, a steady drumbeat against the backdrop of the city’s hushed murmurings. It was the kind of night secrets were whispered, and sometimes, in Finnian’s chair, confessed.
