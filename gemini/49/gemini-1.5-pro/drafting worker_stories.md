The fluorescent lights of the Darrow & Blake Drafting office hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic scratch of graphite on vellum.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her brow furrowed in concentration, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of the proposed Northwood Industrial Park. Outside, the January wind howled against the single-pane windows of the converted textile mill, rattling the iron fire escape that crisscrossed the brick facade.  Dust motes danced in the beams of sunlight that managed to penetrate the grime, illuminating the faded grandeur of the space – soaring ceilings, exposed brick, and the ghosts of machinery long gone.  Amelia’s small drafting table, nestled in a corner near the rattling window, felt like a life raft in the vast, echoing room. The only other occupant, Mr. Henderson, the firm's perpetually grumpy senior draftsman, snored softly behind a towering stack of blueprints at the far end of the room. The aroma of stale coffee and his pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air.  It was 1957, and in the burgeoning city of Ashworth, opportunity seemed to be rising as fast as the new skyscrapers downtown, but for Amelia, the future felt as hazy as the winter sky outside.
