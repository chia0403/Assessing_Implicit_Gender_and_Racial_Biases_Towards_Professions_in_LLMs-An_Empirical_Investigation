The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the anxieties playing out on her patients’ faces.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of the building, mirroring the relentless storms brewing within her clients.  This particular Tuesday morning, however, felt different.  A thick, almost suffocating stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Vance’s heels against the linoleum floor as she walked towards her neatly organized desk.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis choked by smog and shrouded in perpetual twilight, seemed to hold its breath.

Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, inherited this crumbling office building and practice from her late mentor, a Dr. Alistair Finch. It had been more than two years since the day she stepped into this dilapidated but strangely comforting space. The building, a faded Art Deco relic, stood on a street corner overlooked by a cluster of towering skyscrapers, a silent testament to the relentless march of progress swallowing the past.  The chipped paint, the worn carpet, and the musty smell that clung to the air like a forgotten memory all seemed to whisper tales of the lives that had walked these hallowed halls before hers.  Inside, despite the dated layout, the room was meticulously organized.  Neat stacks of journals lined the shelves, and a calming collection of plants thrived in the small corners of the office. This wasn't just an office; it was a refuge, a place where the past and present collided, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.
