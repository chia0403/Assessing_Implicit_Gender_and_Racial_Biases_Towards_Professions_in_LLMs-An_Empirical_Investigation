The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air of the "Golden Crust" bakery, a tiny, almost hidden shop tucked between a bustling market stall and a towering, ivy-covered brick wall.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves, dappled the worn wooden counter where Elias Thorne, a baker with eyes the colour of a ripe plum and hands that seemed permanently dusted with flour, meticulously arranged a tray of delicate croissants.  He hummed a low, almost imperceptible tune, a melody lost in the rhythmic clatter of the rolling pin and the gentle clinking of metal pans.  Outside, the Parisian air, usually vibrant with the cries of vendors and the chatter of tourists, was unusually still, the only sound the occasional rustle of leaves and the distant rumble of a passing omnibus.  This morning, though, a strange quietness settled over Elias, a quietness that resonated deeper than the usual morning calm.  He felt a premonition, a vague stirring in the depths of his soul, a sense that today would be different, that something extraordinary, possibly even ominous, was about to unfold.
