The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the desolate, snow-covered plains of the High Peaks region.  The jagged peaks, sculpted by centuries of glacial ice, loomed like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.

The air, sharp with the scent of pine and frost, carried the faint, insistent whimpers of a creature in distress.  Eleanor, her breath puffing out in white clouds, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.  The calls for help were becoming more frequent, the animals' cries harsher, a troubling indicator of something amiss in the delicate balance of this untamed wilderness.
