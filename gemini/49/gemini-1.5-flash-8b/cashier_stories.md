The fluorescent hum of the "Corner Mart" was a constant, irritating thrum, vibrating through Amelia Stone's tired bones.  The small, brightly lit store, a testament to late-night convenience, felt like a concrete tomb on this Tuesday evening.  Rows of brightly-packaged snacks and sugary drinks lined the shelves, mocking the emptiness in her stomach.  Outside, the city pulsed with a life Amelia didn't feel a part of.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion against the quiet hum of the checkout scanner.  Amelia, with her messy braid falling over one eye and a tired sigh escaping her lips, was the only one left inside.  The closing bell had rung hours ago, the last customers swept away by the relentless pull of the night.
