The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and simmering spices, clinging to the narrow alleyways of the bustling Cairo souk.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the towering, ochre-hued buildings.  Aisha Al-Fayed, a meticulously dressed dietician with eyes the colour of polished obsidian, navigated the throngs of shoppers.  Her tailored linen abaya, a muted emerald green, shimmered against the vibrant tapestry of the marketplace, a testament to her careful preparation for this day.  This was no ordinary food market; it was the heart of a growing health crisis, a silent epidemic silently encroaching on the community.  Aisha, renowned for her ability to translate complex nutritional science into practical solutions for everyday families, had been summoned here by Dr. Mahmoud, her friend and mentor.  His urgent plea for her expertise had been more than just a request; it was a plea for hope for a community struggling with the devastating effects of malnutrition.
