The chipped paint of Miss Amelia Butterfield's classroom walls whispered stories of countless crayon-stained afternoons and forgotten storybook characters.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty windowpanes, painted stripes across the worn, linoleum floor, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the air.  A faint aroma of cinnamon and old paper clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the quiet sanctuary of Room 3B at Oakhaven Elementary.  Amelia, a woman with eyes the colour of melted chocolate and a smile that could thaw the iciest of hearts, surveyed her charges.  Ten-year-old twins, Leo and Lily, were engrossed in a furious game of checkers, their tiny brows furrowed in concentration.  Across the room, a shy girl named Maya, clutching a worn copy of "The Secret Garden," sat hunched over her desk, lost in the pages.  Amelia, with her meticulously organized lesson plans tucked neatly into her worn leather folder, felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders. Today's lesson:  unraveling the mysteries of the solar system.  But something felt different.  A subtle shift in the air, a hint of the extraordinary lurking beneath the ordinary.
