The aroma of roasted pheasant, mingled with the sharp tang of lemon and rosemary, hung heavy in the air of the "Golden Spoon," a small, unassuming bistro tucked between a crumbling apothecary and a bustling market stall.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that echoed the frantic beat of Amelia Josephine Featherstone's heart.  Tonight, the bistro was packed, a testament to the reputation Amelia had cultivated over the past five years.  Her meticulously crafted dishes, each a symphony of flavour and presentation, had drawn a loyal following of discerning palates.  But tonight, something felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thick as the plumes of steam rising from the bubbling sauces on the stove.  The clatter of plates and cutlery, usually a comforting soundtrack, now sounded almost discordant.  Amelia, the ever-present conductor of this culinary orchestra, felt a prickle of unease, a sense that the carefully orchestrated performance was about to go off-key.
