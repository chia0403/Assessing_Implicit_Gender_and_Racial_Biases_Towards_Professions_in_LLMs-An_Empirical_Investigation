The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly green glow over Amelia Nightingale, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  The small, dimly lit bar was a study in contrasts: chipped Formica tables jostled awkwardly beside plush velvet booths, the clinking of ice against glass mingled with the hushed murmur of conversation, and the faint scent of stale beer fought with the sharp tang of lemon and rosemary from Ameliaâ€™s expertly-maintained cocktail shaker.  Tonight, however, the usual low hum of the bar was punctuated by an unnerving silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. Amelia, her name etched onto the worn mahogany bar in a faded script, leaned against the cool surface, a glass of water almost forgotten in her hand.  The perpetual frown that usually etched itself into her brow was slightly softened, giving way to a look of profound weariness.  Outside, the city of Veridian sprawled beneath a bruised twilight sky, a metropolis seemingly oblivious to the strange stillness that had settled over the small, unassuming bar.
