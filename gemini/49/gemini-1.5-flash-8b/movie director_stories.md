The chipped Formica table, stained a sickly yellow from decades of lukewarm coffee and spilled lukewarm tea, groaned under the weight of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's weary hand.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated windows of her cramped, cluttered office, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Empty takeout containers, meticulously arranged by size and type, littered the space between the overflowing printer bin and a half-finished model of a futuristic spaceship, its chrome surfaces dulled by days of neglect. Amy, a movie director with more unfulfilled dreams than completed films, stared at the script sprawled before her.  Her name, embossed in faded gold lettering on the worn manuscript, seemed to mock her.  *Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne: Director.  And, a failure.*

The setting was the dimly lit, perpetually-overcrowded, and surprisingly cozy, back room of a small, independent film studio on the outskirts of the rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood in the city of  Portland.  The city itself, a pulsating mix of creative energy and economic desperation, cast a long shadow over Amy, whispering doubts into her mind as the relentless ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to mock her pacing.  The aroma of stale coffee and ozone, a familiar scent of her creative sanctuary, clung to the air.  Empty film canisters lined the walls, each a silent testament to films that never saw the light of day, memories of dreams never realized.
