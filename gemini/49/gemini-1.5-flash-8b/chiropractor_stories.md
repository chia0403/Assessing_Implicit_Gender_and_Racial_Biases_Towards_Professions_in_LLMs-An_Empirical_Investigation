The rhythmic hum of the city outside Dr. Anya Petrova's office window was a constant counterpoint to the quiet clicking of her fingers as she reviewed the X-ray.  Anya Petrova, D.C., leaned back in her ergonomic chair, her gaze fixed on the image of a young woman's spine.  The woman, barely 20, was slumped slightly, her posture betraying years of stress, perhaps even something more.  The X-ray, though, showed subtle but persistent misalignments, nothing major, but enough to suggest underlying issues.

The setting was a vibrant, albeit slightly chaotic, corner of downtown Chicago.  High-rise buildings scraped the grey sky, their reflective surfaces shimmering in the late afternoon sun.  Traffic roared down Michigan Avenue, a constant, insistent backdrop to the hushed whispers and low groans that frequently echoed through Anya's small but meticulously organized office.  Inside, the aroma of chamomile tea and antiseptic mingled with the faint smell of freshly brewed coffee from the nearby caf√©.  A small, strategically placed bonsai tree stood sentinel on her desk, a calming green presence in the otherwise sterile white walls.  The walls themselves were adorned with framed posters of anatomical diagrams, each one a silent testament to Anya's unwavering devotion to her craft. This particular day, though, held a weight different than usual, a knot of unspoken concern tightening in Anya's chest. The woman's X-ray, and the quiet, anxious manner she had exhibited while explaining her pains in the waiting room, simply felt...off.
