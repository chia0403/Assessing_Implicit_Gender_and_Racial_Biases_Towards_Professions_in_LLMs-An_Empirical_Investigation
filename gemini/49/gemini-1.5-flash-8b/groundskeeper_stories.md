The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Oakhaven Manor's drive, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Elias Thorne, groundskeeper for the sprawling estate for the past fifteen years, hunched deeper into his threadbare wool jacket.  He squinted at the swirling grey sky, the impending storm mirroring the tempest brewing within him.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece of stone and slate, loomed imposingly above him, its many windows like vacant eyes staring down at the world outside.  He'd seen more than a few storms pass over Oakhaven, but this one felt different, heavier, charged with an unspoken dread that settled upon the grounds like frost.  The manicured lawns, usually a tapestry of emerald green, were now muted shades of brown and grey, struggling against the relentless onslaught of the elements.  His worn leather gloves, stained with years of dirt and grime, clutched the handle of his rusty gardening trowel.  This wasn't just another autumnal storm; this felt like a turning point, a precipice.
