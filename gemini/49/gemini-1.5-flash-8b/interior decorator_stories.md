The chipped paint of the "For Rent" sign, a sickly yellow that seemed to mock the grey November sky, hung precariously on the weathered doorframe.  This was Amelia Nightingale's cue.  Amelia, a meticulous interior decorator with a flair for the dramatic and a surprising fondness for antique doorknobs, surveyed the dilapidated Victorian.  Cobwebs, thick as lace, draped from the eaves, catching the faint afternoon light.  The house, nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of the historic Blackwood district, whispered stories of forgotten dances and lost laughter.  Its silence, however, was a suffocating blanket, and Amelia, ever the whisperer of new life into the voiceless, felt a familiar thrill of challenge.  This house, though wounded, held a spark, a potential Amelia was eager to ignite.  It was the perfect canvas for her next masterpiece.
