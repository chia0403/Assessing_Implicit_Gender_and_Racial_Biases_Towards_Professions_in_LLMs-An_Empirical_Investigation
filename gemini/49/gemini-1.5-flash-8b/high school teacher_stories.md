The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Josephine Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air like a shroud.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window above her, painted the worn wooden desk in shifting hues of amethyst and emerald.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light piercing the gloom of her classroom at Hawthorne High, a school nestled deep within the whispering pines of Blackwood Hollow, a town perpetually shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  It was a Tuesday, the same as every other Tuesday.  The rhythmic squeak of the old floorboards, a familiar soundtrack to her existence, echoed the hollow thump of Amelia's own heart.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a melody that seemed to whisper secrets only the trees understood.  She watched as the last student, a pale-faced girl with eyes like polished storm clouds, slipped quietly out the door.
