The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm cast a pale, sickly yellow glow over Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s desk.  Paper, shredded receipts, and half-eaten takeout containers lay scattered like fallen leaves in a November storm.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the color of a stormy sea and hair the shade of midnight, hunched over a spreadsheet, the numbers blurring into an indistinguishable mass.  Around her, the office, a cramped space on the fifth floor of a downtown skyscraper, echoed with the rhythmic clatter of keyboards and the low, almost conspiratorial murmur of colleagues.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of honking taxis and the distant wail of sirens, a soundtrack to the relentless, often monotonous, work that filled Amelia's days.  The year was 2024.
