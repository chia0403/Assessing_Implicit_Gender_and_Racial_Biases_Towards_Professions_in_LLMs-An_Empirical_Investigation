The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floor of the Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral insects, swirled in the beams, reflecting the opulent gloom of the drawing-room.  Agnes Periwinkle, housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, meticulously polished a crystal vase, the faint scent of lavender clinging to her worn linen apron.  Each polished facet seemed to capture a fragment of the manor's history – a whispered secret, a forgotten laughter, a lingering sorrow.  The air, thick with the scent of aged leather and dried flowers, held the weight of centuries.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic-style mansion perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty Yorkshire moors.  The house itself was a monument to bygone grandeur, its many rooms echoing with the ghosts of forgotten celebrations and whispered tragedies.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows, adding a soundtrack of relentless drumming to the house's quiet stillness.  The manor’s sprawling gardens, once vibrant with colour, were now a muted canvas of grey and brown, frosted with the first signs of winter.
