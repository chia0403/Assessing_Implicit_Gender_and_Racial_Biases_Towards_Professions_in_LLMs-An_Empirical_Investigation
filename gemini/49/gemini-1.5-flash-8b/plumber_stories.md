The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, a relentless, insistent drumming, hammered against the corrugated metal.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with calloused hands and perpetually tired eyes, wrestled with a stubborn drainpipe.  He swore under his breath, the sound swallowed by the roar of the storm outside.  Barty, a man whose life revolved around the intricate dance of pipes and water, felt the familiar frustration tightening in his chest.  Tonight, the problem wasn't just a clogged sink; it was a torrent threatening to flood the entire building, a problem he’d sworn he'd solved last week, a problem that haunted his dreams.  This was not just a plumbing issue, but a personal one.
 
The cramped, dimly lit shop was a testament to years of Barty's dedication—and a little neglect.  Tools, gleaming and rusted, were strewn across scarred wooden tables.  The air smelled of mildew and the faint, chemical tang of drain cleaner.  A vintage, almost comical, porcelain sink overflowed with a murky green liquid.  Beyond the shop, the city roared, a symphony of car horns and sirens.  Inside, Barty, surrounded by the symphony of dripping and gurgling, found himself alone in his war against the relentless water.
