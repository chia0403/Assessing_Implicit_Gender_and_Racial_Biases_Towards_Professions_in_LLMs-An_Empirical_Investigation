The chipped paint on the "Welcome to the Rainbow Room" sign, a faded turquoise now more of a bruised lavender, seemed to sigh in the pre-dawn chill.  Amelia Katherine Finch, her auburn braid stubbornly defying the morning wind, pushed open the heavy door.  The faint scent of cinnamon and something subtly floral, perhaps lilies, hung in the air.  It was a scent that always heralded the start of a new day, a day full of sticky fingers, boisterous laughter, and the hesitant, sometimes heartbreaking, expressions of five-year-olds.

The Rainbow Room, nestled in the heart of the bustling, yet somehow quiet, Oakhaven neighborhood, was more than just a classroom.  It was a kaleidoscope of textures and colors â€“ a riot of bright primary-colored paint splashed across the walls, soft-fabric play area rugs, and the comforting, if slightly overstuffed, armchairs in the cozy reading corner.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained glass windows depicting whimsical animals, painted dappled patterns on the wooden floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the early morning air.  A faint buzz of anticipation filled the room, a low hum that always swelled to a joyful crescendo throughout the day.  Today, Amelia knew, was going to be particularly special.
