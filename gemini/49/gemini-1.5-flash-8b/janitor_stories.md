The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation headquarters hummed a mournful dirge, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished floors.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through a grimy window high above, illuminating a swirling vortex of forgotten paperwork.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, janitor.  Elias Thorne, custodian of secrets and silent witnesses, the unacknowledged architect of the Zenith Corporation's gleaming facade.  His worn, grey uniform, perpetually smudged with ink and the faint, chemical tang of cleaning fluid, was his armour, his anonymity.  Today, however, the usual hum of the building had a different, almost electric, quality. The air thrummed with an unspoken tension, a low-level anxiety that felt palpable even beneath the layers of grime.
