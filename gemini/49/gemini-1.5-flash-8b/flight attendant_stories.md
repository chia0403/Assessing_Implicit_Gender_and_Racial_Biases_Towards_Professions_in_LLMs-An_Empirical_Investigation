The humid air hung thick and heavy in the cabin, clinging to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin.  Sweat prickled her temples, a counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the engines as the Boeing 787 soared over the sapphire expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  Below, the islands of Fiji, emerald jewels scattered across the dark water, promised a paradise Amelia longed to explore, but knew she likely never would.  Her current mission was far more mundane: keeping the passengers of Flight 321—mostly bored businessmen and weary tourists—comfortably ensconced on their plastic seats until their arrival in Auckland.  It was a routine that, while predictable, held an unsettling rhythm, a quiet hum that echoed the steady thrum of her own dissatisfaction.

Amelia was stationed in the galley, the metal counters gleaming dully under the harsh fluorescent lights.  The aroma of stale coffee and lukewarm meals hung heavy, a stark contrast to the tantalizing scents of the islands she glimpsed from her window.  A cascade of clattering trays, the muffled sighs of passengers, the faint, metallic tang of disinfectant – these were the soundtrack of her existence.  A lifetime spent in the pressurized confines of a metal bird, a life carefully curated within the sterile framework of her job.  Yet, deep down, a restlessness brewed, a yearning to escape the gilded cage of her existence and explore the world beyond the clouds.
