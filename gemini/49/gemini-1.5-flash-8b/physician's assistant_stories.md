The fluorescent hum of the emergency room buzzed like a trapped bee, a constant, low-level thrum that Amelia Hayes found oddly comforting.  She wasn't sure why.  Maybe it was the rhythmic pulse of life and death woven into the fabric of the room, a soundtrack to the frantic choreography of the night.  Tonight, that soundtrack was particularly jarring.

The setting was the bustling, dimly lit emergency department of the Mercy Medical Center in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying section of the city.  Cracked linoleum floors, the faint smell of antiseptic and fear, and the echoing clatter of metal instruments on stainless steel tables – these were the familiar accompaniments to Amelia's nightly duties as a physician's assistant. Outside, the city thrummed with a different kind of energy – the low rumble of cars, the distant wail of sirens, the hushed murmur of conversations that Amelia couldn't hear, but knew were part of the symphony of the city.  A pale, almost ghostly moonlight spilled through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, casting long, distorted shadows of the frantic figures moving about.  Tonight, Amelia was particularly aware of the weight of each patient’s silent plea for help, the invisible threads of their stories clinging to the sterile air.
