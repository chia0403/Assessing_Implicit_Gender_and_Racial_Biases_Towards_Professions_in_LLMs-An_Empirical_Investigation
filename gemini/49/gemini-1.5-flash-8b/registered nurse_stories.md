Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Mercy Hospital emergency room, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sterile, almost hostile, glow on the chaotic scene unfolding before her.  Broken glass crunched under the rubber soles of her worn nursing shoes as she navigated the throng of anxious patients and their equally anxious relatives.  The year was 1987.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy in the humid, summer air.

Amelia Blackwood, a registered nurse with five years’ experience at Mercy, was a seasoned veteran of the ER, yet even she found herself grappling with the sheer volume of tonight's arrivals.  A mangled motorcycle accident, a heart attack that had hit a young mother while on a grocery run, and a series of seemingly minor injuries cascading from a late-night brawl in the city's downtown district – the emergency room seemed to have swallowed the entire city.  The pressure mounted, the adrenaline spiked, and the rhythmic pounding of the rain served as a grim soundtrack to the drama unfolding before her.  The rhythmic beep of monitors, the cries of children, and the hushed whispers of staff mingled into an unnerving symphony of urgency.
