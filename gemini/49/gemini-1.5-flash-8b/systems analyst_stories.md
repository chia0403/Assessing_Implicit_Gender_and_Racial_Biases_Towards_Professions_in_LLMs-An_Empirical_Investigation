The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming to Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst at NeoCorp.  He was accustomed to the sterile white walls, the rows of humming machines, the faint scent of burnt coffee that clung to the air like a spectral shroud.  This particular night, however, the thrumming was amplified, a low, insistent pulse that resonated not just in the metal and wires, but in his very bones.  Every few seconds, a jarring, high-pitched whine sliced through the hum, a sonic shiver that made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.  He wasn't sure if it was his imagination, or if the system, normally so predictably precise, was starting to unravel.

The server room, a vast cathedral of cooled metal and blinking lights, stretched out before him.  Rows upon rows of rack-mounted servers, each a silent, digital heart pumping data through a web of interconnected cables.  Tiny lights flickered and glowed in a chaotic ballet, casting shifting patterns on the polished concrete floor.  Elias, in his worn, but comfortable, grey hoodie and jeans, was hunched over a complex array of monitors, the lines of code scrolling past like a torrential river of binary.  The air conditioning, a constant, low-pitched whine, was the only sound louder than the churning of his own mind.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridia, a sprawling metropolis built on the foundation of technological progress, glittered under a sky of pale, artificial light. Elias was alone, except for the hum and the whine.
