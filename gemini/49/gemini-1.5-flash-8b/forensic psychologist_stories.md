Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, a relentless percussion mirroring the pounding in Dr. Eleanor Vance's temples.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and something akin to burnt sugar, a scent that clung to the walls like a shroud.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a chipped porcelain sink and a metal table scarred with countless faded ink smudges.  This was the Forensic Psychology Clinic of Dr. Alistair Finch, a man more known for his flamboyant theories than his practical applications.  Eleanor, a forensic psychologist with a reputation for unflinching objectivity, had been summoned here by a cryptic message from Finch, a message promising a case unlike any other.  The rain intensified, transforming the rhythmic drumming into a deafening roar.  The clinic seemed to vibrate with an underlying tension, an energy that thrummed beneath the surface of the crumbling edifice.  This was no ordinary investigation.  This was somethingâ€¦ deeper.
