The chipped paint on the workshop door, a sickly shade of faded teal, seemed to mock Elias Thorne's efforts.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the meagre sunlight filtering through the grime-coated window.  Elias, a carpenter of thirty-two years, hunched over his workbench, his calloused hands meticulously shaping a piece of seasoned oak.  The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the symphony of creaks and groans that punctuated the otherwise silent space.  Outside, the bustling city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on the back of industry and ambition, seemed a distant hum.  Within these four walls, Elias found his refuge, his sanctuary, his only real reality – one where the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his tools spoke volumes. The workshop was a testament to his life; a haphazard collection of tools, salvaged wood, and half-finished projects, each whispering stories of past endeavours and future dreams. Today's challenge, a delicate intricate frame for a new antique mirror, was yet another step towards making enough to keep his small family afloat, and enough to finally leave his father’s shadow behind.
