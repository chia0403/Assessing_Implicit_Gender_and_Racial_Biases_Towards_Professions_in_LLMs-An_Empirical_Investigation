The roar wasn't just the wind and rain; it was the hum of illegal speakeasies, the whispers of underworld figures, the clinking of high-stakes gambling games, and the faint cries of desperation from the teeming crowds.  Ace, a woman of uncommon resilience and even more uncommon determination, navigated this labyrinthine underworld with a steely gaze and a street-smart wit,  her tweed coat clinging to her as she dodged the muddy puddles and the hurried footsteps of the city's denizens.
