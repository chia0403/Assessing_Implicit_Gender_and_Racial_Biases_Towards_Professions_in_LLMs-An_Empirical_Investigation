The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air of Amelia Nightingale's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate latticework of the Parisian loft windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, painting shimmering patterns on the delicate silks draped over the work tables.  Amelia Nightingale, a dressmaker of renowned skill and almost legendary reputation, traced a meticulous line with a needle, the faintest whisper of a sigh escaping her lips.  Her atelier, a sprawling space tucked between a bustling marketplace and a quiet courtyard, was a symphony of rustling fabrics and the rhythmic clicking of scissors.  This particular morning, however, the symphony was muted, almost melancholic.  A chill, deeper than the autumn air, settled over her, a tangible premonition of something coming, something she couldn't quite name.  The upcoming social season, usually a whirlwind of commissions and exquisite creations, felt strangely stagnant, the murmurings of excitement from her neighbours a distant, dissonant harmony.  Her latest commission, a breathtaking gown destined for the Lady Beatrice Cavendish, felt weighed down by a foreboding shadow.
