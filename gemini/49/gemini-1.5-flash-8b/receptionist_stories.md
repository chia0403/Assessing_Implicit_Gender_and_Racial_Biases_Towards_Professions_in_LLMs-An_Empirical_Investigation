The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Solutions" office hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Blackwood’s fingers on the keyboard.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of desperation emanating from the hushed conversations filtering through the open doorway, was the familiar symphony of a Monday morning.  Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the colour of warm honey, stared blankly at the screen, the words "client scheduling" blinking menacingly.  Another Tuesday. Another mountain of appointments. Another day in the purgatory of the receptionist's desk.

The office, located on the fifth floor of a towering, glass-fronted skyscraper in the heart of the bustling metropolis of Zenith City, offered a breathtaking view of the sprawling cityscape.  But from Amelia's perspective, hemmed in by rows of overflowing file cabinets and a never-ending stream of clients – some demanding, some distracted, some just plain lost – the view was more of a blur of grey and steel.  The oversized windows, meant to provide a sense of grandeur, instead amplified the pressure.  Each reflected face, each fleeting shadow, seemed to judge her, to assess the competence – or lack thereof – of the company.  This was her domain, the first impression, the silent arbiter of the architects' day.  And Amelia, armed only with a stack of appointment cards and a weary smile, was determined to navigate the treacherous waters of Apex Architectural Solutions.
