The chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes wide with a perpetual, unsettling stare, sat atop the intricate sugar-rose arrangement.  Amelia "Amy" Butterfield, nimble fingers dancing across a cloud of spun sugar,  paused.  The delicate lacework of the icing, painstakingly sculpted to mimic a forgotten forest, seemed to hum with a silent energy.  Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the tiny, cobbled alleyway behind Amelia's bakery, "Sweet Surrender."  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon light, swirled around the tiny shop, a kaleidoscope of browns and beiges and dusty rose.  A single, wilted bougainvillea vine, clinging stubbornly to a crumbling brick wall, was the only splash of vibrant colour.  This,  she knew, was not just a cake. It was a commission, one burdened with a weight that extended far beyond the sugary fa√ßade.  The client, a reclusive antique dealer named Mr. Grimshaw, had never spoken.  He had only gestured, a silent, almost desperate language, towards the doll.  It was a request whispered on the wind, a riddle shrouded in the afternoon heat.
