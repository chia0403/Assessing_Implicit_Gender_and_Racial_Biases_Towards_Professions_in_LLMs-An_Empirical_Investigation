The chill of the early morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, a familiar companion to the butcher in the cobbled alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the glistening crimson of the freshly slaughtered lamb hanging from the rafters of the Butcher's Quarter.  Barty, a man whose calloused hands spoke volumes of years spent cleaving through sinew and cartilage, adjusted the worn leather apron around his waist. The air, thick with the pungent aroma of blood and roasting meat, clung to him, a second skin.  He was the only soul stirring in the still-sleeping district, the quiet before the city's waking roar, the only one who could truly appreciate the beauty in the silent symmetry of the carcasses.  The Butcher's Quarter, a labyrinth of narrow, echoing alleys, was not for the faint of heart.  Each doorway held the promise of a different, and often unpleasant, smell.  Each corner whispered tales of the city's rough edges, and today, Barty was ready to face them all.
