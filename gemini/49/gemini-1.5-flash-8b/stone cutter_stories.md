The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the exposed stone face of the mountain, stinging Elara Stonehand’s cheeks.  Dust, fine as powdered granite, danced in the pale light of the approaching twilight, swirling around her as she meticulously chipped away at a stubborn vein of quartz running through the grey basalt.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of the ancient earth.  Elara, her name a testament to her profession, was a stone cutter in the remote valley of Veridian Glade, a place where the mountains clawed at the sky and the whispers of forgotten ages echoed in the wind.  Her hammer, a familiar weight in her calloused hand, resonated with a dull thud against the stone, a counterpoint to the symphony of the wind's song.  Around her, the rough-hewn forms of half-finished statues—figures of warriors, gods, and nameless beasts—stood in various stages of completion, incomplete monuments to a forgotten civilization.  Veridian Glade was a place where the past felt tangible, where history was carved into the very heart of the land.
