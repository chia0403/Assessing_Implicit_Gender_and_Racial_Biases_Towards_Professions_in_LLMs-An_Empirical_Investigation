The biting wind whipped Amelia Genevieve Hayes's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the forest path clawed at the bruised, grey sky.  October.  Always a cruel month in the Vermont hills.  Even the usually cheerful chatter of the resident squirrels had fallen silent, replaced by the mournful rustling of leaves.  Amelia, bundled in layers of wool and fleece, pressed on, the rhythmic crunch of fallen leaves the only soundtrack to her solitary journey.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar aroma that usually calmed her, but today, it only served to heighten the oppressive silence.  She was seeking solace, not serenity, in the woods surrounding the small, isolated town of Willow Creek, a place where the secrets of the forest seemed to whisper on the wind.  Her patient, a young woman named Elara, had been quiet, unusually withdrawn since the accident.  Amelia knew the forest held a certain magic, a power that could draw out the deepest emotions, and today, she needed to feel that power.
