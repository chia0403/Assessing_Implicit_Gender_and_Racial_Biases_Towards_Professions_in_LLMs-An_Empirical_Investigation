The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her drill.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the harsh glare, seemed to absorb the quiet anxieties of her patients.  Today, though, the usual symphony of whimpers and whispered apologies was absent.  An unnerving silence hung heavy in the air, broken only by the whirring of the extraction unit and the occasional metallic *click* of a dental tool.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, stared at the X-ray.  Something was off.  Not just a misplaced tooth, or a surprising cavity. This was...different.

The setting: a small, but well-maintained dental practice on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a town nestled amidst rolling hills and ancient woodlands.  A gentle breeze whispered through the trees outside the large bay window, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth.  Oakhaven was known for its quiet charm, its residents mostly occupied with their own quiet lives and hushed conversations.  The practice, nestled on a quiet street, had served the community for decades, its walls filled with portraits of smiling patients, faded with time.  But today, a sense of unease hung in the air, both inside and out.
