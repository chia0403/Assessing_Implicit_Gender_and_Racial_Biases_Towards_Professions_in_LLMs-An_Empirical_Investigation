The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket, the familiar ache of frostbite a constant companion on these late-October nights.  The sprawling expanse of the Blackrock Mountains loomed around her, silhouettes sharp against the bruised twilight sky.  Below, nestled in a valley choked with ancient pines, lay the village of Oakhaven, a place Amelia knew intimately, not just for its cobblestone streets and thatched roofs, but for the fierce determination burning in the hearts of its inhabitants.  Amelia was their coach, their guide, their unwavering beacon of hope, not just for their fledgling sporting teams, but for their spirits too.  The village had been through a particularly brutal winter, and the whispers of despair had begun to gather like storm clouds.  It was a responsibility Amelia carried with the same weight she carried her worn, leather-bound journal filled with handwritten strategies and the memories of countless victories and setbacks. Tonight, however, felt different.  A premonition, cold and sharp as the wind, had settled in her bones.  Something was stirring in the mountains, something dangerous, something that could shatter the fragile peace of Oakhaven.
