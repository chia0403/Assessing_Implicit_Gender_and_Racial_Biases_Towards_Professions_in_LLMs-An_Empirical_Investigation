The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow-green from decades of unloved dish soap, reflected Amelia “Amy” Carmichael’s face back at her.  She sighed, a sound as sharp and brittle as the broken nail shard lodged in the drain.  Another client, another set of perfectly manicured nails, another carefully crafted conversation meant to be both professional and, somehow, engaging.  Today’s was a woman with eyes the color of polished amethyst, a woman who spoke in clipped pronouncements and demanded her nails to be, as she put it, “extraordinarily brilliant.”

The salon, "The Polished Petal," was tucked away on a side street in the bustling, yet somehow melancholic, city of Veridian.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the pastel-colored nail polish bottles that lined the shelves.  The air hung heavy with the scent of artificial flowers and diluted nail polish remover.  A faint, persistent hum vibrated through the worn linoleum floor, a sound that seemed to emanate not just from the city outside but from the very marrow of the building itself.  A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed above the meticulously organized work stations, casting long, unforgiving shadows on the manicured hands and faces around her. Amy, perched on a stool in the back, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her chest.  This wasn't just another day at The Polished Petal; it was a day she feared might finally crack the carefully constructed facade she'd built around her heart.
