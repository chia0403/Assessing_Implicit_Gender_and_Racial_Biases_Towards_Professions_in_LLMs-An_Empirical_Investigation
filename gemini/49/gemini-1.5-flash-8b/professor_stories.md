Professor Eleanor Vance, renowned astrophysicist and meticulous record-keeper, stared at the swirling nebula photograph.  Not just stared, but *scrutinized*.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through her cluttered office, illuminating the faint, almost imperceptible shimmer in the lower right quadrant of the image.  It wasn't a star, not a known asteroid, not anything cataloged in the vast databases of the galactic archives.  It was...different.  A subtle anomaly, a whisper of something out of place in the vast symphony of the cosmos.

Her office, a chaotic haven of overflowing bookshelves, half-eaten takeout containers, and meticulously organized binders filled with astronomical data, was a microcosm of her own mind.  Papers littered the desk, each a fragment of a different astronomical investigation; equations scribbled in a spidery, almost lyrical script covered the surface, alongside faded tea stains and the telltale imprint of countless coffee cups.  The air hung thick with the smell of old paper and stale coffee.  Outside, the bustling city of New Avalon, a metropolis built on the foundations of forgotten civilizations and bathed in the perpetual glow of the city's atmospheric lights, roared with the cacophony of daily life, a stark contrast to the quiet hum of her work.  A half-finished pot of chamomile tea sat on the edge of her desk, its steam rising to join the dust motes in their dance.
