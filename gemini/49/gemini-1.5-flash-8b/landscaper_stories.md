The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s back, turning the already sweat-slicked fabric of her linen shirt into a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat rising from the cracked earth of the overgrown garden.  Amelia, a seasoned landscaper with calloused hands and eyes that had seen countless blooms and withered hopes, cursed under her breath.  This overgrown monstrosity, once a meticulously planned rose garden, was a far cry from the pristine, vibrant oasis she'd envisioned.  The client, Mrs. Eleanor Finch, a woman renowned for her sharp tongue and even sharper taste, was due to inspect the disaster area any minute.  Amelia's stomach tightened.  This job, more than any other, felt like a personal affront, a direct challenge to her reputation.

The setting:  A sprawling, sun-baked suburban estate on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a town renowned for its meticulously manicured lawns and extravagant gardens.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of thyme and wilting petunias.  A rusted wrought-iron gate, its once-elegant design now marred by rust and neglect, marked the entrance to the property.  Beyond the gate, the once-proud rose garden was a tangled riot of weeds, encroaching ivy, and overgrown shrubs, a stark contrast to the manicured lawns that surrounded it.  A single, defiant rose, struggling to bloom amidst the chaos, stood as a silent testament to the garden's former glory.
