The biting wind, a razor-sharp blade against Amelia "Em" Petrova's cheeks, whipped dust devils across the cracked asphalt of Interstate 80.  The midday sun, a cruel, indifferent eye, beat down on the desolate landscape stretching to the horizon, a tapestry woven from barren plains and the occasional, stubbornly green patch of scrub.  Em, her faded safety vest a muted beacon against the ochre of the highway, wrestled with a stubborn bolt, the rhythmic clang of her wrench echoing in the vast emptiness.  This wasn't the picturesque desert she'd imagined as a child, captivated by stories of cowboys and dusty trails.  This was work, unforgiving and relentlessly monotonous.  

The year was 2042.  The sprawling metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, shimmering with its holographic billboards and autonomous vehicles, felt a world away from the forgotten stretches of highway where Em toiled.  The very air, thick with the scent of ozone and recycled exhaust, seemed to whisper of the looming scarcity of resources and the growing divide between the gleaming urban centres and the neglected, often forgotten, infrastructure that held the whole fragile system together.  Today, her section of I-80 held the brunt of a particularly aggressive dust storm, adding to the daily struggle to maintain the increasingly battered arterial highway that connected the remnants of the old world.
