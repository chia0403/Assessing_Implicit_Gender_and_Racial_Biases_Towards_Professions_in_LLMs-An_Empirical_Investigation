The biting November wind whipped Amelia Josephine Blackwood's cloak around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled streets of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering gas lamps, danced in the pale moonlight.  The sprawling manor, her familyâ€™s ancestral home and the heart of the Blackwood estate, loomed before her like a brooding giant, its silhouette stark against the inky sky.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar but unsettling perfume, especially tonight.  Tonight, something felt different. A tremor, almost imperceptible, ran through the very foundations of the estate.  Dr. Amelia Blackwood, physician to the Blackwood family for generations, knew this feeling.  It heralded the coming of illness, of crisis, and tonight, the whispers from the manor were not of simple ailments.  They were of something...worse.
