The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming, a soundtrack to Elara Blackwood's life.  Dust motes danced in the meagre afternoon sunlight that sliced through the grimy windows of the "Precision Plans" workshop, illuminating the intricate lines and curves etched onto the oversized drafting tables.  Elara, her name a whispered echo in the sterile air, leaned over a table, her pencil a blur against the vellum.  The precise, almost surgical, movements of her hands were a familiar ballet, a silent language understood only by the steel and concrete that filled the building.  She was a drafting worker, a translator of dreams into blueprints, a whisperer of structures into existence.


The setting:  The Precision Plans drafting room, located in the industrial heart of the rust-belt city of Ashwood.  The room itself was a cavernous space, long and narrow, filled with a depressing array of worn drafting tables, antiquated drawing instruments, and the faint smell of aged ink and stale coffee.  Windows, dusty and grimy, offered only a muted view of the sprawling factory complex and the endless expanse of grey skies above. The air was thick with the palpable tension of deadlines and the whisper of unspoken anxieties.
