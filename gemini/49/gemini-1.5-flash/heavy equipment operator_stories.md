The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s cheeks, a familiar sting she’d grown accustomed to over her fifteen years wrestling behemoths of steel across the Nevada desert.  The air hung thick with the scent of creosote and diesel, a perfume as comforting as a worn-out work glove.  The rising sun, a bruised plum against the eastern horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the half-built solar farm stretching across the desolate landscape. Amy sat perched in the cab of her Caterpillar D11T, the gargantuan bulldozer humming a low, rumbling song beneath her. Dust motes, illuminated by the weak light, danced in the beam of her headlamp like tiny, mischievous spirits.  The only other sound was the rhythmic scrape of her blade, carving a precise path through the unforgiving earth, a path that would soon hold rows of solar panels, silently absorbing the sun’s energy.  Today, however, the familiar rhythm felt…off. A nagging unease prickled at the edges of Amy’s usually stoic focus.
