The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Grace Hawthorne's fingertips, a familiar testament to another Friday night rush at The Rusty Mug.  Amelia, or Amy as most of the regulars called her, wiped at it with a rag that smelled faintly of stale beer and desperation.  The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, spilled coffee, and the low thrum of conversation â€“ a chaotic symphony only a seasoned server could navigate without losing their mind.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unforgiving glare on the peeling wallpaper depicting a jaunty, cartoonish mug overflowing with foam.  Beyond the window, the neon glow of the city pulsed, a glittering promise of escape that felt a million miles away from the sticky tables and demanding customers of The Rusty Mug.
