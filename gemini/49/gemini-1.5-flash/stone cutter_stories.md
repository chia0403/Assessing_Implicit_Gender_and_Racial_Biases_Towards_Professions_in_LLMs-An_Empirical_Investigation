The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of the hammer.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering oil lamp hanging from the raftered ceiling, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous spirits.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, a stone cutter whose hands, gnarled and strong as the very rock he shaped, moved with a precision honed over decades.  The air smelled of damp earth, sharp granite, and something faintly sweet â€“ the lingering scent of the elderflower tea Elias usually kept warming on the hearth, a small comfort against the biting chill of the late autumn evening. Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad against the towering cliffs that surrounded the isolated village of Oakhaven, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the land that had both nurtured and challenged Elias his entire life.
