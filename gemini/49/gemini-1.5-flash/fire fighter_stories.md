The acrid bite of smoke stung Lieutenant Elias Thorne's eyes, a familiar discomfort that did little to dull the sharp, adrenaline-fueled awareness that thrummed beneath his ribs.  Flames, a malevolent orange maw, gnawed at the Victorian townhouse on Elm Street, the heat radiating outwards in waves that buckled the asphalt and singed the already wilting hydrangeas lining the manicured lawn.  The crackling roar of the fire was a counterpoint to the panicked shouts of the crowd gathered behind the police barricade, a chaotic symphony of destruction that Elias had come to know all too well in his thirteen years with the San Francisco Fire Department.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The air hung heavy not just with smoke, but with a chilling premonition that gnawed at the edges of his courage.  The flickering gaslight illuminating the scene cast long, dancing shadows, making the already sinister inferno appear even more monstrous.
