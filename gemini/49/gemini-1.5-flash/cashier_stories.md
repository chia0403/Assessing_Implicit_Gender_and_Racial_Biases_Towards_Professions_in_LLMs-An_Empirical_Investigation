The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's increasingly tedious Tuesday.  Amelia, whose name tag declared her simply "Amy," sighed, the puff of air barely disturbing the meticulously arranged stack of lottery tickets before her.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ the familiar aroma of a convenience store clinging to the edges of dawn. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, promising another sweltering summer day in the sprawling, sun-baked town of Harmony Creek, Arizona.  The only sounds besides the humming lights were the rhythmic whir of the refrigerator and the occasional, distant drone of a passing semi-truck on Route 66, its phantom rumble a stark contrast to the stillness inside the store.  Amelia absently tapped her pen against the countertop, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the silent anticipation of the day's first customer.
