The aroma of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the relentless Seattle drizzle lashing against the windows of Serenity Spa.  Rain hammered a steady rhythm against the oversized panes, a counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic hum of the massage table’s motor.  Inside, nestled amongst plush towels and the gentle glow of Himalayan salt lamps, sat Elara Genevieve Vance, her fingers kneading a small, tense knot in her client’s shoulder. Elara, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as they were gentle, felt the familiar thrum of energy flow beneath her fingertips – a tension not just in the muscle, but in the very soul of the woman lying beneath her.  This wasn't just another Tuesday at Serenity Spa; this felt…different.
