The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own heart.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with five years and countless anxious patients under her belt, felt the familiar prickle of adrenaline crawling up her spine.  It wasn’t the usual pre-draw jitters; this was different.  The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something else… something metallic, faintly sweet, and undeniably wrong.  Outside, the late-afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sterile linoleum floor, painting the normally bustling hallway in an unsettling, almost theatrical light.  A single, flickering emergency room light pulsed erratically, a frantic strobe in the otherwise calm, clinical environment.  Tonight, Mercy General felt less like a hospital and more like a stage set for a tragedy yet to unfold.
