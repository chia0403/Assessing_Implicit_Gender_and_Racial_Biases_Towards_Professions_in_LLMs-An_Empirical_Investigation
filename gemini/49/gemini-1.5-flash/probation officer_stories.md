The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the frayed edges of Elias Thorne’s patience.  He sat behind his scarred mahogany desk, the afternoon sun slanting through the grime-streaked window, painting dust motes dancing in the air.  The air itself hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee, despair, and something faintly floral – probably the air freshener struggling against the overwhelming aroma of human desperation. Outside, the relentless summer heat baked the asphalt of the city's forgotten corner, a simmering backdrop to the simmering tensions within the cramped office. Elias, a man whose face bore the weight of countless broken promises and shattered lives, sighed, the sound swallowed by the hum of the aging air conditioner.  His worn leather briefcase lay open beside him, its contents – files overflowing with the hopes and failures of his charges – a silent testament to the Sisyphean task he'd undertaken. Today, however, the weight felt heavier than usual.  It was the case of  Marcus Holloway that was weighing him down.  Holloway’s probation hearing was scheduled for 3 pm, and the clock was already ticking past 2:55.
