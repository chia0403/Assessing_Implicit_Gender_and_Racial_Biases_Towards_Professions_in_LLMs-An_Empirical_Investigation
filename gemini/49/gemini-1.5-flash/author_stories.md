The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s face as she leaned against the weathered railing of the *Seraphina*, the fishing trawler groaning beneath her.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead, a counterpoint to the rhythmic churn of the engine.

The grey, turbulent sea mirrored the turmoil brewing within her, a tempest far more potent than any she’d ever conjured on the page.

This unplanned voyage, however, felt far more compelling than any fictional adventure she could ever create.
