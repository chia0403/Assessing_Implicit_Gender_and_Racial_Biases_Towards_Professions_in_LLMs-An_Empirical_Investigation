The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she navigated the treacherous, wind-whipped path leading down to the craggy coastline.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the churning grey sky, cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled, wind-battered pines that clung precariously to the cliff edge.  Below, the Atlantic roared its disapproval, a relentless symphony of crashing waves and howling wind that mirrored the turmoil in Eleanor’s own heart.  Her worn leather satchel, containing her usual array of therapeutic tools – resistance bands, a foam roller, and a well-thumbed copy of *Kinesiology for Rehabilitation* – swung rhythmically against her hip, a counterpoint to the chaotic rhythm of the sea.  This wasn't her typical Tuesday afternoon at the brightly lit, sterile clinic; today, her appointment was with a patient unlike any she’d encountered before – a man clinging to life, both literally and figuratively, on the isolated shores of the remote island of Aisling.
