The brass spittoon gleamed under the single, dusty bulb hanging in the dimly lit hallway of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  A thick layer of cigar smoke clung to the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender and something distinctlyâ€¦musty.  It was the kind of smell that seeped into your bones after a long day, a smell that twenty-year-old Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield knew intimately.  He polished a already-gleaming silver tray with a practiced hand, the rhythmic squeak a counterpoint to the mournful groan of the ancient elevator shaft somewhere beyond the stained-glass doors.  Barty adjusted his ill-fitting but crisp, navy blue uniform, the tiny, tarnished Grand Majestic crest pricking his skin slightly. Tonight, like every other night, promised a parade of eccentric guests and equally eccentric luggage through the hallowed, if somewhat decaying, halls of the Grand Majestic.  And Barty Butterfield, the most observant bellhop in the city, was ready for them all.
