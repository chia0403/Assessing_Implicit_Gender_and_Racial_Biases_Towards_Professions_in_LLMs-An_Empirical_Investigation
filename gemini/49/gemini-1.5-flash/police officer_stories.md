The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate Cornish coastline.  The sky, a bruised purple merging with the churning grey sea, mirrored the grimness settling in her gut.  Below her, clinging precariously to the jagged cliffs, lay the wreckage of a small fishing boat, its splintered wood a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the churning waves.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something else… something metallic and sickeningly sweet, clung to her like a shroud. This wasn't a routine fishing accident; Mia knew it in her bones. This was something far more sinister, something that had washed ashore with the tide, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a chilling silence that the wind itself couldn’t quite drown out.
