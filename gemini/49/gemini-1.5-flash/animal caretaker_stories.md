The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in the sprawling, slightly ramshackle grounds of Blackwood Manor.  Blackwood wasn't your typical stately home;  its elegant Georgian facade was more than offset by the menagerie of creatures that spilled from its extensive outbuildings – a cacophony of barks, meows, clucks, and the occasional indignant squawk punctuating the otherwise quiet countryside.  Amelia, bundled in layers of worn wool, barely registered the cold.  Her focus was entirely on coaxing the stubborn hay into the hungry mouths of the manor’s resident pygmy goats, a particularly boisterous and demanding bunch.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the cobbled courtyard, painting the ancient stone walls in hues of orange and purple, a stark contrast to the muddy chaos surrounding Amelia and her charges.
