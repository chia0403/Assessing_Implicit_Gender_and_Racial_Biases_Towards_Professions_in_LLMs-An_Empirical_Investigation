The shop itself was a time capsule, a relic of a bygone era tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street, its walls lined with faded photographs of long-dead patrons and sporting memorabilia yellowed with age.  Elias, with his silver-streaked hair neatly combed back from his forehead and his hands, gnarled but steady, worked with a practiced ease that spoke of decades spent honing his craft.
