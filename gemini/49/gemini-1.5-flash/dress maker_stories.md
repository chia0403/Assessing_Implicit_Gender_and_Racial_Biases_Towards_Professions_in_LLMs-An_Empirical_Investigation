The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the arched window of "Stitches & Dreams."  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate purple from the dye she'd been using, meticulously stitched a tiny, iridescent bead onto the bodice of a gown the colour of a summer twilight.  The shop itself, nestled on a cobbled lane in the heart of the ancient port city of Porthaven, was a haven of faded elegance.  Cracked porcelain dolls, their painted eyes slightly askew, lined the shelves alongside bolts of shimmering fabric in every imaginable hue.  The rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock, its face obscured by a crocheted shawl, punctuated the quiet hum of Amelia's sewing machine, a constant companion in her solitary world.  Outside, the cries of gulls and the distant rumble of cargo ships provided a soundtrack to her creative solitude, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos soon to erupt in her otherwise peaceful life.
