The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the chill November air that seeped through the gaps in the corrugated iron walls of Thorne's Auto Repair.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above his workbench, danced in the shafts of light slicing through the grime-coated windows.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the skeletal branches of the lone oak tree that stood sentinel over the dilapidated building, a fitting testament to the equally weathered state of the business itself.  The scent of burnt oil and something vaguely metallic, possibly a hint of ozone from a recent electrical fault, hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias, a comforting aroma that spoke of honest labor and stubborn resilience.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting hum of the workshop was absent, replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the relentless wind and the rhythmic tick-tock of a battered grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from a time when Thorne's Auto Repair had been a thriving enterprise.
