The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the deserted street, the collar of her thick wool coat pulled high.  Salt spray, thick as sea mist, stung her cheeks, a familiar discomfort in the coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  The only sounds competing with the wind were the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore and the mournful cry of a distant seagull.  Port Blossom, nestled between the churning Pacific and a range of brooding, rain-lashed mountains, was beautiful in a stark, unforgiving way – a beauty that mirrored Amelia’s own mood.  Tonight, the beauty felt particularly menacing, a cruel mockery of the frantic thump of her heart.  She was late, desperately late, and the weight of her responsibility pressed down on her like the heavy, grey sky above.  The emergency call had been vague, chillingly so, only mentioning a "severe trauma" at the isolated lighthouse keeper's cottage on Widow's Point.  Amelia, a physician's assistant at the Port Blossom Community Clinic, knew this meant one thing: trouble. Serious trouble.
