The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the sound swallowed almost entirely by the roar of the engine.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks shrouded in a swirling veil of near-whiteout conditions.  Visibility was down to practically nothing, the only landmarks the occasional jagged silhouette briefly piercing the swirling snow, quickly swallowed again by the blizzard's relentless assault.  Evie gripped the yoke, knuckles bone-white, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit.  This wasn't just a flight; it was a desperate race against the encroaching darkness and the unforgiving wilderness, a gamble with the very elements themselves. The radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the aircraft's engine â€“ the only sound, besides the wind, that offered any semblance of comfort in this desolate, icy kingdom.
