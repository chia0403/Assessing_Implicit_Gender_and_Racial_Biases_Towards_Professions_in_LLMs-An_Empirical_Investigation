The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and subtly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Blackwood Memorial Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, her name a whisper on the wind rustling the lace curtains, meticulously catalogued a first edition of  “Wuthering Heights,” her spectacles perched precariously on her nose.  The library, a gothic masterpiece of dark oak and soaring ceilings, felt less like a place of work and more like a sacred space, a silent guardian of countless untold stories.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, a stark contrast to the hushed reverence within.  But tonight, Eleanor sensed something else stirring in the shadowed corners, something far more unsettling than the usual creaks and groans of a building as old as Blackwood itself.
