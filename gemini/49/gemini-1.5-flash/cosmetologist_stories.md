The scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  Sera, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird's wings and a laugh that could charm the birds from the trees, surveyed her salon, "Shear Indulgence," with a practiced eye.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the large, arched windows that overlooked the bustling cobblestone streets of Montmartre, Paris.  The salon itself was a riot of colour –  a vibrant tapestry woven with plush velvet armchairs in jewel tones, antique mirrors reflecting a kaleidoscope of shimmering hair dyes, and the gentle hum of a vintage hairdryer that had witnessed countless transformations over the years. Outside, the cacophony of Parisian life – the chatter of tourists, the rumble of scooters, the melancholic strains of an accordion – provided a lively counterpoint to the serene atmosphere within.  Today, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, heavier than the scent of rosemary shampoo.  Sera felt it in the pit of her stomach, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with a botched perm and everything to do with the cryptic note she'd found tucked into her appointment book that morning.
