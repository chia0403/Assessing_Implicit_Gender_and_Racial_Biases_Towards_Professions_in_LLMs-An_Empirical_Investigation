The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips as she polished a already gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, orange smear.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap bourbon and the acrid tang of stale cigarette smoke, a familiar perfume in this dimly lit haven nestled in the forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town clinging to the edge of a dying coal mine and a fading memory of its own prosperity.  The only sound louder than the drumming rain was the low hum of the refrigerator, a tireless, mechanical heartbeat in the otherwise quiet pre-dawn hours.  Elara, with her weary eyes and a sigh that mirrored the city's exhaustion, wiped down the bar again, the rhythmic motion a silent prayer for the day to be kinder than the last.
