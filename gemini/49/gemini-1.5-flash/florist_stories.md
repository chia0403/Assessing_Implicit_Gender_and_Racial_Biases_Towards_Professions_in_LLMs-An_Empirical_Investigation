The scent of lilies, heavy and intoxicating, hung in the air like a perfume cloud, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Lavender Lane.  Rain, a persistent drizzle that had lasted for three days, plastered Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn curls to her forehead.  Water beaded on the scarlet petals of the roses in her shop window, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow.  Inside "Petals & Promises," Amelia's small but perfectly formed flower shop, the air was a warmer, more vibrant mix of damp earth and exotic blooms.  Tonight, however, even the usual comforting aroma couldn't quite mask the creeping unease that snaked through Amelia's usually cheerful disposition.  A chill, deeper than the autumn evening's dampness, settled in her bones, hinting at something far more sinister than a late-season storm brewing just beyond the stained-glass window.
