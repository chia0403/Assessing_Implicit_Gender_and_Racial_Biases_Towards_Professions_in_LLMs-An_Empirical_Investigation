The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Rella”  Montrose truly appreciated.  Her salon, “Shear Bliss,” nestled on the cobbled side street of Rue de la Lune in the ancient, slightly dilapidated, but undeniably charming town of Saint-Cerf, France, was a testament to her eclectic tastes.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather flamboyant, scissor-wielding cherub, dappled the worn wooden floorboards.  The air vibrated with the low hum of the vintage hair dryers and the gentle clatter of Rella’s own nimble fingers as she meticulously snipped a stray strand from Madame Dubois's perfectly coiffed silver bob. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the terracotta rooftops, but inside Shear Bliss, a calm, almost magical, tranquility reigned.
