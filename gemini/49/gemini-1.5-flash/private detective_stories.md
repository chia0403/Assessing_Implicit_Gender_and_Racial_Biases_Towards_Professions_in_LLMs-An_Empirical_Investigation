The chipped porcelain of the coffee cup warmed Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s fingers, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whipping through the alleyway behind the Crimson Quill nightclub. Rain, the kind that seeped into your bones and stole the warmth from your soul, plastered her trench coat to her back.  Neon signs bled lurid colours onto the slick, garbage-strewn pavement, reflecting in the puddles that mirrored a distorted cityscape.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap perfume and the acrid tang of stale beer, a familiar olfactory symphony in Mia’s nocturnal world.  She took another sip of the lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring the sour mood settling in her stomach. This case – finding a missing jazz musician named Silas Blackwood – was proving far more complicated, and far less lucrative, than she’d anticipated.
