The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant sketchbook from his windbreaker.  Grey, churning waves crashed against the jagged cliffs of the Aran Islands, their rhythmic roar a counterpoint to the frantic scribbling of his charcoal pencil.  The wind, a raw, untamed beast, threatened to rip the page from his hands, yet Elias held firm, his gaze transfixed on the ancient stone fort perched precariously on the cliff edge – Dún Aonghasa.  He was an architect, not a storm chaser, but the raw power of the Atlantic, the brutal beauty of the landscape, and the sheer audacity of the centuries-old structure had captivated him completely. This wasn't a typical site visit; it was a pilgrimage. Elias, renowned for his minimalist designs and innovative use of sustainable materials, had come seeking inspiration, a connection to something older, something more primal than the glass and steel towers that defined his city life.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the faint echo of centuries past, whispering secrets only the stones could understand.
