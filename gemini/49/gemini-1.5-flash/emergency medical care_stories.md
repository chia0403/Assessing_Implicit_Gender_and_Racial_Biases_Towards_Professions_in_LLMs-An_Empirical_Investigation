The crisp, pristine white snow of the mountainside was now marred by a crimson stain spreading slowly across the packed powder.  Amy, a seasoned paramedic with the Aspen Valley Emergency Medical Services, adjusted her headlamp, its beam cutting through the gloom, and braced herself for whatever lay ahead.  The silence, broken only by the frantic crackle of her radio and the distant mournful howl of the wind, amplified the gravity of the situation.  Tonight, Aspen’s glittering façade of winter wonderland hid a brutal reality.
