The air hung thick and cloying, a miasma of blood and sawdust and the faintly sweet decay of offal.  Arthur Penhaligon, his apron stained a deep, almost celebratory crimson, ran a calloused thumb along the glistening surface of a prime rib roast, the fat marbling like a winter landscape under the gaslight.  His shop, Penhaligon's Prime Cuts, was tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight district of Grimsborough, a place where the shadows clung to the brickwork like clinging ivy and secrets were as common as stray cats. The only sounds were the rhythmic *thunk* of his cleaver against the butcher block and the distant, mournful wail of a foghorn, a sound as familiar to Arthur as the scent of roasting bone marrow.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort of his work was overshadowed by an unease that prickled at the back of his neck, a feeling far colder than the chill seeping from the November wind whistling through the cracks in the shop's ancient windowpanes.
