The air hung heavy with the scent of sweat, floor wax, and the faint, lingering perfume of a forgotten cheerleader's hairspray – a potent cocktail that perfectly encapsulated Blackwood Academy: a place of both vigorous activity and quiet decay.  Tonight, however, the usual post-game chaos was absent. An unsettling stillness settled over the vast space, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Elias’s broom and the quiet squeak of his worn-out shoes.
