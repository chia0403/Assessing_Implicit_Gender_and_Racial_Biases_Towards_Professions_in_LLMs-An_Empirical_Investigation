The scent of sandalwood and simmering chamomile hung heavy in the air, a familiar balm to Elara Vance’s weary soul.  Rain lashed against the warped, wooden shingles of Apothecary Vance, its rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the soft crackle of the fire in the hearth.

Each jar held a meticulously labelled treasure – a potent remedy, a fragrant oil, or perhaps a curious ingredient awaiting its destined purpose.  Tonight, however, the only thing simmering besides the chamomile was the unease that clung to the air like damp wool, heavier even than the relentless rain outside.  The small coastal town of Port Blossom, usually quiet and predictable, felt charged with an unspoken tension, a secret humming beneath the surface.
