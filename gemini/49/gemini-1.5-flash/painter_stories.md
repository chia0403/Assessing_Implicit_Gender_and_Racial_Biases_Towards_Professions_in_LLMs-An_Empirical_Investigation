The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She gripped the worn wooden railing of the dilapidated pier, the wind whipping her auburn hair across her canvas, threatening to smear the still-wet oils of the churning grey sea.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, a pungent perfume that Aurelia, despite her years spent painting this very coastline, never quite grew accustomed to.  Her easel, perched precariously on a crumbling section of the pier, groaned a mournful protest with each gust.  Below, the jagged rocks of Widow's Cove clawed at the retreating tide, their teeth bared like a snarling beast, a constant reminder of the oceanâ€™s volatile beauty, a beauty that Aurelia relentlessly sought to capture on canvas.  This was her sanctuary, this desolate stretch of coast near the forgotten fishing village of Port Blossom, a place where the only witnesses to her artistic struggles were the gulls and the relentless waves.
