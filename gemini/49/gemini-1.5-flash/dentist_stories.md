The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she hurried down the snow-packed street of Havenwood, the icy crunch of her boots a counterpoint to the mournful wail of the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees lining the avenue.  Havenwood, nestled deep within the Adirondack Mountains, was a picture postcard town in summer, all charming clapboard houses and vibrant flower boxes. But winter had a different, harsher beauty, transforming the quaint village into a frosted fairytale, cloaked in a blanket of pristine white – a blanket that, Eleanor knew from experience, could easily conceal a hidden peril.  The flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows, turning familiar houses into looming, mysterious shapes. Tonight, even the usually comforting glow of the Havenwood Dental Practice sign felt a little less reassuring.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and the approaching blizzard, held a tension that even the comforting warmth of her thick wool coat couldn't quite dispel.
