The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Jean Hawthorneâ€™s hands, a meager defense against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the pane, blurring the already indistinct view of the perpetually grey Cornish coastline.  Amelia, a woman whose age was as elusive as the precise shade of her auburn hair (somewhere between fiery and cinnamon), sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming of the storm.  Her desk, a chaotic landscape of policy forms, half-eaten biscuits, and a suspiciously stained insurance claims folder, reflected the state of her life: meticulously organized on the surface, yet simmering with a quiet, persistent chaos beneath.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wool and the faint, metallic tang of sea salt, a smell that Amelia, despite years spent in this coastal town of Portwenn, still found both comforting and unsettling.  This was her domain, her little kingdom of risk assessment and actuarial tables, perched precariously on the edge of a cliff both literally and metaphorically.
