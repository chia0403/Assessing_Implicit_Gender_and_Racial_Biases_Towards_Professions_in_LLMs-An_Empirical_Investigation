The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s salon, "Scissors & Curls."  Sera, perched on a worn velvet stool before her latest client – a nervous bride-to-be with a veil clutched like a lifeline – sighed inwardly.  The humid Charleston air, thick and clinging like a second skin, pressed against the tall, arched windows of her salon, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the late afternoon.  Rain, a relentless Charleston downpour, hammered against the aged brick exterior, mirroring the frantic rhythm of the bride's fidgeting hands.  Inside, amidst the clutter of hairspray bottles, curling irons, and the gentle hum of the old-fashioned hairdryer, Sera found herself unexpectedly calm, a practiced serenity that only years spent coaxing beauty from chaos could bestow.
