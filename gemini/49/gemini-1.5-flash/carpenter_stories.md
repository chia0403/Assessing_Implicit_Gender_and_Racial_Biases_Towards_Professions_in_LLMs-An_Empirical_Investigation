The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face, stinging his eyes as he squinted at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and knotted as the ancient oak beams he favoured, stood on the windswept cliff overlooking the tiny, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom.  The village, clinging precariously to the cliff face like barnacles to a ship's hull, was a picture of muted colours – the slate roofs of the cottages blending seamlessly with the grey stone walls, the only splashes of brightness coming from the brightly painted fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbour below.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks provided a constant, almost hypnotic soundtrack to the quiet solitude of the place – a solitude that Elias, despite his solitary nature, found increasingly unsettling.  For the last three days, a storm of a different kind had been brewing in Port Blossom, a storm that had nothing to do with the relentless North Sea.
