The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  It was a sound she usually found soothing, a comforting backdrop to the often turbulent confessions that spilled forth within these walls.  But tonight, the downpour felt oppressive, mirroring the suffocating weight of the case file sitting unopened on her desk. The file, thick with handwritten notes and police reports, bore the name of its subject in stark, black lettering:  Mark Ashton.  The air in her small, cluttered office, usually scented with the faint aroma of lavender and sandalwood essential oils, now held the sharp, metallic tang of fear.  Her worn leather armchair, usually a sanctuary of calm, felt suddenly cold and unforgiving beneath her. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful counterpoint to the quiet, persistent tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner â€“ a clock that, tonight, seemed to be measuring out not just time, but the dwindling seconds before a potential tragedy.  Eleanor Vance, PhD, counseling psychologist,  knew she had to open that file.
