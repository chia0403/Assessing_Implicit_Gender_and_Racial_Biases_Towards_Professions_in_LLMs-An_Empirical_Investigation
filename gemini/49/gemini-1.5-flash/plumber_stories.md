The biting November wind howled a mournful tune through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the derelict Victorian mansion, rattling the ancient, skeletal oak tree that clawed at the crumbling stone façade.  Rain, driven by the gale, lashed against the stained-glass fragments still clinging to the upper stories, a shattered mosaic of faded blues and greens.  Inside, amidst the echoing silence punctuated only by the drip, drip, drip of a leaky roof,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, plumber extraordinaire (or at least, that's what his rusty van proclaimed), wrestled with a recalcitrant pipe.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying wood, and the faint, metallic tang of rust – a perfume only a plumber could truly appreciate, or possibly tolerate.
