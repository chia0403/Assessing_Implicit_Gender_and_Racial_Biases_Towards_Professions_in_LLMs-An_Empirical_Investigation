The chipped paint of the "Sunny Days Child Care" sign flaked onto the overflowing geranium pots lining the porch, a miniature, floral snowdrift.  Inside, twenty-three miniature hurricanes raged in various stages of tantrum, playtime, and quiet contemplation.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a whirlwind of organized chaos herself, navigated the tempest with a calm that bordered on the supernatural.  The air hummed with the high-pitched cacophony of children's voices, the rhythmic thud of tiny feet, and the insistent drone of "Baby Shark" playing on repeat from a battered CD player – a soundtrack to Amelia’s life.  The scent of slightly burnt toast and vaguely fruity hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, a permanent aroma in this brightly-colored, slightly chaotic kingdom.
