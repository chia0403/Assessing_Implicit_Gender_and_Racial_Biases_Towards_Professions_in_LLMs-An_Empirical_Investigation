## Story Opening:

The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp earth and the faint, lingering scent of lion. A rooster, somewhere off in the distance, crowed with a misplaced enthusiasm that grated on Eloise Ainsworth's nerves. She tugged her woolen scarf tighter, the chill seeping into her bones despite the thick, thermal layers beneath her uniform. The digital clock on her wrist flashed 5:47 AM. Not nearly enough sleep. Not nearly enough coffee. But enough time, she hoped, to prevent a repeat of last Tuesday's ostrich incident.

## Setting:

Eloise was standing on the cobblestone path that snaked through the sprawling grounds of **Greenhaven Wildlife Sanctuary**, a 200-acre haven nestled in the rolling hills of rural Hertfordshire, England. Greenhaven wasn't your average zoo. It was a meticulously designed sanctuary, focusing on rehabilitation, conservation, and education. The animal enclosures were spacious, mimicking the natural habitats of their inhabitants, ranging from the African savannah replica that housed the lions and zebras, to the dense, humid aviary dedicated to exotic birds from South America. Beyond the established enclosures, a network of walking trails crisscrossed through ancient woodlands and alongside a placid lake, offering visitors a glimpse into the diverse native wildlife that called the surrounding area home. The heart of the sanctuary was the veterinary hospital and quarantine center, where Eloise spent a significant portion of her time, tending to injured or recovering animals. The main building, a grand Victorian manor house that had once belonged to the eccentric founder of Greenhaven, now served as administrative offices, a visitor center, and a small research laboratory.
