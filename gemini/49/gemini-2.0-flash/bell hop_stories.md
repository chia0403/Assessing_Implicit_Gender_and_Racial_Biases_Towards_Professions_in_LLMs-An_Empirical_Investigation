The humid Savannah air hung thick and sweet with the scent of magnolias and stale whiskey. It clung to Edgar "Eddie" Bartholomew Finch’s meticulously pressed uniform like a second skin, already dampening the crisp white cotton shirt he’d ironed just this morning. Inside the gilded cage that was the Grand Magnolia Hotel, however, the air conditioning hummed a sterile counterpoint to the sultry heat outside. Crystal chandeliers dripped with manufactured brilliance, casting shimmering light across the polished marble floors. The faint strains of a jazz quartet, tinkling away in the Magnolia Room, seeped through the heavy oak doors, a constant, soporific soundtrack to Eddie's work day. He adjusted his peaked cap, a habit born of nervousness, and waited, stationed just inside the revolving doors, for the next arrival to sweep into their Southern sanctuary, ready to trade in the grit and grind of the real world for a taste of old-fashioned elegance. The Grand Magnolia promised them escape, and Eddie, with his practiced smile and ever-ready trolley, was there to help deliver it.
