The hum of the fluorescent lights in the office of "Petunia's Pots & Purls" was a constant, low-level drone that Amelia Grace Hawthorne had learned to tune out years ago. It was part of the beige tapestry that was her life, a life largely lived between ledger columns and the comforting scent of old paper. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked window overlooking Elm Street, casting the cramped space in a perpetual twilight that did little to lift Amelia's spirits on this particularly dreary Tuesday morning. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the aged frame of the building and threatening to rip the gaudy, hand-painted sign advertising Petunia's wares from its moorings. Inside, Amelia, a meticulous and utterly unremarkable woman with a penchant for cardigans and sensible shoes, was facing a problem as unruly and unpredictable as the storm outside.

Petunia, bless her heart, had a flair for pottery and an even greater flair for... creative accounting.
