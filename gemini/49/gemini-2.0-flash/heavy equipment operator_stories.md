**Story Opening:**

The sun was a raw, angry wound in the east as Silas "Silas" McKinley powered up the Cat D11T bulldozer. The rumble that vibrated through his bones was a familiar comfort, a morning symphony only he and the earth truly appreciated. He spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the dusty soil, the brown juice a dark contrast against the pale grey of the dawn.  He knew the day would be a long one, measured in cubic yards of dirt moved and the constant, relentless whine of hydraulic fluid. But for Silas, it was the closest thing he had to peace.

**Setting:**

The setting is a vast, open-pit coal mine in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.  Imagine a landscape scarred and sculpted by massive machinery; a lunar-like expanse of terraced benches, where seams of coal are exposed and ripped from the earth. The air is thick with the grit of coal dust and the ever-present scent of diesel. Gigantic haul trucks, dwarfing even the bulldozers, rumble along designated routes, carrying their precious black cargo.  The horizon is a jagged line of man-made mountains and deep canyons.  The harsh climate swings from blistering heat in the summer to bone-chilling blizzards in the winter.  Life here is hard, unforgiving, and strangely beautiful in its brutal efficiency.
