The late afternoon sun, still boasting a surprising ferocity even in early October, slanted across the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Estate. Arthur Penhaligon, his back aching with the familiar ache of a day spent coaxing the stubborn flora into submission, paused in his raking. He leaned on the worn wooden handle, sweat beading on his brow, and surveyed his domain. Blackwood Estate, a sprawling gothic monstrosity of grey stone and gargoyles, was his responsibility, his burden, and, undeniably, his pride. The ancient house perched atop a hill overlooking the town of Harrow's End, its shadow a constant reminder of the Blackwood family's long and often whispered history. Today, the whispers seemed louder, clinging to the air like the scent of damp earth and dying leaves. Arthur, though a man of the earth, felt a prickle of unease. Something about the stillness, the unnatural quiet that had settled over the normally bustling estate, was unsettling. He straightened, adjusted his worn tweed cap, and resolved to finish raking the last of the maple leaves before nightfall, even if it meant facing the gathering gloom that clung to the dark corners of Blackwood Estate.
