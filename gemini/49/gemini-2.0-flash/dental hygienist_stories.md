The antiseptic tang of fluoride and the faint whir of the ultrasonic scaler were the twin scents that always ushered Eliza Mae Thornton into her workday. The aroma of freshly brewed hazelnut coffee, a personal indulgence against the day's onslaught of plaque and polish, did little to mask them. Eliza stood in the crisp, white-walled operatory of "Smiles of the Emerald Coast," a small, family-run dental practice nestled just a few blocks from the blindingly white sand of Destin, Florida. Sunlight, filtered through the gauzy blinds, dappled the pristine dental chair. The walls were adorned with cheerful, albeit generic, prints of smiling children brushing their teeth, their pearly whites gleaming like beacons. Outside, the promise of another gloriously sunny day in paradise beckoned, a stark contrast to the intimate, often challenging, reality of poking around in strangers' mouths. Eliza sighed, the salty air carrying the faintest hint of sunscreen mixing with the dental smells, and mentally reviewed her schedule. Mrs. Henderson was first, a sweet woman with surprisingly poor oral hygiene habits considering her devotion to organic kale. Eliza straightened, adjusted her mask, and prepared to face the day, one meticulous cleaning at a time.
