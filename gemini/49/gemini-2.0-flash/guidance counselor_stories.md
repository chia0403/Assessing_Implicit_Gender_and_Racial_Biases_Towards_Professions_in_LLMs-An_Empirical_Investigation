Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a guidance counselor named Eleanor Grace Albright:

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the fluorescent lights in Eleanor Grace Albright’s office was a persistent drone, a soundtrack to her daily routine. At 7:45 AM, the air still held the faint scent of industrial cleaner and last night's stale vending machine coffee. Outside her window, the first tendrils of sunrise were tentatively licking at the brick facade of Northwood High, painting the frosted-over athletic fields in a weak, watery pink. Eleanor, however, barely registered the dawn. She was too busy staring at the photograph clutched in her hand, a picture of a vibrant, smiling girl with eyes as bright as the summer sky.

That girl, Maya Rodriguez, had missed her appointment yesterday. And the day before. Three days of Maya, usually a punctual and enthusiastic participant in Eleanor’s college prep program, ghosting her. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine, a feeling she recognized, a premonition that sat heavy in her gut like a poorly digested donut. Missing appointments was one thing, but Maya hadn’t even called. Eleanor knew, deep down, that something was very, very wrong.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Northwood High School**, a large, somewhat dilapidated public school in the fictional blue-collar town of **Crestwood, Ohio**. Crestwood is a town clinging to the remnants of its industrial past, with a mix of modest suburban developments and older, more run-down neighborhoods. The school reflects this economic reality; it's underfunded, overcrowded, and riddled with the quiet anxieties of a community struggling to stay afloat. Northwood High has seen better days, and the weight of that history is palpable in the chipped paint of the lockers and the worn treads on the staircases.

Eleanor's office, tucked away on the second floor near the library, is a small, window-lined space attempting to be a haven of calm amidst the chaos. A plush, slightly threadbare armchair sits opposite her desk, offering a comfortable (if slightly stained) refuge for students sharing their worries. Bookshelves overflow with college brochures, pamphlets on mental health, and well-worn copies of classic literature. Motivational posters, carefully selected and strategically placed, adorn the walls, offering platitudes about perseverance and reaching for the stars. The overall effect is a well-intentioned, but slightly desperate, attempt to inject hope into a space often filled with teenage angst and quiet desperation.
