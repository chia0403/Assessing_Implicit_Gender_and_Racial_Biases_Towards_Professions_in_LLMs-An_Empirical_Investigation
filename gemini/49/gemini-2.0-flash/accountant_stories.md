## Story Opening:

The stale air hung thick with the scent of instant coffee and the faint, metallic tang of toner. It was a smell Beatrice Eleanor Finch had come to associate with Tuesdays. And Tuesdays, in the accounting department of Global Dynamics Corp, meant reconciling last week's travel expenses. A task she regarded with the same enthusiasm one might reserve for a root canal.

Beatrice sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the fluorescent lights that relentlessly buzzed overhead. She meticulously aligned her stack of receipts - a colorful, chaotic jumble of taxi fares, lukewarm coffees, and suspiciously lavish dinners - against the edge of her blotter. Her lips, a thin, pale line, moved silently as she keyed in numbers on her adding machine, the rhythmic click-clack a monotonous counterpoint to the inner turmoil churning within her.

This wasn't what she had envisioned for herself.

## Setting:

**Office:** The scene takes place in a cramped, windowless cubicle on the third floor of Global Dynamics Corp's headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh. The cubicle walls, a depressing shade of beige, are adorned with a slightly faded motivational poster featuring a stock photo of a soaring eagle and the caption: "Reach for the Sky!" Beatrice's desk is meticulously organized, save for the ever-growing mountain of receipts threatening to spill over the edge. A half-eaten apple sits forlornly in a plastic container next to a framed photo of her tabby cat, Winston, perched regally on a velvet cushion. The air is perpetually recirculated, and the only natural light comes indirectly from the hallway outside, filtered through the grimy glass of the office doors. The overall impression is one of quiet desperation, a place where dreams go to slowly wither and die.
