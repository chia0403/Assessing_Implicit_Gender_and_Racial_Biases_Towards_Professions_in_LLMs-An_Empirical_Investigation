The scent of stargazer lilies hung heavy in the air, a sweet, almost cloying aroma that clung to everything in "Petals & Prose," including its owner, Evelyn Mae Kensington. She pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, leaving a smudge of pollen on her cheek. Outside, a relentless downpour lashed against the shop's large, Victorian-paned windows, blurring the already muted colors of the cobblestone street.

Petals & Prose wasn't just a flower shop; it was Evelyn's sanctuary, a haven carved out of the bustling heart of Port Blossom, a quaint seaside town perched on the rugged Oregon coast. The walls were painted a soft robin's egg blue, adorned with framed botanical prints and antique mirrors that reflected the riot of color spilling from every corner. Wicker baskets overflowed with hydrangeas and roses, while delicate orchids perched on tiered stands. Old books, their spines cracked and faded, lined the back wall, a testament to Evelyn's other great love. This was where she felt most at peace, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the comforting weight of words. But today, even the fragrant tranquility couldn't quite dispel the unease that simmered beneath the surface, a disquiet that had been brewing ever since the peculiar postcard arrived, addressed in elegant, unfamiliar script.
