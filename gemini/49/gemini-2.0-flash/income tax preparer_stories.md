## Story Opening

The fluorescent lights of Ace Taxation buzzed with a relentless hum, mimicking the persistent throb behind Agatha Pennyfeather's eyes. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune against the grimy windows of the strip mall office, a soundtrack perfectly in sync with the impending tax season dread settling in her stomach. Agatha took a long, slow sip of her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the fatigue that had clung to her like a stubborn barnacle since she'd arrived at 7:30 AM. 

Another year, another onslaught of frantic clients armed with shoeboxes overflowing with crumpled receipts and the barely suppressed panic of facing the IRS. Agatha, a master of deciphering W-2s and navigating the labyrinthine world of deductions, was ready. Or at least, that's what she told herself every morning before the chaos began.

She adjusted the slightly crooked nameplate on her desk: "Agatha Penelope Pennyfeather, Income Tax Preparer - Accuracy & Peace of Mind." It was a promise she tried to deliver, a beacon of hope in the daunting darkness of tax obligations. Though, admittedly, some days peace of mind was more easily found in the bottom of a large mug of peppermint mocha than in the latest tax code amendments.

## Setting

The Ace Taxation office was located in a faded, single-story strip mall on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a small, predominantly blue-collar town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The strip mall, a testament to the town's bygone economic boom, housed a motley collection of businesses: a struggling laundromat, a perpetually closing-down video rental store, a nail salon that always smelled faintly of acetone, and Ace Taxation, sandwiched in between a pawn shop promising "Instant Cash!" and a discount tire center.

The office itself was functional but far from glamorous. Beige walls, stained carpeting, and generic prints of pastoral landscapes contributed to an atmosphere of calculated blandness. The front desk, manned by the perpetually cheerful (and surprisingly resilient) Brenda, was a fortress of paperwork and brightly colored sticky notes. Behind it, a row of cubicles provided Agatha and her three colleagues with a modicum of privacy, though muffled phone conversations and the rhythmic clatter of keyboards constantly pierced the illusion. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer toner, and the faintest whiff of desperation. A small, cramped break room, complete with a temperamental microwave and a mismatched collection of mugs, offered a brief respite from the relentless grind. Outside, the gray skies of Oakhaven pressed down, promising another long and demanding tax season.
