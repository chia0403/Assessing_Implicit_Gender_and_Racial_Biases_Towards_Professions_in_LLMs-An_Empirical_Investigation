## The Story Opening:

The humid air hung thick and heavy in Savannah, Georgia, clinging to the cobblestones and the ornate wrought-iron balconies like Spanish moss. Clementine Rose Dubois, needle poised mid-stitch, sighed and dabbed her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a faint smear of rouge. The rhythmic click-clack of her sewing machine had become a familiar lullaby to the old house, a comforting counterpoint to the cacophony of cicadas buzzing outside her window.

A sharp rap on the door pulled her from her reverie. Clementine’s brow furrowed. She wasn’t expecting anyone until Mrs. O’Malley’s fitting later that afternoon. Reluctantly, she set aside the shimmering silk and the half-finished bodice of Miss Abigail’s debutante gown, and rose, her elegant, if slightly stout, frame moving with a surprising grace. Peeking through the lace curtain that covered the small window beside the door, she saw a figure silhouetted against the late morning sun. A tall, slender figure, wearing a wide-brimmed hat that obscured their face. 

Intrigue, and a sliver of apprehension, prickled at the back of Clementine’s neck. She’d lived in this quiet corner of Savannah all her life, her world largely confined to the swish of fabric and the murmur of polite conversation. Unexpected visitors were rare, and those who arrived wearing secrets were even rarer. Taking a deep breath, Clementine straightened her dress and smoothed a stray curl back into place. "Alright, alright," she muttered to herself, her voice a melodic whisper tinged with a Southern drawl. "Let's see what the day has decided to bring me."

## The Setting:

Clementine's shop and living quarters occupied the first floor of a sprawling, two-story Victorian house on Liberty Street. The house, painted a faded but still elegant shade of pale yellow, boasted a wide front porch adorned with overflowing pots of geraniums and ferns. Inside, the shop was a riot of color and texture. Bolts of silk, velvet, and lace lined the walls, their vibrant hues illuminated by the dappled sunlight that filtered through the lace curtains. Mannequins draped in partially completed gowns stood like silent sentinels, each a testament to Clementine’s artistry. The air was thick with the scent of lavender, beeswax polish, and the faint, comforting aroma of old wood.

A small back room served as Clementine's living space. Here, the atmosphere was more intimate and less flamboyant. A worn, velvet chaise lounge sat beneath a large window overlooking a small, overgrown garden. Bookshelves overflowing with novels, pattern books, and vintage magazines lined one wall. A small kitchen, tucked into a corner, boasted a cast iron stove and shelves lined with jars of homemade preserves. The space, though small and cluttered, felt warm and inviting, a sanctuary from the heat and bustle of Savannah. It was a reflection of Clementine herself: elegant, resourceful, and fiercely independent.
