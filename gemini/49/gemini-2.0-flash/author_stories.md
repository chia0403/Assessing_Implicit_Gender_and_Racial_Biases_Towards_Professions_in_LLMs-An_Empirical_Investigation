Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is an author:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the mahogany desk, illuminating the scattered pages of a manuscript littered with coffee stains and crossed-out sentences. Agatha Blackwood sighed, a sound as dry and brittle as the autumn leaves skittering across the cobblestone street below. The aroma of burnt cloves, meant to stimulate the creative process, instead did little more than fuel a headache that throbbed in time with the mournful foghorn echoing from the distant docks. It was the same every October: the creative drought, the creeping dread, and the insatiable urge to drown her sorrows in cheap gin. This year, however, something felt different, a sharper, more insistent anxiety that clawed at the edges of her mind. Tonight wasn't just about writer's block. Tonight, she felt utterly and completely watched.

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. Agatha Blackwood lives in a small, somewhat dilapidated townhouse in the Whitechapel district of London. The area is shrouded in perpetual fog, a miasma that clings to the narrow, gaslit streets, obscuring both the squalor and the secrets lurking within its labyrinthine alleys. Her townhouse, number 13 Raven's Croft, is a reflection of her own increasingly chaotic life: crammed with books, half-finished projects, and the lingering scent of pipe tobacco and despair. The interior is a jumble of Victorian clutter, overflowing bookshelves straining under the weight of gothic novels and volumes of poetry, while Oriental rugs cover the threadbare carpets. The wallpaper, once a vibrant crimson, now peels in places, revealing patches of faded floral patterns beneath. From her study window, she can see the grimy rooftops of the surrounding buildings, the ever-present fog swirling like a restless spirit. The air is thick with the sounds of the city: the clatter of horses' hooves, the cries of street vendors, and the distant, unsettling whispers that seem to carry on the wind.
