## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frying onions, woodsmoke, and the salty tang of the Adriatic Sea. The setting sun cast long, orange fingers across the narrow, cobbled streets of Rovinj, Croatia, painting the ancient stone buildings in hues of fire. In a tiny, unassuming trattoria nestled halfway up the steep incline towards St. Euphemia Church, the clatter of pans and the murmur of voices mingled with the distant calls of seagulls. This was "Konoba More," a family-run establishment beloved by locals and the occasional adventurous tourist brave enough to navigate the winding alleyways.

**Story Opening:**

"Bloody mussels again, Nonna?" shouted Antonio Rossi, his voice barely audible above the sizzling garlic in the pan. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his flour-dusted hand. The aroma of tomato sauce and oregano clung to him like a second skin. *Antonio Lorenzo Rossi*, he thought, a small sigh escaping his lips. Twenty-eight years old and still flipping *frutti di mare* for his grandmother's whims. He loved her, he truly did, but sometimes he dreamed of escaping the cramped confines of Konoba More and creating something, *anything*, that wasn't dictated by tradition.
