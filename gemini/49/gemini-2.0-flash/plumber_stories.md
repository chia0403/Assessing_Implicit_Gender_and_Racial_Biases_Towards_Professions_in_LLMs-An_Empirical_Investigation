## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid air hung heavy in the narrow, cluttered basement of the St. Jude's Catholic Church, a building that had seen better days â€“ and better congregations. Cobwebs draped like macabre Christmas decorations from the low-hanging pipes, and the only light came from a bare bulb that flickered ominously overhead. The scent of damp concrete and something vaguely resembling old incense clung to everything.

**Story Opening:**

The wrench slipped in **Angelo "Angie" Bellini's** sweaty palm, sending a sharp clang echoing through the cavernous basement. "Mamma mia," he muttered, wiping his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime on his forehead. He could practically hear his Nonna shaking her head in disappointment, tut-tutting about him using the Lord's name in vain, especially in a church basement. But honestly, even Nonna would be losing her patience with this rusted-out, Frankensteinian plumbing system. He'd been wrestling with this particular drain for the better part of an hour, and it was winning. He kicked a loose piece of concrete across the floor, the sound bouncing off the damp walls. Just another Thursday for Angie Bellini, plumber to the downtrodden and unfortunate, and apparently, also to God.
