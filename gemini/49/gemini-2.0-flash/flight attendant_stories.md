The fluorescent lights of Gate 42B hummed a monotonous tune, a dull counterpoint to the nervous flutter in Amelia Beatrice Bellweather's stomach. Amelia, a flight attendant for Skybound Airlines for the past seven years, smoothed down the crisp navy skirt of her uniform, her fingers tracing the gold wings pinned just below the collar. The familiar ritual usually calmed her, a grounding force before the storm of passengers boarded. But today, the ritual felt hollow.

She stood in the narrow jet bridge, a sterile tube connecting the humming terminal to the gleaming fuselage of the Boeing 737-800, Flight 217 to Denver. Outside, the Kansas sky was a bruised violet, threatening rain, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia. She’d been on this route countless times – Kansas City to Denver, a quick hop, a milk run. Nothing ever happened. Until now.

Today, she had a feeling, a prickling unease that had settled deep in her bones since she'd woken that morning. An email from her Aunt Mildred, filled with cryptic warnings about "listening to your intuition," hadn't helped matters. Amelia scoffed internally. Aunt Mildred and her hunches. Still, the feeling persisted, a tiny seed of dread planted in the fertile ground of her already anxious nature.

She took a deep breath, forcing a smile as Captain Reynolds, a man whose wrinkles told tales of countless landings and turbulent skies, gave her a brisk nod. "Ready, Amelia?" he asked, his voice booming over the bridge.

"Ready as I'll ever be, Captain," she replied, the lie surprisingly convincing, even to herself.
