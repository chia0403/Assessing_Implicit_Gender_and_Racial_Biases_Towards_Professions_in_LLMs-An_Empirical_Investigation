Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character working in emergency medical care:

**Setting:** The cramped, brightly lit interior of an ambulance, somewhere on the outskirts of Denver, Colorado. The vehicle vibrates relentlessly as it tears down a potholed county road, the siren a mournful wail cutting through the vast, star-dusted night. Outside, the silhouette of the Rocky Mountains looms, a constant, imposing presence. The air is dry and carries the faint scent of sagebrush.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor was the only consistent sound apart from the ambulance's overworked engine.  Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Reed, her brow furrowed in concentration, pressed the stethoscope more firmly against the chest of the man lying strapped to the gurney.  He was barely conscious, his face pale and slick with sweat.  

"BP's dropping, Jones," she said, her voice calm and steady despite the rising knot of anxiety in her stomach.  "Let's get another line in. And tell dispatch we're still ten minutes out, ETA revised down. I need a trauma surgeon on standby, stat. This is a code three."

The young paramedic, barely out of his training, fumbled with the IV kit. Evie sighed inwardly, but kept her voice even. "Take a breath, Jones. You've got this. Upper arm, above the elbow. Firm pressure when you occlude."

The air inside the ambulance reeked of antiseptic and fear.  Evie’s gloves squeaked as she ran a hand through her short, practical haircut, a strand of dark hair escaping and falling across her weary face. She hated these rural calls.  Long drives, minimal resources, and too often, situations that could have been avoided if people weren't so isolated. This one had been a farm accident—a combine harvester and a very unlucky farmer. Every second mattered now, and the vast, silent landscape offered no comfort, only the daunting reminder of how far they were from help.
