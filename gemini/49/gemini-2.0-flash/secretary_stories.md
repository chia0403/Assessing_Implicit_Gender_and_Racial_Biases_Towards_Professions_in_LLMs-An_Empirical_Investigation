## Story Opening:

The rhythmic clatter of Margaret Elaine Hemmings’ mechanical typewriter was the only sound cutting through the late afternoon gloom. It was a sound she found both maddening and comforting, a constant companion in the silent symphony of bureaucracy. Rain lashed against the tall, grimy windows of the Fitzwilliam & Sons Law Offices, blurring the already indistinct skyline of post-war London.

Margaret, her back aching from hours hunched over faded documents, paused, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She glanced at the clock on the wall: 5:47 PM. Another thirteen minutes until she could escape the suffocating confines of Room 3B, with its peeling wallpaper depicting an unconvincing landscape of rolling hills and perpetually grazing sheep.

Fitzwilliam & Sons, specializing in wills, estates, and the occasional messy divorce, wasn’t exactly glamorous. But in 1948 London, a steady job was a blessing, and Margaret was nothing if not grateful. Still, sometimes, staring at the endless stream of probate forms and property deeds, she couldn't help but dream of something more, something beyond the relentless click-clack of her typewriter and the lingering scent of stale pipe tobacco that clung to Mr. Abernathy's threadbare tweed suit. Tonight, though, she was dreaming only of a hot bath and a pot of Earl Grey, before facing the rationing queues and the endless blackout that swallowed the city each night.
