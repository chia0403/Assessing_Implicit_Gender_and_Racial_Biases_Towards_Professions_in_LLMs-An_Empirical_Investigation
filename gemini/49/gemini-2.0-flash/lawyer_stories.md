## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The dimly lit, oak-paneled back room of "The Gavel & Goblet," a lawyers-only pub nestled in the labyrinthine streets of Boston's legal district. The air hangs thick with the mingled scents of aged whiskey, pipe tobacco, and the unspoken anxieties of high-stakes litigation. Outside, a biting November wind howls a mournful tune through the narrow alleyway, rattling the frosted glass of the pub's windows. Inside, the only illumination comes from a flickering gas lamp perched precariously on a scarred table, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to mimic the jittery energy of its occupants.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Vance, Esquire, swirled the amber liquid in her glass, the ice clinking a mournful rhythm against the crystal. "Double bourbon, neat," she'd barked at Danny the bartender, knowing he understood the unwritten code: a plea for temporary oblivion. The Gavel & Goblet was her usual refuge after a particularly brutal day, and today's courtroom battle had been more brutal than most. The image of Mrs. Henderson, her client, face crumpling as the judge declared the will invalid, was etched behind Eleanor's eyelids, a permanent, painful reminder of her failure. Sheâ€™d argued until her throat was raw, citing precedent after precedent, but Judge Mallory, that pompous relic of the old guard, had remained unmoved. "Sentimentality over legality, Ms. Vance," he'd sneered, "is a dangerous path for a lawyer to tread." He was right, of course. But try telling that to Mrs. Henderson, a woman who'd lost not just her inheritance, but her faith in the system. Eleanor took a long, slow sip, letting the burn of the whiskey chase away the chill that had settled deep in her bones. She needed to forget, even just for a moment, the crushing weight of injustice. Tonight, in this dimly lit sanctuary of lawyers, she was just Eleanor, not Eleanor Vance, Esquire, champion of the wronged and defender of the downtrodden. Tonight, she was just a woman, nursing a bourbon and wrestling with the gnawing feeling that maybe, just maybe, she was on the wrong side of the law. And maybe, tonight, the law itself was wrong.
