The biting November wind whipped across the desolate parking lot of Northwood High, tugging at Ms. Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne's worn wool scarf. She hunched deeper into her faded green parka, its pockets overflowing with ungraded essays and crumpled granola bar wrappers, a familiar shield against the encroaching chill and the lingering ghosts of her own high school experience. The sodium lamps cast a jaundiced glow on the rows of parked cars, each a metal testament to varying levels of suburban success (or lack thereof).

Northwood High, a sprawling brick monstrosity built in the 1970s, stood silhouetted against the darkening sky. Its Brutalist architecture, meant to inspire awe and strength, now just felt oppressive and outdated. The windows, glazed over with years of grime and the existential dread of countless teenagers, reflected back Eleanor’s own weary face. It was Friday night, and the building was mostly deserted, save for the janitorial staff and the occasional athlete practicing late. Eleanor, however, was still here, meticulously planning her next week’s lesson on "The Scarlet Letter." Ironically, a book about societal judgment was her only solace in a town that seemed to judge her every move. Tonight, the loneliness of Northwood High felt particularly profound, mirroring the silent hum of disapproval she often felt emanating from the manicured lawns and cookie-cutter houses that surrounded it.
