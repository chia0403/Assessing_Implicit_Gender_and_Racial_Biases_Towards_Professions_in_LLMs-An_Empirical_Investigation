## Story Opening:

The biting wind, sharp as shards of glass, tore across the unfinished skyscraper skeleton. Michael Anthony "Mickey" Russo braced against it, his calloused hands gripping the cold steel beam. Above him, the November sky was a bruised purple, threatening snow. He squinted, trying to make out the blurry orange glow of the city spreading below, a million tiny, warm lives unaware of the precarious dance happening hundreds of feet above them. He’d seen that glow every day for the past six months, watching this steel and concrete giant claw its way towards the clouds. And every day, a sliver of him felt a strange, almost unsettling pride.

This wasn't just another job. This was something… bigger. Something that would stand long after he was gone, a testament to sweat, grit, and the collective will of men like him. He reached into his patched Carhartt jacket, pulling out a thermos. The coffee was lukewarm, but it was enough to momentarily thaw the chill that had sunk deep into his bones. He took a long swig, the metallic tang of the thermos a familiar comfort. Today was Friday. Today was almost over. And today, that familiar unease, that nagging feeling that something was just… *off*, was clinging to him tighter than the wind.

## Setting:

**The Building:** The "Nova Tower," a 70-story skyscraper under construction in downtown Chicago. Only the steel skeleton and concrete base are complete, with much of the exterior yet to be added. The highest levels are exposed to the elements, offering breathtaking but dangerous views of the city and Lake Michigan.

**Time:** Late November, a few weeks before Thanksgiving. The days are short, the weather is unpredictable, and the wind is relentless.

**Specific Location:** Michael is currently on the 57th floor, securing steel beams in preparation for the next concrete pour. He’s one of a small team working late to meet a tight deadline. The air is filled with the clang of metal, the hum of generators, and the shouted instructions of the foreman.

**Atmosphere:** Harsh, cold, and gritty. The constant wind and height create a sense of isolation and vulnerability. Despite the danger, there's a camaraderie amongst the workers, a silent understanding forged in the face of shared risk. But today, the atmosphere feels heavier, tinged with a subtle undercurrent of apprehension.
