Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the main character being a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The story opens on a blustery, late October afternoon in Asheville, North Carolina. The Blue Ridge Mountains are cloaked in a haze of crimson and gold, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the grey, rain-threatening sky. Leaves, brittle and dry, skitter across the cobblestone sidewalk of Lexington Avenue, dodging the feet of tourists and locals alike. Inside "The Mindful Path Counseling Center," a converted Victorian house, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Soft jazz drifts from hidden speakers, and the scent of chamomile tea hangs in the air. Comfortable armchairs are arranged in a circle around a thick, patterned rug in the group therapy room.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth sighed, running a hand through her already unruly auburn hair. She glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ 3:57 PM.  Three more minutes until the weekly Grief & Loss support group began. Outside, the wind howled like a mournful spirit, and Ellie couldn't help but wonder how many of her clients would be no-shows, succumbing to the dreary weather and the weight of their own sorrow. She straightened the stack of tissues on the small table, a ritual she performed every Tuesday, then smoothed the wrinkles from her emerald green cardigan.  It was her "comfort" sweater, and she suspected she needed it as much as her clients did this afternoon. The truth was, some days, listening to the stories of profound loss felt like wading through treacle, each word pulling her further down. And today, with the oppressive sky mirroring her own slightly melancholic mood, felt like one of those days.
