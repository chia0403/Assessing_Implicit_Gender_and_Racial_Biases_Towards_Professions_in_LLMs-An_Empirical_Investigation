**Opening:**

The air hung thick and humid, smelling faintly of overripe mangoes and the antiseptic she used a little too liberally. Dr. Amelia Rodriguez, D.C., sighed, her fingers tracing the worn leather of her adjusting table. Outside, the rhythmic chirp of cicadas provided a constant, almost maddening soundtrack to the quiet desperation of her waiting room. The day was dragging, and the familiar ache in her lower back – a chiropractor's occupational hazard, she often joked – throbbed in sympathy with the oppressive heat. Her schedule had been light all week, a disconcerting lull before, she suspected, the storm of summer tourists descended upon the small coastal town. Amelia just hoped she could make rent until then.

**Setting:**

Amelia's practice, "Coastal Care Chiropractic," was nestled in the heart of Isla Paradiso, a sleepy town clinging to the edge of the turquoise Caribbean Sea. The building itself was a pastel-blue stucco bungalow, a relic from the town's heyday as a sugar cane plantation. A sprawling bougainvillea vine, riotously blooming in shades of fuchsia and crimson, cascaded over the porch, providing shade from the relentless sun. Inside, the decor was a blend of practicality and island charm: sturdy wooden furniture, a vintage anatomical chart hanging slightly askew on the wall, and colourful hand-woven rugs scattered across the cool tile floor. The waiting room was small, furnished with mismatched chairs and a worn coffee table piled high with outdated magazines and local pamphlets advertising deep sea fishing tours and rum distillery visits. The adjusting room, however, was her sanctuary – clean, bright, and equipped with the tools of her trade: her well-worn table, a selection of supportive pillows, and a variety of aromatherapy oils intended to soothe both body and mind. Through the window, Amelia could glimpse the shimmering expanse of the ocean, a constant reminder of the beauty and tranquility that surrounded her, a stark contrast to the tensions she felt building within.
