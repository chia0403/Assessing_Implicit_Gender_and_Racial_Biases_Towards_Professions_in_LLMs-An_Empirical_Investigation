The wind howled like a banshee possessed, whipping around the corrugated iron hangar and rattling the windows. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aviation fuel and grease, a comforting perfume to Amelia "Amy" Isabella Hayes. Rain lashed against the roof, a drumming rhythm that almost drowned out the static crackling from the radio on the workbench. Amy, a figure swallowed by her heavy shearling jacket, leaned closer to the device, a frown creasing her brow.

Outside, the Northern Lights danced across the inky sky, a shimmering, ethereal curtain drawn across the vast Alaskan landscape. They were beautiful, mesmerizing even, but utterly useless to her right now. Amy needed a break in the storm, a window long enough to get her plane, a battered but beloved de Havilland Beaver, airborne.

The setting was a remote, isolated airbase called "Whispering Pines," nestled in the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. It was little more than a collection of ramshackle buildings clustered around a single, rough-hewn runway. The population consisted of a handful of grizzled mechanics, a surly cook named Olga, and, of course, Amy. Whispering Pines wasn't exactly a thriving metropolis, but it was home, and it was where Amy's life, as much as it was connected to the ground at all, existed. She flew supplies, mail, and the occasional adventurous tourist to the even more remote settlements scattered throughout the peninsula. Tonight, though, she was waiting on something far more important, a mission she had been dreading since the moment it landed on her desk.
