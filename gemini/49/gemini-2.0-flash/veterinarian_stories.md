The antiseptic smell of the clinic always hit Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth like a wall. Even after ten years of scrubbing in and out, the mingled odors of surgical cleaner, animal fur, and subtle fecal matter still made her nose wrinkle. This morning, though, the familiar olfactory assault was compounded by the acrid tang of burnt coffee, a disaster courtesy of her perpetually sleep-deprived assistant, David.

The setting was the Ainsworth Animal Clinic, a modestly sized, single-story building situated on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, and your grandmother had probably known your dog's grandmother. The clinic itself, though small, was a testament to Eleanor’s hard work. Sunshine streamed through the large front windows, illuminating the pastel-colored walls adorned with framed photos of local pets, each one a fuzzy, feathered, or scaled testament to Eleanor’s dedication. The reception area boasted a well-worn, floral-patterned sofa, perpetually occupied by a mix of anxious owners and bored children. Behind the counter, David, a lanky young man with perpetually messy brown hair and a nervous habit of clicking his pen, was currently on the phone, his face contorted in a grimace.

Eleanor sighed, tightening the belt on her worn denim jacket. She was already running behind schedule, thanks to Mrs. Gable's Pomeranian, Princess Fluffybutt the Third (another Havenwood legacy), who had decided that 3 AM was the perfect time to ingest a particularly sparkly Christmas ornament. It was shaping up to be just another Tuesday in Havenwood, Oregon, a town where the dramas might be small, but the animals were always capable of throwing you for a loop.
