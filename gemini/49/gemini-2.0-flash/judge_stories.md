## Story Opening:

The gavel echoed, sharp and final, through the cavernous courtroom, a sound Judge Eleanor Ainsworth found increasingly hollow. She barely registered the rustle of the defense attorney gathering papers, the defeated slump of the defendant’s shoulders. Her eyes, framed by sensible silver spectacles, remained fixed on the faded tapestry hanging behind the witness stand, a depiction of Lady Justice herself. The irony wasn’t lost on her; blindfolded, impartial, and holding balanced scales. Eleanor often felt she was neither.

She cleared her throat, the silence amplifying the small sound. “Court is adjourned.”

And with that, the weight of another case, another fractured life, settled on her shoulders like a leaden cloak.

## Setting:

The setting is the **Superior Court of Polk County, Iowa**, specifically Courtroom Two, its interior a study in austere practicality. The room, built in the early 1900s, boasts high ceilings and imposing oak paneling, darkened with age and varnished to a near-black sheen. Two rows of stiff, uncomfortable benches face the judge's elevated bench, separated by a well-worn stretch of carpet. Natural light struggles to penetrate the grime-coated, arched windows that line one wall, leaving the room perpetually shadowed, the air thick with the scent of dust and legal precedent. The only modern touches are the discreet microphones placed on each table and the humming of the air conditioning struggling to combat the Iowa summer heat. Outside, the cornfields stretch as far as the eye can see, a constant reminder of the heartland values that underpin the legal proceedings within.
