## Opening:

The stench of stale beer and burnt popcorn clung to the air like a persistent stagehand. Alistair Finch, theatrical director extraordinaire, stood center stage of the decaying Majestic Theatre, his silk scarf askew and his brow furrowed with the intensity usually reserved for opening night. He coughed, a dry, rattling sound that echoed unpleasantly in the vast, empty auditorium. Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight piercing through a hole in the roof, illuminating the rows upon rows of ripped velvet seats, a silent, accusing audience. He ran a hand through his already disheveled silver hair, leaving behind a small cloud of dust.

"Right then," he muttered to himself, his voice barely a whisper, "let's see if we can conjure a miracle from thisâ€¦ well, this archaeological dig."

## Setting:

The Majestic Theatre in the heart of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, had once been a jewel. Built in the roaring twenties, it had hosted vaudeville acts, silent films, and touring Broadway productions. Now, decades of neglect had transformed it into a dilapidated relic. The ornate plasterwork on the ceiling was crumbling, revealing patches of damp and mold. The once-grand chandelier hung precariously from a single, frayed cable, its crystals dulled with age.

Oakhaven itself was a small, quiet town, slowly being swallowed by the creeping suburban sprawl of a nearby city. The Majestic was a symbol of the town's faded glory, a reminder of a time when Oakhaven was a vibrant, independent community. Now, most of its residents preferred the multiplex cinemas in the neighboring town, leaving the Majestic to rot in quiet desperation. Alistair had inherited the theatre from his eccentric aunt Mildred, a former burlesque dancer with a penchant for dramatic entrances and even more dramatic exits from life. He had come to Oakhaven, leaving behind a somewhat successful career directing experimental theatre in New York City, with the impossible dream of breathing life back into the old theatre and, perhaps, into the town itself.
