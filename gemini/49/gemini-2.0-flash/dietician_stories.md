## Story Opening:

The aroma of roasted garlic and rosemary usually soothed Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth, but tonight, it only amplified the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. She nervously adjusted the single strand of pearls adorning her navy blue dress, the cool smoothness a small comfort against her clammy skin. Tonight wasn't just any dinner; it was her parents' anniversary, a monumental 50 years that deserved celebration, joy, and…well, palatable food.

Eleanor glanced around the dining room of "The Gilded Spoon," a restaurant her mother had insisted upon for its "old-world charm" and "refined ambiance." Eleanor saw only dust motes dancing in the dim light filtering through heavy velvet curtains, and tables draped in tablecloths so starched they crackled with every movement. It was the kind of place where the waiters wore white gloves and judged you silently for even considering adding salt to your meal, a place far removed from her usual world of nutrient-dense smoothies and whole-grain goodness.

She loved her parents dearly, of course. But their culinary tastes were…archaic. They still believed butter was a food group, vegetables were a suggestion, and anything that wasn't fried or smothered in cream sauce was considered "rabbit food." And knowing her mother, Beatrice, she would spend the entire evening probing Eleanor about her own "sadly single" status, all while simultaneously lamenting Eleanor's "obsession" with kale and quinoa.

Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to center herself. She was a professional. She had helped countless patients navigate the treacherous waters of dietary restrictions, emotional eating, and the baffling world of nutritional misinformation. Surely, she could survive one evening of polite conversation, questionable appetizers, and passive-aggressive familial barbs.

But as she watched her father, George, proudly order the "Escargots Bourguignon" with a wink, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that this particular anniversary dinner might just be her most challenging case yet.

## Setting:

**Location:** The Gilded Spoon, a stuffy, old-fashioned restaurant in the upscale, historic district of Boston, Massachusetts. The restaurant attempts to evoke an atmosphere of old-world elegance, with heavy drapes, ornate chandeliers, and formally dressed staff. The color palette is primarily dark reds, golds, and creams, giving the space a somewhat claustrophobic and dated feel.

**Time:** Saturday evening, October 14th, 7:30 PM. The air outside is crisp with the scent of fallen leaves, but inside, the temperature is stifling and the air thick with the scent of rich food and heavy perfume.

**Atmosphere:** Tense and slightly suffocating for Eleanor. The air buzzes with the hushed whispers of other diners and the clinking of silverware, creating a formal and somewhat intimidating environment. It's a stark contrast to Eleanor's more relaxed and health-conscious lifestyle, adding to her feelings of discomfort and apprehension.
