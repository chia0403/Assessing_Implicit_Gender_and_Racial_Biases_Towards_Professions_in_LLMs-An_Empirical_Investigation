The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to the endless parade of lottery tickets, milk cartons, and frozen dinners shuffling across Eleanor Mae Thompson's checkout scanner. It was a Tuesday, which meant the usual rush of senior citizens snagging their discounted biscuits and coupons, followed by the harried parents scrambling for last-minute ingredients for forgotten school lunches. Eleanor, however, had long learned to tune out the symphony of beeps and murmurs, her mind adrift in a sea of grocery lists and half-remembered song lyrics.

The setting was the "Fresh & Easy Supermarket" in Willow Creek, a sleepy, unassuming town nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. The store itself was a microcosm of Willow Creek: a little bit dated, a little bit quirky, and perpetually stocked with an inexplicable amount of pickled beets. Aisles crammed with brightly colored products stretched as far as the eye could see, culminating in a row of cash registers manned by the weary souls who kept the lifeblood of the town flowing. Eleanorâ€™s, number five, was strategically positioned near the magazine rack, giving her ample opportunity to judge the latest celebrity gossip and peruse questionable advice columns between customers. For Eleanor, who had worked at Fresh & Easy since her graduation, it was a familiar, if somewhat stifling, universe.
