The scent of industrial-strength cleaner mingled with the faint, persistent odor of glue and spilled juice, a familiar cocktail that greeted Miss Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth every morning she unlocked the door to her third-grade classroom. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds, cast stripes across the brightly colored alphabet chart and the slightly lopsided construction paper turkeys still clinging stubbornly to the bulletin board, remnants of a Thanksgiving project gone rogue. It was Tuesday, the kind of overcast, pre-snow Tuesday that made the children squirrelly and Eleanor’s coffee habit essential.

Eleanor’s classroom, Room 203 at Sunny Meadow Elementary, was a haven of controlled chaos. Located on the less-than-scenic side of the school, overlooking the parking lot and a perpetually overflowing dumpster, it relied on Eleanor’s energy to bring it to life. She’d tried to combat the drab surroundings with cheerful decorations: student artwork, inspirational posters featuring wide-eyed puppies and kittens, and a small, overflowing bookshelf dedicated to the adventures of brave mice and talking animals. The room felt worn, loved, and just a little bit sticky.
