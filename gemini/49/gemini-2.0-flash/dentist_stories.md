The air in the office of Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth hung thick with the cloying sweetness of bubblegum-flavored fluoride varnish. It was a scent Eleanor had grown numb to over the years, a masking agent against the more…pungent realities of her profession. Not that her patients were particularly egregious in their dental hygiene, no. It was more the inherent, animalistic vulnerability she felt in those moments when a mouth was agape, exposed and trusting.

Outside, a relentless Seattle rain hammered against the panoramic windows of her Queen Anne clinic. It blurred the already hazy view of Puget Sound, turning the sailboats into ghost ships and blurring the Emerald City's skyline into an Impressionist's wet dream. Eleanor, perched precariously on her rolling stool, adjusted the angle of the overhead light, its harsh beam reflecting off the pristine white of her patient’s teeth. A drip, drip, drip of condensation formed on the windowsill, a tiny metronome counting down the seconds until her next agonizing decision. Today, it wasn't about plaque or cavities. It was about Mrs. Higgins' wisdom tooth. And a promise.
