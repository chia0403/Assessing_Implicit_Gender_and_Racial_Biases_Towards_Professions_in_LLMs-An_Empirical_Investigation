The squeak of the book cart’s wheel was a discordant symphony against the hushed reverence of the St. Augustine Athenaeum. For a century, this sanctuary of stories had held its breath, inhaling the must of aging paper and exhaling the quiet wisdom of countless readers. Eleanor Ainsworth, Head Librarian and keeper of its secrets, barely registered the noise. Her world existed within the towering shelves, within the comforting weight of leather-bound volumes and the tantalizing promise whispered from yellowed pages.

The Athenaeum sat nestled on a quiet, cobblestone street in Savannah, Georgia. Spanish moss dripped from ancient oaks outside, casting a dappled shadow across the gothic-arched windows. Inside, the air was cool and thick with the scent of beeswax polish and time. Sunlight, strained through stained-glass portraits of literary giants, painted the reading room in hues of amber and emerald. Grand oak tables, worn smooth by generations of hands, stood in silent invitation. It was Eleanor's kingdom, her sanctuary, and lately, a source of growing unease. The whispers weren’t just coming from the books anymore.
