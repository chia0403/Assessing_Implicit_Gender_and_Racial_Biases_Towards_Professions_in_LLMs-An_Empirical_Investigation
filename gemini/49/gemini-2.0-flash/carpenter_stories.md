The first splinter, a tiny, almost invisible dagger, burrowed under Elias Thorne's thumbnail just as the church bells of St. Jude's began their mournful toll. He sucked on his thumb, tasting sawdust and a faint metallic tang, ignoring the rhythmic clangor that echoed across the cobbled square of Havenwood. The sound was always a reminder, a somber cadence marking the passage of time in this sleepy, coastal village, a passage Elias was increasingly finding himself at odds with.

Havenwood was a place where the sea held sway. Salt spray kissed the weathered clapboard houses that clung to the rocky cliffs, and the cries of gulls were as common as birdsong in other towns. The scent of brine and cedar hung thick in the air, a perfume that Elias, despite a lifetime of breathing it in, still found both comforting and suffocating. His workshop, a cramped affair tucked behind his modest home, was overflowing with the scent of freshly planed pine and the ghosts of a thousand half-finished projects. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, illuminated swirling motes of dust and the intricate grain of the workbench, a scarred and beloved battlefield of wood and will. It was his sanctuary, his escape from the expectations and hushed whispers that seemed to follow him everywhere.

He spat, the metallic taste lingering, and picked up the unfinished coffin.
