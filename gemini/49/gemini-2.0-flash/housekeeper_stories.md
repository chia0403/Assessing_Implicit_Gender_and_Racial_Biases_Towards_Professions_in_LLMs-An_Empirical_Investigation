Okay, here's a story opening with a main character, including setting and full name:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of beeswax and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shield against the lingering ghosts of last night's revelry. Cecilia Antoinette Dubois, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun that belied the mischievous glint in her hazel eyes, surveyed the battlefield that was the Grand Ballroom of Oakhaven Manor. Champagne flutes lay scattered like fallen soldiers, their crystal shards glinting under the morning sun filtering through the immense arched windows. Silk scarves, shed in moments of boisterous celebration, draped across the ornate, gilded chairs like fallen banners.

It was always the same after a ball. The same riot of discarded finery, the same stubborn stains on the antique Persian rug, the same echo of laughter and music clinging to the high, vaulted ceiling. Cecilia, however, found a strange satisfaction in restoring order to the chaos. Each gleaming surface, each perfectly aligned cushion, was a small victory against the fleeting nature of joy.

She sighed, a sound swallowed by the cavernous room, and tightened her grip on the feather duster. Time to begin. Lady Oakhaven wouldnâ€™t appreciate tardiness. Not when Cecilia had made such a good impression for a woman who was, after all, just the help.

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily in **Oakhaven Manor**, a sprawling, centuries-old estate located in the rolling hills of the English countryside, about two hours outside of London. The manor is the ancestral home of the Oakhaven family, wealthy aristocrats known for their lavish parties and eccentric traditions. The story will likely feature various rooms in the manor, including the Grand Ballroom, the formal dining room, the family library, and the servants' quarters.

**Further Details that can be revealed as the story progresses:**

*   **Time Period:** The story is set in a vague time period, around 1950s, that is alluded to through fashion and technology. This era is chosen to allow for a mix of old-world charm and modern sensibilities.
*   **Social Context:** The social hierarchy of the time is important, influencing Cecilia's interactions with the Oakhaven family and the other staff. The story may explore themes of class and the changing role of women.
*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is intended to be a blend of elegance and mystery. Oakhaven Manor is beautiful but also holds secrets within its walls. The story will play with both the light and shadows of this world.

I hope this is a helpful starting point! Let me know if you would like more details or changes to any of these elements.
