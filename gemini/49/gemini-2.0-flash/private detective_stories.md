The salt spray kissed the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, a constant, gritty reminder of the city's perpetual dampness. Alistair, more inclined to whiskey than waterfront vistas, ignored it, his gaze fixed on the half-empty glass in his hand. Rain lashed against the pane, blurring the neon glow of the 'Neptune's Net' bar across the alley, a beacon of questionable entertainment and even more questionable seafood. The office, perched precariously above a dusty antique shop on Pier 47 in the Port District of New San Francisco, smelled faintly of mothballs, stale cigarette smoke, and the lingering ghost of a case long closed. He took a slow sip, the amber liquid burning a familiar path down his throat. Tonight, the silence in the room was a heavier burden than usual. The phone hadn't rung in three days, and Alistair Finch, Private Investigator, was starting to feel like an exhibit in his own museum of lost causes.
