Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a registered nurse named Elara Mei Chen:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the cramped, bustling break room of St. Jude's Hospital in San Francisco. The walls are a faded, institutional green, plastered with outdated flyers about CPR certifications and the latest hospital cafeteria specials. The air is thick with the aroma of stale coffee, reheated takeout, and the faint, lingering scent of antiseptic from the nearby patient rooms. A flickering fluorescent light hums overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the faces of the tired nurses and techs crammed around the small, chipped table. Outside, the distant wail of sirens underscores the relentless, high-stakes rhythm of city life.

**Story Opening:**

Elara Mei Chen, R.N., stared blankly at the half-eaten container of yogurt in her hands, the plastic spoon hovering just above the surface. Five minutes. That's all she had. Five minutes before she had to return to the chaos of the oncology ward, to the quiet desperation in Room 304, to the relentless beeping of machines that seemed to mock the fragile breaths of her patients. Five minutes to swallow down the knot of anxiety that had been tightening in her chest since the shift report. Across from her, Maria, a veteran ICU nurse with eyes that held the stories of a thousand near-death experiences, took a long, deliberate drag from her vape pen. The sickly sweet scent of bubblegum filled the already overloaded air. "Rough night, Elara?" Maria asked, her voice raspy. Elara managed a weak smile. "You know, the usual. Mr. Henderson's sats dipped again, Mrs. Rodriguez is convinced the radiation is burning her from the inside out, and I spent an hour trying to convince little Leo that the IV wasn't going to steal his superpowers." Maria chuckled, a dry, rattling sound. "Welcome to the frontline, kid. Now, eat your yogurt. You're gonna need the energy." But Elara couldn't shake the feeling that tonight would be different. Tonight, the line between life and death felt thinner than ever. And she was standing right on it.
