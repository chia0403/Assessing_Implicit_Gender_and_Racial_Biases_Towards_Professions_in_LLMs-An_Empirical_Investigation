The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Little Acorns Kindergarten, a relentless rhythm that threatened to drown out even the gleeful shrieks emanating from inside. Inside, Miss Penelope Clementine Plum, better known as Penny to her five-year-old charges, meticulously arranged a tray of glitter-covered paper snowflakes. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, not because the task was difficult, but because she was attempting to ignore the nagging feeling that she'd forgotten something important. Today was the last day before the winter break, a day usually filled with the magic of Christmas and the promise of hot cocoa. But beneath the sparkly decorations and the anticipation of Santa Claus, Penny felt a discordant note, a wrongness she couldn't quite place.

The Little Acorns Kindergarten was a sprawling, single-story building nestled at the edge of the Whispering Woods in the quaint town of Everbrook. It was a place of vibrant murals depicting whimsical animals, overflowing bookshelves, and the comforting aroma of crayons and spilled apple juice. The walls were adorned with artwork, a kaleidoscope of handprints and lopsided drawings that celebrated the chaotic creativity of its inhabitants. Outside, a rambling garden, now dormant under a blanket of grey sky and persistent rain, usually buzzed with the life of busy little explorers chasing butterflies and digging for worms. But today, the garden felt abandoned, mirroring the unease that simmered within Penny. Something was off in Everbrook, and she couldn't shake the feeling that it had something to do with her tiny, snow-covered classroom.
