**Opening:**

The fluorescent hum of the office lights was a constant companion to Eleanor Vance. She barely registered it anymore, just like she barely registered the lukewarm coffee sloshing in her mug or the persistent ache in her lower back. What truly occupied her mind was the manuscript sprawled across her desk: *Whispers of the Crimson Coast*, a debut novel by a writer who clearly thought the word “prolix” was a challenge, not a warning. Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of keyboard clicks and phone calls that defined a Tuesday afternoon at Sterling & Blackwood Publishing. She ran a weary hand through her perpetually messy bun, the scent of lavender shampoo a fleeting moment of calm in the literary storm.

**Setting:**

Sterling & Blackwood Publishing, a venerable institution nestled on the fifth floor of a pre-war building in Midtown Manhattan, was an odd mix of tradition and modernity. Gleaming glass cubicles housing the marketing and publicity teams clashed with the mahogany desks and overflowing bookshelves of the editorial department. The air was thick with the aroma of old paper and ambition, a potent cocktail that fueled the dreams of both aspiring authors and the weary editors who held their fates in their hands. Eleanor’s own cubicle, tucked away in a corner near the perpetually malfunctioning coffee machine, was a testament to her dedication and her disorganization. Piles of manuscripts threatened to spill onto the floor, competing for space with stacks of galleys, scribbled notes, and half-empty mugs. A framed photograph of her niece, beaming from a school play, sat precariously balanced on a tower of unopened submissions, a small reminder of the life she often sacrificed for the sake of the written word. From her window, she could just glimpse the grey expanse of the Hudson River, a silent, watchful presence in the heart of the city.
