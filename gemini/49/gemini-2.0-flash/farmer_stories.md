The dust devil snaked across the parched fields, a miniature tornado kicking up grit and whispering a lonely song against the relentless Kansas sun. Jedediah "Jed" Ebenezer Thompson, his face etched with the map of years spent wrestling with this unforgiving land, squinted at it from the porch of his farmhouse. The wood, once a vibrant red, was now faded and peeling, mirroring the weariness in his own bones. The house, a square, solid structure built by his grandfather, stood sentinel against the vast, undulating ocean of wheat, a sea that this year threatened to be a desert.

Jed’s fingers, gnarled and brown from decades of toil, tightened around the chipped enamel of his coffee mug. The bitter brew barely cut through the dryness in his throat, a dryness that mirrored the land itself. He'd watched the rain clouds dance just beyond the county line all spring, teasing him, promising relief, then disappearing like fickle lovers.

The year was 1934, smack dab in the heart of the Dust Bowl, and Jedediah Ebenezer Thompson was running out of time, running out of water, and running out of hope. His farm, Thompson Family Farms, passed down through generations, teetered on the brink of ruin. His neighbors were packing up, heading west, lured by the promise of California oranges and a life free from the suffocating dust. Jed, however, couldn't bring himself to abandon the land that held the bones of his ancestors, the land that was woven into the very fabric of his being. He’d rather starve standing tall, rooted in the soil, than crawl away in defeat. He just prayed that soil had something left to give.
