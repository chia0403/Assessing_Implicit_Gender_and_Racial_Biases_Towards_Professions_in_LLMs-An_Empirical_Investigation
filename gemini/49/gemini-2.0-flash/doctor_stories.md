## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the choppy, slate-grey waters of the North Sea, stinging exposed skin and rattling the corrugated iron roof of the tiny clinic. The Shetland Islands, a scattering of green and brown jewels flung across the vast ocean, were unforgiving in late December. The clinic itself, perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the tiny village of Hamnavoe, was a single-story, utilitarian structure, its peeling white paint a testament to the relentless weather. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of disinfectant, antiseptic cream, and the faint, underlying scent of damp wool. A kettle whistled merrily on a small hotplate in the corner, a beacon of warmth against the encroaching cold.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Iris Vance, her red hair pulled back in a practical bun escaping strands that stubbornly framed her tired face, stared out the grime-streaked window. The swirling snow blurred the already indistinct horizon, making the few fishing boats returning to harbour look like ghostly apparitions. She massaged the bridge of her nose, feeling the familiar throb of a headache building behind her eyes. The island was beautiful, fiercely independent, and fiercely demanding. And tonight, with the storm intensifying and the single midwife off-island attending a training course, she was the only doctor for the entire peninsula. The shrill ring of the old rotary phone on the desk behind her shattered the relative silence. Eleanor sighed, a puff of warm air momentarily fogging the cold glass. “Hamnavoe Clinic, Dr. Vance speaking,” she said, her voice already laced with weary expectation. Whatever awaited her on the other end of the line, she knew it wouldn’t be good news. Not tonight.
