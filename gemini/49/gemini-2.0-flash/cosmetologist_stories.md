The hum of the fluorescent lights in "Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow" seemed particularly loud that morning, exacerbating Isabella Marie Rossi's already throbbing headache. The salon, a riot of teal and fuchsia that felt perpetually stuck in the 1980s, hadn't been renovated since it opened, a fact that Isabella was constantly reminded of by the peeling floral wallpaper and the chipped linoleum. It smelled perpetually of hairspray and stale coffee, a scent that clung to everything, including Isabella’s clothes. She sighed, adjusting her apron, which, despite her best efforts, always managed to attract errant strands of brightly colored dye like a magnet. Outside, the November wind howled down Elm Street in the small, stubbornly blue-collar town of Mill Creek, Pennsylvania, rattling the ill-fitting windows and promising a long, bleak winter. The clock on the wall ticked with irritating precision, counting down the minutes until her first client of the day, Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose silver hair was perpetually in need of taming and whose opinions were even more unruly. Isabella dreaded Tuesdays; Mrs. Henderson always came with a fresh batch of gossip about the town, most of which centered around the illicit affairs and questionable financial decisions of the town's residents. Isabella, however, was too polite to tell her she’d rather just cut hair in silence.
