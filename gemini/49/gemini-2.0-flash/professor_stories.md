The first snowflake, fat and clumsy, landed squarely on Professor Amelia Thorne's nose as she wrestled with the recalcitrant clasp of her ancient leather briefcase. She swore under her breath – a practiced, academic sort of curse that involved the word "entropy" – and fumbled with gloved fingers. The late afternoon gloom had already begun to steal the colour from the cobblestone streets of Heidelberg, painting the ancient city in shades of grey and muted gold.

Amelia stood perched on the steps of the Friedrich Building, a gargantuan edifice of sandstone and wrought iron that housed the hallowed halls of Heidelberg University’s History Department. Built in the late 19th century, it exuded an aura of profound scholarship and whispered secrets, its ivy-choked walls bearing silent witness to countless academic squabbles and groundbreaking discoveries. The sharp scent of woodsmoke, mingled with the damp, earthy aroma of the nearby Neckar River, hung in the crisp air. Across the street, the students from the Studentenkarzer, the old student prison, spilled out onto the pavement, their youthful laughter a stark contrast to the gravitas emanating from Amelia and the building behind her.

She was late, predictably so. The manuscript on Byzantine iconoclasm had proven more stubborn than anticipated, and the final paragraph had demanded rewrites with the obstinacy of a spoiled child. Amelia knew the book needed to be perfect, the culmination of years of painstaking research and unwavering dedication. Now, however, she had to hurry. Frau Schmidt was expecting her for Glühwein, and Amelia wouldn't dream of being late for their annual Christmas market rendezvous. The thought of the warm, spiced wine and the familiar comfort of her friend's company was a welcome beacon in the encroaching winter darkness.
