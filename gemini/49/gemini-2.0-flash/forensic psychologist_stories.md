The low, guttural growl vibrated through Dr. Alistair Reed's chest, a physical manifestation of the unease that had been gnawing at him for weeks. He adjusted his glasses, their titanium frames cool against the sudden sweat on his brow, and forced himself to focus on the grainy CCTV footage flickering on the screen. Rain lashed against the grimy window of his temporary office in the basement of the Essex County Jail, mirroring the storm brewing inside him.

The setting itself felt like a purgatory. The air, thick with the stale scent of disinfectant and despair, clung to everything. Bare concrete walls, chipped paint, and the constant metallic clang of distant cell doors formed the soundtrack to Alistair's days. He had requested a space closer to the interrogation rooms, for practical reasons of course, but he suspected Warden Davies had deliberately stuck him down here, a subtle power play from a man who didn't appreciate outside interference.

This wasn't his usual world. Alistair preferred the sanitized calm of his private practice in Boston, the gentle hum of the air purifier and the comforting weight of psychology journals stacked on his mahogany desk. But the Essex County case, specifically the chilling enigma that was Elias Thorne, had drawn him in like a moth to a dangerous flame. And now, staring at the ghostly image of Elias, hunched and shivering on a street corner hours before the brutal murders, Alistair knew he was in too deep to turn back.
