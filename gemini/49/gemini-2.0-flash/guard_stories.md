## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The wind, a cruel, biting thing, whipped around Guard Thomas Ashton's ankles, tugging at the hem of his worn woolen cloak. He shifted his weight, stamping his feet against the cobblestones in a futile attempt to ward off the creeping numbness. A fresh flurry of snow swirled past the brazier, momentarily obscuring the already dim light, and Thomas sighed, a puff of white vapor disappearing into the swirling grey. Another night. Another endless, soul-numbing night guarding a gate that had seen more action in its weathered timbers than he had in his entire life.

**Setting:**

The setting is the imposing North Gate of the city of Eldoria, a sprawling, ancient metropolis built into the foothills of the jagged, snow-capped Dragon's Tooth Mountains. Eldoria is a city of contrasts: grand, soaring spires of polished white stone pierce the sky alongside crumbling tenements choked with ivy. The air, even on a still day, hums with a restless energy â€“ a mixture of trade, magic, and simmering discontent.

The North Gate itself is a formidable structure, built to withstand siege. Two massive iron-clad doors, each easily ten feet thick, are flanked by two equally imposing towers. The stonework is stained dark with age and etched with intricate carvings, most of which have been worn smooth by centuries of wind and rain. Within the gatehouse, a small, cramped space is occupied by a crude wooden table, a few rickety chairs, and a constantly burning brazier that offers little warmth against the relentless chill. A narrow arrow slit looks out onto the windswept plains beyond, offering a stark view of the desolate landscape that stretches towards the horizon. This desolate landscape is known as the Wastes, a dangerous and untamed region populated by roaming bandits and rumored to be haunted by creatures of darkness. The North Gate is the only reliable passage into Eldoria from the Wastes, making it a crucial, if mind-numbingly boring, post for the city's guard.
