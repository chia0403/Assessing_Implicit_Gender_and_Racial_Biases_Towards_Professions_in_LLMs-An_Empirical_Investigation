## Story Opening:

The buzzing of the fluorescent lights in the waiting room seemed to syncopate with the rhythmic tapping of Dr. Eleanor Miriam Harding's pen against her clipboard. She sighed, the sound barely audible over the muted classical music drifting from hidden speakers. It was nearly five o'clock, and the end of a long Tuesday â€“ a Tuesday filled with anxieties, traumas, and the persistent, underlying hum of human suffering. Eleanor closed her eyes for a moment, willing away the phantom ache in her temples. She needed to be present, needed to be sharp. Mrs. Abernathy was next, and her struggles with agoraphobia demanded Eleanor's full, unwavering attention.

## Setting:

Eleanor's practice, "Harding Psychology," occupied the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Oak Haven, Connecticut. The building, painted a soothing shade of sage green, was known for its wide, welcoming porch and carefully manicured gardens. Inside, the reception area was deliberately designed to be calming and inviting. Soft, muted colors adorned the walls, punctuated by framed prints of landscapes and abstract art. Comfortable, overstuffed armchairs and a worn, but elegant, sofa provided seating for waiting clients. A small table held a selection of magazines, from the National Geographic to People, alongside brochures on mental health resources and coping mechanisms. Eleanor's own office, just beyond the reception area, was her sanctuary. Lined with bookshelves overflowing with psychology textbooks, research papers, and well-worn novels, it was a space where she could both intellectually challenge herself and find moments of quiet respite. A large, comfortable armchair faced her desk, offering a safe and supportive space for her patients to share their burdens. The scent of lavender oil, diffused from a small ceramic burner on her desk, permeated the air, a subtle attempt to create a feeling of peace and tranquility within the often turbulent world of the human psyche.
