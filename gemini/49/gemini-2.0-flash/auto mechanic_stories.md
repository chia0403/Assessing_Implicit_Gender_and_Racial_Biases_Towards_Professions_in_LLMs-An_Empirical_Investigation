## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The setting is a sweltering July morning in Harmony Creek, Ohio. The air hangs thick and heavy, buzzing with cicadas and the faint scent of honeysuckle struggling to overpower the pervasive smell of motor oil and burning rubber.  Across the street from a weathered diner named "Dot's," sits "Rosewood's Garage," a small, single-bay affair with a faded blue paint job and a perpetually open bay door.  Tools hang haphazardly on pegboards inside, glinting in the dim light. Greasy handprints mark every surface. A radio, perpetually tuned to a classic rock station, blasts out a distorted rendition of "Born to Be Wild."

**Story Opening:**

Sweat plastered Amelia Rose Carter's dark hair to her forehead as she wrestled with the rusted bolt on a 1967 Mustang's carburetor.  The wrench slipped, drawing a sharp curse from her lips that mingled with the blaring rock music. "Damn it!" she muttered, wiping her hands on a grease-stained rag tucked into the back pocket of her jeans. The humidity was a killer today, even for a seasoned auto mechanic like herself.  Amelia squinted at the offending bolt, the familiar frustration bubbling up inside her. This Mustang, belonging to the notoriously picky Mr. Henderson, was her nemesis of the week, and it was putting up one hell of a fight. It wasn't just a car; it was a symbol. A symbol of her father's legacy, the garage he built from the ground up, and the impossible standards she felt compelled to uphold.  She took a deep breath, trying to quell the familiar anxieties. This town, this garage, this carâ€¦ they were all she had left.  And right now, they were all conspiring against her.
