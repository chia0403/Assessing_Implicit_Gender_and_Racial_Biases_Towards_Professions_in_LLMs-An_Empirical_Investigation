The stale scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a grim reminder of life and death dancing a delicate waltz just beyond the OR doors. Dr. Alistair Benedict Cavendish pinched the bridge of his nose, the fluorescent lights of St. Jude's General Hospital amplifying the fatigue etched on his face. He hadn't slept properly in forty-eight hours, fueled only by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing pressure of responsibility. Tonight, that responsibility rested on the fragile life of a five-year-old girl with a congenital heart defect, her tiny heart a battlefield he was about to step onto.

The setting was the pre-op waiting room, a sterile purgatory bathed in the harsh glow of overhead lamps. Rows of uncomfortable, grey chairs sat empty, monuments to the anxiety simmering just below the surface of the hospital's hum. A lone, flickering vending machine offered sugary solace, and a water cooler gurgled intermittently, mimicking the nervous breaths Alistair often heard just before a critical incision. Through a small, reinforced window, Alistair could see the OR: a gleaming, intimidating space filled with advanced technology and a team of masked figures waiting for his command. He took a deep breath, straightened his shoulders, and pushed through the swinging doors, ready to face the theatre of life and death that lay within.
