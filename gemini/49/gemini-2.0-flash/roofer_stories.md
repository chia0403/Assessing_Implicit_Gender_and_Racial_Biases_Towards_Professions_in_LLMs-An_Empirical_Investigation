The tar clung to Edgar Archibald Pruitt's boots like a stubborn memory. He knelt on the sun-baked asphalt shingles, sweat beading on his brow beneath the frayed brim of his "Pruitt Roofing & Sons" cap (the "Sons" part was aspirational, seeing as his only offspring, Mildred, preferred spreadsheets to shingles). Edgar squinted, shielding his eyes from the relentless summer glare that bounced off the newly repaired section of the roof. He was perched precariously on the dilapidated Queen Anne Victorian at 7 Elm Street, Willow Creek, Iowa.

Willow Creek was a town where time seemed to move a little slower, where the gossip travelled faster than the mail, and where every other house seemed to be in a state of either blissful perfection or picturesque disrepair. 7 Elm Street, however, was firmly in the latter category. Built in 1908, it boasted intricate gingerbread trim, a wrap-around porch slowly surrendering to the elements, and a palpable sense of history, both the charming and the unsettling kind. The current owner, a reclusive antique dealer named Mrs. Hawthorne, claimed to have seen "orbs" floating in the upstairs hallway. Edgar, a man of concrete (or asphalt, in this case) facts, remained unconvinced. He was more concerned with the structural integrity of the roof than the spectral activity within. Today, however, even Edgar had to admit, the house felt different. A chilling draft snaked across his exposed neck, despite the sweltering heat, and the usual cacophony of cicadas in the surrounding maple trees had fallen into an unnerving silence. Something was amiss.
