The November air was sharp enough to bite, laced with the metallic tang of rain and the exhaust fumes of early-morning commuters. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi shivered, pulling her threadbare collar higher around her neck. The flickering neon sign of "Lou's Diner," the only splash of color on this grimy block of South Boston's Dorchester Avenue, cast a weak, yellow glow across the slick pavement. She could hear the muffled clatter of silverware and the low murmur of conversation coming from within, a warm, comforting sound that only amplified the chill clinging to her bones.

Izzy, whose full name was Isabella Sophia Rossi, had been staked out across the street for almost three hours now, tucked into the shadowed doorway of a boarded-up pawn shop. Her focus was on a nondescript brownstone a few doors down from Lou's, a building known in police circles as "The Hive" â€“ a haven for small-time drug dealers and desperate souls just trying to score their next fix. She'd been assigned surveillance, a "babysitting job" as her lieutenant had put it, while the warrant team prepped for a dawn raid. Izzy hated babysitting. She preferred kicking down doors and chasing the scum herself. But tonight, her job was to watch, wait, and hope something, anything, would happen to break the monotony and justify the hours she was losing to the damp, pre-dawn gloom.
