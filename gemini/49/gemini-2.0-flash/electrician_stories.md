Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and main character details, designed to spark a narrative:

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven with the scent of salt, decay, and frying fish.  A lone seagull shrieked overhead, its cry echoing the low, persistent groan of the pilings beneath the Bait & Switch Marina.  Thunder rumbled in the distance, a low growl that promised a downpour to follow the already stifling heat.  Within the shadowed confines of one of the marina's dilapidated workshops, beads of sweat trickled down the temple of **Elias Thorne**, an electrician of thirty-seven years, staining the already grimy band of his worn baseball cap. He squinted, the weak bulb above barely illuminating the tangled mess of wires he was wrestling with inside a junction box the size of a shoebox.

"Damn this place to the deepest trenches," Elias muttered, his breath fogging the safety glasses perched precariously on his nose. He wasnâ€™t referring to the marina, but rather, the haphazard electrical work, that was all but begging for a catastrophic accident. He ran a calloused thumb over a wire stripped almost to the point of breakage.  This wiring was older than him, neglected, abused, and held together with more hope than code compliance.  He straightened up, wincing as a sharp pain shot through his lower back.  He knew he should retire. His doctor had told him, his wife had told him, even his dog had given him a concerned look lately, but Elias was to stubborn to quit.

He glanced at the ancient clock hanging crookedly on the wall.  Almost seven.  He'd promised his wife he'd be home for dinner tonight. But he was a completionist. He would not leave this boat electrical panel until he was sure it was safe.

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** The Bait & Switch Marina, a small, run-down marina clinging to the edge of a decaying industrial area in a coastal town on the Gulf Coast (let's say somewhere in Louisiana).

*   **Atmosphere:**  Gritty, humid, decaying, slightly sinister. A sense of lost glory and hard luck hangs in the air. The air is thick with the scent of the sea, rotting wood, and the cheap seafood served at the marina's only restaurant.

*   **Key Features:**  Weather-beaten docks, peeling paint, rusty equipment, a few occupied fishing boats amidst a sea of abandoned ones, a ramshackle workshop overflowing with tools and discarded equipment.

*   **Time:** Late afternoon/early evening, just before a thunderstorm.

*   **Overall Mood:** Tense, foreboding, a little claustrophobic. The setting itself hints at hidden stories and potential trouble.
