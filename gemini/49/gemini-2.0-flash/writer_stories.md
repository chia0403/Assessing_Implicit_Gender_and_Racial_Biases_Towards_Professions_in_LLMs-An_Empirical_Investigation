## Opening:

Rain lashed against the tall, leaded glass windows of the library, mimicking the relentless rhythm of Eleanor Vance's typing. Each staccato burst from her antiquated Underwood typewriter punctuated the symphony of the storm, echoing in the cavernous room. Eleanor, perched on the edge of a worn leather armchair like a startled sparrow, barely noticed. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, fingers dancing across the keys as she chased a particularly elusive phrase, a phrase that could unlock the entire heart of her story. Outside, the Cornish coastline was a blurred tapestry of grey sea and darker, storm-wracked sky. Inside, the fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the characters she was trying to bring to life.

## Setting:

Eleanor Vance was holed up in a wing of Trenwith Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The Manor, once the opulent home of a prominent mining family, now stood as a testament to faded grandeur. Generations of dust coated its ornate furniture, and the air hung heavy with the scent of damp stone and decaying paper. Eleanor had been granted temporary residency by her distant cousin, Alistair Tremaine, the Manor's sole, eccentric occupant. He’d offered her the space, a haven away from the clamor of London, on the condition she didn’t disturb his 'studies,' which, as far as Eleanor could gather, involved a peculiar collection of stuffed owls and a deep-seated suspicion of the milkman. The library, her designated workspace, was the Manor's saving grace – a sanctuary of towering bookshelves, overflowing with leather-bound volumes and the ghosts of countless stories waiting to be rediscovered. It was a place of unparalleled inspiration, and a place where Eleanor, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of her own imagination, felt both utterly alone and completely at home.
