The stale smell of lavender and sweat clung to the air in Studio Serenity like a forgotten prayer. Outside, the cacophony of morning rush hour on Bleecker Street hammered a relentless rhythm against the aged brick building. Inside, the only sound was the gentle, rhythmic whoosh of the air purifier and the steady, almost imperceptible breathing of Evelyn Maeve Carter.

Evelyn, nestled amongst a mountain of plush, Egyptian cotton towels in the cramped supply closet, wasn't enjoying the serenity her studio promised its clients. She was, in fact, actively avoiding it. Her first client of the day, Mr. Archibald Worthington III, was a particularly…difficult…man, and the thought of spending ninety minutes untangling his knots (both physical and emotional) filled her with a dread usually reserved for tax season.

She took a deep breath, the lavender doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. Maybe, just maybe, he’d cancelled. A girl could dream, couldn't she?
