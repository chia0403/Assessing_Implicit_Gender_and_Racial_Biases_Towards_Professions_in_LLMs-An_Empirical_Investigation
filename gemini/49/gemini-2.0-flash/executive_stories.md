The rain was a brutal, insistent curtain against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Genevieve Eleanor Sterlingâ€™s 47th-floor office. It mirrored the relentless hammering in her temples. Genevieve, Senior Vice President of Global Strategy at OmniCorp, watched the city lights blur through the deluge, each streak a tiny, incandescent disappointment. Across the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Tokyo, deals were being forged, fortunes made, and empires built, all while she was stuck here, nursing a lukewarm green tea and a crippling sense of failure.

The office itself was a sterile testament to corporate ambition. Polished chrome and brushed steel gleamed under strategically placed spotlights, highlighting the minimalist art pieces that Genevieve secretly found pretentious. A single, perfect orchid sat in a crystal vase on her desk, its pristine white petals a stark contrast to the crumpled reports and half-eaten energy bar buried beneath. The air hummed with the low thrum of the building's automated systems, a constant, almost imperceptible, drone that always seemed to amplify her anxiety. Outside, the relentless rain kept falling, washing away the neon-slicked streets below and, it felt like, her career with it.
