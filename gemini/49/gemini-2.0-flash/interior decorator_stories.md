The late afternoon sun, filtered through a gauzy linen blind, cast a soft, buttery light across Eleanor Vance's cluttered desk. It was a light she usually cherished, a light that could make even the most dismal swatch of fabric seem infused with magic. Today, however, it only served to highlight the mounting pressure on her temples. Eleanor, professional name Eleanor Vance Interiors, but in her own head forever just Ellie, pushed a stray curl behind her ear, the movement doing little to alleviate the creeping tension.

Her studio, a converted carriage house nestled behind her Victorian home in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, usually hummed with a creative energy. Samples of silks and velvets spilled from overflowing drawers, paint chips clung to the walls like stubborn ivy, and architectural magazines stacked precariously on every available surface threatened to avalanche with the slightest tremor. The air was usually perfumed with the scent of beeswax polish, mingled with the faintest whiff of aged wood, a comforting aroma that spoke of history and craftsmanship.

Today, however, the ordered chaos felt oppressive. The fabrics seemed to mock her indecision, the paint chips judged her lack of inspiration, and the magazines whispered of deadlines looming. The source of her anxiety, a sprawling blueprint of a sprawling beachfront estate on Kiawah Island, lay spread before her, a stark white battlefield against the warmly stained wood of her desk. The client, a notoriously difficult and demanding tech billionaire named Jasper Thorne, expected nothing short of perfection. And perfection, at least for Eleanor Vance, had become excruciatingly elusive.
