The humid Florida air clung to everything like a needy lover, plastering Bethany Alice Collier's meticulously styled blonde bob to the back of her neck. Bethany, even in her linen power suit and meticulously applied coral lipstick, felt the first tendrils of sweat trickling down her spine. She adjusted the oversized sunglasses perched on her nose, shielding her eyes from the dazzling glare reflecting off the azure waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

She stood on the overgrown lawn of "Sea Breeze Manor," a sprawling, dilapidated Victorian monstrosity overlooking Siesta Key Beach. The once-grand estate, built in the roaring twenties, now looked more like a haunted house reject than a million-dollar property. Paint peeled from the clapboard siding in thick, grotesque curls, like sunburnt skin. The wraparound porch sagged precariously, its ornate railings choked with vines thick as pythons.

Bethany, a top-performing real estate agent for Coastal Dreams Realty, plastered on her most winning smile, the one that promised champagne sunsets and a life of leisure. "Well," she chirped, her voice a little too bright even for her own liking, "isn't she justâ€¦charming?" She carefully avoided stepping on a particularly large and brazen lizard sunning itself on the cracked sidewalk, offering a silent prayer that her clients, the notoriously discerning Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy, wouldn't be deterred by the overwhelming scent of mildew and decay that hung heavy in the air. This property, Sea Breeze Manor, was her biggest challenge yet, and if she could pull this sale off, Bethany Alice Collier would be the undisputed queen of Sarasota real estate.
