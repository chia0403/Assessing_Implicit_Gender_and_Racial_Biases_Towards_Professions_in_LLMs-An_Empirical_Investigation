Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The sickly sweet scent of lavender hand lotion, the kind Beatrice kept liberally applied to combat the chronic dryness of staring at a computer screen all day, was the first thing Amelia Stone registered. Then came the incessant hum of the fluorescent lights, a noise she usually managed to filter out, and finally, the weight of regret, pressing down on her like the pixelated sadness of a rejected logo. She hadn't slept, not really. Not since she’d sent *that* email. The email that, in a fit of caffeine-fueled creative rage, had probably just torpedoed her career.

Amelia groaned and burrowed deeper into the scratchy tweed of her office chair, the kind designed for ergonomic support but which felt suspiciously like torture after twelve hours. She scrubbed at her eyes with the heels of her hands, smearing the remnants of last night's eyeliner across her already pale skin. Sunlight, harsh and unforgiving, streamed through the grimy window, illuminating the chaos of her cubicle.

**Setting:**

The setting is the open-plan office of "Visual Ascent," a mid-sized marketing and advertising agency located on the 17th floor of a nondescript office building in downtown Chicago. The building, like the agency, is striving for modern and edgy, but mostly manages to achieve "slightly-dated and vaguely corporate."

Amelia's cubicle is a small, personalized island in a sea of beige. Stacks of design magazines threaten to topple over, competing for space with half-empty coffee mugs, scattered Pantone swatches, and a haphazard collection of quirky desk toys—a rubber chicken, a bobble-headed Frida Kahlo, a Rubik's Cube perpetually stuck on two sides. A framed print of Saul Bass's "Vertigo" poster hangs askew, a silent testament to her aspirations. The overall impression is one of creative energy battling against the constraints of corporate conformity. Outside her cubicle, the office stretches on – rows of identical desks populated by graphic designers, copywriters, account managers, all hustling to meet deadlines and keep the clients happy. A low-level murmur of keyboards clicking and phones ringing fills the air, punctuated by the occasional bark of laughter or the terse tones of a heated negotiation. You can smell the lingering aroma of stale pizza from last night's late-night brainstorming session mingling with the overly-fragrant scent of Beatrice's lavender lotion.
