The rain was coming down in sheets, blurring the already faded lines on Interstate 80, just east of Des Moines, Iowa. Inside his rig, a hulking Peterbilt 379 painted a faded shade of blue he called "Prairie Sky," Arthur Theodore Reynolds gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white. The wipers slapped rhythmically against the windshield, fighting a losing battle against the deluge.

Arthur had been driving for seventeen years, crisscrossing this country more times than he could count. He’d seen sunrises that painted the desert gold, blizzards that swallowed mountain passes whole, and enough diners serving questionable coffee to fuel a small army. He was a man of the road, a creature of the asphalt and diesel fumes, and usually, the rhythm soothed him.

Tonight, however, the rhythm felt off. A persistent ache throbbed behind his left eye, a warning sign that he was pushing himself too hard. He’d picked up a load of frozen chicken in Omaha and was supposed to deliver it to a distribution center outside of Chicago by dawn. Every minute he wasted felt like money slipping through his calloused fingers.

The truck lurched slightly as it hit a pothole concealed by the water. Arthur winced. Prairie Sky was getting old, just like him. She needed new shocks, new tires, and probably a whole host of other repairs he was putting off. He told himself he'd get around to it, eventually. After this run. After the next one. After… well, after he had enough to finally hang up his keys and find a place to settle down. A place with a front porch, maybe, and a dog.

The thought flitted through his mind, a fleeting warmth against the cold reality of the storm. Then, a flash of lightning illuminated the road ahead, and Arthur Theodore Reynolds was snapped back to the present, his focus narrowed to the blurry ribbon of asphalt and the urgent need to get his load to Chicago on time. He pressed down on the accelerator, the engine roaring in defiance of the storm, and vanished into the Iowa night.
