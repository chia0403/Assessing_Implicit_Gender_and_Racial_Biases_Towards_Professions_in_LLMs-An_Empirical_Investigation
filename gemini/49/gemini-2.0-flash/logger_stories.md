## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scream ripped through the pre-dawn stillness, a ragged sound that clawed its way out of the dense forest and sent shivers down Silas Thorne’s spine. He froze, hand hovering over the cold metal of his chainsaw, the acrid smell of two-stroke engine fuel suddenly cloying in his nostrils. It wasn’t an animal. It was a human sound, laced with terror and pain. Silas swore under his breath, a grim certainty settling in his gut. Something was wrong. Terribly, horribly wrong. He hadn’t heard a sound like that since... well, since the accident. And he'd vowed he never would again.

**Setting:**

The year is 1953. The setting is the sprawling, unforgiving wilderness of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Towering Douglas firs and Sitka spruce claw towards the sky, blotting out much of the sun and casting the forest floor in perpetual twilight. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the ever-present tang of the Pacific Ocean, which lies just beyond the ragged edge of the forest. Logging camps, temporary settlements of rough-hewn cabins and rusty machinery, are scattered throughout the area, clinging to the rugged terrain like tenacious parasites. The landscape is a brutal tapestry of steep, treacherous slopes, icy rivers that rage with the spring thaw, and dense undergrowth that snags and tears at clothing. It’s a land of hard work, hard living, and even harder deaths, where men pit themselves against the raw power of nature, and often lose.
