The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Elara Vance's scrubbing.  Steam, thick and fragrant with lemon and pine, swirled around her as she attacked the stubborn grease clinging to the enormous copper pot.  The kitchen, a cavernous space dominated by a range the size of a small car, belonged to the Blackwood Manor, a rambling Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey Atlantic.  Wind howled outside, rattling the ancient windowpanes, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of Elara’s scouring pad.  The air, despite the warmth of the kitchen, held a damp chill that seeped into your bones, a constant reminder of the relentless ocean’s proximity.  Tonight, however, the wind carried something else besides salt spray – a tremor of unease, a whisper of something…unseen.
