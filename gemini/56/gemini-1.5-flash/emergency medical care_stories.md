The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy stretcher door shut.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the helicopter blades overhead.  Amelia, a seasoned paramedic with the Metro Emergency Medical Services, shivered, not entirely from the cold. The scene still clung to her, a grim tableau of twisted metal and shattered glass under the sickly yellow sodium glare of a streetlamp.  Rain slicked the asphalt, reflecting the flashing lights like a morbid disco ball.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid bite of exhaust fumes, hung heavy in the damp night above the intersection of Bleecker Street and Lafayette Avenue – a location notorious for its late-night accidents and even later-night regrets.
