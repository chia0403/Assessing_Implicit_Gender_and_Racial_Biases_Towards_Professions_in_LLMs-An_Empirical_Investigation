The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Elias Thorne's hammer.  Dust motes, thick as summer flies, danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window high above.  Elias, his face etched with the same patient lines as the granite itself, squinted at his work.  His strong hands, calloused and scarred from years of shaping stubborn stone, moved with a practiced grace, each blow precise and deliberate.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet stone and linseed oil, a familiar perfume in the ancient, echoing workshop nestled deep within the shadowed heart of the quarry town of Oakhaven.  Outside, a relentless, driving rain lashed against the rough-hewn timbers, a sound almost swallowed by the constant, low hum of Elias's labor.
