The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort he welcomed as much as the bracing wind whipping through his unruly brown hair.  He perched precariously on the edge of the crumbling cliff, the churning grey Atlantic a churning maelstrom below.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls.  Before him, perched dramatically on the jagged rocks, stood Kilchurn Castle, its ancient stones a testament to centuries of wind and wave, a brutal beauty that Elias, architect and self-proclaimed lover of forgotten things, found utterly captivating.  The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the rugged Scottish landscape, painting the sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, a fitting backdrop for the crumbling majesty before him. His assignment – the restoration of Kilchurn – felt less like work and more like a pilgrimage.
