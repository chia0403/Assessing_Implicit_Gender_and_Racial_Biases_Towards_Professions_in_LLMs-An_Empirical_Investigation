The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of lavender and ozone, a peculiar combination that only a barbershop on a humid summer afternoon in Charleston, South Carolina could produce.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless rhythm against the backdrop of clanging trolley bells echoing down Meeting Street.

Elias Thorne, owner and proprietor of the establishment, hummed a low, melancholic tune as he expertly wielded a pair of thinning shears, his nimble fingers working magic on a client's already impressive head of silver hair.  The rhythmic snip-snip of his scissors was a counterpoint to the city's simmering energy, a quiet symphony of precision amidst the Charleston chaos.
