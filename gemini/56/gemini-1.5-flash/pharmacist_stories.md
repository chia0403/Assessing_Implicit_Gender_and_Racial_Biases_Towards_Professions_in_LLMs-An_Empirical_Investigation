The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool beneath Dr. Elara Vance’s fingertips.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faint breeze drifting in from the open window of her shop, danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the cluttered space.  The air hung thick with the scent of dried herbs – chamomile, lavender, and something sharper, almost metallic, that Elara couldn't quite place.  It was a scent as familiar to her as her own heartbeat, a comforting perfume woven into the fabric of "Vance's Apothecary," a family business nestled on the cobbled side street of Oakhaven, a town steeped in both ancient lore and stubborn modernity.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith’s hammer provided a steady percussion to the quiet hum of Elara's work, a soundtrack to the carefully measured life she’d cultivated within these four walls.  But today, the usual rhythm felt…off.  A shadow, darker than the approaching twilight, seemed to have settled over Oakhaven, and Elara knew, with a prickling unease at the back of her neck, that it was more than just the setting sun.
