The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, reflecting the nervous sheen on Finley “Finn” O’Malley’s forehead.  Finn, all elbows and knees in his ill-fitting, navy bellhop uniform, adjusted the precarious stack of luggage balanced precariously on his trolley. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigars, overripe oranges, and the faint, unsettling sweetness of cheap perfume – a perfume that clung to the velvet ropes and the ornate, dust-laden furniture like a tenacious ghost. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the stained-glass windows of the Grand Majestic, a mournful counterpoint to the tinkling of the grand piano in the far corner, where a lone pianist played a jaunty ragtime tune that felt utterly out of place.  This was 1928, and the Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the city, was beginning to show its age, its grandeur slowly crumbling like the flaking plaster on the ceiling above.  Finn, however, saw past the tarnish, past the faded glory; he saw a place of secrets, whispered behind closed doors and tucked away in the shadows of opulent suites, secrets that often found their way, via his trolley, to his eager ears.
