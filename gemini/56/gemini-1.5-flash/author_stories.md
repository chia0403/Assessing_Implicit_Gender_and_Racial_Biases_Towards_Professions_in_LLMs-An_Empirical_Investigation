The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s face, a familiar discomfort that mirrored the churning in her stomach.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – except her stern, demanding publisher – called her, gripped the railing of the ferry, the rhythmic chug of the engine a counterpoint to the frantic hammering of her own heart.  The grey, turbulent waters of the North Sea churned between her and the windswept, dramatic cliffs of Skye, their jagged silhouettes a brooding promise of the isolation she craved, and simultaneously dreaded.  Her latest manuscript, a psychological thriller titled *The Obsidian Mirror*, lay unfinished in her battered laptop bag, a stark, physical representation of the creative block that had clamped down on her like a vise. The cottage she'd rented for the month, perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling coastline, felt less like a refuge and more like a cage built of granite and sea mist.  The only sounds were the mournful cries of gulls and the relentless whisper of the wind, a symphony of loneliness that perfectly matched the desolate landscape and the emptiness she felt inside.
