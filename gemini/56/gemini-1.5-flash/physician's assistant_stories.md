The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Amelia “Mia” Hayes, whipping her parka tighter against her skin as she wrestled the stubborn latch on the clinic's back door.  The single, flickering porch light cast long, skeletal shadows across the freshly fallen snow, painting the already desolate landscape of Barrow, Alaska in even starker monochrome.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something faintly…fishy.  Mia, a physician’s assistant accustomed to the unpredictable nature of rural Alaskan medicine, shivered, but not entirely from the cold.  A sense of foreboding, as sharp and icy as the Arctic air itself, settled in her stomach.  This wasn't just another late-night call; this felt different.  The frantic message from the Inupiaq village elder, crackling over the unreliable satellite phone, had hinted at something beyond the usual flu season woes. Something far more… unsettling.
