The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the tiny aircraft bucking like a bronco in the teeth of the blizzard.  Visibility was down to near zero, the swirling snow a chaotic white curtain obscuring the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, gripped the controls with knuckles bone-white against the worn leather.  Below, the vast, unforgiving wilderness stretched out like a frozen sea, a landscape of treacherous icefalls and snow-laden spruce forests.  Her destination: a remote research station clinging precariously to the side of a glacier, a lifeline threatened by the encroaching storm.  The radio crackled with static, a desperate whisper against the roar of the wind, a stark reminder of her isolation in this unforgiving expanse.  Tonight, her skill wouldn't just be tested â€“ it would be judged.
