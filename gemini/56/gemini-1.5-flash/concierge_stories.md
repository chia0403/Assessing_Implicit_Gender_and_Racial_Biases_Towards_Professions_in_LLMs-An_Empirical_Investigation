Gus, a man whose tailored suit seemed to absorb the muted sounds of the hotel – the clinking of ice in glasses, the hushed murmurs of well-heeled guests, the soft thrum of the antique elevator – sighed, the sound swallowed by the plush carpet. Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking Fifth Avenue, a relentless percussion to the melancholic jazz drifting from the hotel bar.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive perfume and old money, felt heavy with unspoken desires and simmering secrets.  Tonight, however, the usual air of restrained luxury felt amplified, charged with an almost palpable tension that prickled at the edges of Gus's meticulously maintained composure.  He checked his pocket watch, its gold face reflecting the flickering candlelight of the nearby fireplace.  Ten minutes until midnight.  And ten minutes until, he suspected, everything was about to change.
