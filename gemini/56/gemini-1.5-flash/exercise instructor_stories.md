The salt spray stung Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s face as she jogged along the clifftop path, the wind whipping her dark braid across her cheek.  The sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the Pacific, cast long shadows across the rugged coastline of Big Sur. Below her, the waves crashed against the rocks with a rhythmic roar that was both terrifying and strangely soothing.  Amy, a certified personal trainer with a physique sculpted from years of demanding workouts, inhaled deeply, the crisp, briny air filling her lungs.  Her usual pre-dawn boot camp session was finished, but the day, like her energy levels, was far from over. The vibrant sunset, however, was a perfect end to the physical exertion, or so she thought.  Tonight's client was different, and Amy had a feeling this would be anything but a typical workout.
