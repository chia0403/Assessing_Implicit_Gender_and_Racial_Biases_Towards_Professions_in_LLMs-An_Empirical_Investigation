The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved the Wyoming landscape into a masterpiece of brutal beauty.  Jagged peaks, stained the color of rust and granite, clawed at a sky the bruised purple of a twilight bruise.  Below, the sprawling ranch of  Barnaby “Barney”  McGregor stretched out like a rumpled, patchwork quilt of brown and green, a testament to generations of stubborn resilience against the unforgiving elements.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and sagebrush, mingled with the metallic tang of distant lightning, a promise of the storm that brewed on the horizon. Barney, his weathered face etched with the map of a hard life lived under these unforgiving skies, squinted at the gathering darkness, a familiar unease settling in his gut.  Something felt…off.  The rhythmic bleating of his sheep, usually a comforting symphony, sounded strangely muted, almost…fearful.
