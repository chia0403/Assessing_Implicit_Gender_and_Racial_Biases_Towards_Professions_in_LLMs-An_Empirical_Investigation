The acrid tang of ozone hung heavy in the air, a lingering ghost of the afternoon thunderstorm that had ripped through Charleston.  Rain still lashed against the tall, arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dental practice, blurring the gas lamps that flickered on King Street below.  Inside, the air was a stark contrast – warm, subtly scented with peppermint and the faintly metallic smell of freshly polished instruments.  Eleanor, or Ellie as her closest friends (and a handful of particularly brave patients) called her, meticulously cleaned her dental tools, the rhythmic click of metal against metal a counterpoint to the drumming rain.  Her office, a Victorian-era gem tucked away on a cobblestone side street, was a testament to her refined tastes: mahogany furniture gleamed under the soft light, antique medical charts hung framed on the walls, and a single, perfect orchid bloomed in a crystal vase on her desk.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by a persistent, unnerving tremor that seemed to emanate from deep within the old building itself.
