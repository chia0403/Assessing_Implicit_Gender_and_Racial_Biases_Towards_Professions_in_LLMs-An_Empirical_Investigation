The scent of glue, glitter, and slightly-too-sweet apple juice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow-hued mobiles suspended from the ceiling, dappled the brightly colored carpet of Room 2B at Sunny Meadows Elementary.  Crayon shavings littered the floor like confetti after a particularly enthusiastic art project, a testament to the chaotic, yet undeniably joyful, energy of her five-year-old charges.  Outside, the late October wind rattled the ancient oak tree whose branches scraped against the classroom window, a counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of tiny voices engaged in a spirited debate about the relative merits of dinosaurs versus unicorns.  Eleanor, perched on a miniature chair, felt the familiar thrum of exhaustion mixed with a deep, abiding affection for her little flock.  Today, however, something feltâ€¦ different.  A subtle shift in the air, a prickle at the back of her neck, suggested that the usual kindergarten chaos was about to be upended.
