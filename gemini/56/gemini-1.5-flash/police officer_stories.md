The biting November wind whipped Detective Inspector Amelia Stoneâ€™s trench coat around her legs as she stared down at the body.  Rain, slick and relentless, mirrored the oily sheen on the cobblestones of  Backchapel Alley, a narrow, forgotten throat between the imposing Victorian facades of  Clerkenwell.  The gaslights, sputtering defiance against the downpour, cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering flames of the emergency vehicle's rotating beacon.  The air, thick with the stench of damp earth and something else, something acrid and metallic, clung to Amelia like a second skin. This wasn't just another Friday night in London; this was the beginning of something far, far worse.
