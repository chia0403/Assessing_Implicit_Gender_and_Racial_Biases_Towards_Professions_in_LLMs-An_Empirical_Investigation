The November wind, a razor-edged thing, whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she navigated the skeletal branches of the overgrown sycamore lining the cracked pavement of Crestwood Drive.  A biting chill seeped through her worn wool coat, a stark contrast to the humid, almost tropical air that clung to the cramped, graffiti-scarred apartment buildings just beyond the manicured lawns of the wealthier residents.  This was her domain, the borderland between forgotten and privileged in the city of Oakhaven, a place where the decay of abandoned dreams met the glossy veneer of carefully constructed success.  Mia, a probation officer with five years and a thousand broken promises under her belt, adjusted her worn leather satchel, its contents a jumble of case files, half-eaten granola bars, and a perpetually lukewarm thermos of coffee.  Tonight’s visit was to Michael Davies, a repeat offender whose penchant for petty theft had somehow escalated into a series of increasingly brazen burglaries.  The flickering streetlight cast long, dancing shadows, and Mia felt a familiar prickle of apprehension.  This wasn't just another check-in; something felt wrong, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of her nightly rounds.
