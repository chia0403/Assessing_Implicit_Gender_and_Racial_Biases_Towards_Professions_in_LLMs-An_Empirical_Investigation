The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate soccer field.  Floodlights, skeletal and rusting, cast long, distorted shadows across the slick, mud-caked grass.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the summer training sessions she’d cherished.  This wasn’t the manicured pitch of the prestigious Northwood Academy, where Amy had spent the last decade molding young athletes into champions; this was the forgotten corner of Westview Park, home to the ragtag Under-14 team she'd reluctantly agreed to coach.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic thud of her worn leather soccer ball against the cracked asphalt beside the field.  Tonight, Amy Hernandez wasn't just coaching a team; she was fighting a losing battle against apathy, despair, and a rapidly fading hope.
