The chipped paint of the third-grade classroom’s windowsill felt rough beneath Ms. Eleanor Vance’s fingertips.  Outside, the October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient panes and sending a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the autumn chill.

Oakwood Elementary, usually a haven of childish laughter and the comforting rhythm of lesson plans, felt tonight like a waiting room for something she couldn’t name, something that lurked just beyond the periphery of her vision.
