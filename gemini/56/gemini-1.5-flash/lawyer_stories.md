The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as she leaned against the railing of the ferry, the churning grey waters of Puget Sound a churning mirror to the tempest brewing inside her.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had begun hours ago, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, clinging to the crisp collar of her charcoal grey coat.  Around her, the other passengers, bundled in their own layers of protection against the November chill, were a blur of muted colours – a stark contrast to the vibrant, chaotic hues of the Seattle skyline rising in the distance, a jagged silhouette against the bruised sky.  Amelia, however, saw none of it. Her gaze was fixed on Bainbridge Island, a smudge of green and brown slowly resolving itself from the mist as the ferry cut through the waves, its rhythmic chugging a counterpoint to the frantic beat of her heart.  She was going home, but home felt less like sanctuary and more like a battlefield awaiting her return.
