Outside, the grey, brooding sky mirrored the state of Blackwood & Sons' accounts, a sprawling, chaotic mess that threatened to swallow Amelia whole.  Blackwood & Sons, purveyors of fine teas and even finer gossip, occupied a crumbling Georgian building on the edge of Ashworth, a town where secrets lingered like the damp in the ancient stone walls.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's pen against the ledger was the only sound louder than the relentless wind, a counterpoint to the storm brewing both outside and within the company's finances.
