The rusty swing of the butcher's cleaver echoed through the fog-choked alley, a metallic counterpoint to the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  Rain, thick and greasy as rendered fat, plastered itself against the grimy brick walls of Grimsborough's Meat Market District.  The air hung heavy with the scent of brine, blood, and something else… something acrid and unsettling, that clung to the back of the throat like a cobweb.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butchershaw, a man whose hands were as calloused as his heart was purported to be, wiped his brow with the back of his equally blood-stained apron.  His shop, "Butchershaw's Best," was, for all intents and purposes, deserted – a stark contrast to the bustling market stalls a mere block away.  But Barty wasn't worried about customers; he was worried about the silence, the unsettling stillness that had settled over the usually boisterous alley like a shroud.  Tonight, even the rats seemed to hold their breath.
