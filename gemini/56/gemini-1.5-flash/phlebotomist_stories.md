The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own heart.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with a decade of experience etched onto her face in the form of faint lines around her eyes and a perpetual air of calm efficiency, adjusted the tourniquet on Mr. Henderson’s arm.  The air hung heavy with the sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of blood, a familiar aroma that usually didn't bother her.  But today, the familiar comfort was absent, replaced by a gnawing unease that settled deep in her stomach, a feeling as prickly as the disposable needles scattered across her tray.  The clinic, usually a hive of orderly activity, felt strangely still, the usual cheerful chatter of patients and nurses muted to a hushed whisper.  Even the clock on the wall seemed to tick with a deliberate slowness, each second stretching into an eternity.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Meadowbrook, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost clinical, atmosphere within.
