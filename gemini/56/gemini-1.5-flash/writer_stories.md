The chipped mug warmed Amelia Stone’s fingers, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the gnawing anxiety in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the single-pane window of her attic studio, a relentless drumming that mirrored the chaotic rhythm of her thoughts.  Dust motes danced in the weak beam of the desk lamp, illuminating the overflowing ashtray and a manuscript titled *The Obsidian Mirror*, its pages splayed open, mocking her with their blankness.  The attic room itself, perched precariously atop her grandmother’s rambling Victorian house in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, was a testament to creative chaos: stacks of books teetered precariously, half-finished paintings leaned against the walls, and the scent of old paper and drying paint hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to Amelia’s current state of writer’s block.
