The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves clinging to the air.  Giant oak trees, their branches skeletal against the bruised purple twilight, lined the street, their shadows long and stretching like grasping fingers.  Amelia clutched a worn copy of "Goodnight Moon" tighter to her chest, its familiar comfort a stark contrast to the chill that seeped into her bones.  She was late.  Again.  Not that the children at Sunnyside Daycare would mind – they were far too absorbed in their pre-bedtime chaos to notice her tardiness, a chaos that Amelia, despite the lateness and the biting wind, found strangely comforting.  The chaotic, sweet-smelling comfort of sticky fingers, crayon marks, and the lingering aroma of spilled juice –  that was her sanctuary.
