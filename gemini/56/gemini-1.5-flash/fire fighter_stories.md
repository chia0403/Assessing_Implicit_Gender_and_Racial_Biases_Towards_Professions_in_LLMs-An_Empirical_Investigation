The acrid bite of smoke stung Elias Thorne's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old Victorian on Elm Street.  Flames, a hungry orange maw, licked at the gables, throwing dancing shadows that writhed against the inky backdrop of the late October sky. Rain, a hesitant drizzle at best, did little to quell the blaze; it merely hissed and steamed against the superheated brickwork, adding a ghostly veil to the spectacle of destruction.  The air hung thick with the smell of burning wood, melting plastic, and something elseâ€¦ something sickeningly sweet, like overripe fruit.  This wasn't just a house fire; Elias sensed something far more sinister was at play.
