The aroma of sourdough, sharp and yeasty, hung heavy in the pre-dawn air, clinging to the cobblestones of Rue du Pain Dor√© like a second skin.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, slicked the narrow street, reflecting the pale glow of the gas lamps in shimmering pools.  Inside "Le Fournil de la Lune," the air was even warmer, a comforting contrast to the chill outside.  Flour dusted every surface, a fine, ethereal snow settling on the aged oak counters and the worn copper bowls.  This was the domain of  Isabelle Antoinette Dubois, a woman whose life revolved around the rhythmic kneading of dough and the satisfying crackle of a perfectly formed crust.  The first rays of the rising sun, struggling to pierce the thick cloud cover, painted long shadows across her flour-dusted apron as she began her day, the rhythmic thump of her hands against the dough a counterpoint to the whispering rain outside.
