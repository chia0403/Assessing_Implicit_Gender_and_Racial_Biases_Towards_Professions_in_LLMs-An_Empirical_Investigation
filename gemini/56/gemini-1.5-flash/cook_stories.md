The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last crate of limpets onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey horizon of the Outer Hebrides, cast long shadows across the pitching vessel.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, was pierced by the insistent cry of gulls circling overhead, their calls a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic creak of the wooden hull.  Elias, his hands raw and chapped despite the thick gloves, wiped a streak of seawater from his grizzled beard.  He wasn't a fisherman, not truly; he was a cook, a culinary artist confined to the cramped, swaying galley of this fishing trawler, where his canvas was not linen but a battered steel countertop and his palette, the bounty of the unforgiving sea.  Tonight, the menu was simple: limpet stew, a fisherman's favourite, but even the most humble dish required skill and precision when the sea was your only supplier.
