The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's face as she wrestled her easel into position, the wind threatening to send her palette of vibrant oils tumbling into the churning turquoise waters below.  The cliffs of Île de Sein, a jagged tooth jutting from the tempestuous Atlantic, rose behind her, their granite faces scarred by centuries of relentless storms.  Seabirds, their cries lost in the roar of the ocean, wheeled overhead.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of something else – something sweet and subtly floral, a perfume perhaps, carried on the erratic gusts.  Sera, however, was more preoccupied with capturing the ferocious beauty of the churning waves, the way the light fractured and danced on the white-capped crests, a kaleidoscope of blues and greens that shifted with every breath of wind.  Her canvas, already alive with preliminary strokes of Prussian blue and emerald green, promised to become a masterpiece, a testament to the untamed power of the sea and the unwavering spirit of the island itself.
