The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion accompanying the even more relentless throbbing in his left temple.  It was the kind of rain that soaked to the bone in seconds, the kind that seeped into your very soul, mirroring the grimness of the case currently occupying his already overflowing desk.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, damp wool, and something vaguely floral – probably the remnants of a particularly enthusiastic attempt at air freshener by his landlady, Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose eccentricities were only surpassed by her rent increases.  Jack Stratton, Private Investigator, sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, the dim light of a single bare bulb illuminating the scattered papers, half-empty whiskey glass, and a photograph – a faded image of a smiling woman with eyes that held a haunted depth that mirrored the city outside his window: rain-lashed, unforgiving, and shrouded in secrets.  This was San Francisco, 1947, and secrets, Jack knew, were his bread and butter – or, more accurately, his lukewarm coffee and cheap rye.
