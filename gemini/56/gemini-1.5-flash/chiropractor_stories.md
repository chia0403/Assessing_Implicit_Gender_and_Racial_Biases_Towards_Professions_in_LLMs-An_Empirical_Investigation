The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn, wind-whipped door of her clinic open.  The "Oceanside Back & Body" sign creaked a mournful protest against the relentless Pacific gale, its faded paint chipping like sunburnt skin.  Inside, the small waiting room, smelling faintly of antiseptic and seaweed, was empty save for a lone, wind-tossed pamphlet advertising whale watching tours.  Rain lashed against the panoramic window overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Monterey Bay, mirroring the stormy turmoil brewing inside Eleanor herself.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore provided a constant, almost oppressive, soundtrack to her quiet, isolated practice, a stark contrast to the bustling city she'd left behind just six months ago.
