The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Elias Thorne’s ears, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of his hammer against slate.  Below, the city of Porthaven sprawled, a patchwork of grey roofs and twinkling streetlights reflecting in the slick, rain-streaked cobblestones.  Elias, perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of a Victorian mansion, felt the familiar thrill of the height, the dizzying freedom, a stark contrast to the cramped, damp attic he called home just a few feet below.  The air tasted sharp and clean, a welcome change from the coal smoke that perpetually clung to the city’s lower levels.  Tonight, however, even the usual exhilaration was muted by a gnawing unease.  The job – a simple repair, at least that’s what Mr. Silas Blackwood had claimed – felt…off.  The silence from the house was unnerving, broken only by the wind and the insistent tapping of Elias’s hammer, a lonely rhythm against the approaching storm.
