Her usual haunts were the glittering ballrooms and hushed concert halls, places where the air itself seemed to shimmer with expectation.  But tonight, the Rusty Mug was her stage, and the handful of patrons scattered around the sticky tables were her audience.  Her carefully crafted smoky eye makeup, usually a beacon of glamour, seemed out of place in this grimy haven of forgotten dreams.
