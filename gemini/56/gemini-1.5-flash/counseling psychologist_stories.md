Sunlight, filtered through the grimy window, barely illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the worn Persian rug and the comfortable, slightly rumpled sofa where her clients usually unburdened their souls.  Tonight, however, the only sound besides the relentless rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall, a counterpoint to the unsettling quiet in her otherwise busy schedule. Eleanor sighed, the steam from her tea momentarily clouding her already weary gaze.  Another cancelled appointment.  She wondered if the storm was keeping them away, or if something else was brewing.
