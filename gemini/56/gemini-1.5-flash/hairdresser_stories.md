The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Katherine Finch truly appreciated.  Amelia, or Millie as most of her clientele called her, surveyed her salon, "Shear Perfection," with a critical eye.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows of the century-old building on Bleecker Street.  The building itself, a faded Victorian marvel squeezed between a trendy vegan bakery and a vintage clothing store, was a testament to the grit and glamour that defined the West Village.  Flaking paint on the windowsills hinted at a history richer than any of Millieâ€™s expensive shampoos, a history whispered in the groan of the floorboards underfoot and the faint echo of laughter long faded.  Today, however, the laughter was decidedly present, a lively, chaotic symphony of chattering women, the whir of hairdryers, and the rhythmic snip-snip of Millie's shears, a familiar and comforting soundtrack to her life.
