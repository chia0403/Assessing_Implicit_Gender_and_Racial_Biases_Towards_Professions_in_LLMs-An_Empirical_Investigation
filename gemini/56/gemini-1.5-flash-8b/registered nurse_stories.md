The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, almost malevolent drone that vibrated through Amelia Grace Blackwood's bones.  She scrubbed furiously at the bloodstains on her scrubs, the metallic tang clinging to the air like a shroud.  Outside, the city thrummed with life, a stark contrast to the frantic, silent chaos within the room.  The rhythmic beep of heart monitors mingled with the ragged gasps of patients, the sharp crackle of static from the intercom, and the hushed whispers of medical staff.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years' experience at St. Jude's General Hospital, felt the weight of the night pressing down on her shoulders, a tangible force that threatened to crush her.

Setting: The bustling emergency room of St. Jude's General Hospital, a large, urban facility known for its high volume of patients and the high-pressure environment that went hand-in-hand with that volume.  The room itself was a tableau of medical urgency:  the sterile white walls were marred by splashes of crimson; the air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear; the beeping of machines, the clanging of gurneys, and the hurried footsteps of doctors and nurses created an almost frenetic undercurrent.  Outside the emergency room, the city bustled with a vibrant energy, the sounds of traffic and the distant glow of streetlights a stark reminder of the world Amelia tried so desperately to ignore for now.
