The biting wind whipped at the oversized visor of Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's cab, stinging his cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the desolate highway, swallowing the faded billboards advertising questionable energy drinks and miracle weight-loss pills.  He gripped the worn steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather, his breath misting in the frigid air.  Sunrise, a pale blush on the horizon, barely pierced the swirling grey. This stretch of the I-95, between the rust-colored plains of Kansas and the ragged mountains of Colorado, was always a tough one.  A place where the silence stretched longer than the endless ribbon of asphalt, a place where the only company was the rhythmic groan of his rig and the relentless symphony of the open road.

Jax Blackwood, a seasoned trucker with eyes the color of weathered granite and hands calloused from a lifetime of handling heavy cargo, was a man sculpted by the elements.  His rig, a beat-up but loyal Freightliner named the "Iron Horse", was his home, his office, his confidante.  Today, the cargo held no allure.  His stomach churned with a knot of apprehension, a feeling heavier than the twenty-ton load he hauled.  The shipment wasn't some ordinary freight; it was a consignment of antique firearms, marked with the cryptic initials "A.S.D.".  The sender, a reclusive arms dealer known only as "The Serpent," had left Jax with no other instructions than to deliver it to a drop-off point outside Cheyenne.  A shiver, more than just the chill of the wind, ran down his spine.  This was no ordinary delivery.
