The clatter of shears against cloth, a rhythmic tattoo against the muted hum of the city, was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  Elias Thorne, Master Tailor of the Whispering Needle, was a creature of habit.  Every morning, the same chipped porcelain mug warmed his hands, the same bittersweet blend of chamomile and rose filling the small, cluttered workshop.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows, painted a shifting tapestry of light and shadow across the meticulously organized rows of fabric – silks, satins, velvets, each a whispered promise of luxury to come.  Today, however, the usual symphony was interrupted.  Not by a particularly demanding client, not by a rogue seamstress, but by a sudden, unnerving stillness.  The city outside, usually a cacophony of hawkers, carriages, and shouts, was eerily silent.  This unusual quiet, though, was far more than a temporary lull.  It felt… wrong.

The workshop itself was a testament to Elias’s meticulous nature.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating intricate patterns sketched on charcoal-smudged parchment.  A worn mahogany table, scarred with the battles of countless stitches, stood in the center, a collection of half-finished garments nestled around it.  A tapestry depicting a knight slaying a dragon – a gift from his late father – hung above the workbench, a constant reminder of the life Elias had left behind, of the world he now sought to understand.  The subtle scent of beeswax, a familiar comfort, mingled with the faint aroma of something alien, something unfamiliar, something…metallic.  And that scent was intensifying.
