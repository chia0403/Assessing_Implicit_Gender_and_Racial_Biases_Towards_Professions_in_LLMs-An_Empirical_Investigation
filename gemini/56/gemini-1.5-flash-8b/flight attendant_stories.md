The humid air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a scent Amelia, Flight Attendant Amelia Hayes, couldn't quite place.  Outside, the sun beat down on the emerald-green jungle canopy, a stark contrast to the cool, sterile interiors of the Aerolineas del Sol 787.  Amelia adjusted the oxygen mask around her neck, the soft plastic a familiar comfort against her skin.  Her eyes scanned the rows of sleeping passengers, the gentle hum of the engines a rhythmic lullaby.  Today, Flight 428 was bound for the remote island of Isla Esmeralda, a haven shrouded in myth and mystery, a place whispered to be teeming with ancient secrets.  Amelia, however, was focused on the mundane: ensuring every passenger reached their destination safely and comfortably.  But a nagging unease, like a small, persistent fly buzzing around her temples, persisted.  Something about this flight felt different, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of things.  The metallic scent, the strange stillness in the air â€“ it all pointed to something more than just a typical journey.
