The biting wind whipped Amelia Petrova's hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she wrestled the controls of the Zephyr.  Below, the jagged peaks of the K'thara Mountains, perpetually shrouded in a bruised purple haze, pressed against the horizon.  A thousand feet below, the shimmering turquoise lake nestled within the valley floor was a stark contrast to the harsh, unforgiving landscape surrounding it.  Amelia, her knuckles white on the yoke, felt the Zephyr shudder beneath her, a familiar dance of power and defiance.  The lake, they said, held the key. Not to treasure or riches, but to something far more elusive – the answers to the whispers carried on the wind. This was Amelia's third attempt to reach the lake's hidden cove, three unsuccessful attempts to decode the ancient symbols etched into the surrounding cliffs.  Time, as always, felt like a suffocating blanket; a race against the encroaching twilight. The roar of the turbine, the steady rhythm of the wind, the eerie silence of the mountains – these were the only constant companions in Amelia's life as a pilot.  And tonight, she had a feeling that the answers were closer than ever before.
