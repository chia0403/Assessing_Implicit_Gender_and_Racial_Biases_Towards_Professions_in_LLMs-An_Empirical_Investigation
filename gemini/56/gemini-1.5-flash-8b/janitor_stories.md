The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rustle of unseen pages and the faint, persistent scent of aged paper.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a figure hunched over a chipped porcelain sink in the meticulously organized, yet perpetually dusty, janitor's closet.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, custodian of the Grand Zenith Library, a place where the whispers of forgotten knowledge echoed through towering shelves and silent study rooms.  Barty, a man perpetually shrouded in the shadows of the library, was a creature of quiet efficiency, his life a symphony of quiet tasks: emptying overflowing wastebaskets, replenishing paper towels, and sweeping the relentless debris left by the wandering souls within.
