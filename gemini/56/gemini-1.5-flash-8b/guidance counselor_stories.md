The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a constant, almost oppressive thrum that mirrored the anxiety swirling in the air.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a scattered pile of student essays – crumpled, annotated, and undeniably filled with the angst of adolescence.  Eleanor, her name a quiet counterpoint to the clamor of the high school hallways outside, stared at the latest submission from Liam O'Malley.  This wasn't the usual teenage angst; this felt… different.

The setting was the cramped, beige-walled office of Northwood High School.  Paint chipped in places, revealing the faded glory of a once-bright school.  The aroma of stale coffee and old books hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to the echoing silence that often descended on the office during the slow afternoons.  A half-eaten bag of crisps lay on Eleanor's desk, a testament to the frequent late-night sessions and rushed lunches that were a part of her job.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the school bell marked the passing of time, each chime a tiny hammer blow against the anxieties and hopes she encountered daily.
