The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded, turquoise that had seen better days, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of "Scissors & Smiles."  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bare bulb, and hung suspended over the meticulously organized array of hair products: shimmering serums, vibrant dyes, and sturdy curling irons.  Amelia “Ames” Hawthorne, her name barely a whisper on the air, adjusted the small, intricate mirror over the sink, her gaze sharp, focused on the reflection of her own hands.  They were calloused, stained from countless washes and cuts, but they moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned sculptor, shaping and reforming the very essence of her clients.  Today, though, the usual symphony of chattering conversations and the rhythmic buzz of clippers were absent.  An unnerving stillness hung heavy in the air.  Ames was alone, and the silence pressed in on her like a suffocating blanket.

The salon, tucked away on a side street in the heart of a bustling city, was a study in contradictions.  Bold, geometric patterns in muted pastels adorned the walls, a stark contrast to the faded floral wallpaper that covered the small, waiting area.  A single, wilting potted fern sat on a chipped mahogany table, its once vibrant leaves now a dull shade of brown, mirroring the atmosphere in the salon.  Outside, the urban cacophony of honking taxis and distant sirens seeped into the quiet room, a reminder of the vibrant life beyond these four walls.  Ames, with a practiced sigh, closed her eyes for a moment. The quiet was suffocating. Perhaps a new client would arrive. Perhaps a new appointment. Perhaps a new day.
