The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" retail store hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Butterfield's heels against the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air, mirroring the flurry of activity in Ameliaâ€™s mind.  She was on the clock, meticulously charting her sales quota for the day, each unanswered question and unmade sale a tiny, frustrating weight in her stomach.

From the gargantuan inflatable dinosaurs in the children's section to the meticulously-arranged artisanal cheese displays in the gourmet food hall, every item seemed to shout its own unique selling proposition.  A symphony of beeping alarms, the cheerful chatter of customers, and the grating, repetitive voice of the in-store promotional announcements, all conspired to create a soundtrack of relentless pressure.  Today, the pressure felt especially heavy.  Amelia, despite her years of experience, was still a novice at navigating this frenetic landscape.
