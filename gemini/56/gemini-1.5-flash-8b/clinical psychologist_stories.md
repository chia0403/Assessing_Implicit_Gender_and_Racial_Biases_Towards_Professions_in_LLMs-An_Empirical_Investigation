The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was a constant, almost imperceptible drone, a soundtrack to the quiet anxieties that swirled around her.  Rain hammered against the windowpane of her small, second-floor office, mimicking the rhythmic thudding of her own heart.  Outside, the grey October sky mirrored the bleakness of the afternoon.  This wasn't just any Tuesday; this was the Tuesday following the sudden, unexplained disappearance of her patient, Leo Rossi.

Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, sat hunched over her overflowing desk.  Stacks of files, each one a testament to someone's struggle, whispered secrets in the dim light.  Empty coffee cups and crumpled napkins littered the surface, evidence of countless late nights spent wrestling with the intricacies of the human psyche.  The chipped mug in front of her, with a faded image of a phoenix, was a recurring symbol, a reminder of the resilience she hoped her patients could find, a resilience she herself sometimes felt she lacked.  The city of Alderwood, nestled in the shadows of the Appalachian Mountains, offered little solace.  It felt suffocating, a dense blanket of grey clinging to everything, even the damp autumn air.  The quiet was punctuated only by the relentless drumming of the rain.
