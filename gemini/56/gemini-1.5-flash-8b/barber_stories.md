The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped linoleum floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Edge."  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, swirled in the faint air currents.  A comforting aroma of sandalwood and slightly burnt sugar hung heavy in the space, a testament to Barty's unique blend of barbershop balm and the occasional stray piece of burnt toast from his overly enthusiastic morning routine.  Barty, a man of fifty summers with a mop of unruly, iron-grey hair, leaned into the mirror, meticulously trimming the neatly sculpted beard of a customer.  The afternoon sun, already sinking below the horizon, painted the narrow street outside a hazy amber, casting a warm glow on the small, struggling business nestled between a bustling marketplace and a crumbling row of tenements.  This was 1898, and the hum of the city outside was a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of the shears, the only sounds in The Clipper's Edge besides the occasional contented sigh from a client.
