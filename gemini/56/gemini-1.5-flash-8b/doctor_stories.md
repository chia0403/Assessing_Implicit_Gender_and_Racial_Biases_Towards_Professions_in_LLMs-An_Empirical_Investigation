The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a discordant tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beep-boop-beep of the heart monitors. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her name etched in stark white on the nametag clipped to her crisp white coat, stared down at the young man sprawled on the gurney.  His chest rose and fell with ragged gasps, a frantic dance against the stillness of the room.  The smell of antiseptic and fear hung heavy in the air, a suffocating blend that clung to the sterile white walls and the polished metal of the instruments.  Outside, the city thrummed with a restless energy, oblivious to the silent drama unfolding within the sterile confines of St. Jude's Emergency.  Eleanor knew this was just another night.
