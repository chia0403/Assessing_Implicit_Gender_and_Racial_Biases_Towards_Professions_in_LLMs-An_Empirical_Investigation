The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped Amelia Blackwood's worn wool scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.

Twisted branches of ancient oaks, skeletal fingers clawing at the bruised sky, framed the imposing silhouette of the manor house, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the desolate landscape. Amelia, with hands calloused from years of coaxing life from stubborn soil, trudged along the icy path, the rhythmic crunch of frozen gravel her only companion.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds, obscuring the details of the overgrown flowerbeds she was tasked with tending.  Blackwood Manor, once a vibrant hub of activity and social graces, was now a mausoleum of muted hues and whispers of abandonment.  Amelia, the groundskeeper, was the only living vestige of its former glory, a silent sentinel on a fading stage.
