The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Every Tuesday, the same tired rhythm played out: scan, bag, smile, repeat.  The air, thick with the scent of stale pretzels and bargain-basement cleaning supplies, clung to her like a second skin.  This particular Tuesday was no different, save for the lingering smell of burnt popcorn, a telltale sign of another disastrous attempt at movie night by the perpetually hungry teenagers who frequented the store after school.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a faded floral print dress, stared at the barcode scanner, a faint frown etched between her brows.  Outside, the city bustled with a cacophony of sounds, but inside Super Saver Mart, it felt like the world had condensed into the muted thrum of the fluorescent lights and the rhythmic clank of shopping carts.
