The chipped paint of the classroom walls, a faded, pastel blend of lavender and mint, seemed to sigh with the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windowpanes of Miss Elara Nightingale's kindergarten classroom at the Blossom Brook Elementary School.  Crayon shavings, like tiny, rainbow confetti, littered the worn wooden floor.  A faint, comforting aroma of cinnamon and peanut butter, the remnants of snack time, hung heavy in the air.  Clockwise, from a corner, a single, tattered teddy bear, named Barnaby, watched the small, boisterous creatures in his world.

Elara Nightingale, with her perpetually tousled auburn hair and the gentle smile that seemed to melt the anxieties of the four-year-olds under her charge, straightened her posture.  She adjusted her favourite, slightly oversized, floral cardigan. Her meticulously planned lesson on the life cycle of a sunflower lay in tatters, the chaos of the afternoon having overtaken her expectations, as it invariably did.  A quiet whisper of giggling, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of little hands on the colourful felt board, served as a constant backdrop to her own internal quiet battle.  Today, the quiet was elusive, the energy levels were high, and the creative juices of the youngest students were bubbling, like a pot on a very high flame.
