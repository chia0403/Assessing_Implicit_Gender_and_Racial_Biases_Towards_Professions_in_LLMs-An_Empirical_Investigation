The flickering fluorescent lights of the small, windowless waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Blackwood’s pen on the worn leather of her desk.  Amelia, a counseling psychologist with a practice tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of a bustling metropolis, ran a hand through her already-dishevelled hair.  Outside, the city thrummed with life, oblivious to the quiet anxieties and unspoken burdens that often spilled into her office.  

Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the city lights into a shimmering, indistinct canvas.  The scent of stale coffee and old paper clung to the air, a familiar comfort and unwelcome companion.  Amelia’s office, bathed in the muted glow of the single overhead light, felt like a small, contained vessel in a vast ocean of chaos.  A single, worn armchair sat facing her desk, the worn fabric whispering tales of countless whispered confessions, tear-soaked apologies, and the quiet struggles of her clients.  Amelia knew the chair held the weight of unspoken words, of unspoken fears.  Today, the silence was heavy, a suffocating blanket pressing down on the air.
