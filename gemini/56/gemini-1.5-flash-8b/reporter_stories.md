Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Whispering Pines" motel, a symphony of rhythmic thuds that echoed the frantic drumming in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's ears.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the small, sparsely furnished office cast long, dancing shadows across the worn Formica table where she hunched, hunched over a half-eaten takeout sandwich and a stack of crumpled documents.  The town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, clung to a perpetual twilight, even during the briefest moments of sun.  Mist, thick and clinging, hung heavy in the air, shrouding the mountain peaks in an almost oppressive veil.  Amy, a seasoned reporter for the *Mountain Echo*,  a local weekly newspaper with a circulation thinner than the fog rolling off the creek, had come to Oakhaven seeking a story, a story that smelled as stale and musty as the air in the town. This wasn't her usual assignment, the usual interviews with local farmers, small town weddings, and community center fundraisers.  This was something...different.  Something unsettling.  Something potentially...dangerous.
