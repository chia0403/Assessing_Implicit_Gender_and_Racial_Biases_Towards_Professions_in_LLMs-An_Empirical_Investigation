The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint stubble that had stubbornly refused to disappear despite her best efforts.  The air, thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap cologne, and desperation, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit bar.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion echoing the hollow thrum of Amelia's thoughts.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, and the only other patrons were a trio of men huddled around a pool table, their whispers lost in the ceaseless downpour.  Amelia, a seasoned bartender with eyes that held the weariness of a thousand stories, meticulously wiped down the sticky bar top, her movements practiced and precise.  The Rusty Mug, a local institution tucked away on the fringes of the city, was her world, and tonight, it was a world of quiet contemplation.
