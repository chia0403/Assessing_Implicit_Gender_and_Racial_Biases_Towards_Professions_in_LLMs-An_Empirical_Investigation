The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Accounts & Accruals" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's relentless tapping.  Stacks of invoices, each a miniature mountain of numbers, loomed over her cluttered desk, their paper-sharp edges a constant reminder of the meticulous work ahead.

It was a Tuesday, a day like any other, in the heart of the grey, perpetually overcast city of Ashworth.

Elara, a bookkeeper with the precise movements of a trained dancer and the patience of a saint, meticulously entered debit and credit transactions into the groaning, ancient computer system.  Her fingers, long and nimble, danced across the keyboard, a quiet ballet of numbers.  Elara Nightingale, twenty-nine years old, was the keeper of the kingdom's financial soul, whether that kingdom was a small, struggling bakery or a bustling, multi-national corporation.  This Tuesday, however, was focused on the former â€“ a bakery that baked more than just bread, she knew.
