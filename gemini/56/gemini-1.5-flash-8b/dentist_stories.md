The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's cramped, downtown dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a stark counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia's instruments.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating a miniature metropolis of dental tools, patient charts, and half-eaten granola bars.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-five with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that had seen more fillings than a lifetime, hunched over the chair, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Her patient, a nervous young woman named Clara, fidgeted, her breath coming in shallow gasps.  The scent of antiseptic, coffee, and something vaguely floral hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that had become both comforting and suffocating in the last decade.  Outside, the relentless honking of city traffic blended with the muffled strains of a street musician's saxophone, a soundtrack to Amelia's quiet, persistent battles against decay.  The year was 2024.
