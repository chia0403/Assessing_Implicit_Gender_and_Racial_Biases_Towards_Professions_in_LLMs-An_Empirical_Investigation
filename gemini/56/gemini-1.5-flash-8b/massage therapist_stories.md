Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Tranquil Touch" massage parlour, a rhythmic drumming that seemed to vibrate through the wooden floorboards.  The scent of lavender and a hint of sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the stormy tempest outside.  Inside, bathed in the soft glow of a single, warm bulb, Amelia Nightingale, a massage therapist with eyes the colour of stormy seas, meticulously arranged the linen cloths on a massage table.  Her fingers, surprisingly delicate despite the calloused tips, moved with a practiced grace that belied the raw strength hidden beneath her calm exterior.  The small, dimly lit room, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling city of Newhaven, was her sanctuary, her haven from the relentless chaos of the outside world.  Tonight, a familiar tension hung in the air, a subtle vibration that mirrored the storm brewing just beyond the window.
