The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Crane's weathered face.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the flapping eaves of the Victorian mansion a precarious perch.  Rain, the colour of pewter, hammered against the slate roof, a relentless percussion that echoed in the hollow spaces of his skull.  Below, the cobbled street of Spitalfields, usually a vibrant tapestry of early evening London life, was swallowed by the deepening gloom.  Barty, thirty-seven years old and hardened by a life spent mending the skies over East London, felt a familiar knot of apprehension tightening in his stomach.  This job, this particular roof, was different.  Not just because of the treacherous incline, or the whisper of a draught emanating from the attic, but because of the unsettling presence of the house itself.  It seemed to watch, a silent, brooding entity, with every crumbling shingle and dripping gutter.  He gripped the rusted iron hook, his calloused hands slick with the remnants of the day's rain, and took a deep breath, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and the faintest trace of somethingâ€¦else. The great house, known as Blackwood Manor, loomed over the narrow street, its windows dark and impenetrable, like vacant eyes staring into the soul of the city.
