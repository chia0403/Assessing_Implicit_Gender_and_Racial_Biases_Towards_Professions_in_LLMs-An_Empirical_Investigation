The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the High Fells, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks and tugging at the frayed collar of her worn leather coat.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes of ochre and grey, danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the skeletal remains of a long-dead pine forest.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the faint scent of pine needles, a ghostly echo of a time when these mountains were green.  This was the heart of the Fells, a place where civilization ended and the wild began, a place where Amelia, a veterinarian with a heart as tough as the granite peaks, felt at home.  Her battered, four-wheel-drive Land Rover, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," was her only companion in this vast and unforgiving landscape.  Today, a distress call had led her here, to the remote homestead of the renowned (and notoriously reclusive) sheep farmer,  Barnaby Grimshaw.
