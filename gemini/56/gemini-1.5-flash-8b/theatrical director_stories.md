The air in the Grand Theatre hung thick with the scent of aged velvet and damp earth.  Rain hammered against the ornate glass roof, a relentless percussion echoing through the empty auditorium.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a figure hunched over a worn, leather-bound script.  This was  Aurelia Blackwood, Director of the Grand, her sharp eyes, usually alight with theatrical fire, clouded with a weariness that had settled over her like a shroud.  The grand hall, usually a symphony of preparation, laughter, and the clatter of costumes, was now a tomb of unspoken anxieties.  The upcoming production of "The Tempest" – a play Aurelia had poured her heart and soul into – was in jeopardy.  Not from a lack of talent, but from a deeper, insidious poison spreading through the company like a creeping vine: a pervasive fear. A fear that now threatened to strangle the very lifeblood of the production.  The rain outside seemed to mirror the storm raging within the theatre.
