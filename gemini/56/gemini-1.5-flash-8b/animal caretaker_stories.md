The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, windswept enclosure.  The biting March air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, stung her lungs, but Amelia, Animal Caretaker at Blackwood Manor, was used to it.  This was her domain, a haven of feathered and furry creatures within the sprawling, centuries-old estate.  Blackwood Manor, with its creaking timbers and echoing halls, had always been more than a stately home; it was a sanctuary for the unusual and the overlooked.  From the meticulously manicured topiary in the gardens to the secluded aviary holding endangered macaws, every corner of the estate held its own special secret, and Amelia, with her practiced eye, knew them all.  Today, however, a new secret, or perhaps a renewed worry, had taken root in her mind.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the Scottish Highlands.  The year is 1898.  The estate is steeped in history, shrouded in mist and legend, and home to a menagerie of animals, each with its own unique story. The Manor itself feels both grand and neglected, with vast, echoing halls, grand staircases draped in dust, and antique furniture scattered throughout.  The grounds are extensive, featuring winding paths bordered by ancient trees, secluded ponds, and secluded enclosures.  A constant, windswept chill permeates the air.
