The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet clicking of instruments and the soft, rhythmic rasp of Amelia’s ultrasonic scaler.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a practiced hand and a perpetually tired gaze, leaned over the patient’s chair.  The sterile white walls, usually a calming presence, felt oppressive today, reflecting the tension simmering beneath the surface of the waiting room. Outside, the city of New York thrummed with its usual chaotic energy, a stark contrast to the clinical serenity of the practice.

Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Iris Thorne, adjusted the suction tip.  Her gaze fell on the chipped porcelain of the patient’s front teeth, a testament to the relentless force of late-night bodega runs and lukewarm coffee.  This was just another Wednesday morning, another set of problems that were not only dental, but carried with them the unspoken narratives of their owners. The faded mural depicting a vibrant coral reef, a gift from a previous patient, barely held the attention of her now preoccupied mind.  The mural felt almost comical amidst the gritty reality of the lives mirrored in the chipped teeth before her.
