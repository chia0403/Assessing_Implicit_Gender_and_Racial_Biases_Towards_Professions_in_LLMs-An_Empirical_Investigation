The chipped porcelain sink of the "Grand Chateau" gleamed under the single, flickering fluorescent light.  Amelia Genevieve Dubois, concierge extraordinaire, adjusted her emerald green silk scarf, a stark contrast to the faded floral wallpaper surrounding her.  A faint scent of lavender and old books clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise sterile grandeur of the hotel lobby.  It was 2:17 AM, the quietest hour in the opulent establishment, and Amelia, despite her reputation for tireless efficiency, felt a prickle of unease.  This particular quiet hummed with an almost palpable tension, a silent anticipation that settled over the marble floors like a thick fog.  The ornate clock on the wall ticked away the seconds, each one a tiny hammer blow against the unsettling stillness.  Amelia, despite her twenty years of experience in the Grand Chateau, couldn't quite place the source of this particular dread.  The hotel, a historical landmark in the city of Veridia, often held its own silent stories, but this felt different.  It felt... waiting.
