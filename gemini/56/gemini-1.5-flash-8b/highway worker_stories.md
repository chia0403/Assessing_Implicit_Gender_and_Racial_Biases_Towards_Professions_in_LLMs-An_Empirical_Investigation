The pre-dawn chill, a greasy film on the cracked asphalt, clung to Elias Thorne, Highway Maintenance Specialist.  He shivered, not from the cold, but from the oppressive weight of the day ahead.  The sun, a pale disc just beginning its ascent, cast long, skeletal shadows across the I-95 median, highlighting the jagged edges of the crumbling concrete barrier.  This stretch of highway, a ribbon of worn asphalt snaking through the rust-colored hills of Appalachia, was his domain, his daily battleground against the relentless march of time and neglect.  

The setting was the early morning hours of a late September day in the mountainous region of West Virginia, nestled between the foothills and the looming presence of the Allegheny Mountains.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, carried the faint, almost imperceptible rumble of distant traffic.  Overhead, a lone hawk circled, a silent sentinel above the sprawling expanse of the highway.  Elias's worn Ford Ranger pickup truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Beast," sat parked beside a cluster of rusting utility boxes, a testament to its own hard-worn existence.
