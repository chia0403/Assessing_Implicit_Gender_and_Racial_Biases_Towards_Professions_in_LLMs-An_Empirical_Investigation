The fluorescent lights of the downtown law office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's day.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the rows of meticulously organized file cabinets that lined the walls of the sprawling, if slightly dated, office space.  Amy, a paralegal with a perpetually tired expression, meticulously filed a stack of documents, the rhythmic *thump* of the file folders echoing in the otherwise silent space.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of car horns and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost sterile, environment within.  It was a Tuesday, and the usual Monday-morning backlog of legal paperwork, as thick as a dense fog, seemed to have settled over her, and she was already feeling the familiar pressure mounting.  The small, almost imperceptible tremor that ran through the building, a low, rhythmic thrum, felt ominous.  It was a persistent, almost imperceptible, vibration. Amy knew it was more than just the building settling; the ground itself seemed to be pulsing, faintly but undeniably.
