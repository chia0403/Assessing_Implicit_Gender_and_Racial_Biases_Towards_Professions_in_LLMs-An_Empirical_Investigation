The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She huddled deeper into the worn, threadbare wool of her coat, the damp air seeping into her bones.  Rain lashed against the cobblestones of the Quays, turning the already murky water of the River Styx into a churning, grey chaos.  The scent of brine and decaying seaweed hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of the coastal city of Aethelgard.  Amelia, a struggling artist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hands perpetually stained with charcoal and paint, traced the silhouette of a gaunt seagull against the pewter sky.  Each gust of wind seemed to whisper tales of forgotten voyages and lost treasures, tales she yearned to capture on canvas, but the relentless weather threatened to erase her inspiration before it could take form.  The grand, gothic cathedral, with its spires piercing the gloom, loomed over the Quays like a skeletal sentinel, its stained-glass windows reflecting the raw, tempestuous light of the storm.
