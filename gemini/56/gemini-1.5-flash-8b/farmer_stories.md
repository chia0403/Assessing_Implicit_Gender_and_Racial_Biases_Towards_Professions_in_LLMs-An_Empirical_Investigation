The biting wind, a relentless rasp against the weathered clapboard of the barn, whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding Silas Blackwood's farm.  Dust devils danced across the parched, cracked earth, mimicking the tremor in Silas's own weary bones.  October had arrived, a cruel mistress, and the harvest, once promised, now felt like a distant, fading dream.  Silas, a man whose weathered hands had coaxed life from this unforgiving land for fifty years, stood hunched in the doorway of the barn, the fading light painting his face with long shadows.  The air, thick with the scent of hay and dried earth, carried the faint whimper of a lone, lost calf.  This was his final harvest, he knew it with the same certainty as the setting sun.  He felt the weight of his legacy, the burden of a life lived on the unforgiving slopes of the Allegheny Mountains, pressing down on him.  His name was Silas Blackwood, and the whispers of the wind seemed to carry his story with them.
