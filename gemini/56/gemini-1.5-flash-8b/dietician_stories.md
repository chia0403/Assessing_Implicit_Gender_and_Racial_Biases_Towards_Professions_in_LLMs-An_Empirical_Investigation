The antiseptic smell of bleach and freshly-cut grass hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the simmering frustration bubbling inside Amelia “Amy” Sterling.  Her meticulously organized office, a testament to her meticulous nature as a registered dietician, felt anything but calm.  Stacks of colourful charts, overflowing with nutritional information, and motivational quotes – ironically, none of which seemed to be working for her current client.  Seventeen-year-old Leo Davies was slumped in his chair, a hollow-eyed teenager with an almost imperceptible tremor in his hand, clutching a crumpled napkin.  Amy, a woman with an almost unnervingly calm demeanor that masked the decades of experience and countless hours spent dissecting the relationship between food and health, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest.  Leo's parents were present, their strained faces etched with worry, and their silence was as heavy as the thick humid air.

The setting:  a small, sun-drenched corner office nestled within a sprawling, ivy-covered building on the outskirts of the bustling city. Sunlight streamed through the large window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows that seemed to lengthen with each passing moment.  Outside, the vibrant colours of a local farmer's market, a place Amy often frequented for fresh produce, seemed a world away from the hushed tension within the room.  The humid summer air, laden with the scent of jasmine and decaying leaves, hung heavy, mimicking the stagnant emotions in the room.
