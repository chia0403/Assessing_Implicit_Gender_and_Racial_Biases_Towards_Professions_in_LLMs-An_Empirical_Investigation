The biting wind whipped Amelia Cavendish's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the abandoned foundry.  Rust-colored dust motes danced in the pale winter light filtering through the skeletal windows, illuminating the cavernous space that once echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammers and the hiss of molten metal.  This, Amelia Cavendish, architect extraordinaire, had envisioned as a revitalized urban oasis, a shimmering jewel of glass and steel rising from the industrial heart of the city.  Now, a decade after the project's collapse, the foundry stood as a stark monument to ambition and folly, a silent testament to a dream lost in the labyrinthine corridors of bureaucracy.  Amelia traced the outline of a broken pillar with her gloved hand, the rough stone a tangible counterpoint to the smooth lines of her blueprints.  The city, a chaotic tapestry of towering skyscrapers and narrow, winding streets, pressed against the foundry's perimeter.  Below, the murky waters of the River Tyne flowed, a sluggish current mirroring the stagnant air of disillusionment that seemed to hang heavy in the air, just as it did within Amelia herself.
