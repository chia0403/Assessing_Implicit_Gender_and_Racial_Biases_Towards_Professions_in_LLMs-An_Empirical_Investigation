The chipped paint of the "Artisan's Rest" sign, barely clinging to its weathered wood, seemed to mock the persistent rain drumming against the corrugated iron roof.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands calloused and strong, meticulously sanded a piece of reclaimed oak.

Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, its cries echoing the loneliness Elias felt tightening around him like a vise.  He was Elias Thorne, the carpenter of Copper Creek, a town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, a place where time seemed to crawl and secrets were as plentiful as the whispering pines.
