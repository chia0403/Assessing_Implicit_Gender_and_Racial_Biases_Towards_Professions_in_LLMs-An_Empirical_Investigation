The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the cobbled lane towards the "Sunstone Manor."  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the whisper of stories from the past, echoing through the ancient stone buildings that lined the narrow street.  Sunstone Manor, a sprawling gothic edifice with ivy-covered walls and a perpetually shadowed silhouette against the grey sky, seemed to hold its breath, waiting.  Amelia, her breath misting in the frosty air, felt a familiar knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach.

This was her third visit, and the tension hadn't lessened.  Her assignment: to assess the residents of Sunstone, a private rehabilitation facility catering to the physically and mentally challenged, in preparation for the upcoming accreditation review.  The residents, largely elderly individuals with complex needs, lived behind imposing, ornately carved oak doors.   The air itself seemed to pulse with a suppressed energy, the kind that clung to places that had witnessed more than their share of quiet struggles and unspoken fears.  Amelia, a seasoned occupational therapist with a master's degree from the esteemed University of Sterling, had a reputation for meticulously evaluating environments, but this place held a unique, unnerving charm.
