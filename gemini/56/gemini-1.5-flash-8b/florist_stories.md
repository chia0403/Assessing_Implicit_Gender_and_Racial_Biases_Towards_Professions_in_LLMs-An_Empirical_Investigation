The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of freshly cut roses.  Rain lashed against the glass of Amelia Nightingale's flower shop, "Bloom & Thistle," a tiny, sun-drenched haven tucked between a bustling bakery and a crumbling antique shop on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Oakhaven, a town where the whispers of centuries-old secrets clung to the ancient stone buildings like clinging ivy, pulsed with a quiet, almost spectral energy.  Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate shade of rose from a particularly vibrant bloom, meticulously arranged a bouquet of snowdrops, their fragile white petals catching the flickering gaslight.  Each stem, each blossom, held a story, a whisper of hope and sorrow.  For Amelia, a florist in the heart of Oakhaven, those stories were her language.
