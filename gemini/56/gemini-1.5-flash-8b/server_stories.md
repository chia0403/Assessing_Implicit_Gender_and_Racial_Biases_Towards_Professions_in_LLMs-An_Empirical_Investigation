The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Blackwood, who stood hunched over a sticky Formica table.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and something indefinably…musty.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind that always felt like a forgotten Wednesday.  A single, pathetically dim bulb above the door cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the weary souls huddled within.  This was Amelia's domain, this purgatory of lukewarm lattes and whispered complaints, and tonight, as always, she was the quiet observer, the silent custodian of the unspoken anxieties swirling around her.

The setting was the back room of The Rusty Mug, a dimly lit, corner establishment nestled on the quiet backstreets of Havenwood.  A town known more for its forgotten history than its vibrant present.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the worn vinyl booths and chipped Formica tables.  The faded posters on the walls advertised long-forgotten bands and obscure poetry slams, silent witnesses to a bygone era.  A constant hum of low conversation – mostly hushed complaints and the rhythmic clinking of cutlery – filled the space, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that Amelia was used to.
