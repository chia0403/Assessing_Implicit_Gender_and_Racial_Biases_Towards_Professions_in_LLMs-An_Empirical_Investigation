The biting wind, a razor-sharp, icy knife, sliced through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of the Blackwood Forest.  Rain, a relentless, pewter-colored curtain, lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated fire station, a rusted monument to forgotten glory.  Inside, Sergeant Elias Thorne, a man whose face was etched with the weariness of countless nights spent battling the forest's capricious fury, hunched over a chipped Formica table.  He stirred a steaming mug of instant coffee, the acrid scent mingling with the stale smell of damp wool blankets and the faint, persistent aroma of pine needles.  The flickering fluorescent light cast long, dancing shadows that mimicked the flames he'd so often confronted. Outside, the storm raged on, a symphony of wind and rain.  The station, nestled deep within the heart of Blackwood, felt a world away from the bustling city that lay just beyond the forest's edge.
