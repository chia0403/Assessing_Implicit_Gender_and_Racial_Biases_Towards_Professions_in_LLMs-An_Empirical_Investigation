The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Sunlight, fractured by the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clinging to the hillside, cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted forest floor.  Amelia, a photographer known for her ethereal portraits of nature's beauty, shivered, not just from the cold, but from a premonition of something amiss.  This secluded valley, usually a symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds, felt strangely silent, a hush that pressed down like a suffocating blanket.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds in the frigid air.  The valley was nestled deep within the heart of the Black Mountains, a region shrouded in myth and legend, and she was alone, miles from the nearest village.  Her tripod, heavy and steady, felt a familiar weight in her hands, a silent companion in this desolate landscape.  A glint of metal caught her eye, nestled amidst a collection of fallen leaves.  It was a small, ornate dagger, its hilt carved with intricate symbols that seemed to writhe and shift beneath the pale winter light.  Amelia's heart hammered against her ribs, a dissonant counterpoint to the silent forest.
