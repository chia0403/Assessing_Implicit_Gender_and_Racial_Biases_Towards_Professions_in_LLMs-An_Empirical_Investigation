The biting wind, a glacial breath from the peaks of the Chugach Mountains, whipped at Barnaby "Bar"  Hawkins's weathered parka.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the logging camp, a rusted silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and wet earth, also carried a faint, acrid tang of something metallic, a constant reminder of the perilous work that defined life in the Alaskan wilderness.  Bar, a man carved from the very wood he felled, hunched deeper into his worn-out sheepskin-lined chair, a mug of lukewarm coffee steaming before him.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of axes, punctuated by the groan of falling timber, was a hypnotic soundtrack to his solitude.  It had been a hard day, even by the unforgiving standards of the Alaskan winter.  The forest, a living, breathing beast, had been reluctant to yield its secrets, a silent testament to the strength and stubbornness of the Alaskan wilderness.
