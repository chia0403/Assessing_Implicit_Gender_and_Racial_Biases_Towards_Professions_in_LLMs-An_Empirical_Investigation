Rain hammered against the grimy, soot-stained windows of the probation office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Blackwood’s head.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, a sterile counterpoint to the muted despair clinging to the air.  She traced the chipped paint on the Formica desk, her fingers a blur of nervous energy.  Outside, the city of Ashendale, choked by industrial smog and whispered secrets, was swallowed by the storm. Amelia, a probation officer with three years under her belt and a weariness etched into her features, stared at the case file in front of her.  It read:  "Darius Thorne – Violation of Probation, Article 12."


The setting was the probation office of Ashendale, a sprawling, grey metropolis nestled in the industrial heartland.  Buildings clawed at the overcast sky, their façades scarred by time and neglect.  The air, thick with the smell of coal smoke and damp earth, hung heavy in the city. The office, situated on the third floor of a crumbling building downtown, was small and sterile, a stark contrast to the chaotic, often violent world Amelia navigated on a daily basis.  The cramped space, with its worn furniture and dim lighting, held a palpable sense of confinement, reflecting the oppressive atmosphere of the city itself.
