The fluorescent hum of the salon, a symphony of buzzing clippers and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears, filled Amelia Genevieve Blackwood’s ears.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered light, illuminating the polished chrome of the sinks and the myriad shades of hairspray clinging to the air.  It was a Tuesday, a slow Tuesday, and Amelia, perched on a stool in her small, but impeccably organized, salon, “The Gilded Curl,” felt the familiar weight of quiet settle over her like a fine mist.  Her small, quiet salon, nestled in the heart of the bustling city’s historic district, was a haven of gentle whispers and the occasional, enthusiastic sigh of a satisfied client.  Outside, the city roared with life, but within the four walls of the Gilded Curl, time seemed to slow, allowing for a moment of reflection, a moment of quiet contemplation before the next appointment, or another wave of the city's restless energy washing in.
