The chill of the early November morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's bones as he pushed open the heavy oak door of "Butterfield's Bloody Butcher Shop."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a scene straight out of a forgotten nightmare.  The air, thick with the cloying smell of aged blood and rosemary, hung heavy, clinging to the chipped porcelain sink and the glistening, crimson-stained butcher block.  Barty, a man whose face had been weathered into a perpetual mask of grim determination, adjusted the worn leather apron cinched tight around his waist.  He surveyed the shop, his eyes scanning the rows of gleaming carcasses â€“ a prize-winning boar, a plump lamb, a brace of defiant-looking geese.

The setting was a small, independent butcher shop, tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the heart of a forgotten quarter of the sprawling city of Aethelgard.  Narrow, shadowed alleys snaked off the main thoroughfare, their alleyways choked with a tangle of overflowing flowerpots and overflowing bins.  The air, though cold, held a faint, sweet scent of nearby orchards.  The city, though vibrant and bustling in its larger districts, felt a world away from the stillness of this backwater.  The butcher shop itself, while functional, carried a layer of melancholy, a testament to its owner's unwavering dedication and, perhaps, a lingering sense of quiet desperation.
