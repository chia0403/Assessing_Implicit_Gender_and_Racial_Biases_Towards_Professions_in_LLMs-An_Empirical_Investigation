The fluorescent hum of the high school hallway, a relentless, buzzing soundtrack to teenage angst, pressed in on Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The scent of stale coffee, disinfectant, and something vaguely floral, perhaps desperation, clung to the air.  Each chipped tile underfoot seemed to vibrate with unspoken anxieties, the kind that manifested as whispered arguments in hallways and slumped shoulders in study carrels.  She was a school psychologist, and this was her battlefield, a landscape of burgeoning emotions, fleeting friendships, and burgeoning futures, all crammed into the grey concrete shell of Northwood High.  The chipped paint on the door to Room 206, emblazoned with a faded "Counseling" sign, promised a more subdued, quieter scene.  Perhaps a respite.  Perhaps not.
