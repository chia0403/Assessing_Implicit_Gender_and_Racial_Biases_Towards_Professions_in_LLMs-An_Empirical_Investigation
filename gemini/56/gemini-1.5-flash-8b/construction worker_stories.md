The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's hard hat, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the frayed edges of his thermal scarf.  He squinted, peering through the swirling snow that had transformed the construction site into a featureless white landscape.  The skeletal framework of the new "Apex Tower," a gleaming monument to ambition, stood stark and vulnerable against the grey sky.  It was mid-December, and the biting cold, amplified by the wind whistling through the exposed steel girders, was a constant, relentless companion.

He’d worked on this project since the groundbreaking ceremony, seeing the steel frame gradually rise from the frozen earth, witnessing the ambition of the architects and the sweat of the laborers.  This was the final stage, the last piece in the puzzle.  But a peculiar tremor in the air, a subtle shift in the weight of the surrounding snow, unnerved him.  It felt…wrong.  As if something was lurking beneath the surface of the pristine, icy world.
