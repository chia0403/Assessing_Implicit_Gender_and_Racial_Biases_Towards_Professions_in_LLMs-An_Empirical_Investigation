The chipped porcelain sink in the ladies' restroom of the Carnegie Library hummed faintly, a low thrumming that resonated with the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Peabody's heels against the worn linoleum floor.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent light, danced in the air around her.  Amelia, a librarian at the sprawling, century-old institution for the past fifteen years, hated the sound.  It felt like the library itself, a monument to quiet contemplation and hushed whispers, was trying to tell her something, something she wasn't quite ready to hear.

The library, a magnificent Beaux-Arts structure, dominated the city skyline with its towering fa√ßade of cream-colored stone and intricate carvings.  Inside, sunlight struggled to pierce the thick layers of dust motes and the myriad of bookcases that snaked through the vast, echoing halls.  The scent of aged paper and leather, a subtle perfume only librarians seemed to notice, clung to the air.  Rows of towering bookshelves, lined with volumes dating back centuries, stretched endlessly in all directions.  Today, however, Amelia felt a peculiar stillness, a feeling of impending change that had settled over the library like a dense fog.  The air, usually thick with the whispers of turning pages and the rustling of turning leaves, felt strangely hushed.  Amelia's heart thumped against her ribs, a counterpoint to the low thrumming of the sink.
