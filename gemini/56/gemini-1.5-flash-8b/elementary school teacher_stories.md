The chipped paint of the "Miss Abigail Carter, 3rd Grade Wonders" classroom door, a faded shade of turquoise, seemed to sigh with the humid air of the Mississippi Delta summer.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a chaotic landscape of construction paper animals, crayon drawings of fantastical creatures, and stacks of meticulously organized, yet slightly battered, reading books.  This was Miss Abigail Carter's domain, a microcosm of creativity and contained chaos where the sounds of children's laughter, whispered secrets, and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the nearby air conditioner formed an almost soothing symphony.  Miss Abigail, a woman with a smile that could melt glaciers and eyes that held the wisdom of centuries, surveyed her charges.  Today, though, a hush had fallen over the usual boisterous energy.  Something was different. Something feltâ€¦ wrong.
