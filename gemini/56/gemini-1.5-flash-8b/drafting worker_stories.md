The humid air hung thick and heavy in the drafting room, a miasma of stale coffee, graphite dust, and the faint, metallic tang of the freshly sharpened pencils.  Sunlight, filtered through grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the meticulously ordered tables.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker with hands calloused from years of wielding a French curve and a T-square, meticulously traced the blueprint of a new wing of the Grand Cathedral of St. Alaric.  The intricate lines, representing soaring arches and intricate stained-glass windows, danced under his steady hand, a silent symphony of design.  The faint whir of a nearby air conditioner was the only sound that broke the quiet concentration, punctuated occasionally by the rhythmic *thwack* of a ruler hitting a drawing board.  Elias was a man of few words, his world contained within the precise confines of his drafting table, his life a meticulous tapestry woven from lines and angles.
