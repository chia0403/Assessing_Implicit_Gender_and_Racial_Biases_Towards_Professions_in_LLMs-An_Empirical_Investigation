The flickering neon sign of the "Cosmic Connection" crackled, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Inside, Amelia "Anya"  Seraphina Takahashi, her brow furrowed in concentration, hunched over a tangle of wires and circuit boards.  The air thrummed with a low, buzzing hum, a symphony of static and faint, crackling voices that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the dusty, cluttered workshop.  Anya, a radio technician with fingers as nimble as spiders' legs, was trying to coax a signal from a battered, antique receiver â€“ one rumored to have once belonged to a celebrated, but now forgotten, interstellar communicator.  The faint hope of picking up a lost transmission, a whisper across the galaxy, pulsed through her veins.  Neo-Kyoto, a city built on the ruins of ancient temples and skyscrapers that pierced the clouds, was a place where the boundaries between the seen and unseen were constantly blurred. The rain, a relentless curtain against the glass windows, mirrored the relentless pressure Anya felt to unlock the secrets within the old receiver. Her single, unlit neon sign, a miniature reflection of the city's garish glow, was the only hint of her presence in this sea of metallic and weathered concrete.
