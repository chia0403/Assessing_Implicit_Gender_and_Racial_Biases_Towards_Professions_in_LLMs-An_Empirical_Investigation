The flickering neon sign of "The Leaky Faucet" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Market Square.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the dripping pipe that had been plaguing Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, master plumber, for the past three hours.  Barty, a man whose brow perpetually housed a collection of tiny beads of sweat, wrestled with the stubborn leak beneath a towering, ancient oak tree, its gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers towards the tempestuous sky.  He swore under his breath, a guttural sound lost in the downpour, as a particularly forceful gust of wind rattled the rickety wooden scaffolding heâ€™d erected.  He was already late for the crucial meeting with Mrs. Periwinkle, a client whose demands were legendary in the town of Oakhaven.  And the leak was refusing to yield.  This old oak, with its cryptic history whispered by the townsfolk, seemed to be the source of all his trouble tonight.  He adjusted his worn leather apron, the cool dampness soaking into his thick, already-perspiring cotton shirt.  This wasn't just a plumbing problem; it felt like a battle against the very elements.
