The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny garage tucked between a bakery overflowing with the sweet scent of croissants and a dilapidated antique shop smelling faintly of mothballs.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by grime-coated windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused, spoke volumes about a life spent wrestling with metal and machinery.  Barty, with his perpetually smudged face and a mischievous glint in his eye, was the self-proclaimed king of the rusted and broken.  Today, however, the usual symphony of clanking metal and muttered curses was replaced by a heavy silence.  A beat-up, crimson sports car, nicknamed "The Scarlet Siren" by a previous owner, sat nestled between a sputtering lawnmower and a collection of forgotten bicycles, its engine cover hissing faintly.  Barty traced a finger along the chipped paint, a frown etching itself onto his brow.  The Siren was acting up again, and Barty, despite the stillness in the garage, felt the familiar pressure of a looming deadline tighten around his chest.
