The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague shimmered under a bruised twilight sky, the silhouette of Prague Castle looming dark against the horizon.  Above, the ancient ramparts of the Old Town, battered by centuries of storms and whispers, seemed to press in, almost suffocating her with their silent history.  Sparrow, a self-proclaimed “whisperer of stones,” adjusted her backpack, a worn leather affair filled with maps, brochures, and a half-eaten bag of hardtack. This was her favourite time, the hour before the city settled into its nightly slumber, the hour when the ghosts of Prague, she believed, stirred most restlessly. Tonight, she was leading a small group of American tourists on a “Secrets of the Night” tour, an unofficial venture she ran in addition to her day job as a historical museum curator.  The unspoken rule amongst her regular clientele was that the less they knew of her alternative vocation, the more enthralled they’d be by the stories she spun.

The setting: Prague, Czech Republic, 2024.  A crisp autumn evening, just before the first hints of winter.  The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts, a familiar aroma that intertwined with the ancient stone of the city, its history and mystery.   The tour began at the Old Town Square, a bustling hub of activity during the day, now slowly emptying into the silent streets, preparing for a night of quiet contemplation.  Sparrow’s target audience were those travelers who sought more than the glossy brochures and standardized sightseeing routes offered by the major tour operators.  Her tour promised something tangible, something more than mere spectacle, something… whisper-worthy.
