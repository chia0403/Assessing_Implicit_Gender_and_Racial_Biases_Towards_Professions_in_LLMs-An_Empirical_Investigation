The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face as she adjusted the collar of her thick wool coat.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the path to Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  A thin, almost translucent, layer of ice coated the cracked pavement, reflecting the streetlights in fractured shards.  The air, sharp and frigid, carried the scent of pine and something faintly metallic, a smell that clung to the hushed, almost spectral quiet of the small town nestled amongst the foothills.  Amelia, a physical therapist with five years of experience, pulled her worn, but trusted, waterproof notebook from her bag.  Inside, detailed sketches of muscle groups and exercise protocols mingled with scribbled notes about patient progress, her usual companions on these solitary walks.  Tonight, however, her thoughts strayed.  Something was off. Not just the unusual chill, or the disconcerting quiet, but something deeper, something humming beneath the surface, a subtle tension in the very fabric of the town. This quiet wasn't peaceful; it was expectant.
