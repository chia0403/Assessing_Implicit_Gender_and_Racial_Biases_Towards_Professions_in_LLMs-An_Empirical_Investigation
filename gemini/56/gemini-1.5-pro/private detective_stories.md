Rain lashed against the grime-streaked window of Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head.  Neon light from the Lucky Dragon Chinese takeaway across the street painted lurid stripes across the peeling wallpaper, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Her office, sandwiched between a bail bondsman and an all-night laundromat in the less-than-salubrious Tenderloin district of San Francisco, wasn't much, but it was hers.  The year was 1948, and the post-war boom hadn't quite trickled down to this forgotten corner of the city, leaving it steeped in a melancholic blend of fog, shadows, and the faint scent of desperation. Izzy, chin propped on a fist, stared at the overflowing ashtray on her desk, the half-smoked cigarette dangling from her lips forgotten.  The case file lay open before her: the disappearance of a jazz singer named Ruby Valentine.  It was the kind of case that usually landed on her doorstep â€“ messy, complicated, and reeking of trouble.  But this one felt different.  This one felt personal.
