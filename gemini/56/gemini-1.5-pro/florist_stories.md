The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elsie Amelia Hawthorne's shears.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, Vermont, shimmered under a fresh coat of October snow.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine and woodsmoke, seeped in through the cracks around the aged wooden door frame. Inside, the small shop was a riot of color and fragrance, a vibrant refuge against the encroaching winter.  Buckets overflowing with ruby red roses, saffron-hued lilies, and deep violet irises lined the walls, their perfume mingling with the earthy scent of potting soil and the sweet, spicy aroma of cinnamon sticks Elsie kept simmering on a small electric burner.  Elsie, with her hands dusted with pollen and a stray curl of fiery red hair escaping her braid, hummed along to the Billie Holiday record playing softly on the gramophone.  She was crafting a particularly intricate arrangement of white orchids and eucalyptus, her brow furrowed in concentration, oblivious to the new arrival.
