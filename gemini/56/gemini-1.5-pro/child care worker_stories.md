The air in the Bumblebrook Daycare center buzzed with the chaotic symphony of toddlerhood.  Tiny hands slapped paint onto butcher paper taped to the low tables, creating abstract masterpieces that would undoubtedly end up adorning refrigerator doors across the city.  The shrieks of delighted laughter mingled with frustrated wails, the constant background music to Amelia "Amy" Rose Peterson's day.  Sunlight streamed through the large, west-facing windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the brightly colored alphabet rug.  Amy, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, crouched beside four-year-old Leo, patiently guiding his chubby fingers as he struggled to zip up his bright red puffer jacket.  Outside, the first fat snowflakes of the season began to drift lazily to the ground, hinting at the long winter ahead and the inevitable flurry of indoor activities that would accompany it. Bumblebrook, nestled in the heart of a quiet, residential neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, was Amy's haven, a place where finger-paint and playground squabbles reigned supreme.  Little did she know, the tranquility of this familiar world was about to be shattered.
