The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, creating a chemical cocktail that only someone truly devoted to the art of beautification could appreciate. This was Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's domain: "Shear Radiance," a cozy, yet decidedly upscale salon nestled amongst the antique shops and artisanal bakeries lining Elm Street in the quaint, coastal town of Seabrook, New Hampshire.  October had arrived, painting the maples outside in fiery hues of orange and crimson, and the crisp air hinted at the approaching winter.  Gen, a woman whose own auburn hair was always impeccably styled in a sleek bob, glanced at the antique clock above the reception desk.  2:57 PM.  Mrs. Henderson, notorious for her exacting standards regarding her weekly blue rinse, was three minutes early.  Gen sighed, smoothed down her apron embroidered with a pair of silver scissors, and plastered a welcoming smile on her face. This was going to be a long afternoon.
