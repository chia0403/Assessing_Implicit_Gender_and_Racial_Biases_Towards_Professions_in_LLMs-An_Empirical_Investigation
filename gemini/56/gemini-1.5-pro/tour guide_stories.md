The air, thick with the scent of plumeria and salt spray, clung to Amelia "Millie" Reyes like a damp embrace.  She stood on the crumbling ramparts of Castillo San Felipe del Morro, the 16th-century fortress looming over Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Below, the turquoise Caribbean crashed against the ancient walls, sending plumes of white foam skyward.  It was a picture-perfect postcard scene, one Millie had described countless times to the wide-eyed tourists under her care.  This particular Tuesday morning, however, the familiar beauty held a tremor of unease for her.  The sky, usually a vibrant, cheerful blue, was overcast, a bruised purple hinting at the approaching hurricane season.  And the normally boisterous laughter of the tour group she was supposed to be leading was conspicuously absent.  Millie checked her watch, a chipped silver heirloom from her grandmother.  They were twenty minutes late.
