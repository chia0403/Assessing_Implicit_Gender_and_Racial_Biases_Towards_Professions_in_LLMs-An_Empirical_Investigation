The brass fixtures of the Grand Majestic Hotel glittered under the oppressive Charleston summer sun.  Humidity hung thick in the air, clinging to the starched white uniform of Elias Finch, whose name tag, pinned precariously to his lapel, threatened to succumb to gravity with every bead of sweat that trickled down his spine. The revolving doors whirled constantly, disgorging a steady stream of guests â€“ sun-kissed vacationers, perspiring businessmen, and the occasional aloof celebrity, all seeking refuge in the opulent, air-conditioned embrace of the hotel.  Elias, barely seventeen and with a frame too slight for the oversized luggage trolley he wrestled with, plastered a professional smile on his face.  He knew the routine:  a swift greeting, a practiced charm, a hefty tip.  But today, the air crackled with something more than just heat and humidity. A subtle unease, a whisper of the unusual, clung to the marble floors and ornate chandeliers, promising that this particular Tuesday at the Grand Majestic would be anything but ordinary.
