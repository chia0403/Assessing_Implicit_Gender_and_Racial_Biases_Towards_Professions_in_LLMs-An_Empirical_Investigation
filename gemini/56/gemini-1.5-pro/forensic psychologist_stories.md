Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his temples.  The gothic revival architecture of the Grimshaw Institute, a sprawling mental health facility nestled in the fog-wreathed hills of the Peak District, usually soothed him. Tonight, however, the gargoyles perched on the roofline seemed less like protectors and more like silent, judging witnesses. A single lamp illuminated the mahogany desk, casting long shadows across the room and highlighting the swirling grey mist clinging to the windowpanes. Elias, his dark hair still damp from the downpour, rubbed his tired eyes and stared at the file in front of him.  Inside, the mugshot of Bethany Clement stared back, her eyes wide and vacant, a chilling counterpoint to the rain's fury.  The accompanying police report detailed a series of bizarre, ritualistic murders in the nearby village of Hollow Creek, and Elias, the Institute's leading forensic psychologist, had been called in to unravel the mind of the woman suspected of committing them.
