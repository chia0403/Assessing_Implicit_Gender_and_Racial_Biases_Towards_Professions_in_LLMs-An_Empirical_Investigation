The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she perched precariously on the ladder, three stories up.  Flames licked at the night sky, painting the Victorian facade of the old Hawthorne House in flickering orange and demonic black.  Embers, like angry fireflies, danced on the wind, threatening the neighboring buildings in the tightly packed row of historic homes that lined Sycamore Street in the heart of Ashwood, Pennsylvania.  Below, the shouts of her fellow firefighters mingled with the guttural roar of the inferno and the shriek of the wind, creating a chaotic symphony only they could truly understand.  Mia adjusted her helmet, the icy air stinging her cheeks.  She could feel the heat on her face, a dry, baking heat that promised a long, grueling night.  The Hawthorne House, once a grand symbol of the town's prosperity, was quickly becoming a fiery tomb. And someone, according to the frantic 911 call, was still inside.
