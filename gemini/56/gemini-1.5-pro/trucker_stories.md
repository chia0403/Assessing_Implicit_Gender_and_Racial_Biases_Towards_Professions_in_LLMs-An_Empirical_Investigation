The biting Nevada wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Flying J truck stop, stinging Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's eyes as she wrestled the fuel nozzle into her rig's tank.  Her Peterbilt 389, christened "The Wanderer" by her late father, grumbled a low, guttural complaint as it idled, its chrome gleaming under the sodium-vapor lights.  Amy, clad in worn jeans, a faded Springsteen tee, and a thick fleece-lined jacket, ignored both the wind and the truck's protest.  It was nearing 2 AM, the sky a bruised purple canvas dotted with indifferent stars, and the only other signs of life were a couple of other long-haul rigs and a lone, flickering neon sign advertising lukewarm coffee and questionable showers.  Amy had a delivery of avocados bound for Chicago, and a thousand miles of blacktop stretching out before her like a concrete river, flowing towards the rising sun.  This was her life, a life on the road, inherited from her father and embraced with a mixture of fierce independence and quiet resignation.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A prickling unease, like the static charge before a desert storm, hung in the air.
