The rain hammered against the arched windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's attic apartment, a relentless rhythm mirroring the frantic tap-tap-tapping of her fingers against the worn keys of her laptop.  Crimson and gold leaves, torn from the ancient oak outside, plastered themselves against the glass like desperate supplicants. Her apartment, nestled under the eaves of a grand, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house on the edge of Hollow Creek, Vermont, usually offered a tranquil escape from the clamor of the city she'd left behind.  Tonight, however, the storm seemed to be conspiring with the blinking cursor on her screen, both mocking the emptiness of the document she was supposed to be filling with witty, insightful prose for the autumn issue of "Rustic Charm" magazine.  A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm oatmeal sat forgotten on her desk, a testament to the hours Amelia had spent staring at the blinking cursor, her normally sharp editorial eye clouded by a crippling writerâ€™s block.  Hollow Creek, with its quaint charm and vibrant fall foliage, was supposed to be her muse. Instead, it was starting to feel like a beautifully decorated prison.
