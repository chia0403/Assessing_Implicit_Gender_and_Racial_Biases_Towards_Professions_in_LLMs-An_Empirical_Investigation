Rain lashed against the window of "Flights of Fancy" travel agency, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's fingers on her keyboard.  The quaint, book-lined office, usually redolent with the alluring scent of faraway lands – coconut oil and Moroccan spices – today smelled only of damp wool and Amelia's lukewarm chamomile tea. Nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Bath, England, the agency felt a million miles away from the sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains plastered across its walls.  Outside, the typically bustling tourist crowds were huddled beneath dripping awnings, their colourful rain jackets a stark contrast to the grey skies above.  Amelia sighed, the glow of her computer screen reflecting in her tired eyes. Another cancelled flight, another disappointed client, another Thursday.
