The crisp October air nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry. The setting sun painted the brick buildings of Harmony Creek, Indiana, in hues of orange and crimson.  Harmony Creek, a town where everyone knew everyone, and secrets whispered on the wind like fallen leaves, wasn't exactly known for its excitement. Elias, however, found comfort in its predictable rhythm.  He adjusted his tweed jacket, the chill seeping through the wool, and glanced at the clock tower above the town hall.  5:15 pm. Time for his usual Wednesday evening ritual: a solitary walk along the creek before heading home to his empty Victorian house on Sycamore Lane. Tonight, however, something felt different. A faint unease, like a cavity subtly throbbing beneath the surface, gnawed at him. He couldn't quite place it, but the familiar comfort of Harmony Creek feltâ€¦ brittle.  Like it could shatter at any moment.
