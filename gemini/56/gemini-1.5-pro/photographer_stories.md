The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face, the fine mist clinging to the lenses of her vintage Rolleiflex.  The Isle of Skye, a jagged claw of volcanic rock reaching out into the churning slate-grey waters of the Hebrides, was a photographer's dream, and Amy, despite the biting wind that threatened to rip her tripod from its precarious perch on the cliff edge, was in her element.  Below her, the Old Man of Storr, a jagged pinnacle of basalt, pierced the swirling fog like a forgotten god.  The air vibrated with the cries of unseen gulls, their mournful calls echoing across the desolate landscape. Amy, bundled in a thick Aran sweater and a battered waxed jacket, adjusted her camera, the familiar click and whir of the film advance a comforting rhythm in the vast emptiness. This was why she'd come â€“ to capture the raw, untamed beauty of a place untouched by time, a place where the earth still whispered ancient secrets.
