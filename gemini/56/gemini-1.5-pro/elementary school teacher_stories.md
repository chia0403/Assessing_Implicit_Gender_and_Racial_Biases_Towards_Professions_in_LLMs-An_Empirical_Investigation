The insistent chirp of a robin, perched precariously on the window ledge, pulled Amelia Grace Holloway from the depths of grading fourth-grade spelling tests.  Rain hammered against the glass panes, a relentless soundtrack to the grey afternoon.  Outside, the playground of Maplewood Elementary, usually a riot of colour and shrieks, lay deserted.  Swirls of muddy water pooled in the dips of the worn grass, and the bright yellow slide glistened under the deluge.  Amelia sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose.  The scent of damp wool from the children's forgotten jackets, hanging on hooks by the door, mingled with the faint, sweet aroma of the apple sheâ€™d eaten at lunch.  It was Friday, and even the usual end-of-week buzz seemed subdued by the oppressive weather. Little did Amelia know, the storm brewing outside was nothing compared to the one about to erupt within the walls of Maplewood Elementary.
