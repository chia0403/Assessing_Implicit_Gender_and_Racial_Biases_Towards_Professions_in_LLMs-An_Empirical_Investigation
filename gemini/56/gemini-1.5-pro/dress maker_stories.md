The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against cobblestones was a constant rhythm outside the frosted window of Mademoiselle Elodie Beaumont's atelier.  A faint scent of woodsmoke, mingled with the sharper tang of the Seine, drifted in through the slightly warped pane, hinting at the approaching Parisian winter.  Elodie, perched on a velvet-upholstered stool, her needle flashing in the gaslight, meticulously stitched a pearl onto the bodice of a silk evening gown the colour of a summer sky.  Her workroom, nestled above a bustling boulangerie on the Rue de Rivoli, was a haven of organized chaos.  Swatches of fabric in every imaginable hue draped over chairs and mannequins, while intricate paper patterns lay scattered across the worn wooden worktable.  Pins, needles, and spools of thread, like miniature soldiers, stood at attention in neatly arranged boxes.  It was 1888, a time of burgeoning opulence in Paris, and Elodie Beaumont, with her exceptional talent and unwavering dedication, was on the cusp of becoming one of the city's most sought-after dressmakers.  However, the delicate balance of her world was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
