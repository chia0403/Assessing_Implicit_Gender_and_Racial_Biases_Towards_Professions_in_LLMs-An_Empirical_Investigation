The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she leaned against a lamppost, the cold seeping through her threadbare coat.  Neon signs flickered erratically above the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, casting a lurid, artificial glow over the scene.  This once-thriving fishing town, nestled on the rugged Oregon coast, now wore an air of faded grandeur and quiet desperation.  Empty storefronts lined Main Street, their dusty windows displaying faded "For Lease" signs. The only businesses seemingly immune to the town's decline were the Mermaid's Kiss, a dimly lit tavern whose patrons spilled out onto the sidewalk in boisterous bursts, and the Bait & Tackle shop across the street, its solitary occupant casting a wary eye at Amy from beneath the brim of a faded baseball cap.  Amy, a reporter for the struggling Port Blossom Gazette, shivered and pulled her notebook from her pocket, the brittle pages crinkling in the damp. She was waiting. Waiting for a story, any story, that could breathe life back into her dying town, and perhaps, her own sputtering career.
