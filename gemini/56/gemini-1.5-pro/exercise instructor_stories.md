The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Sweat slicked the brightly coloured tiles beneath Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's feet as she adjusted the microphone headset.  The eighty-degree heat, normally a deterrent for most, was her bread and butter.  Every morning at 7 am sharp, Amy transformed the beachfront patio of the opulent  "Solara Suites" hotel into her open-air fitness studio. This morning, however, a tension hung in the air thicker than the humidity.  Amy could feel it in the stiff smiles of the hotel staff, in the hushed whispers amongst the usually boisterous early-morning joggers, and even in the rhythmic crash of the waves â€“ usually a soothing soundtrack, today it felt like a drumbeat heralding a storm.  Something was off.
