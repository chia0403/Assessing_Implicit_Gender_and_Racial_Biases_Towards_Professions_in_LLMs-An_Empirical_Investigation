The biting November wind whipped off the Seine, plastering Aurelia Vivienne Dupres's auburn curls to her cheeks, already rosy from the cold.  Paris, in her grey winter coat, was a different beast than the sun-drenched city of summer. The tourists had thinned, leaving the cobbled streets to the locals and the truly dedicated. Aurelia, bundled in a thick scarf and fingerless gloves, huddled deeper into her worn wool coat, her gaze fixed on the Pont Neuf. The bridge, usually bustling with activity, was subdued this morning, the only movement the rhythmic sway of the lampposts in the wind and the occasional hurried pedestrian.  Her easel, propped against a stone wall, rattled precariously. Aureliaâ€™s breath puffed out in white clouds as she adjusted the canvas, a blank expanse primed for the scene before her.  She was determined to capture the essence of this particular grey, the way it muted the vibrant colours of the buildings lining the river and softened the harsh lines of the city, revealing a quiet, melancholic beauty.  This was her Paris, the Paris she loved, the Paris that whispered secrets to her brush.
