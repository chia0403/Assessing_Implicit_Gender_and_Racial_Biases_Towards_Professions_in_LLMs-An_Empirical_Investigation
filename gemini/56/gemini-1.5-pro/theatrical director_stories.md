The damp, clinging air of a late October evening in Prague settled onto Elias Thorne like a shroud.  He stood on the Charles Bridge, the gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral looming above him like skeletal fingers against a bruised twilight sky.

He was in Prague to direct a reimagining of  "Faust" in the ancient Estates Theatre, a venue steeped in theatrical history, and yet a premonition of something unsettling, something beyond the usual opening night jitters, gnawed at the edges of his mind. The weight of expectation, the whispers of the theatre's past, and the unsettlingly familiar glint in the eyes of the lead actor, a man named Karel Dvorak, were coalescing into a disharmony that threatened to unravel his carefully constructed production before it even began.
