The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Ashworth Estate, tugging at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's thick braid and sending fallen oak leaves swirling around her steel-toed boots.  Frost crunched beneath her feet, a stark contrast to the vibrant emerald green of the winter rye she'd sown just weeks before.  Here, in the heart of Connecticut’s Litchfield County, autumn’s fiery spectacle had faded, leaving behind a skeletal beauty that only hinted at the lush tapestry that would emerge in spring. Mia, bundled in a worn Carhartt jacket and fingerless gloves, surveyed her handiwork with a practiced eye.  This estate, with its rolling hills, ancient stone walls, and meticulously planned gardens, was her canvas, and even in the grip of approaching winter, it held a quiet majesty she found both humbling and inspiring.  Today's task was less glamorous than designing intricate floral displays or coaxing rare orchids to bloom; today, Mia was wrestling with the estate's stubborn irrigation system, preparing it for the long, frozen months ahead. The air smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar perfume that both soothed and invigorated her. But beneath the familiar scents, a subtle, unsettling aroma of woodsmoke hung in the air, drifting from somewhere beyond the manicured grounds, a discordant note in the otherwise serene symphony of the estate.
