The pre-dawn sky over Minneapolis was the colour of a bruised plum, streaked with thin, icy clouds. A biting wind whipped across the Mississippi, rattling the scaffolding around the skeletal frame of the Hennepin County Courthouse annex.  Thirty-four-year-old  Rosalind “Rosie” Maria Diaz stamped her feet, trying to coax some feeling back into her toes inside her steel-toed boots.  Below, the city was still mostly asleep, a grid of dark squares punctuated by the occasional lonely headlight.  Rosie, however, was already two hours into her day, her thermos of coffee half-empty and her breath puffing out white clouds in the frigid air. Today was topping-out day, the ceremonial placement of the final beam on the annex, and Rosie, the project’s lead ironworker, had a crucial role to play.
