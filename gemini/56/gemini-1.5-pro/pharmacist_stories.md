The neon glow of "Apothecary & Elixir," a stubborn holdout against the encroaching chain drugstores, cast a sickly green light on the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, Elias Thorne, Pharm.D., meticulously polished the antique brass scales, their tiny weights clicking like secrets in the quiet.  The aroma of dried herbs, sweet and pungent, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of sea salt drifting in from the harbor.  It was a Tuesday night, just past nine, and the only sound besides Elias’s polishing cloth was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from his grandfather’s time, when this apothecary had been the only source of medicine for miles around.  Elias preferred the quiet. It allowed him to think, to lose himself in the familiar comfort of his work, a balm against the unease that had been settling in his bones like a damp chill for the past few weeks.
