The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick and pungent, clinging to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of black across his forehead, and adjusted his worn leather gloves.

From this vantage point, Elias could see the Potomac River glinting in the distance, the spires of the Washington Monument just a hazy silhouette against the pale sky. The rhythmic clang of his hammer echoed across the rooftops, a familiar counterpoint to the distant drone of city traffic.  This particular roof, belonging to a grand, three-story Victorian, was proving more troublesome than most. The slate tiles were brittle with age, crumbling like biscuits under his boots, and the underlying wooden sheathing was riddled with dry rot. It was the kind of job that made Elias grateful for his years of experience, and a little uneasy about the structural integrity of the whole damn house.  A sudden, sharp crack from beneath his feet jolted him.  He froze, his heart thumping against his ribs like a trapped bird.
