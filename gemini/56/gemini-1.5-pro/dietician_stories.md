The fluorescent hum of the overhead lights buzzed in counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of Dr. Eleanor Vance's sensible heels on the linoleum floor.  St. Jude's Wellness Center, nestled in the heart of bustling Asheville, North Carolina, was a symphony of sterile scents and hushed tones this early Wednesday morning. Eleanor, clipboard clutched in her hand, navigated the maze of pale green hallways, her crisp white lab coat a stark contrast to the muted palette around her.  Outside, the burgeoning spring promised dogwoods in bloom and the heady fragrance of honeysuckle, but here, within these clinical walls, the air was thick with the antiseptic aroma of disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of impending medical procedures.  Eleanor, however, found a strange comfort in the predictability of it all.  Her world was one of calculated calories, balanced meals, and the meticulous management of dietary needs, a world where even the smallest deviation could have significant consequences.  Today, however, those meticulously constructed walls of routine were about to be breached.  A new patient awaited, one whose case promised to be unlike any she'd encountered before.
