The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the cacophony of twenty-five five-year-olds attempting to glue googly eyes onto construction paper pumpkins.  The air, thick with the scent of Elmer's glue and damp wool from the children's fall coats piled haphazardly in the corner, vibrated with an almost tangible energy.  Outside, fat raindrops splattered against the large windows overlooking the playground of Maplewood Elementary, washing away the last vestiges of a stubbornly lingering Indian summer. The brightly colored leaves of the maple tree for which the school was named clung precariously to their branches, poised for a final, dramatic descent. Inside, however, the season of pumpkin spice and tiny costumes was in full swing.  And Mrs. Vance, with a pumpkin-shaped nametag pinned to her sweater and a faint smear of glitter on her cheek, was at the helm of this joyful chaos.
