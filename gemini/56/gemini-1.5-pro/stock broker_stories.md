Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne’s forty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The city lights of Chicago glittered below, a blurred kaleidoscope through the downpour.  His mahogany desk, usually a bastion of organized chaos, was now littered with printouts – graphs depicting plunging stock prices, frantic emails from clients, and a half-eaten container of lukewarm lo mein.  Elias, usually the picture of Wall Street composure in his tailored suit and power tie, now sported a rumpled collar and a five o’clock shadow that had arrived three hours early.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; this was the Tuesday that threatened to unravel everything he’d built.  The phone buzzed again, a jarring interruption to the low hum of the air conditioning battling the storm outside.  He knew who it was. He didn’t want to answer, but he had to.  His future, and potentially the futures of hundreds of others, depended on it.
