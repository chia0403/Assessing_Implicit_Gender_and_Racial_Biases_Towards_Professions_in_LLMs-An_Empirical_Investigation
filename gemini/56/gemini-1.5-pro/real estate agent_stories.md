The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Hayes’ exposed cheeks as she wrestled a "For Sale" sign into the unforgiving Vermont earth.  Frost already dusted the browning grass of the sprawling property, a testament to the quickly approaching winter.  Around her, the vibrant tapestry of autumn foliage – maples ablaze in crimson and gold, birches shimmering like pale flames – clung to the slopes of the Green Mountains.  This was Maplewood Manor, a sprawling Victorian estate perched high above the picturesque town of Cavendish.  Amelia, bundled in a thick tweed coat and sturdy boots, surveyed her latest listing with a mixture of professional pride and a shiver of unease.  The house was undeniably beautiful, a testament to a bygone era of elegance and grandeur, but something about its shadowed windows and imposing silence felt… unsettling.  This wasn't just another sale for Amelia Hayes; this one felt different.
