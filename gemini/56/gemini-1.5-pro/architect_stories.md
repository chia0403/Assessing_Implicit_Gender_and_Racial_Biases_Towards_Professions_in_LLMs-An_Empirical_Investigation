Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Twenty-two stories above the relentless pulse of downtown Chicago, the city lights blurred into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  His normally meticulous workspace, usually a testament to clean lines and minimalist design, was strewn with blueprints, crumpled sketches, and half-empty coffee cups. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and the faint, metallic tang of desperation. Elias, his normally impeccable brown hair now disheveled, ran a hand over his weary face. The Parker Tower, his most ambitious project to date – a soaring testament to glass and steel designed to pierce the very heart of the Chicago skyline – was on the verge of collapse, not literally, but figuratively. The city council, swayed by a vocal minority and a sudden influx of NIMBYism, was threatening to revoke the building permits.  His legacy, years of painstaking work, hung precariously in the balance.
