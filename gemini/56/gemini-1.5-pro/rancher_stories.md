The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved deep lines into Elias Vance's face, each one a testament to years spent beneath the unforgiving Montana sky. His ranch, the Whispering Pines, stretched across the eastern foothills of the Absaroka Mountains, a patchwork of emerald pastureland and dense pine forest.  It was late October, and the air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine needles and impending snow, held a bite that promised a harsh winter. The first flakes had already begun to dust the peaks, their white fingers creeping down the slopes like grasping ghosts.  Elias, perched on the worn wooden fence of the corral, watched his herd of Hereford cattle huddle together for warmth, their breath clouding the air in ghostly puffs.  A gnawing worry, deeper than the coming winter, settled in his gut. Something was off. The usual symphony of the ranch – the lowing of the cows, the chirping of crickets, the rustling of wind through the pines – felt… muted, almost expectant. As if the land itself was holding its breath.
