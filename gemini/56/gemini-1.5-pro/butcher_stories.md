The biting wind whipped down Cobblestone Alley, swirling greasy newspaper scraps around the ankles of Elias Thorne. He shivered, pulling his thick, bloodstained apron tighter around his broad frame.  The alley, tucked between a fishmonger and a dimly lit apothecary in the lower quarter of New Birmingham, was Elias's domain.  Here, nestled under a perpetually overcast sky, sat Thorne's Fine Meats.

The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood, the sweet rot of aging game, and the faint, underlying aroma of coal smoke that permeated every corner of the city.  It was a smell Elias, after twenty years, barely noticed anymore.  Tonight, however, something else lingered in the air – something sharp, acrid, and undeniably unnatural.
