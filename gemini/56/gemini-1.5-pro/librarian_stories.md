The scent of old paper and leather clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. It always had.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Peregrine Thorne, felt more at home amongst the towering shelves of the Whispering Pines Public Library than he did anywhere else.  Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the Redwood National Park in Northern California, was a town perpetually shrouded in a soft, emerald twilight.  Giant redwoods, their trunks thicker than cars, guarded the edges of the town, their branches interwoven so tightly that even midday felt like dusk. The library, a quaint Victorian building with stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature, sat at the heart of it all, a beacon of knowledge and quiet contemplation in a world that seemed increasingly loud and frenetic. Rain pattered softly against the diamond-paned windows, a soundtrack Elias had come to cherish. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, and the library was unusually empty, save for Mrs. Henderson, a sweet but perpetually flustered elderly woman who frequented the large-print section.  Elias, perched on a rolling ladder, was reshelving a collection of first-edition Edgar Allan Poe, his mind more occupied with the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of the rain than the task at hand. That's when he heard it: a faint, almost melodic chime, emanating from the restricted section in the basement.  A section Elias had never been allowed to enter.
