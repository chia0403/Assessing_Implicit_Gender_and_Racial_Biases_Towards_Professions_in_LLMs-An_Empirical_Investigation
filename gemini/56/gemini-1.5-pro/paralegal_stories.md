Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne Investigations, blurring the neon glow of "Bail Bonds" from across the street.  Inside, Amelia Reyes, a paralegal for the past five years, hunched over a stack of affidavits, the fluorescent lights humming a monotonous tune above her head. The air in the cramped office was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma for Amelia.  It was 7:37 pm on a Friday night in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, a city that never truly slept, especially not in this part of town. The clatter of a broken typewriter from Mr. Thorne's office punctuated the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a staccato soundtrack to Amelia's increasingly frantic search for a misplaced witness statement.  This particular case, a petty theft gone sideways, was turning out to be more complicated than sheâ€™d anticipated, and the upcoming Monday court date loomed like a guillotine.
