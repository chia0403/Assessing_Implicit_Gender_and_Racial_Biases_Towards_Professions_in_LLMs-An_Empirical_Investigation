The fluorescent lights of Harold Finchley's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of his keyboard.  Outside, the April air in Derry, New Hampshire, held a deceptive warmth, hinting at spring while clinging to winter's icy grip.  Melting snow dripped from the eaves, forming miniature glaciers on the sidewalk below, mirroring the precarious state of Harold's clients' finances.  Tax season, that annual ritual of receipts, deductions, and existential dread, was in full swing, and Harold, a man who found solace in the order of numbers, was bracing himself for another onslaught of panicked taxpayers.  His office, a small, cluttered space above Mrs. Higgins' bakery, smelled perpetually of cinnamon and desperation, a combination that, strangely, Harold found comforting.  This year, however, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the scent of Mrs. Higgins' renowned apple fritters.  It wasn't just the usual tax-time anxiety; it was somethingâ€¦else. Something unsettling.
