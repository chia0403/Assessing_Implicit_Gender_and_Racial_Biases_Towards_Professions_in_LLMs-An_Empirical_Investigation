The late October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied spirals around the ankles of Ms. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the parking lot of Northwood High.  A smear of crimson sunset bled across the grey sky, reflecting in the puddles left by the afternoon’s downpour.  The air, scrubbed clean by the rain, carried the sharp scent of pine from the woods bordering the school and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt popcorn from someone’s forgotten microwave experiment in the Home Ec lab.  Northwood, a sprawling brick structure that had seen better days, hunched against the gathering darkness like a tired, arthritic beast. Inside, a single light flickered in the faculty lounge window, a lonely beacon in a building that was rapidly emptying for the weekend.  Eleanor, clutching a stack of ungraded essays to her chest, felt a familiar pang of melancholy. Friday nights at Northwood usually meant quiet solitude in her classroom, meticulously planning lessons for the week ahead, a ritual she both cherished and, if she were honest with herself, found a little isolating.  Tonight, however, something was different. A cryptic email from Principal Thompson, subject line: "Urgent - Meeting Required," sat unread in her inbox, a digital foreboding that cast a long shadow over her usual Friday night routine.
