The wail of the siren was a constant companion to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, its rhythmic pulse mirroring the frantic thump of her own heart. Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic One, blurring the neon glow of the late-night diners and pawn shops that lined Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys, California.  The air inside the ambulance was thick with the smell of antiseptic and a faint metallic tang Amy couldn't quite place. Dispatch had called it a "multi-vehicle incident with possible entrapment" at the intersection of Sepulveda and Victory. That was code for chaos, for mangled metal and shattered glass, for the raw, desperate edge of human suffering Amy had learned to both fear and embrace. Tonight, the added element of the torrential downpour, turning the already treacherous intersection into a slick deathtrap, promised to make things even worse.  Amy gripped the handle above the window, her knuckles white, and braced herself for the carnage she knew awaited.
