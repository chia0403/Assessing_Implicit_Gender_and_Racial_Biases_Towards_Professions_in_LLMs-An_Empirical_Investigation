The insistent Los Angeles sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast stripes across Amelia Reyes’s worn leather massage table.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, hung heavy and still, mirroring the quiet anticipation that always preceded her first client of the day.  Serenity Now wasn’t exactly a haven of tranquility; nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually buzzing tattoo parlor on Melrose Avenue, it was more an oasis of calm in a desert of urban clamor.  Amelia, however, had cultivated a sense of peace within its walls, a sanctuary built not of silence, but of the rhythmic kneading of muscles and the hushed release of tension.  Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her own stomach.  The appointment scheduled for 9 am was with a new client, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, and something about his curt phone call the previous day had left her feeling unsettled.
