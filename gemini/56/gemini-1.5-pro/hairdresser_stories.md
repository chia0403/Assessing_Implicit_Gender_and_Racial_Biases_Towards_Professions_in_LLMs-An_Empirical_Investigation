The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed a tired B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip emanating from within. Rain lashed against the large plate glass window, blurring the reflection of Amelia Grace Hawthorne, thirty-two and owner of the only hair salon in the sleepy, slightly rundown town of Harmony Creek, Oregon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of hairspray, perm solution, and the faint, lingering aroma of Amelia's signature lavender chamomile tea. The salon itself, a converted gas station, retained a faint whiff of gasoline, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era that clung to Harmony Creek like the damp coastal air. Tonight, however, the usual cozy atmosphere was charged with an unusual tension. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration as she trimmed the ends of Mrs. Higgins' blue-rinsed perm, couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change in Harmony Creek. And not for the better.
