Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings building, turning the cityscape of downtown Chicago into a blurred watercolor of grays and blues.  Inside, the air buzzed with a low, electric hum – the combined output of hundreds of servers housed in the climate-controlled server room on the 42nd floor.  This was Eleanor Vance's domain. Eleanor Beatrice Vance, Systems Analyst Extraordinaire (a self-proclaimed title, albeit a fitting one), tapped a rhythmic tattoo on her desk with a chewed-down pen, her brow furrowed in concentration as she stared at lines of code scrolling across her monitor.  The problem – a persistent latency issue plaguing the company’s new trading platform – had been dogging her for days, a digital splinter she couldn't quite dislodge. The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to the late nights she’d been pulling.  The office was deserted save for the flickering fluorescent lights and the distant drone of the cleaning crew’s vacuum cleaner, adding an eerie soundtrack to her solitary struggle. This Friday night was supposed to be dedicated to craft beer and live jazz with her best friend, but Eleanor had a feeling that debugging would be the only music in her immediate future.
