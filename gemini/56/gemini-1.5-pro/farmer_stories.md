The wind, sharp and cold even for late October, whipped across the parched fields of Elderberry Farm, tugging at the brim of Elias Thatcher's worn felt hat. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic swirling in Elias's gut.  Elderberry Farm, nestled in the shadow of the brooding Grimshaw Peaks in rural Oregon, had been in the Thatcher family for five generations.  Five generations of dependable rain, fertile soil, and bountiful harvests. This year, however, the heavens had remained stubbornly closed, the soil dry and unforgiving, the harvestâ€¦a whisper of what it should have been.  Elias squinted at the skeletal remains of his corn stalks, their leaves brittle and brown, rustling like dry bones in the wind.  He ran a calloused hand through his greying hair, the weight of responsibility heavy on his shoulders. This drought, if it continued much longer, threatened not only his livelihood but the legacy of his family.
