The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped wasps, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the perpetual knot in Amelia Reyes's stomach.  It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the graveyard shift, and the only sound other than the buzzing and the low rumble of the ancient fridge was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Ameliaâ€™s acrylic nails on the worn countertop. Outside, the Nevada desert stretched away from the lonely gas station, a vast expanse of black punctuated by the distant, shimmering lights of Las Vegas, a city Amelia had never visited despite living just thirty miles away. The Quick Stop, a beacon of slightly stale coffee and questionable hot dogs, was her world, and tonight, it felt smaller and more suffocating than usual.
