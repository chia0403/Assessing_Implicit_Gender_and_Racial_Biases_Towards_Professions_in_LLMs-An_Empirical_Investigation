The rusty scissors, cool and familiar in Elias Thorne's hand, snicked rhythmically.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Located on the less-fashionable end of Aethelred Street, in the perpetually overcast city of Port Blossom, the parlour was a haven of faded grandeur.  Velvet chairs, threadbare but still retaining a hint of regal purple, lined the wall.  A chipped porcelain sink, stained the colour of weak tea, occupied one corner.  The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and something indefinably, stubbornly old â€“ perhaps the ghosts of a thousand haircuts past. Elias, a man whose age was as difficult to determine as the exact shade of his salt-and-pepper beard, hummed a mournful sea shanty as he meticulously trimmed the wispy sideburns of Mr. Henderson, Port Blossom's perpetually disgruntled clockmaker.  Outside, the fog horns began their low, mournful calls, a soundtrack to the city's slow descent into twilight.
