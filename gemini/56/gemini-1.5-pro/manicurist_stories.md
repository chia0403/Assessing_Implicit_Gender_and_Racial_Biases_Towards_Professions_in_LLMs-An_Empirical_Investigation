The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty storefront in Brooklyn, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose wrinkles seemed to multiply with each passing Tuesday.  Elara Valentina Rodriguez, her name embroidered in elegant cursive on the pocket of her crisp white apron, sighed internally. Tuesdays were always Mrs. Henderson and her endless stream of gossip, punctuated by complaints about ingrown toenails. Elara plastered a smile on her face, the kind she'd perfected after years of dealing with demanding clientele, and gestured towards the plush pedicure chair.  Outside, the November wind howled, whipping fallen leaves against the grime-streaked window, mirroring the restless energy churning within Elara.  She yearned for something more than the predictable rhythm of filing, buffing, and polishing, a yearning that intensified with every chilly gust.  Little did she know, this Tuesday was about to be anything but predictable.
