The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Spatula Diner, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the churning anxiety in Amelia Rose Holloway's stomach.  It was 5:57 pm on a Tuesday, the slowest night of the week, and the diner, usually bustling with the clatter of cutlery and the sizzle of the grill, was eerily quiet.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the red vinyl booths and checkered floor.  Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp white uniform, nervously polished the already gleaming countertop, her gaze fixed on the swirling droplets clinging to the windowpane. Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, its promise of "Best Burgers in Town" a pathetic lie on a night like this.  The only other occupant of the diner was old Mr. Henderson, slumped in his usual corner booth, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring blankly at the wall.  He hadn’t spoken a word in the three hours he’d been there, and Amelia, usually eager for a chat, found herself strangely grateful for his silence.  Something felt off.  The air was thick with a peculiar stillness, a pregnant pause before…something.
