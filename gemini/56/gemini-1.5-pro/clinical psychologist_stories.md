The rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his latest patient.  His consulting room, tucked away on the third floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, usually offered a calming sanctuary.  Dark wood paneling, a worn Persian rug, and the comforting aroma of old books typically lulled patients into a state of relative ease.  But tonight, the storm outside seemed to amplify the anxiety radiating from the woman perched rigidly on the edge of the plush armchair.  Lightning briefly illuminated the room, revealing the stark white knuckles gripping a crumpled tissue in her hand.  Dr. Thorne, a man whose composure rarely faltered, felt a prickle of unease.  He had a feeling this session was about to be anything but typical.
