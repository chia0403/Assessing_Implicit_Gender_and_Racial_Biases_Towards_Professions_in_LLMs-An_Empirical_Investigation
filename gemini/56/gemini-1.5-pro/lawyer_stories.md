Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Hayes's office, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of a mournful saxophone solo drifting from a nearby jazz club.  The crimson leather of her armchair creaked softly as she shifted, the scent of old books and brewing coffee clinging to the air. Her name, Amelia Josephine Hayes, Esq., was embossed in gold on a small plaque on her mahogany desk, a testament to years of relentless work and an unwavering dedication to the law. This small, book-lined sanctuary tucked above a bustling bakery in the French Quarter of New Orleans was her refuge, her fortress against the chaotic currents of the city â€“ a city that tonight, felt particularly sinister.  A single lamp cast a warm glow across the overflowing files scattered across her desk, each a testament to the tangled web of human drama that she navigated daily. Tonight, however, one file sat alone, stark white against the dark wood, its contents threatening to unravel the delicate fabric of Amelia's carefully constructed life.
