The biting wind whipped across the tarmac, stinging Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's cheeks and rattling the pre-flight checklist clamped in her gloved hand.  Above, the Alaskan sky was a bruised purple, the first hesitant streaks of dawn bleeding through the eastern horizon. Knik Arm, usually a steely grey, reflected the faint light, its surface broken only by the occasional chunk of glacial ice drifting southward. Mia exhaled, a puff of white against the frigid air, and surveyed the De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, its pontoons resting on the choppy water.  Anchorage's Lake Hood Seaplane Base, a chaotic ballet of floatplanes and bush pilots in the summer, was eerily deserted in the pre-dawn gloom of late November. This was Mia's favourite time to fly â€“ before the radio chatter crackled to life, before the tourists arrived, before anything disturbed the raw, untamed beauty of the Alaskan wilderness.  Today's flight was a charter to a remote fishing lodge nestled deep within the Chugach Mountains, a routine run, but one that never failed to fill her with a quiet sense of anticipation.
