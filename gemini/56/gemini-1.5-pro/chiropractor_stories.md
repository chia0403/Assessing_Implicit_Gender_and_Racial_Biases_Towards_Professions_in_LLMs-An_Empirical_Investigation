The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he locked up Thorne Chiropractic.  His clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine, was finally quiet after a long day of coaxing misaligned spines back into harmony.  Havenwood, a place where gossip travelled faster than the local broadband and everyone knew everyone else’s business (including their lower back pain), wasn’t exactly Elias’s dream locale. He’d pictured himself practicing in a bustling city, surrounded by cutting-edge technology and complex cases. Instead, he'd inherited his grandfather’s practice and found himself treating everything from text-neck in teenagers to slipped discs in elderly farmers.  Tonight, however, Elias had a more pressing concern than the usual aches and pains of Havenwood’s residents. A cryptic note had been slipped under his door that afternoon, a single line scrawled in shaky handwriting: "Your grandfather's secrets are not buried deep enough."
