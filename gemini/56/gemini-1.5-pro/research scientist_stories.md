The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blinding white to a slightly less blinding white, punctuated by the dark, jagged peaks of the Ellsworth Mountains.  The year was 2077, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, usually a hive of activity, was eerily quiet.  A skeleton crew remained, huddled inside the futuristic geodesic dome that protected them from the brutal elements.  Aris, however, preferred the biting cold to the suffocating anxiety that permeated the station. Out here, surrounded by the vast, desolate beauty of the ice, he could almost forget the reason for the sudden evacuation, the reason he had volunteered to stay behind: the anomaly.  Buried deep beneath the ice, something was emitting a signal, a rhythmic pulse that defied all known physics.  And Aris, a glaciologist by trade but increasingly a xenoarchaeologist by necessity, was the only one left to find out what it was.
