Budget cuts.  Her already overflowing caseload was about to explode, swallowing her whole in a tide of paperwork and desperate faces.

The only signs of life were the flickering neon signs of bars yet to close and the huddled figures Anya knew were seeking a temporary escape from the cold and their own personal storms.  She pulled up outside the dilapidated brick building that housed the King County Community Corrections office, its peeling paint a testament to years of neglect.  Another day, Anya thought grimly, another battle.
