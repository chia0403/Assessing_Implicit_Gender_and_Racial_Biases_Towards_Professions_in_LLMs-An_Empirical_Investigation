The biting November wind whipped around Elias Finch, tugging at the edges of his worn canvas jacket and whistling through the skeletal branches of the sycamores lining Sycamore Street.  Ironically, Sycamore Street contained not a single sycamore tree anymore, just a row of squat, brick duplexes clinging to a steep hill overlooking the grey expanse of Lake Erie. Elias, his toolbox clanking against his leg with each step, trudged up the cracked pavement towards number 22B, the source of the frantic, pre-dawn phone call. Mrs. Petrovich, a sweet but perpetually flustered woman, had claimed a "geyser" had erupted in her bathroom, and Elias, the only 24-hour plumber in the rust-belt town of Ashwood, Ohio, was her only hope. The sky, a bruised purple just beginning to lighten with the promise of a bleak day, reflected in the icy puddles gathering in the potholes that peppered the street.  A faint smell of sulfur hung in the air, a familiar aroma Elias attributed to the aging pipes that crisscrossed the town like forgotten veins.
