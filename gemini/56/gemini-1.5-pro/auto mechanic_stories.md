The rusty tang of iron oxide hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez.  Her garage, "Bea's Bolts and Bearings," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon. The corrugated metal walls, patched with mismatched sheets like a quilt stitched by a colorblind giant, trapped the summer heat, turning the interior into a sauna.  The only respite came from a single, wheezing box fan perched precariously on a stack of worn tires.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, cast long shadows across the concrete floor, illuminating a chaotic landscape of tool chests, engine parts, and half-disassembled vehicles.  A faded pin-up calendar featuring a 1957 Chevy Bel Air hung askew on the wall, its cheerful colors a stark contrast to the gritty reality of the garage.  This morning, however, the usual symphony of clanging wrenches and whirring drills was absent. Bea, her grease-smudged hands resting on her hips, stared down at the stubborn engine of a cherry-red 1967 Ford Mustang, a frown etched deep into her brow.  This wasn't just any Mustang; it was her ticket to the annual Harmony Creek Classic Car Show, and it refused to cooperate.
