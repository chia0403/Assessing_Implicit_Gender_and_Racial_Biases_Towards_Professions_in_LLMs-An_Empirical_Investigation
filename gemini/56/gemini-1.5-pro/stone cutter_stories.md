The biting wind whipped off the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the near-constant whisper of falling snow. The sun, a pale disc in the iron-grey sky, offered little warmth to the isolated village of Hollow Creek, nestled in a sheltered valley where the wind, at least, lost some of its ferocity.  Smoke curled lazily from the squat stone houses, clinging to the frosted roofs like a second skin.  Here, amidst the perpetual chill, lived Elias Thorne, a stone cutter renowned throughout the valley for his steady hand and the uncanny ability to coax beauty from even the most stubborn granite. His workshop, built against the cliff face at the edge of the village, was little more than a rough-hewn cave, warmed by a crackling fire and illuminated by the flickering glow of an oil lamp.  This morning, however, the usual rhythmic clang of Elias' hammer against chisel was absent. He stood, his breath misting in the frigid air, staring out at the fresh blanket of snow that had transformed the valley into a pristine white canvas, a frown etched deep into his weathered face.  Something felt amiss.
