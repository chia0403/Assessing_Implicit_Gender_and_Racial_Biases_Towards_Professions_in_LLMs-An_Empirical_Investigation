The flickering neon sign of the "Binary Bean" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia Reyes's tired face. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the already distorted reflection of the cafe's interior.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and desperation. Amelia, hunched over a battered laptop plastered with coding stickers, absently chewed on the end of a pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  It was 3:17 am in the perpetually damp and dimly lit alleyway known as Glitch Gulch, the heart of the city's underground tech scene. Tonight, however, the usual hum of clandestine activity was muted, replaced by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and Amelia's frantic keystrokes.  She had three hours to find and fix the bug that threatened to unravel the biggest project of her career â€“ a decentralized, self-learning AI designed to predict and prevent urban infrastructural failures.  And if she failed, Glitch Gulch, and maybe the whole city, would be the first to know.
