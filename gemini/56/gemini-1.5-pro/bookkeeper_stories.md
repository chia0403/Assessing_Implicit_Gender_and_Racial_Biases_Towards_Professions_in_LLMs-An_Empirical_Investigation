The insistent drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Finch's bookkeeping office mirrored the frantic tapping of her fingers on the adding machine.  Located above O'Malley's Pub in the perpetually damp, cobbled heart of Port Blossom, Maine, the office was a single room crammed with dusty ledgers, overflowing filing cabinets, and the faint, lingering scent of stale beer.

Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windowpanes and adding another layer of unease to the knot already tightening in Amelia's stomach.  The numbers weren't adding up.
