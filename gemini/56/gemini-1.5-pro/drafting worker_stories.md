The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&L Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Isabella Reyes, squinted at the blueprint spread across her drafting table, the crisp white paper a stark contrast to the gathering gloom outside the large, grime-streaked window.  It was a Thursday afternoon in late November, and the early darkness of a Chicago winter was already clamping down on the city.  A biting wind howled through the canyons of skyscrapers, rattling the poorly insulated windows of the aging office building.  The scent of stale coffee and burnt popcorn hung heavy in the air, a testament to the long hours the small team regularly put in.  Amelia meticulously adjusted her mechanical pencil, its lead sharpened to a needle-fine point, before carefully drawing the intricate details of a ventilation system for a new high-rise condominium complex planned for the rapidly gentrifying West Loop.  She loved the precision of her work, the satisfaction of seeing a building take shape from a collection of lines and angles, but today, a persistent unease gnawed at her.  Something about the blueprints feltâ€¦off.
