The aroma of bay rum and talcum powder hung thick in the air, a comforting, slightly medicinal perfume that permeated every inch of Alfie "The Blade" Bartholomew's Tonsorial Parlour. Situated on the corner of Bleaker Street and Despair Avenue in the perpetually overcast city of Grimshaw, the parlour was a small, wood-panelled haven against the grim realities outside. Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the neon glow of the "Shaves & Trims" sign, while inside, the warm glow of Edison bulbs cast long shadows on the checkered floor. Alfie Bartholomew himself, a man whose face was as weathered and lined as the leather of his barber chair, stood polishing a straight razor with the meticulous care of a surgeon preparing for an operation.  His silver hair, neatly slicked back, caught the light, making him appear almost angelic in contrast to the shadowy corners of his shop.  This Tuesday morning, however, the only sound accompanying the rhythmic swish of the strop was the insistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a sound that seemed to echo the city's unspoken anxieties.  Something was different in Grimshaw, a shift in the usual dreary atmosphere, and Alfie, a man attuned to the subtle vibrations of his neighbourhood, could feel it in the very marrow of his bones.
