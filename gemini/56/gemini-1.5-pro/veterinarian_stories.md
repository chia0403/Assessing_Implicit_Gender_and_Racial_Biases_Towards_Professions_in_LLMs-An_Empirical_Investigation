The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, rattling the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic and sending a shiver down his spine.  The "clinic" was a generous term; in reality, it was a converted shed attached to his weathered, salt-laced house overlooking the craggy cliffs of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands.  Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of antiseptic, hay, and the faint, underlying tang of the sea.  A half-finished cup of lukewarm tea sat on a cluttered desk beside a dog-eared copy of "Merck Veterinary Manual,"  open to a particularly challenging chapter on bovine respiratory diseases, a surprisingly common ailment even on this remote, windswept isle. The only light came from a flickering fluorescent bulb overhead and the waning glow of the late November afternoon filtering through the grimy window.  Outside, the sky was bruised purple, promising a storm. Elias rubbed his tired eyes, the lines around them etched deep by years of battling the harsh elements and the equally demanding needs of the island’s animals. He was expecting a difficult lambing season… and that was before the phone rang, shattering the fragile peace.
