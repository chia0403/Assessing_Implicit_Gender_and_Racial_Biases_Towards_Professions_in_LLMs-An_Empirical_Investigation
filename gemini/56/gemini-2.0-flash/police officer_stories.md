## Story Opening:

The stench of cheap tequila and desperation hung thick in the air, clinging to the peeling wallpaper and stained linoleum of the 'Sunset Motel.' Officer Amelia Ramirez, a damp tendril of dark hair escaping her tight braid, grimaced. The air conditioning, if it could even be called that, hummed a mournful dirge, doing little to combat the oppressive Miami heat seeping in through the cracks in the window frame. She pulled the yellow latex glove tighter around her hand, the faint scent of powdered donuts from her earlier stakeout suddenly nauseating.

"Anything, Ramirez?" Sergeant Johnson’s voice crackled through her shoulder radio, a rough intrusion into the silence of room 3B.

Amelia knelt beside the overturned metal suitcase, its contents – a jumble of cheap costume jewelry, crumpled receipts, and a half-eaten bag of plantain chips – scattered across the floor. "Just the usual, Sergeant. Looks like someone was living fast and dirty, and left in a hurry." She paused, her gloved finger tracing the outline of a smudged lipstick stain on a discarded photograph. "But… something feels off."

## Setting:

**Miami, Florida. Mid-July. Early evening.**

The humidity hangs like a shroud over the city. The vibrant colours of South Beach, usually a balm to the soul, are dulled by the oppressive heat. The Sunset Motel, located on the fringes of Little Havana, is a far cry from the glitz and glamour. It's a place where dreams go to die, a haven for those clinging to the edges of society. The air buzzes with the frantic energy of a city that never sleeps, a city that constantly demands more than it gives. But beneath the surface of the turquoise waters and sun-drenched beaches, a darkness lurks, a darkness that Amelia Ramirez is all too familiar with.
