## Story Opening:

The biting wind, smelling of salt and something vaguely fishy, ripped at Amelia Willowbrook's parka as she battled her way across the frost-slicked boardwalk. The sky above the Marin Wildlife Sanctuary was a bruised purple, threatening snow. Amelia clutched the thermal mug tighter, the lukewarm coffee barely offering any solace against the encroaching chill that had settled deep in her bones. She could feel it in her fingertips, numb despite her gloves, and in the way her breath puffed out in ragged clouds. Another storm was brewing, and she just hoped it wouldn't be as bad as the last one, which had seen a baby harbor seal stranded dangerously close to the crashing waves.

## Setting:

The Marin Wildlife Sanctuary sprawled across a rugged peninsula jutting into the churning waters of the Pacific Ocean. The landscape was a dramatic tapestry of windswept cypress trees, rocky cliffs pounded by relentless waves, and pockets of sheltered beach where seals sunned themselves and migratory birds rested. The sanctuary itself comprised a cluster of weathered wooden buildings: a main office, a small veterinary clinic, several enclosures for injured or orphaned animals, and a research lab perched precariously on the edge of a bluff overlooking the ocean. The constant soundtrack was the roar of the waves, punctuated by the cries of gulls and the occasional barking of a seal. The air was thick with the scent of salt, seaweed, and the faint, earthy smell of animal musk. In the distance, the iconic silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge shimmered through the swirling fog, a constant reminder of the bustling city just a stone's throw away from this haven of wildness.
