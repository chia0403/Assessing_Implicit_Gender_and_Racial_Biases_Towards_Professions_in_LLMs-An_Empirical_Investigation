The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Finch law firm hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's acrylic nails against the polished reception desk. It was 7:58 AM, precisely two minutes before the official start of the workday, but Agnes was already poised, a fortress of composure in a sea of pre-caffeinated chaos. The air, thick with the scent of lemon-scented polish and barely-concealed ambition, crackled with an unspoken energy. Agnes, a veteran of countless early mornings, felt it like a low-frequency vibration in her bones.

Sterling & Finch, a behemoth of corporate law situated on the 37th floor of the Zenith Tower in downtown Chicago, was not just a workplace; it was a crucible. Here, deals were brokered, fortunes were made (and occasionally lost), and egos clashed like cymbals in a marching band. The reception area, a pristine tableau of chrome and glass, was the firm's meticulously curated first impression. An impression Agnes Beatrice Plumtree was largely responsible for maintaining.
