## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The stale air of mid-April hangs heavy in the cramped office of "Tax Time Solutions" in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. Fluorescent lights hum incessantly, buzzing a discordant melody above the frantic tapping of keyboards and the muffled sighs of frustrated clients. Cheap, motivational posters depicting eagles soaring above mountains offer a hollow encouragement that clashes sharply with the grim reality of the spreadsheets and receipts piled high on every surface. Outside, the sky is a sullen grey, mirroring the general mood.

**Opening:**

Agnes Beatrice Plumtree, her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a severe bun and a pair of half-moon spectacles perched precariously on her nose, took a long, fortifying sip of lukewarm coffee. The cheap styrofoam cup crumpled slightly under the pressure of her grip. It was April 14th, the day before the tax deadline, and Agnes, a seasoned income tax preparer with twenty years of experience under her belt, felt the familiar thrum of dread building in her chest. She’d seen it all, the panicked procrastinators, the desperate deductions, the outright lies whispered across her desk. But this year felt… different. A palpable anxiety permeated the air, thicker than the coffee fumes and the scent of cheap printer ink. And it wasn't just the impending deadline. It was something more, something she couldn't quite put her finger on, a feeling that she was about to stumble upon something far more complicated than a simple miscalculation of charitable donations. Her phone buzzed, displaying the name "Brenda from Bakery" - a notoriously chaotic client known for burying her business expenses under piles of frosting-covered receipts. Agnes sighed. Today was going to be a long one.
