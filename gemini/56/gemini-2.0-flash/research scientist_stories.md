The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Sterling like a damp shroud. It smelled of overripe mangoes and something vaguely metallic, a scent that had become as familiar to her as the lab's sterile disinfectant back home. Evelyn wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of red earth on her skin. The drone of cicadas was deafening, almost drowning out the rhythmic chop of the machete as Gabriel, her local guide, cleared a path through the dense undergrowth.

They were deep within the Yasun√≠ National Park in Ecuador, a sprawling emerald tapestry stitched together by winding rivers and shrouded in perpetual twilight. Evelyn, a research scientist specializing in bioacoustics and the effects of human activity on rainforest ecosystems, had been tracking the elusive calls of the Harpy Eagle for the past six months. Her research grant was running dangerously low, and the faint, almost mythical, cry she'd recorded the previous night felt like her last chance to prove her hypothesis: that illegal logging operations were driving the eagles to abandon their traditional nesting grounds, a slow, sonic annihilation that preceded physical extinction. Today, she hoped to locate the source of that haunting sound, a signal in the chaotic symphony of the Amazon, before it was lost forever.
