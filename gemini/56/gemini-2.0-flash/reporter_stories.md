## Story Opening:

The clatter of old-fashioned manual typewriters was a symphony to some, a cacophony to others. For Eleanor “Ellie” Ainsworth, it was the background music of her life, the comforting soundtrack to another deadline looming large and menacing. She stared at the blank page in her Royal Standard, the keys cold beneath her fingertips. Another day, another story, another desperate scramble to meet the printing press's insatiable appetite. The city desk was a war zone today, a thick fog of cigarette smoke hanging heavy in the air, punctuated by shouts and the frantic ringing of telephones. Ellie usually thrived in the chaos, but today, the words felt leaden, the inspiration absent. She needed something, anything, to crack this writer's block before Mr. Henderson, the editor with a face permanently etched with disapproval, descended upon her like a disapproving hawk.

## Setting:

The year is 1938. The place is the newsroom of the *Chicago Chronicle*, a bustling, grimy space located on the third floor of a building that had seen better days, somewhere down near the grimy wharves along the Chicago River. The room is a rectangular box crammed with desks overflowing with papers, overflowing ashtrays, and half-eaten lunches. Overhead, bare bulbs cast a harsh, unflattering light. Wires snake across the floor, a testament to the haphazard and ever-evolving nature of the operation. The walls are painted a drab green, peeling in places and stained with years of nicotine and coffee spills. The air is thick with the aforementioned cigarette smoke, the aroma of cheap coffee, and the faint, lingering scent of printer's ink. Outside, the roar of the city is a constant presence, a rumbling backdrop to the frantic activity within. Through the dirty windows, Ellie can just make out the glint of the river, a steely grey ribbon winding its way through the concrete canyons. It's a place of grit and glamour, of truth and deception, a place where stories are born, broken, and sometimes, buried.
