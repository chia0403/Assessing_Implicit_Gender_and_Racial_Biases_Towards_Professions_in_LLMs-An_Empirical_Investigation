## Story Opening:

The air in Pine Ridge County hung thick and heavy, promising another scorcher. Dew still clung stubbornly to the pine needles, making the already uneven ground slick. Jebediah "Jeb" Tanner, a man built like a concrete mixer and just about as weathered, spat a stream of tobacco juice that hissed as it landed on the damp earth. He squinted at the sunrise painting the eastern sky in hues of angry orange and bruised purple, colors that mirrored the exhaustion etched into his face. Another day, another mountain moved.

He hoisted himself into the cab of his Caterpillar D10 dozer, "The Beast," its engine already grumbling to life like a slumbering giant. The familiar rumble vibrated through his bones, a comforting hum in the pre-dawn stillness. He adjusted his worn baseball cap, the logo of "Tanner & Sons Excavation" faded almost to oblivion, and ran a calloused hand over the well-worn steering levers. Today's task: clear a new section of the hillside for the upcoming luxury resort development. Landscaping and luxury. Seemed a damn shame to Jeb, who preferred the raw, untamed beauty of the mountains, but bills didn't pay themselves and Tanner & Sons needed the work. He just hoped, as he did every morning, that he wouldn't unearth anything he wasn't supposed to.

## Setting:

**Pine Ridge County, North Carolina:** A mountainous region characterized by dense pine forests, rugged terrain, and small, isolated communities. The county is undergoing a period of rapid development, with luxury resorts and vacation homes steadily encroaching on the natural landscape. While some residents embrace the economic benefits of this growth, others lament the loss of their traditional way of life and the destruction of the environment. The area is also steeped in local folklore and a history of generations eking out a living from the land, leaving behind traces of the past hidden beneath the soil. The weather is typically humid and hot in the summer, with cold, often snowy winters. The landscape is dotted with streams and rivers that cut through the valleys, providing both beauty and a source of potential flooding.
