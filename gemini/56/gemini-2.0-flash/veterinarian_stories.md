## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dust motes dancing in the air of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's clinic, painted long, orange stripes across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the wind, a restless spirit haunting the high plains of Wyoming, rattled the corrugated metal roof, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape that surrounded her. Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed, leaning against the cool surface of the stainless steel examination table. The scent of antiseptic and dried hay, a familiar comfort, clung to the air. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a horse trailer pulling up outside snapped her out of her reverie.

"Showtime," she muttered to herself, straightening her faded denim shirt and pushing up the sleeves. Another animal in need, another day in the life of the only vet for a hundred miles.

## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth Veterinary Clinic** is located in the small, unincorporated town of Dust Devil, Wyoming. It's a one-story building made of cinder blocks, painted a faded beige that's peeling in places. The clinic sits on the edge of town, bordering sprawling ranchlands. A large, gravel parking lot fills the space between the building and the highway, often filled with pickup trucks, horse trailers, and the occasional beat-up SUV. Inside, the clinic is functional but worn.

*   **The Waiting Room:** Features mismatched plastic chairs, a scarred coffee table littered with dog-eared magazines (mostly about horses and cattle), and a corkboard covered in announcements for local rodeos and lost pets. A small, dusty fish tank gurgles softly in one corner, inhabited by a single, perpetually grumpy goldfish.

*   **The Examination Room:** Equipped with a stainless steel examination table, a small sink, cabinets filled with medical supplies, and a framed diploma from Colorado State University, a source of quiet pride for Eleanor.

*   **The Treatment Area:** A larger space used for minor surgeries and treatments, complete with a surgical lamp, an anesthesia machine (rarely used), and a kenneling area for short-term patient stays.

*   **Eleanor's Office:** A cramped space cluttered with paperwork, veterinary textbooks, and a half-eaten bag of beef jerky. A window looks out onto the vast, windswept plains.

The entire clinic feels weathered and well-used, bearing the marks of years of treating everything from pampered show dogs to grizzled cattle. It's a testament to Eleanor's dedication and the vital role she plays in the lives of the people and animals of Dust Devil.
