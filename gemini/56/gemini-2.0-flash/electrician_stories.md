The scent of burnt plastic and fear clung to the air, a suffocating cocktail that clung to Amelia Rose "Rose" Kendrick's work boots like a second skin. She coughed, the taste of ozone bitter on her tongue, and shielded her eyes against the flickering strobe of the emergency lighting. Outside, the coastal storm was still raging, a banshee wail that shook the very foundations of the abandoned lighthouse, but in here, in the dripping, salt-corroded belly of the structure, the immediate threat was far more pressing.

The setting was the dilapidated lighthouse on Mariner's Point, a desolate finger of land jutting precariously into the tempestuous Atlantic Ocean. It had been decommissioned decades ago, left to the mercy of the elements and the whispers of local legend. Now, a low-budget film crew, lured by the lighthouse's eerie atmosphere, had decided to shoot a horror flick, and Amelia Rose Kendrick, a seasoned electrician known for her unflappable demeanor and uncanny ability to coax life back into dead circuits, had been hired to bring the place back to life â€“ at least electrically.

She'd been skeptical from the start. Mariner's Point was infamous for its unpredictable weather, its treacherous currents, and the unsettling stories spun by the old fishermen in the nearby town of Havenwood. Stories about unexplained disappearances, ghostly lights, and a siren's song that lured sailors to their doom. Now, staring at the mangled rats' nest of wiring that was supposed to power the movie set, Rose couldn't help but wonder if those stories held a kernel of truth. Because something, she could feel it in the tingling of her fingertips, was definitely wrong. And it wasn't just the faulty wiring.
