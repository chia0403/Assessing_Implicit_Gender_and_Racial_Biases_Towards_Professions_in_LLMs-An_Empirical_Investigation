## Story Opening:

The scent of aged paper and beeswax polish was Amelia Bellweather's comfort, her constant companion in the grand, echoing silence of the Blackwood Library. It wasn't just the smell; it was the feeling of history humming beneath her fingertips as she ran them along the leather spines. She was, after all, a keeper of secrets, a guardian of stories that stretched back centuries. This morning, however, the comforting silence felt more like a suffocating weight.

The reason sat on her desk, a small, intricately carved box made of a wood she couldn't identify, emitting a faint, unsettling hum. It had been delivered just before opening, left with a cryptic note: "For the Keeper. When the pages weep, unlock the heart." Amelia had spent the last hour meticulously examining it, but the wood remained stubbornly unidentifiable, the carvings indecipherable. The note was even more frustrating. "When the pages weep..." What in heaven's name did that mean?

A sudden draft snaked through the reading room, causing a stack of books to tremble on a nearby table. Amelia shivered, pulling her woolen shawl tighter. The Blackwood Library had always been a littleâ€¦ odd. Rumours whispered of hidden passages, forgotten spells woven into the architecture, and whispers carried on the wind through the high, arched windows. But Amelia had always dismissed them as charming folklore.

Until now. Because as the draft intensified, she noticed something she'd never seen before. A single, glistening bead of moisture formed on the spine of a particularly ancient volume of alchemical texts, a bead that slowly, agonizingly, trickled down the faded gold lettering like a tear.

## Setting:

The story is set in the **Blackwood Library**, a privately owned repository of knowledge located in the remote, windswept region of the Scottish Highlands. The library is housed in a sprawling, gothic-revival mansion, its grey stone walls softened by creeping ivy and its interior a labyrinth of towering bookshelves, hidden alcoves, and dimly lit reading rooms. The library is known for its extensive collection of rare books, manuscripts, and esoteric texts, ranging from ancient philosophies and forgotten languages to botanical treatises and occult knowledge. The atmosphere is one of quiet grandeur, imbued with a sense of history, mystery, and just a hint of the supernatural. The surrounding landscape is rugged and wild, adding to the library's isolated and otherworldly feel.
