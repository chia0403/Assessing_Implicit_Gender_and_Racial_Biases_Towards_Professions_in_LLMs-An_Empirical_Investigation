The relentless spray stung Eleanor Vance’s cheeks, mixing with the tears that clung to her eyelashes. Not real tears, not yet anyway. More a product of the wind and the salt-laced air that whipped around her, a constant companion on this godforsaken stretch of the Icelandic coast. She squinted, struggling to keep her lens clean as another wave crashed against the black volcanic rocks below, sending a plume of icy spray high into the unforgiving grey sky. 

Eleanor Vance was used to unforgiving.

She'd chased light across continents, braved deserts that swallowed men whole, and climbed mountains that scraped the sky, all in pursuit of the perfect image. But this…this was different. This was a landscape that seemed to actively resent being photographed. It held its beauty captive, a sullen, brooding thing that dared you to try and capture it.

The setting was a small, windswept promontory on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. Jagged cliffs, scarred and blackened by centuries of volcanic activity, met a turbulent, slate-grey sea. The air was thick with the smell of brine and the mournful cries of seabirds. A lone, weathered fishing shack clung precariously to the edge of the promontory, its faded red paint peeling like sunburnt skin. In the distance, the brooding, snow-capped peak of Snæfellsjökull volcano was shrouded in mist, a silent, omnipresent sentinel guarding the secrets of this harsh, beautiful land. Eleanor had been here for a week, holed up in the fishing shack, driven by an almost obsessive need to capture the essence of this place, a feeling that nagged at her, a sense that something was waiting to be revealed, something hidden just beneath the surface of the landscape. And the pressure was mounting. The exhibition deadline loomed. And Eleanor, despite all her experience, felt utterly, hopelessly lost.
