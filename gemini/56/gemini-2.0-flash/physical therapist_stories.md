## Story Opening:

The stale, floral scent of hand sanitizer clung to Dr. Eleanor Grace Harding as she rounded the corner, the faint chlorine tang of the therapy pool fighting a losing battle. Another Monday, another mountain of patient charts threatening to topple. She paused, adjusting the strap of her overloaded tote bag, its contents a chaotic mix of resistance bands, anatomical models, and a dog-eared copy of “Gray’s Anatomy” that had seen better days. Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on the palm trees, a stark contrast to the sterile, artificially lit world within the walls of Bayview Rehabilitation Center. Eleanor sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic whoosh of a nearby nebulizer. She was perpetually tired, a feeling that had become as familiar as the ache in her lower back after a long day. But beneath the fatigue, a flicker of something else persisted, a stubborn spark of dedication that kept her coming back.

**Setting:**

The story opens within the walls of Bayview Rehabilitation Center, a sprawling, single-story building located in the bustling coastal town of Sarasota, Florida. Bayview caters to a diverse clientele, ranging from elderly patients recovering from hip replacements to young athletes rehabbing sports injuries. The interior is a study in institutional beige, punctuated by the occasional motivational poster featuring stock photos of smiling, overly-enthusiastic people. The main areas include:

*   **The Reception Area:** Dominated by a large, circular desk and always buzzing with activity, staffed by a rotating cast of harried receptionists.

*   **The Physical Therapy Gym:** A vast, open space filled with treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, and a variety of specialized equipment designed to help patients regain mobility and strength.

*   **The Hydrotherapy Pool:** A warm, inviting pool used for aquatic therapy, often filled with the laughter and groans of patients working through their exercises.

*   **Private Treatment Rooms:** Smaller, more intimate spaces used for one-on-one consultations and manual therapy.

Outside, the center is surrounded by meticulously manicured lawns dotted with palm trees and brightly colored bougainvillea, offering a pleasant, albeit slightly superficial, view. The constant hum of traffic from the nearby highway serves as a constant reminder of the world outside, a world that many of Eleanor's patients are desperately trying to return to.
