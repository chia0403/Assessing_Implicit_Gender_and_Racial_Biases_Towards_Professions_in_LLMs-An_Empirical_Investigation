The incessant drip, drip, drip from the leaky faucet in Dr. Eleanor Vance's bathroom was a maddening counterpoint to the quiet hum of her well-ordered life. Eleanor, a clinical psychologist of considerable renown, had built her career on helping others find solace amidst the chaos of their minds. Yet, tonight, the simple imperfection of a worn-out washer threatened to unravel her composure faster than any deep-seated trauma she'd encountered in her years of practice.

Eleanor stood in the doorway, her arms crossed, surveying the damage. Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains of her San Francisco Victorian apartment, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. The bathroom, like the rest of her home, was a testament to her meticulous nature. Off-white subway tiles lined the walls, reflecting the soft light. A single, potted orchid, its blooms a delicate shade of lavender, sat perched on the windowsill. The air smelled faintly of lavender too, a calming scent she often recommended to her patients battling anxiety. Irony, she thought, was a cruel mistress.

Outside, the familiar rumble of the city began to stir. Car horns honked a discordant symphony, and the cable car, a local icon, clanked its way up the steep incline, its bell a cheerful, almost mocking chime. Eleanor knew she should call a plumber, but the thought of inviting a stranger into her carefully curated sanctuary filled her with a strange sense of dread. Besides, she reasoned, a single drip couldn't possibly be that bad. Could it?
