The scent of chlorine hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the fourth graders' earlier swimming lesson. Ms. Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, a woman whose smile was as sunshine-yellow as the construction paper adorning her classroom walls, wrinkled her nose slightly as she scanned the abandoned desks. Late dismissal days were always a little bittersweet. The quiet was welcome, but it also felt like a piece of her heart was missing â€“ the chatter, the clumsy questions, even the incessant tapping of pencils.

Amelia Hawthorne had been teaching third grade at Willow Creek Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, perpetually-green town of Havenwood, Oregon, for the past seven years. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where Friday nights meant high school football and potlucks, and where the biggest excitement of the year was the annual Pumpkin Festival. Willow Creek itself was a single-story brick building, worn around the edges but filled with the boisterous energy of hundreds of young minds. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the faded alphabet rug and the hand-painted world map that dominated one wall. Today, though, the only light came from the harsh fluorescent bulbs overhead, reflecting off the lingering puddles of melted snow that clung to the edges of the windowpanes. Outside, the skeletal branches of the old oak tree in the schoolyard scratched against the building, a lonely, winter melody. Amelia sighed, pulled her cardigan tighter around her, and turned her attention back to the stack of ungraded spelling tests looming on her desk. The quiet wouldn't last forever. Tomorrow, the chaos would reign again.
