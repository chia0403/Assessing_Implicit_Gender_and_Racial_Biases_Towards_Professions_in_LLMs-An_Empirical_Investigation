The stale air of The Rusty Mug hung thick with the ghosts of spilled whiskey, forgotten dreams, and the faint scent of desperation. It was a Tuesday night, which meant business was slow, and the only entertainment for Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins was the flickering neon sign outside that buzzed with a monotonous hum. He leaned against the mahogany bar, worn smooth over decades of elbows and anxious hands, polishing a glass that was already gleaming. His reflection stared back at him â€“ a middle-aged man with kind eyes that were beginning to show the fatigue of listening to too many sad stories and a neatly trimmed mustache that he subconsciously twirled when lost in thought.

The Rusty Mug was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Port Blossom, a coastal town clinging precariously to the edge of the Pacific. Once a thriving fishing hub, Port Blossom had slowly succumbed to the allure of bigger cities and brighter futures. The docks were mostly empty, the canneries stood silent and rusting, and the only people who frequented The Rusty Mug these days were the few remaining fishermen, the occasional lost tourist, and a handful of locals who found solace in the dim lighting and the strong drinks. It was a place where time seemed to move slower, where secrets were whispered and regrets were drowned, and where Bartholomew Higgins poured hope one shot at a time.
