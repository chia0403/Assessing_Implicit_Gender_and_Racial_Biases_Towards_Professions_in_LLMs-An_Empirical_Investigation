## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The crisp air of late autumn swirled around the wrought iron benches outside the Willow Creek Assisted Living Facility in Vermont. Golden leaves, stubborn holdouts from October, clung precariously to bare branches, rustling a melancholic tune against the brick facade. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of pine cleaner and slightly overcooked broccoli.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Margaret Reynolds sighed, the cool breath fogging momentarily in front of her face. The weight of her clipboard felt heavier than usual. She’d been an occupational therapist at Willow Creek for nearly five years, and some days, like today, the weight of her patients' struggles settled deep in her bones. She adjusted the strap of her canvas tote bag, filled with adaptive tools and therapy putty, and pushed through the heavy oak doors of the facility. Today’s schedule was a challenging one: Mr. Henderson, who stubbornly refused to admit his tremor impacted his painting, and Mrs. Peterson, a former concert pianist who hadn’t touched a piano key in years, her fingers now knotted with arthritis. Eleanor squared her shoulders, forcing a smile to her face. "Time to bring a little sunshine," she murmured to herself, knowing that even the smallest victory – a firmly gripped brush, a tentatively bent finger – could make all the difference.
