The sun, a malevolent orb today, glinted off the mirrored surfaces of neighboring skyscrapers, reflecting back a warped and fragmented image of her own increasingly fractured career. The OmniCorp logo, a stylized, stylized globe, pulsed on the building across the street, a constant, inescapable reminder of the empire she helped build, and the kingdom she might soon lose. The low hum of the city was a constant drone, a background noise to the more urgent, internal clamor threatening to overwhelm her. Today, the hum felt less like progress and more like a dirge.
