## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air hung heavy in the small, coastal town of Seabreeze, Florida. Salt spray clung to everything, including the chipped paint of the volunteer fire station where Amelia Rose Thorne, EMT, sat perched on the edge of a faded, vinyl-covered chair. The station, a converted garage built onto the back of the post office, smelled faintly of diesel, stale coffee, and the faint, antiseptic tang of her own recently used trauma shears.

**Story Opening:**

The dispatcher's voice, crackling through the aging speaker, sliced through the quiet like a rusty knife. "Squad 3, respond to a possible drowning. Dockside Marina, slip number seven. Repeat, possible drowning, Dockside Marina, slip number seven. Time en route."

Amelia Rose Thorne, her usually vibrant green eyes dulled with fatigue, straightened. The half-eaten granola bar in her hand was forgotten. Drowning. Just what she needed to kick off another gorgeous Florida morning. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the rough skin under her fingernails catching on her cheek. She hated drownings. The fear, the desperation, the too-often-grim outcomeâ€¦ it settled on her like the morning humidity, thick and suffocating.

"Squad 3 en route," she replied, her voice a practiced monotone that masked the sudden spike of adrenaline. She glanced at the clock, the digital numbers glaring: 05:17. Sunrise was still a good hour away, leaving the marina shrouded in a deceptive darkness.

Amelia knew the marina well. Rows of gleaming yachts and humble fishing boats bobbed side-by-side, a stark contrast between wealth and working-class grit that defined Seabreeze. It was usually a peaceful place at this hour, the only sound the gentle lapping of waves against the hulls. Today, she knew, that peace would be shattered. And it was her job, along with whoever else was awake enough to scramble onto the rig, to piece it back together. Or, more likely, to try.
