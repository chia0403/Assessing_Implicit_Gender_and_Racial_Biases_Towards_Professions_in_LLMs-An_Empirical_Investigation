Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Opening:**

The scent of ammonia and stale coffee hung thick in the air, clinging to the blueprint paper that covered almost every available surface. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch meticulously traced a curve, the lead of his mechanical pencil a whisper against the matte surface. He squinted, adjusting the gooseneck lamp to throw more light on the intricate plumbing diagram for the new wing of the St. Jude's Hospital. It was Friday afternoon, nearly quitting time, but Bart was determined to finish the section on the main drain before the weekend. Heâ€™d learned long ago that unfinished work had a way of festering in his mind, invading his dreams with visions of leaky pipes and overflowing toilets. He adjusted his glasses, the plastic frames digging into the bridge of his nose, and just as he was about to complete the line, a rhythmic tapping interrupted his concentration.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the drafting department of "Haldeman & Sons Construction," a moderately successful, family-owned construction company in the mid-sized city of Rockford, Illinois. The department itself is a sprawling, open-plan space located on the second floor of a brick building that has seen better days. Large windows line the north wall, offering a view of the bustling city street below, though often obscured by dust and grime.

The drafting tables, each equipped with a lamp, various drafting tools, and half-finished blueprints, are arranged in neat rows. Blueprints tacked to the walls, or rolled-up in various sizes and stored in cabinets are scattered around the room.

The air is perpetually filled with a low hum - the rhythmic scratching of pencils, the shuffling of papers, and the occasional muttered curse. The clatter of manual typewriters from the secretarial pool on the other side of a glass partition provide a constant background noise. It is a space of technical precision and quiet intensity, a place where ideas take form on paper before being translated into bricks and mortar.
