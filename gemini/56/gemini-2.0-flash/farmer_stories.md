The incessant drone of cicadas was the soundtrack to another sweltering Mississippi summer. Sweat beaded on Jebediah "Jed" Tanner's brow, plastering his faded denim work shirt to his back. He squinted against the glare, the rusty red soil of Tanner Family Farm stretching out before him like a vast, uneven carpet. The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the smell of damp earth and burgeoning cornstalks. Jed wiped his forehead with a calloused hand, leaving a smear of mud across his skin. He was kneeling in the dust, painstakingly examining a single, withered tomato plant, his jaw clenched tight with a worry he knew all too well. This was his livelihood, his heritage, the legacy his grandpappy had carved out of this stubborn land generations ago. And lately, the land seemed to be fighting back.

The farm itself was nestled in a gentle valley, surrounded by rolling hills carpeted with pecan trees and the occasional patch of cotton. A dilapidated barn, its wood bleached silver by years of sun and rain, stood sentinel at the edge of the fields. The farmhouse, a modest two-story structure with a wide, inviting porch, sat further back, its paint peeling in patches like sunburnt skin. It was a beautiful place, steeped in history, but beauty didn't pay the bills. And Jed, despite his best efforts, was starting to feel the familiar, suffocating grip of debt tightening around his throat.
