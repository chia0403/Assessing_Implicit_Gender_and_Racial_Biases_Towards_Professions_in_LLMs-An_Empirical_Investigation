## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of my office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding in my head. The stale cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a testament to the hours I'd spent staring at half-empty glasses and cold case files. Another Friday night in the underbelly of New Orleans, and the only company I had was a flickering neon sign outside that read "FORTUNE TELLERS - PSYCHIC READINGS." Apt, considering I felt like I needed a crystal ball to solve my current case. A case that had landed on my desk like a poisoned beignet, sweet on the surface, deadly underneath. The knock on the door was soft, hesitant, almost swallowed by the storm. Probably another dame with a missing cat and a sob story. But dames, missing cats, and sob stories were all that kept the lights on in this place. I stubbed out my cigarette, took a swig of lukewarm bourbon, and braced myself. "Come in," I growled.

## Setting:

The office of **Elijah "Eli" Beaumont, Private Investigator** is located on the second floor of a dilapidated building in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The building itself is squeezed between a voodoo shop and a dive bar perpetually shrouded in darkness. The exterior paint is peeling, revealing layers of faded blues and yellows, and the iron balcony is rusted and bowed. Inside, Eli's office is a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of files teeter precariously on every surface, threatening to topple at the slightest provocation. A worn leather armchair sits in front of a scarred wooden desk, perpetually littered with photographs, ashtrays, and half-empty bourbon glasses. A single, bare lightbulb hangs from the ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows across the room. The walls are adorned with framed newspaper clippings of past cases, faded posters of iconic New Orleans jazz musicians, and a tattered map of the city, meticulously marked with pins denoting locations of interest. The air is thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey, and the faint, lingering aroma of jasmine from the nearby French Market. Outside, the constant hum of the city – the distant wail of a saxophone, the rumble of a streetcar, the murmuring of a thousand secrets – seeps through the thin walls, a constant reminder of the city's vibrant, dangerous heart.
