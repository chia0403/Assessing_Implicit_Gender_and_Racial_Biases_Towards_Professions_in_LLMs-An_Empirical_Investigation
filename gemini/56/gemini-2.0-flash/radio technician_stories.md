## The Hum in the Walls

The biting Alaskan wind clawed at the plywood walls of the Nome Weather Radio outpost, a constant, mournful howl that mirrored the persistent hum eating away at Samuel Elijah Olsen's sanity. He was a man who thrived on silence, the kind of profound quiet only found in the vast, snow-dusted landscapes of the Last Frontier. But the silence had been invaded, corrupted, by a low, guttural thrum that emanated not from the transmitters, not from the faulty generator outside, but… from the very fabric of the building itself.

Samuel adjusted his thick-rimmed glasses, the lenses fogging over as he exhaled a frustrated sigh. The interior of the outpost was cramped, a chaotic ballet of wires, soldering irons, and disassembled radios. Maps of the Bering Sea, riddled with hand-drawn notations about weather patterns and shipping lanes, covered one wall. On another, a corkboard bristled with faded photographs of smiling faces, faces of fishermen and bush pilots who relied on his clear broadcasts to navigate the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. He felt a responsibility to these people, a weight he carried with the same stoic acceptance he reserved for the relentless Alaskan weather.

But this hum… this wasn't weather. This was something else entirely.
