**Opening:**

The scent of stale potpourri and desperation hung heavy in the air, clinging to the threadbare floral wallpaper like a tenacious weed. Amelia Hawthorne, a name more suited to a society debutante than a struggling real estate agent, grimaced and adjusted her perfectly coiffed blonde bob. Even her carefully chosen power suit felt somehow deflated in the face of this… *property*. She took a deep, steadying breath, plastered on her most professional smile, and rang the doorbell. Three long rings echoed through the house, each one a tiny hammer blow against her dwindling optimism.

**Setting:**

The dilapidated Victorian house stood on Sycamore Street, the less glamorous end of Willow Creek. Willow Creek, in its heyday, had been a thriving, picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Now, it was a shadow of its former self, struggling against the tides of economic downturn and urban sprawl. Sycamore Street, once lined with stately homes and meticulously manicured gardens, was now peppered with boarded-up windows, overgrown lawns, and the lingering scent of decay.

Amelia hated selling in this part of town. Every listing felt like a personal defeat, a stark reminder of the dreams that had withered and died. But she was a Hawthorne, and Hawthornes didn’t give up. Even when selling houses that looked like they were on the verge of collapsing into the earth itself.
