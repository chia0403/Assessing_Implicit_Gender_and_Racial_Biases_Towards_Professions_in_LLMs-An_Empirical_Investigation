The thick aroma of garlic, rosemary, and simmering tomatoes hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything in The Copper Kettle like a loving, greasy embrace. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windows of the little Italian restaurant, painted dusty gold patterns on the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the relentless Brooklyn hum of traffic and arguing neighbors provided a constant, if unwelcome, soundtrack. Inside, the clatter of pots and pans, the rhythmic thwack of a cleaver against a wooden chopping board, and the soft murmur of the gas stove created a familiar, almost comforting cacophony.

This was Carmine Bellafiore's domain. At 47, Carmine had spent the better part of his life in the kitchen, his hands perpetually stained with tomato sauce and olive oil. He was a large man, built like a bear with a surprisingly delicate touch when it came to preparing his Nonna's ravioli. He knew every crack in the countertop, every idiosyncrasy of the ancient oven, every whispered secret the Copper Kettle held. And right now, as he meticulously chopped a handful of fresh basil, he was preparing to face the lunchtime rush, a daily battle he both dreaded and deeply relished.
