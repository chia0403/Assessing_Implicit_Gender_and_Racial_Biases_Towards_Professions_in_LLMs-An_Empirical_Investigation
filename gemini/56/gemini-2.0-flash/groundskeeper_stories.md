Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper as the main character:

**Setting:**

The story begins on the sprawling, historic estate of Blackwood Manor, nestled deep in the Cotswolds region of England. Blackwood Manor is a relic of a bygone era: a gothic revival mansion with turrets that claw at the perpetually overcast sky, surrounded by acres of meticulously maintained gardens, ancient woodlands, and a serpentine lake shrouded in mist. The property is steeped in local legend, whispered tales of hauntings, lost fortunes, and the tragic Blackwood family. It's late autumn; the air is crisp and carries the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and woodsmoke from the manor's chimneys. The gardens, though beautiful, bear the somber hues of the season: russet, gold, and brown dominate, punctuated by the vibrant crimson of late-blooming roses.

**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped at Barnaby Finch's worn tweed jacket as he wrestled with the recalcitrant leaves clogging the drainage grate near the west wing of Blackwood Manor. Barnaby, a man whose age was etched in the deep lines around his kind eyes and the stoop in his shoulders, muttered a string of colorful curses under his breath. He’d been the groundskeeper here for nearly thirty years, ever since he'd returned from the Navy and found himself adrift. Back then, the garden was a verdant paradise; now, under the current owner’s neglect, Barnaby did his best to keep the encroaching wildness at bay. He sighed, the sound lost in the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a rook. He knew the signs – the unseasonable frost nipping at the late blooms, the unsettling quiet in the woods, and the way the mist seemed to cling to the manor like a shroud. Something was stirring at Blackwood Manor, something more than just the changing seasons, and Barnaby Finch had a sinking feeling it wasn’t good.
