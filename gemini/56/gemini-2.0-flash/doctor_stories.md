Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a doctor as the main character:

**Setting:** A small, wind-battered island called "Isle of Skye," nestled off the coast of Scotland. The year is 1932. The village, Portree, is a scattering of whitewashed cottages clinging precariously to the cliffs, their roofs weighed down against the relentless gales. The doctor's surgery, a modest building with a faded green door and a sign proclaiming "Dr. Isobel MacIntyre," overlooks the choppy grey waters of the harbor.

**Opening:**

The telegram arrived with the dawn, its stark white contrasting sharply with the peat-stained fingers of young Alasdair, the village boy who delivered it. Dr. Isobel MacIntyre, her face already etched with the weariness of countless sleepless nights, tore it open with a grim certainty. She knew, with a chilling premonition, that the terse words printed in bold black ink would disrupt the fragile peace she'd finally found on Isle of Skye.

*"SEVERE PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK EDINBURGH. IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED. REGARDS, PROFESSOR GRAHAM."*

Isobel stared out at the churning sea, the familiar rhythm of the waves usually a solace now a taunt. Edinburgh. The city she'd fled, the memories she'd tried to bury beneath the rugged landscape and the stoic faces of the islanders. Returning meant facing not just the disease, but the ghosts she'd so desperately tried to outrun. But how could she refuse? People were dying. She was a doctor. And Isobel MacIntyre had never been one to back down from a fight, even one with her own past.
