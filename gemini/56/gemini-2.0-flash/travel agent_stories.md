The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights in "Escape Artists Travel" always seemed to amplify the late afternoon slump. Elara Josephine Cavendish, perched precariously on a stack of brochures featuring the cerulean waters of Santorini, sighed dramatically. Outside, the September rain hammered against the plate glass window, turning the bustling street of Maplewood into a blurry Impressionist painting. Inside, the scent of instant coffee warred with the faint, cloying sweetness of air freshener, creating an aroma that Elara affectionately referred to as "Corporate Comfort."

Escape Artists Travel wasn’t exactly glamorous. Located in a strip mall wedged between a dry cleaner and a perpetually-closing-and-reopening pizza place, its clientele leaned more towards budget-friendly family vacations and predictable cruises than exotic adventures. Elara, a woman whose dreams were filled with the scent of Himalayan spices and the vibrant colours of Moroccan souks, often felt like a caged bird trapped in a pastel-coloured aviary. She plastered on a smile each day, diligently selling all-inclusive resorts and package deals to families she suspected hadn’t ventured further than the local outlet mall, all while silently plotting her own escape.
