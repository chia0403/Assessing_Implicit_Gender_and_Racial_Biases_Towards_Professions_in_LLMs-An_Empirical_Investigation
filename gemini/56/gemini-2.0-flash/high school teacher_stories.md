## Story Opening:

The chalk dust swirled around Ms. Evelyn Rosewood like a miniature snowstorm, clinging to the tips of her auburn hair and settling in the fine lines around her eyes. She coughed lightly, waving a hand in front of her face. "Alright, Tennyson, settle down! We haven't even made it to the iambic pentameter yet and you're already declaring Keats boring!"

A chorus of groans rippled through the classroom, punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of teenage boredom. Evelyn sighed, a familiar weariness settling in her shoulders. This was her life: a constant battle against the inertia of indifference, armed only with poetry, passion, and a stubborn refusal to let a single student slip through the cracks.

She leaned against the whiteboard, the familiar scent of dry erase markers a strange comfort. Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the stormy atmosphere that often brewed within the confines of Room 212. "Look," she said, her voice softening, "Keats isn't just about flowery language and dying of consumption. He's about beauty, about confronting mortality, about..."

Suddenly, her phone buzzed insistently on the desk. She glanced at the caller ID: Principal Thompson. Her stomach dropped. That usually meant only one thing: trouble. And trouble, as Ms. Evelyn Rosewood was quickly discovering, was becoming her unwelcome specialty.

## Setting:

**Location:** Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building located in the sleepy, rain-soaked town of Havenwood, Oregon.

**Time:** Late afternoon, November.

**Details:** Room 212 is a typical high school English classroom: fluorescent lights hum overhead, illuminating faded posters of literary giants and student artwork. Scuffed linoleum tiles cover the floor, and rows of mismatched desks face a worn whiteboard. Bookshelves overflow with paperbacks, many well-loved and dog-eared. The overall impression is one of comfortable chaos, a space that has seen years of whispered secrets, heated debates, and the slow, steady growth of young minds. The large windows offer a bleak view of the school's parking lot, currently deserted except for a few lonely puddles reflecting the grey sky. The air is heavy with the scent of rain, chalk dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of stale coffee â€“ a testament to Evelyn's unwavering commitment to her students, and her dependence on caffeine to get her through the day.
