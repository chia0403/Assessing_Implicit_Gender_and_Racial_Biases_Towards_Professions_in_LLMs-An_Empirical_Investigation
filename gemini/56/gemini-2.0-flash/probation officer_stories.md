Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a probation officer named **Eliza Mae Thornton**:

**Opening:**

The smell of burnt coffee and stale despair clung to the air of the King County Probation Office like a persistent cough. Eliza Mae Thornton, her name tag slightly askew after a particularly rough morning, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a constant, irritating drone that mirrored the anxiety bubbling beneath her skin. Today was parole review day for Daniel "Danny Boy" O’Malley, a charmer with a rap sheet longer than the I-5 and a knack for looking perpetually innocent. Eliza had poured over his file all weekend, each documented incident of petty theft and escalating assault a tiny weight dragging her down. She knew O’Malley's story, the same tired tale of poverty, neglect, and bad choices. She also knew the devastating impact his choices had on his victims. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly onward, each second a step closer to facing his honeyed words and carefully crafted apologies, knowing damn well he'd be back in her office within six months, having violated parole in some spectacularly stupid way.

**Setting:**

The King County Probation Office, located in a nondescript, five-story building in downtown Seattle, is a symphony of utilitarian drabness. Think government-issue beige: beige walls, beige carpets, beige metal desks arranged in cramped cubicles. The air conditioning always seemed to be broken, either blasting arctic air or providing no relief from the muggy Seattle summers. The waiting room is a collection of mismatched plastic chairs, worn thin from years of nervous fidgeting, and a stack of outdated magazines. Security is present, a bored-looking guard sitting behind a thick pane of bulletproof glass, but the overall atmosphere is more of weary resignation than overt tension. The building overlooks a busy intersection, the constant drone of traffic a reminder that life continues, albeit in a very different way, outside the confines of these beige walls. Eliza's office, like the rest, is small and impersonal. A family photo, tucked in the corner of her desk, is the only personal touch amidst the stacks of files and overflowing in-tray.
