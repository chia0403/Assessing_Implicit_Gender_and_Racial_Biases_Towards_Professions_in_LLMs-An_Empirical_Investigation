**Opening:**

The lukewarm coffee tasted vaguely of disappointment, not unlike most of Reginald Archibald Finchley's days lately. He swirled the dregs in his paper cup, watching the brown liquid climb the sides and reluctantly slide back down. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on a kaleidoscope of pastel buildings, a vibrant contrast to the dull ache in his chest. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that if he didn't close at least one deal today, his name would soon be mud, or worse – just plain forgotten – at Sunshine Solar Solutions.

**Setting:**

Reginald Archibald Finchley, a man whose receding hairline and perpetually sweating brow belied his youthful enthusiasm (or at least, *used* to), found himself parked outside a flamingo-pink duplex in Little Havana. A rusty chain-link fence sagged around the property, adorned with wilting hibiscus and a chorus of clucking chickens that seemed to mock his every move. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of exhaust fumes, fried plantains, and something vaguely medicinal that he couldn't quite place. Across the street, children shrieked with laughter as they chased a rogue soccer ball, their energy a stark reminder of his own dwindling reserves. This was his territory. This was Little Havana. And this, he suspected, was going to be a *very* long day.
