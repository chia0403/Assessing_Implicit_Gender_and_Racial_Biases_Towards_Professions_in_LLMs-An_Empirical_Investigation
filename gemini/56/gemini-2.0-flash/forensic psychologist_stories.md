## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The suffocating humidity hung heavy in the air of New Orleans, a tangible thing that clung to everything – the wrought-iron balconies of the French Quarter, the chipped paint of shotgun houses in Tremé, and the very skin of Dr. Evelyn Reed, PhD. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late August, just before the peak of hurricane season, and the city thrummed with a nervous energy, a low-level anxiety that mirrored Evelyn's own. She preferred the controlled, sterile environment of her office at the Orleans Parish Criminal Court to the simmering chaos outside, but today, even that felt tainted.

**Opening:** The insistent ring of her antique rotary phone, a defiant relic in her otherwise modernly-equipped office, dragged Dr. Evelyn Reed from the depths of a particularly troubling file. The grainy image of a young woman stared back at her from the photograph stapled to the top sheet – vacant eyes, smeared lipstick, and the chillingly precise, almost artistic arrangement of her limbs. Evelyn knew, without needing to reread the autopsy report, that the girl hadn't died quickly.

She picked up the receiver, the bakelite warm against her ear. "Dr. Reed speaking."

A gravelly voice crackled through the line. "Doctor, this is Detective Beaumont with the NOPD. We have a situation. One you might find… interesting." He paused, the static crackling filling the void. "Looks like someone's decided to make a spectacle out of death down in the bayou. And frankly, Doctor, we're stumped."
