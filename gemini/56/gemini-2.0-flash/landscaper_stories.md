The insistent whine of the weed whacker was a familiar morning symphony to anyone within a three-block radius of Mrs. Hawthorne’s award-winning rose garden. And it was the bane of Bartholomew “Bart” Finch’s existence, especially at 6:00 AM on a Saturday.

Bart, a man built like a sturdy oak sapling himself, paused his labors, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his dirt-stained gardening glove. The dew-kissed lawns of Willow Creek Estates, where he’d carved out a modest living tending to the manicured dreams of the wealthy, shimmered under the nascent sun. Birds chirped obnoxiously, as if mocking his early rise. Even the meticulously arranged petunias along the cobblestone walkways seemed to judge his lack of enthusiasm.

Willow Creek Estates, nestled in the rolling hills just outside the affluent town of Oakhaven, was a carefully curated paradise. Every blade of grass was perfectly trimmed, every rose bush pruned to a perfect, geometric ideal. The houses were grand, imposing, and built to a strict aesthetic code - think colonial revival meets Hamptons chic. Bart, who preferred the wild, untamed beauty of the surrounding forest, often felt like an alien in this perfectly sculpted landscape. But, bills were bills, and Mrs. Hawthorne, with her prize-winning blooms and eagle-eyed scrutiny, paid handsomely.
