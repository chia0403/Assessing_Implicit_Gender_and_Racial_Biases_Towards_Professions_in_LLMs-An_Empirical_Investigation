## Opening & Setting

The sharp tang of granite dust hung heavy in the air, a perpetual shroud clinging to the nostrils of Elias Thorne. Sunlight, filtered through the gaps between the haphazardly stacked blocks of raw stone, painted striped patterns across his thick forearms. He paused, his hammer poised mid-swing, and wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grey across his forehead.

The settlement of Quarry's End was a place sculpted by necessity and grit. Nestled at the foot of the jagged, unforgiving Stone Fang mountains, it existed solely to carve the grey giants that loomed above it. Wooden shacks, stained the same dusty grey as the surrounding landscape, huddled together like frightened animals. The rhythmic clang of hammers and chisels formed the heartbeat of the town, a constant pulse that vibrated through the very ground beneath your feet. Children played amongst discarded chips of stone, their laughter thin and reedy in the face of the mountain's silent dominance. Even the air seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next block to be cleaved, the next monument to be born from the unyielding rock.

Elias Thorne, his hair the color of weathered slate, stood before a massive block of granite, its surface still rough and untamed. This was to be the keystone for the new cathedral in Silverhaven, a commission that could elevate him from the ranks of common stone cutters to something approaching respectability. He ran a calloused finger along a barely visible crack in the stone, a frown etching itself deeper into the lines already carved by years of sun and toil. This piece... this piece had promise. But it also held secrets, and Elias knew all too well that secrets in stone could shatter dreams, and break more than just rock.
