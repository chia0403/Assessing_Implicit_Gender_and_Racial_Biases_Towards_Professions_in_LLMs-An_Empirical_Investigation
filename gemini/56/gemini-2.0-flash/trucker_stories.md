The setting was a greasy spoon diner called "The Last Chance Cafe" just outside of Tucumcari, New Mexico. It was 3:00 AM, the kind of hour that only truck drivers, insomniacs, and short-order cooks understood. Neon signs flickered weakly in the pre-dawn darkness, casting an orange glow onto the cracked vinyl booths inside. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying bacon, and desperation.

Behind the wheel of his Peterbilt semi, a mountain of chrome and steel affectionately nicknamed "The Beast," sat Clarence "Clancy" Theodore Butterfield. Heâ€™d just finished his shift, a gruelling twelve-hour haul from Amarillo, and the promise of coffee stronger than jet fuel was the only thing that had kept him going those last few miles. Clancy pushed open the diner door, the little bell above jingling a discordant welcome. He was a bear of a man, with a weathered face, calloused hands, and a permanent squint etched around his blue eyes from years spent staring down endless highways. He surveyed the scene with a practiced glance, a weary acknowledgment of the solitude he knew so well. Only two other souls occupied the diner at this ungodly hour: a young waitress with tired eyes and a perpetually gum-chewing smile, and a grizzled old timer nursing a cup of coffee like it was the last precious liquid on Earth.
