## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The high, arid air of Taos, New Mexico, hung crisp and unforgiving. It was late afternoon, the sun a fiery orb dipping towards the jagged peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The adobe walls of the clinic radiated stored heat, a temporary comfort against the encroaching chill of the desert night. Inside, the hum of the aging HVAC system was the only sound besides the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of fingers on a keyboard.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Elena Ramirez was running late again. Not surprising, really. Elena lived by a different clock, one dictated by the needs of the pueblo, the tourists, and the stubborn, sun-baked residents of Taos County. That left Evelyn Marie Sandoval, physician's assistant, to navigate the growing logjam of patients with a blend of efficiency and empathy that Elena often lacked. Evelyn sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. She was already an hour behind, and old Mr. Trujillo was getting increasingly agitated in Exam Room 2 about his "varicose veins the size of anaconda." She just hoped he hadn't started regaling the receptionist, Maria, with his colorful metaphors again. She leaned back in her worn office chair, the pleather cracking softly beneath her. Another deep breath. Time to put on her game face and face the afternoon gauntlet.
