## Story Opening:

The persistent buzz of the fluorescent lights hummed a discordant counterpoint to the gentle, almost meditative music filtering from Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's computer. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the phantom scent of lavender and peppermint clinging to her fingers from Mrs. Hathaway's aromatherapy session that morning. It was nearing the end of a particularly brutal Tuesday, a day that had begun with a tearful confession of marital infidelity and spiraled downwards from there. Ellie longed for the quiet solace of her own apartment, a glass of crisp Sauvignon Blanc, and the latest episode of her guilty pleasure, a reality TV show about competitive pottery.

She glanced at her watch. Just one more session. One more soul to soothe.

A nervous cough echoed from the waiting room. "Ah, showtime," she murmured to herself, pulling on her professional smile like a well-worn, comfortable glove. It wouldn't do to let the tiredness seep into her expression. Sarah had said it just the other day, hadn't she? That Ellie's calm demeanor was a lifeline. A rock in the turbulent sea of her own anxieties.

Ellie straightened her navy blue blazer, smoothed down a stray strand of her auburn hair, and pushed open the door to the waiting room, her voice carefully modulated to a warm, welcoming timbre.

"Mr. Abernathy? I'm Dr. Vance. Please, come in."

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was located on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Maplewood, a charming, affluent suburb outside of Chicago. The building, painted a soothing shade of sage green, housed a small collection of independent practitioners: a chiropractor, a massage therapist, and a dietician. Each office was carefully curated to reflect the personality and therapeutic style of its occupant.

Ellie's space was designed to be a haven of tranquility. The walls were painted a soft, calming grey, adorned with abstract artwork in muted tones. A plush, off-white rug cushioned the floor, absorbing sound and creating a feeling of warmth. Two comfortable armchairs, upholstered in a floral print, faced each other across a small, round coffee table. A fiddle-leaf fig, carefully positioned near the window, added a touch of nature and vibrancy to the room. Bookshelves lined one wall, filled with texts on psychology, self-help, and a surprising number of novels. A small desk tucked into the corner served as her administrative hub, but it was kept meticulously organized, ensuring that it didn't disrupt the overall sense of peace. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating the room and casting long, dancing shadows across the floor. The overall effect was one of understated elegance and quiet comfort, a place where patients could feel safe enough to unravel their deepest anxieties and vulnerabilities.
