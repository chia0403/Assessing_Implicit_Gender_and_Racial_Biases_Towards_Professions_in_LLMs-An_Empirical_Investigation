## Story Opening:

The air in the Grand Majestic Theatre was thick with anticipation, less like the nervous excitement that precedes a premiere and more like the impending doom before a storm. Arthur Benedict Cavendish, his charcoal-grey cashmere scarf askew and his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, paced the orchestra pit, a whirlwind of suppressed anxiety in a perfectly tailored tweed suit. He felt it, a cold, creeping dread that clung to the plush velvet seats and the gilded cherubs adorning the proscenium arch. Tonight was not just another opening night. Tonight was *Macbeth*.

Arthur stopped abruptly, his gaze fixed on the stage where a single, flickering work light cast long, skeletal shadows. The Scottish play. Universally cursed, he knew. And yet, he had, in his arguably arrogant hubris, convinced himself he could tame it. He could elevate it. He could make the Grand Majestic, a theatre clinging to the tattered remnants of its former glory, rise again on the wings of Shakespearean tragedy.

But the wings felt heavy tonight. Far too heavy. He had a terrible feeling something was about to go disastrously, irrevocably wrong.

## Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Theatre, London, England. Present Day.**

The Grand Majestic Theatre, a relic of the Victorian era, stands on a quiet side street just off the bustling Strand. Once a beacon of London's theatrical scene, showcasing the brightest stars and the most lavish productions, it now bears the visible scars of time and neglect. The once-gleaming gold leaf that adorns the balconies is chipped and faded. The plush velvet seats are worn and sag in places. The air is thick with the scent of dust and history, a musty fragrance that whispers of forgotten triumphs and long-gone applause.

Despite its declining state, the theatre possesses a certain undeniable grandeur. The high ceilings, the ornate plasterwork, the sheer scale of the stage, all speak to a bygone era of opulence and theatrical magic. The ghost of past performances hangs heavy in the air, a palpable presence that can be felt even in the empty halls. Arthur, a lifelong admirer of the theatre, had poured his heart and soul, not to mention the last of his dwindling savings, into restoring it to some semblance of its former glory, hoping to breathe new life into its faded grandeur.
