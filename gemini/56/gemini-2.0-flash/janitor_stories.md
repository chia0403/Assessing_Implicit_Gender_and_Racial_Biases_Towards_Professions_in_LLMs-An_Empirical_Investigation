Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a janitor as the main character:

**Setting:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of the Crystal Ballroom cast a harsh, unforgiving glow on the aftermath of the annual "Tech Titans" gala. Empty champagne flutes lay scattered like fallen soldiers across the crimson carpet, their bases ringed with lipstick stains and the faint echo of drunken toasts. Confetti, in a gaudy spray of silver and holographic blue, clung to everything, a sticky reminder of forced revelry. The air still hummed with the faint scent of expensive perfume and desperation. Towering screens, now blank, showed ghostly reflections of the room, mocking its emptiness. The ballroom, once a shimmering beacon of wealth and innovation, now felt like a giant, abandoned stage, waiting for the next act.

**Story Opening:**

Cyrus Bartholomew Penhaligon, a man more accustomed to the shadows than spotlights, surveyed the chaotic scene with a sigh that hitched somewhere in his chest. He'd seen this play out a hundred times before, the ebb and flow of opulent parties, the careless disregard left in their wake. He adjusted his blue, company-issued overalls, the fabric worn thin in places, and rolled up the sleeves of his faded flannel shirt. He was no stranger to this place. He *was* this place, in a way, its silent guardian, its invisible cleaner-upper. The Tech Titans had departed hours ago, off to conquer more worlds with their algorithms and innovations, leaving him, Cyrus Bartholomew Penhaligon, to wrestle with their discarded dreams and forgotten promises. He picked up a stray sequin that had escaped a discarded gown, examining it with a brief, unreadable expression. "Right then," he muttered to the silent ballroom, his voice a low rumble that was swallowed by the vastness. "Let's get you back to respectable, shall we?" He started with the vacuum cleaner, the drone of the motor echoing through the empty ballroom, marking the start of another long night.
