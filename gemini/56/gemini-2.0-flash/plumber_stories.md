## Story Opening:

The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Finch like a physical blow, a putrid wave of sewage and stale coffee that slammed against his sinuses and made his eyes water. He swore under his breath, the muttered curse barely audible over the cacophony of a toddler’s tantrum echoing from somewhere deep within the house. Bart adjusted the wrench in his calloused hand and took another hesitant step into the dimly lit hallway, his work boots squeaking on the grime-caked linoleum. This was it. This was the kind of job that made him question every life choice he’d ever made, every decision that had led him to this moment, standing on the threshold of what he was increasingly sure was a biohazard zone. He just hoped he had enough air freshener in the van.

## Setting:

The setting is a dilapidated, two-story Victorian house located in the outskirts of a small, forgotten town called Willow Creek. The house, once grand, now wears its age like a shroud: paint peeling in long, curling strips, porch steps listing precariously to one side, and windows that seem to stare out with vacant, accusing eyes. Overgrown weeds choke the garden, obscuring a rusted swing set and a crumbling birdbath. The general impression is one of profound neglect, a place where time has stalled and something unpleasant festers beneath the surface. The interior, glimpsed through the doorway, is even more unsettling. Shadows cling to every corner, dust motes dance in the faint light filtering through grimy windows, and the air hangs heavy with a palpable sense of decay. It feels more haunted than lived-in.
