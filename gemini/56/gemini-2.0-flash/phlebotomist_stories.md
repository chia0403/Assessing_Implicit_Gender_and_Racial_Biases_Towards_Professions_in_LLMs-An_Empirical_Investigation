**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant lullaby as Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, her face etched with a practiced neutrality, adjusted the tourniquet on Mr. Henderson's frail arm. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a constant, clinging reminder of the battles fought and sometimes lost within these walls. Mr. Henderson, bless his cotton socks, was rambling again about the pigeons that nested on his fire escape, their cooing a comforting counterpoint to the city's ceaseless roar. Eleanor, however, wasn't listening. Her mind was a kaleidoscope of anxieties: the screaming toddler in Room 3, the backlog of blood draws threatening to engulf her desk, and the nagging feeling that she'd forgotten to defrost the chicken for dinner. Just another Monday at Mercy General.

**Setting:**

Mercy General Hospital, a monolithic structure of brick and grime in the heart of downtown, had seen better days. Once a beacon of hope and healing, it now stood as a testament to budget cuts and bureaucratic red tape. The hallways, a labyrinth of chipped paint and flickering lights, echoed with the sighs of overworked nurses, the hurried footsteps of doctors, and the muffled sobs of worried family members. Eleanor worked primarily in the outpatient lab, a cramped and perpetually bustling space located on the first floor, just down from the radiology department. Three phlebotomy chairs, perpetually occupied, faced a wall adorned with outdated anatomical posters. A small, chaotic desk overflowed with requisitions, tubes, and paperwork, the epicenter of Eleanor's daily struggle to maintain order amidst the chaos. The only respite was the small, grime-streaked window offering a glimpse of the city's indifferent skyline, a daily reminder that life, however messy and complicated, continued beyond the walls of Mercy General.
