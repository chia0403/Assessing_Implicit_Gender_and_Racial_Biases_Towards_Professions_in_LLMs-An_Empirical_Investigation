## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scream ripped through the cabin like a jagged tear in silk. Amelia "Amy" Harding, flight attendant extraordinaire for Pacific Air, nearly dropped the tray of lukewarm coffee she was balancing. It wasn't the usual turbulence-induced yelp. This was raw, primal terror. Amy, her smile instantly plastered back on like a well-rehearsed mask, abandoned the coffee and sprinted towards the source, her sensible heels clicking sharply on the carpeted aisle. As she rounded the corner into Business Class, she wished she'd just dropped the damn coffee.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolded inside the cabin of a Boeing 777-300ER, specifically Pacific Air Flight 808 bound for Honolulu from Sydney. It was approximately six hours into the twelve-hour flight, meaning the majority of passengers were either sleeping, staring blankly at their screens, or subtly complaining about the inadequate legroom. The lighting was dimmed, casting long, dramatic shadows down the aisles, and the hum of the engines was a constant, lulling drone. The air, perpetually circulated and slightly dry, carried the faint aroma of airplane food and recycled dreams. The flight was about halfway over the vast, empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean, a point of no return and undeniable isolation.
