The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Jebediah "Jeb" Tucker's weathered face, carving deeper lines around his squinting eyes. He leaned against the rough-hewn fence post, the dry, cracked wood offering little respite from the heat radiating off the parched earth. Dust devils danced on the horizon, mocking his efforts to keep the soil from simply blowing away. The silence was broken only by the mournful lowing of a distant cow, a sound that echoed Jeb's own weariness.

The setting was the Broken Spur Ranch, a sprawling, if unforgiving, piece of land nestled in the desolate heart of Cochise County, Arizona. Jeb's family had homesteaded here three generations ago, carving a life out of the harsh desert. It wasn't easy, but the Tuckers were a stubborn breed. The main house, a low, adobe structure that had seen better days, stood as a testament to their tenacity. A windmill, creaking and groaning in the breeze, provided the ranch's only source of water, a precious commodity Jeb guarded fiercely. The surrounding land, though vast, was mostly scrub brush and sparse grasslands, barely enough to sustain the herd of cattle Jeb managed to keep going. The Broken Spur wasn't just a ranch; it was Jebediah Tucker's inheritance, his burden, and the only home he'd ever known.
