Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an interior decorator named Eliza Magnolia Thorne:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, swirling snow against the grand, but slightly dilapidated, facade of the Chadwick Mansion. Located on Chicago’s Gold Coast, the mansion, a relic from the Gilded Age, sat perched overlooking the grey, choppy water. Gargoyles, chipped and stained with centuries of soot and grime, seemed to frown down on the street below. Inside, the cavernous rooms echoed with the ghosts of extravagant parties and hushed secrets. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light that pierced through the grimy, leaded glass windows, illuminating peeling wallpaper, threadbare carpets, and forgotten treasures shrouded in linen sheets. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster, mothballs, and a faint, lingering perfume that hinted at a bygone era.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Magnolia Thorne shivered, pulling her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck. The Chadwick Mansion radiated an unsettling chill that seeped into her bones, a chill far deeper than the January wind could account for. "Good lord," she breathed, the words puffing out as small clouds in the frigid air, "it's like stepping into a Dickens novel."

She clutched her well-worn leather satchel, filled with fabric swatches and floor plans, a small island of colour against the monochrome gloom. Mrs. Chadwick, the frail and surprisingly sharp-tongued matriarch of the family, had insisted Eliza take the job personally. "No bright young things," she’d rasped, her voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement. "I want someone with… *understanding*. And a backbone."

Eliza Magnolia Thorne certainly had both. She'd built her reputation on breathing life back into forgotten spaces, on coaxing beauty from the bones of neglected buildings. But even *she* felt a prickle of unease in this place. The Chadwick Mansion wasn't just neglected; it felt… burdened.

The massive oak front door creaked open, revealing a silhouette against the dim light. "Ms. Thorne, I presume?" a voice, raspy and low, called out. "Welcome to a bit of a fixer-upper."
