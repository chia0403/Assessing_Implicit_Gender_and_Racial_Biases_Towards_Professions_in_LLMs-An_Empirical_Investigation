## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous dirge, a constant companion to Agnes Clementine Bellweather during her Tuesday night shift. At 8:47 PM, Agnes was staring blankly at a half-eaten bag of gummy bears abandoned near register six, wondering if ants preferred red or green, when the door chimed. A gust of wind, smelling of wet pavement and something indefinably urban, swept into the brightly lit convenience store, announcing the arrival of a man who looked like he'd stepped out of a black and white photograph. He was tall, with a fedora pulled low over his brow and a long, dark coat that swirled around his ankles like a shadowy embrace. He moved with a slow, deliberate grace that seemed out of place in the brightly-colored aisle of instant ramen and bargain candy. Agnes, who usually considered Tuesdays blessedly uneventful, felt a shiver crawl down her spine. This wasn't just some late-night snack run. This was something different.

## Setting:

The "Quick Stop & Go" convenience store sat on a quiet corner of a perpetually busy street in the fading industrial district of Port Aurora. The city, once a thriving hub for shipbuilding and manufacturing, had long since fallen on harder times, and the Quick Stop, with its peeling paint and slightly crooked signage, felt like a relic of a bygone era. Inside, the linoleum floor was a mosaic of scuffs and stains, illuminated by the aforementioned harsh fluorescent lights that did little to flatter the brightly packaged goods stacked haphazardly on the shelves. Aisles overflowed with chips, sugary cereals, and a questionable assortment of frozen dinners. A small, dusty coffee machine gurgled forlornly in the corner, and the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the sounds of the city – the distant wail of sirens, the rumble of buses, and the murmur of conversations – provided a constant, almost imperceptible, background hum. The store was Agnes's temporary sanctuary, a place where she could retreat from the complexities of her life and lose herself in the mundane rhythms of ringing up groceries and making small talk with the occasional customer. But tonight, that sanctuary felt distinctly less safe.
