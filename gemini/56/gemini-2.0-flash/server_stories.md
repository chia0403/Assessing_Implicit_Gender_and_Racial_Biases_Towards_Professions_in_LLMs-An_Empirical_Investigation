Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the requested details:

**Setting:**

The Salt Kettle Diner sat on the edge of Harmony Bay, a greasy spoon that had seen better days – and better grease. The vinyl booths were cracked and sticky, the chrome trim was pitted with rust, and the aroma perpetually hung somewhere between burnt coffee and yesterday's fried fish.  Sunlight streamed through the large picture windows facing the bay, but it only highlighted the dust motes dancing in the air. The jukebox in the corner, a relic from the 1950s, coughed and wheezed when someone actually dared to drop a quarter into it. Outside, seagulls squawked, battling over scraps left by careless tourists, and the rhythmic lapping of waves against the pilings offered a constant, melancholic soundtrack. It was a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, and where everyone knew everyone else's business, whether they wanted to or not.

**Opening:**

The bell above the Salt Kettle's entrance jingled a tired, predictable melody as a gust of salty air whipped through, carrying with it the faint scent of seaweed. Eleanor Mae Harding sighed, wiping down the already-clean counter with a practiced hand. Another Tuesday morning, another wave of tourists bleary-eyed from their weekend rentals and craving a hangover-curing breakfast. She glanced at the clock above the ancient cash register; 7:17 AM.  Old Man Hemlock would be in for his usual black coffee and crossword puzzle in about ten minutes, followed by the gossiping ladies from the knitting circle.  Eleanor knew their orders by heart – decaf for Mildred, regular with two sugars for Agnes, and herbal tea with lemon for poor, perpetually anxious Beatrice.  She smoothed down her navy blue uniform, tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, and pasted on her best "Welcome to the Salt Kettle" smile. This was her life. Predictable, reliable, and utterly, achingly ordinary. But maybe, just maybe, today would be different.
