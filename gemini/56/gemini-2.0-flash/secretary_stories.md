## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, late-summer air hung thick and heavy in the cluttered reception area of "Oakhaven Estates," a sprawling, yet undeniably dilapidated, mansion on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating peeling wallpaper patterned with faded magnolias. The air smelled faintly of mildew and forgotten dreams. A chipped, mahogany desk, overflowing with paperwork and half-finished crossword puzzles, dominated the room. A lonely, artificial fern drooped forlornly in one corner, its plastic leaves coated in a layer of silent condemnation.

**Story Opening:**

The incessant ringing of the rotary phone cut through the oppressive silence like a rusty saw. Margaret Elizabeth "Maggie" Callahan sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead with the back of her hand. Another disgruntled resident, no doubt complaining about the inedible "meatloaf" served in the dining hall or the perpetually broken air conditioning. She’d heard it all before.

"Oakhaven Estates, good morning," Maggie said, forcing a cheerful tone that felt as artificial as the fern in the corner. The voice on the other end was immediately recognizable – Mrs. Abernathy, prone to dramatic outbursts and theatrical sighs.

"Margaret, darling, you simply *must* do something! I’ve been trying to call all morning! My bridge partner, Bernice, has gone missing!" Mrs. Abernathy’s voice was a reedy tremble, punctuated by gasps.

Maggie’s stomach clenched. Bernice had gone missing? At Oakhaven Estates, "missing" often meant something far more sinister than a misplaced hearing aid. Maggie gripped the phone tighter. This was going to be a long day.
