The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Mrs. Agnes Plumtart's cheeks as she wrestled with a stubborn garbage bag. The pre-dawn light was a bruised purple-grey, barely illuminating the grandiose, gothic architecture of Thorne Manor. It stood perched precariously on the bluffs overlooking the lake, a hulking behemoth of carved stone and leaded glass, a silent testament to a bygone era of robber barons and unimaginable wealth. The Manor was beautiful, in a forbidding kind of way, but beautiful nonetheless. And it was Agnes's job to keep it that way.

She lived in the small, tidy cottage just beyond the Manor's wrought iron gates, a perk of the job that somewhat compensated for the ungodly hours and the demanding, if eccentric, ways of her employer, the reclusive and notoriously prickly Mr. Silas Thorne. Agnes straightened, her breath misting in the frigid air, and tightened her scarf around her head. She knew the groundskeepers wouldn't be in until at least seven, so it was up to her to ensure the entrance was spotless before Mr. Thorne even considered descending from his turret office. Another dawn, another day, another battle against the relentless dust bunnies and the lingering, echoing silence of Thorne Manor.
