The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Bellweather's hands, the heat a small comfort against the pervasive chill of the Seattle morning. Outside, the sky was a bruised purple, threatening rain that would likely linger until well past lunchtime. Amelia, a registered dietitian with a meticulously organized spice rack and an equally organized life (usually), watched the condensation bead on the windowpane, mirroring the chaotic tangle of emotions in her stomach.

Her clinic, "Nourish & Thrive," nestled in a converted Victorian house in the Fremont neighborhood, was usually a haven of soothing colors and the comforting aroma of herbal tea. Today, however, the muted sage green walls seemed to close in, and the smell of the chamomile brewing in the pot did little to calm her nerves. It wasn't just the impending weather, or even the overflowing inbox crammed with frantic "new year, new me" requests. It was the name scrawled on the top of her appointment book in bold, unapologetic lettering: Leo Vargas. A name that brought with it a whirlwind of conflicting feelings Amelia hadn't felt since... well, since she was definitely too young to know better.
