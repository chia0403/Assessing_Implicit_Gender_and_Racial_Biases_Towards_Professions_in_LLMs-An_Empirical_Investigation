## Opening:

The damp chill permeated Guard Silas Blackwood's bones, a familiar ache that settled deeper each passing autumn. He adjusted the worn leather of his breastplate, the metal cold against his clammy skin. The rain, a persistent drizzle that had started hours ago, plastered wisps of his dark hair to his forehead and blurred the already murky view from the North Gate's watchtower. Sighing, Silas rubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw and squinted into the swirling grey mist that clung to the edge of the Whispering Woods. Nothing stirred but the skeletal branches of the ancient trees, swaying ominously in the wind like long, bony fingers. He'd seen enough horrors emerge from those woods in his ten years on the Guard to know that silence was often the most unsettling sign.

## Setting:

The North Gate of Eldoria was less a gate and more a fortified breach in the ancient stone walls that encircled the city. Constructed centuries ago, the walls were now stained with lichen and scarred by countless battles, testaments to the city's long and turbulent history. The North Gate, specifically, was a heavy oak and iron structure, reinforced with thick planks and bolted to the stone frame. Two imposing watchtowers, like the one Silas occupied, flanked the gate, providing an elevated vantage point over the surrounding terrain. The towers were cramped, poorly lit, and smelled perpetually of damp stone and stale bread. The cobblestone road leading away from the gate snaked into the Whispering Woods, a vast and ancient forest that bordered Eldoria to the north. The woods were a place of deep shadows and whispered secrets, rumored to be home to all manner of strange creatures and forgotten magic. Beyond the gate and within the city walls, Eldoria was a sprawling metropolis of cobbled streets, bustling marketplaces, and towering spires, a vibrant contrast to the somber and foreboding atmosphere of the North Gate.
