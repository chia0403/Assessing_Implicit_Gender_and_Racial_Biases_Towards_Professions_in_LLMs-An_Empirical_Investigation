## Opening:

Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne stared at the chipped porcelain swan nestled amongst the succulents on her reception desk. It was a relic from her grandmother, a supposed good luck charm, and right now, Eleanor felt like she needed all the luck she could get. The waiting room was empty, save for a single, faded copy of *National Geographic* showcasing the iridescent beauty of deep-sea jellyfish. Another cancellation. That was the third one this week, and between the rising cost of dental supplies and the ever-looming shadow of "Dental Depot" opening across the street, Eleanor felt like her meticulously crafted practice was slowly sinking.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Hawthorne's dental practice, "Hawthorne Family Dentistry," was located in the heart of the quaint, somewhat crumbling downtown of Havenwood, Massachusetts. The building itself was a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful (though slightly peeling) robin's egg blue. Inside, Eleanor had strived to create a welcoming atmosphere, a far cry from the sterile, clinical environments that often defined dental offices.

Natural light streamed through large, arched windows, illuminating walls adorned with framed prints of vintage dental advertisements â€“ showcasing a time when fluoride was hailed as a miracle and sugar was a dentist's best friend. The waiting room, while charming with its plush floral armchairs and antique coffee table, was noticeably dated. The magazines were perpetually a few months old, and the piped-in music leaned heavily on the easy-listening genre.

Her operating room, however, was modern and impeccably clean, a testament to Eleanor's dedication to providing the best possible care. State-of-the-art equipment gleamed under the bright overhead lights, and the gentle hum of the suction machine was a constant, almost comforting presence. But even the cutting-edge technology couldn't mask the underlying tension that hung in the air these days, a silent acknowledgment of the challenges facing Dr. Hawthorne and her small-town practice. The scent of mint and disinfectant, usually associated with clean teeth and healthy gums, now carried a faint undercurrent of anxiety.
