## Story Opening:

The sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless July sky, glared down at Edgar Bartholomew Finch as he hammered another shingle into place. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes and dripping down his weathered face. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a muddy streak of tar and frustration. Below him, the world shimmered in the heat, the distant rumble of traffic a dull counterpoint to the rhythmic thwack-thwack-thwack of his hammer. He paused, feeling the burn in his lungs, and squinted at the half-finished roof. This wasn't just any roof; this was Mrs. Higgins' roof, and Mrs. Higgins, with her eagle-sharp eyes and even sharper tongue, was a stickler for perfection.

## Setting:

The story opens on the roof of a modest, two-story Victorian house on Elm Street in the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, Ohio. Elm Street is lined with mature oak trees, casting dappled shadows on the manicured lawns and pastel-colored houses. Havenwood is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else's business, and gossip travels faster than a summer breeze. The houses are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed hedges and overflowing flower boxes. The air is thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and, today, the acrid tang of asphalt shingles baking in the sun. The house itself, though charming, shows signs of age. Its paint is peeling in places, and the porch swing creaks ominously in the slightest breeze. The roof, particularly, has suffered under years of neglect, leading to the current, agonizingly slow repair job being undertaken by Edgar.
