## Story Opening:

The hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant companion to Eliza Mae Harding, and tonight, they seemed to be mocking her with a particularly aggressive buzz. It was 2:17 AM, according to the glaring digital clock on her computer monitor, and she was surrounded by a mountain of documents that threatened to topple and bury her alive. Each file folder bore the ominous stamp of "CONFIDENTIAL," and each page was filled with the meticulous details of the upcoming trial: *United States v. Victor "Viper" Rossi*.

Eliza scrubbed a hand over her tired eyes, the gritty sensation mirroring the exhaustion that had settled deep in her bones. She’d sworn off late nights after the Carter case, but Mr. Henderson, her notoriously demanding boss, had a knack for convincing her that *this* case, *this* detail, was the one that would make or break his career. And, consequently, her future as a paralegal at Henderson & Davies, the most prestigious, and arguably ruthless, law firm in Charleston, South Carolina. She took a long swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the growing dread that coiled in her stomach. This wasn’t just another white-collar crime; this was Rossi, the head of a notorious East Coast crime syndicate, and everything about this case felt… wrong.

## Setting:

The year is 2024. The main setting is the dimly lit, sparsely decorated office of Eliza Mae Harding at Henderson & Davies, located on the 12th floor of a modern glass skyscraper in downtown Charleston. The office itself is small and functional, with a large, L-shaped desk overflowing with files and legal pads. The walls are painted a neutral beige, and the only personal touches are a framed photograph of Eliza with her grandmother on Pawley's Island and a small succulent that stubbornly refuses to die despite her neglect. The panoramic windows offer a stunning view of the city, but Eliza rarely has time to appreciate it, especially late at night when the cityscape is reduced to a glittering expanse of unanswered questions. The overall atmosphere is one of sterile efficiency, punctuated by the incessant tapping of keyboards and the hushed voices emanating from the nearby offices of senior partners. Outside the office walls, the humid Southern air hangs heavy over Charleston, filled with the scent of salt and Spanish moss, a stark contrast to the artificial climate and high-stakes tension within.
