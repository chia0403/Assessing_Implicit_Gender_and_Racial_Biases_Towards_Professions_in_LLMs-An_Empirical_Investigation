The humid air hung thick and sweet with the scent of hibiscus and hairspray. Inside "The Mermaid's Mane," where turquoise paint peeled just so to reveal the sun-bleached wood beneath, Elara Juniper Bellweather, cosmetologist extraordinaire, sweltered. It was a Tuesday afternoon in Coral Key, Florida, a time usually reserved for the slow trickle of snowbirds desperate for a touch-up before bingo night. But not today. Today, Elara was wrestling with a head of hair so tangled, she half expected a rare species of mangrove snake to slither out.

Coral Key itself was a postcard come to life, if postcards included swarms of mosquitos and the ever-present threat of a sudden downpour. Pastel houses, lifted high on stilts against the occasional hurricane, lined streets named after various shells. The air was perpetually salty, the sunsets painted the sky in vibrant hues of orange and pink, and the rhythm of life moved at a pace dictated by the tides. It was a haven for retirees, artists, and anyone seeking an escape from the frantic pace of the mainland. Elara, however, had never escaped. She'd been born and raised in Coral Key, her hands practically glued to a teasing comb since she was old enough to hold one. The Mermaid's Mane, a legacy passed down from her grandmother, was more than just a salon; it was a community hub, a gossip mill, and a place where Elara felt most at home. Now, all she needed was to untangle this Gordian knot of frizz before Mrs. Henderson, the owner of said frizz, started threatening to take her business to that "fancy new place" on the other side of the island.
