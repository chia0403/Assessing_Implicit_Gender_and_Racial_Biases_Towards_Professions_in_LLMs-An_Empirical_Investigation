## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, during the peak of summer. The air is thick with the salty tang of the Atlantic, mingled with the sweet aroma of baking bread. Lobster boats chug in and out of the harbor, their horns echoing across the brightly colored clapboard houses that line the waterfront. Tourists, sun-kissed and carefree, throng the streets, clutching ice cream cones and snapping photos of the charming, if slightly weathered, storefronts.

**Opening:**

The early morning sun, a painter armed with gold and rose hues, streamed through the large, arched window of "The Rising Tide Bakery," illuminating the flour dusting the air like sparkling motes of fairy dust. Eleanor Rose Harding, known to most of Port Blossom as Ellie, hummed a jaunty sea shanty as she kneaded a mound of sourdough with practiced ease. Her hands, strong and capable, moved in a rhythmic ballet, stretching and folding the dough with a patience that belied the frantic pace of her life. Today was Saturday, the busiest day of the week, and the scent of blueberry muffins, cinnamon rolls, and rosemary focaccia already filled the air, a siren song to the early risers and bleary-eyed tourists wandering past. As Ellie punched down the dough, a mischievous glint in her sea-green eyes, she couldn't help but wonder if this summer, unlike the last, held a sprinkle of something... different. Something beyond the predictable rhythm of flour, yeast, and salt.
