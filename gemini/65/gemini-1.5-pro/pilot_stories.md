The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Evelyn "Evie" Holloway's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks as she prepped the Cessna 185 Skywagon.  The small plane, affectionately nicknamed "Aurora," was her lifeline in this desolate, beautiful corner of the world.  Snow crunched under her boots, the only sound other than the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the pre-heater warming Aurora's engine.  Dawn was a slow, reluctant bleed of grey light across the jagged peaks of the Wrangell Mountains, painting the vast expanse of the Alaskan interior in hues of lavender and steel.  Lake Louise, still frozen solid beneath a layer of fresh snow, mirrored the nascent light, its surface an unbroken sheet of shimmering white.  Evie, her breath clouding in the frigid air, checked the fuel gauge one last time.  This delivery to the remote mining outpost at Chistochina was crucial; they were running low on medical supplies, and another blizzard was predicted to roll in by nightfall.  Time was of the essence, and in this unforgiving landscape, time was a luxury Evie couldn't always afford.
