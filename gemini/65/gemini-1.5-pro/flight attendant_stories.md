The cabin lights dimmed, casting long shadows down the aisle as the Airbus A380 shuddered, its massive frame protesting against the fierce headwind buffeting it high above the churning Atlantic.  Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp navy uniform, suppressed a yawn, the exhaustion of a five-hour delay finally catching up to her.  Outside, the inky blackness was punctuated only by the occasional flicker of distant lightning, a stark contrast to the sterile, artificial brightness inside the plane.  Flight BA216, bound for London Heathrow from JFK, was finally in the air, but the tension was palpable.  The air crackled not just with static electricity, but with the unspoken anxieties of the passengers, delayed and weary, each lost in their own world of travel woes.  Mia, however, had a different kind of unease settling in her stomach. It wasn't the turbulence, nor the irate businessman in 27B who’d already complained twice about the lack of ice.  It was the feeling, prickly and insistent, that something wasn't right.  Something beyond the usual chaos of a delayed transatlantic flight.
