The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Her office, a converted storage closet tucked between the gymnasium and the cafeteria, smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage angst.  Rain lashed against the small, barred window, blurring the already dreary view of the overflowing dumpster. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a chipped mug against her teeth, contemplating the overflowing inbox on her desk. Each email, each slip of paper requesting a meeting, represented a student teetering on the precipice of some adolescent crisis â€“ a broken heart, a failing grade, a future yet unwritten and terrifying in its vastness.  This was Northwood, a small town high school nestled in the heart of the Oregon Coast Range, where the fog rolled in as thick as the teenage apathy, and Eleanor Vance was the sole lighthouse in that gray, swirling sea.
