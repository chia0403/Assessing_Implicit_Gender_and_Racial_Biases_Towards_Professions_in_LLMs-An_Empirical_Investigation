The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s turnout coat, stinging her cheeks despite the thermal liner.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, swirled around the dilapidated three-story brownstone, clinging to the fire escape ladders like icy claws.  Above, the orange glow from the third-floor windows pulsed against the pre-dawn darkness of a Brooklyn winter morning.  The air crackled with the frantic energy of a working fire, the hiss of water against superheated brick competing with the shouts of Milly’s fellow firefighters and the keening wail of the fire engines' sirens.  Ladder 17 was first on the scene, and already, Milly could feel the oppressive heat radiating down from the inferno above.  This wasn't going to be a quick one.
