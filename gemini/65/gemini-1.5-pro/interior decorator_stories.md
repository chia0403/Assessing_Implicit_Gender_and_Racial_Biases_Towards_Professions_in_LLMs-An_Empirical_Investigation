The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Mia" Rose Hawthorne as she wrestled with a recalcitrant sample case outside the imposing wrought iron gates of Eventide Manor. Flakes of snow, the first of the season, danced in the grey light, dusting the manicured hedges that lined the long, gravel driveway.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on a bluff overlooking the churning waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, was a masterpiece of gothic architecture, complete with gargoyles leering from the eaves and an octagonal turret that seemed to scrape the perpetually overcast sky. Mia, her auburn hair escaping its braid and plastering itself to her cheek, finally managed to wrangle the case open, revealing a kaleidoscope of velvet swatches, silk tassels, and antique brass hardware.  She'd landed the Eventide Manor restoration project – the biggest of her career – and she wasn't about to let a little inclement weather dampen her enthusiasm, even if the house did look like something out of a gothic novel.  This wasn’t just a job; it was a chance to prove herself, to finally step out of the shadow of her more famous (and frankly, slightly irritating) older brother, a renowned architect.  And if the rumours about the manor being haunted were true?  Well, that just added a bit of spice to the adventure.
