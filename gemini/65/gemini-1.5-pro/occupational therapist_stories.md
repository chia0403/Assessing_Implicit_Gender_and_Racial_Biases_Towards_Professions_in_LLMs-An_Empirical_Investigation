Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image given the current state of Eleanor Vance’s spirits.  The waiting room of St. Jude’s Rehabilitation Center, usually a hive of nervous energy and forced cheer, was eerily quiet this late Friday afternoon.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn floral print armchairs and scattered toys.  Eleanor, her name tag slightly askew on her teal scrubs, tapped a pen against her clipboard, the rhythmic click echoing in the stillness. Outside, the November wind howled, a mournful sound that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. This new patient, arriving any minute now, was a complex case, a challenge even the most seasoned therapists at St. Jude's approached with trepidation.  A renowned concert pianist who'd lost the use of his left hand in a tragic car accident, he represented both a professional puzzle and a deeply personal one for Eleanor, whose own musical aspirations had long ago fallen silent.  The squeak of the heavy oak front doors opening finally broke the silence, and Eleanor braced herself.
