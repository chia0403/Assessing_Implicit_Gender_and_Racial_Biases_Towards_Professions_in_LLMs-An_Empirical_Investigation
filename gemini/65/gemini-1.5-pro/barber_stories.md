The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat. It sang a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip of his shears, a duet they'd performed countless times in the cramped confines of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.

Alder's Bend itself was a town steeped in the scent of pine and the hush of the old-growth forest that pressed in on its edges, a place where time seemed to move slower, dictated by the languid drift of the Willamette River and the changing hues of the leaves on the towering maples. It was the kind of town where everyone knew Elias, and he, in turn, knew the stories etched onto the back of every neck he shaved.
