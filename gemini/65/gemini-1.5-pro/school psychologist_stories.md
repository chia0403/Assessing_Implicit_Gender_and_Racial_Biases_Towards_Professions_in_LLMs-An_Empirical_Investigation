The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s dark hair across her face as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the Northwood High School parking lot.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, melting instantly on the damp ground.  Northwood, a sprawling brick behemoth built in the 1970s, loomed before her, its many windows glowing a sickly yellow in the fading afternoon light.  The aroma of stale cafeteria pizza, a scent Amy had come to associate with impending teenage angst, clung to the air.  Inside, the echoing clang of lockers slamming shut punctuated the usual pre-bell chaos.  Amy tightened her grip on her overflowing messenger bag, a portable arsenal containing everything from standardized tests to stress balls, and steeled herself for another Monday afternoon. This week, the focus was on suicide prevention, and the weight of that responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders.  She had a feeling this particular Monday was going to be anything but usual.
