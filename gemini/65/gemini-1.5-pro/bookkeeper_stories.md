The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across Amelia Prudence Higgins' meticulously organized desk.  Ledger books, bound in faded leather and smelling faintly of vanilla and dust, were stacked neatly beside a tarnished brass inkwell. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune down the cobbled lanes of Hollow Creek, a small, isolated town nestled deep in the Derbyshire Peak District. Amelia, a woman of precise habits and even more precise figures, shivered, pulling her shawl tighter around her shoulders.  The year was 1888, and a peculiar unease had settled over Hollow Creek, a disquiet that went beyond the usual gloom of the approaching winter. It clung to the air like the damp mist that perpetually shrouded the valley, seeping into the very stones of the town's ancient buildings.  Amelia dipped her pen into the ink, a frown creasing her brow. The accounts of Mr. Grimshaw’s General Store weren’t balancing, and in Amelia’s world, such discrepancies were akin to cracks in the foundations of reality itself.
