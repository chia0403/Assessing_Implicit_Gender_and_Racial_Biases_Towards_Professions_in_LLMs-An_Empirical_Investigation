The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he leaned against the railing of the ferry, the churning wake of the *S.S. Wanderer* a frothing white scar against the deep turquoise of the Aegean Sea.  The Greek isles, a scattering of emerald jewels on the horizon, shimmered under the relentless August sun.  Elias, a moderately successful author of historical fiction, hadn't planned this trip. Not really.  A disastrous book launch, coupled with a scathing review that called his latest novel "a tedious slog through a poorly researched Renaissance," had sent him spiraling. His agent, bless her optimistic soul, had suggested a "reset." A chance to "reconnect with the muse" in a place steeped in history.  And so, armed with a half-finished manuscript about the Minoan civilization and a healthy dose of self-doubt, Elias found himself sailing towards Crete, the legendary birthplace of Zeus, with a knot of anxiety tightening in his chest.  He hadn't written a decent sentence in weeks, and the island, rising majestically from the sea, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a looming monument to his creative failure.
