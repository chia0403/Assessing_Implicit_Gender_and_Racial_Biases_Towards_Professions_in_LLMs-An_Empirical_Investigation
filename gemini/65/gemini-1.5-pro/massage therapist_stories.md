The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, smelling of brine and hibiscus, as Amelia Grace Hawthorne unlocked the door to "Kneadful Things," her small massage therapy studio nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bait shop on A1A.  The worn, wooden sign above the door creaked rhythmically in the ocean breeze, a sound Amelia found oddly comforting. Inside, the air was cooler, scented with lavender and sandalwood, a deliberate contrast to the salty chaos outside. Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting stripes across the pale green walls and illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. It was a Tuesday morning in June, and the slow season had officially begun in Anastasia Island. Amelia, dressed in her usual loose linen pants and a tank top, surveyed her quiet domain.  The only sound was the gentle whir of the small fountain in the corner, a constant, reassuring presence.  She hoped today would bring more than just the usual handful of regulars. Rent was due next week, and the quiet charm of the off-season wasn't paying the bills.
