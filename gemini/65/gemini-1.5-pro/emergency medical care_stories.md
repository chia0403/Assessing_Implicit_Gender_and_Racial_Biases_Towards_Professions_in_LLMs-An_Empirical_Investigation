The siren's wail was a banshee scream tearing through the humid New Orleans night, swallowed and distorted by the narrow streets of the French Quarter. Rain lashed down, turning the cobblestones into slick, treacherous mirrors reflecting the flashing blue and red lights of the ambulance. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Dubois, a paramedic with New Orleans Emergency Medical Services, braced herself against the lurching vehicle as they careened around a corner, the scent of stale beignets and damp brick battling with the antiseptic tang inside the ambulance. Her partner, a seasoned EMT named Marcus “Big Easy” Broussard, muttered something about tourists and bad decisions under his breath as he gripped the railing above his head.  The dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio, painting a grim picture: unconscious male, possible overdose, location: the alleyway behind the infamous Voodoo Museum.  Amy felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach. In a city steeped in magic and mystery, even routine calls could turn strange… and tonight, something felt particularly off.
