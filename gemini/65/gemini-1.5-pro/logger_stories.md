The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune that echoed through the Cascade Mountains.  Frost crunched underfoot as Elijah "Eli" Blackwood, his breath clouding the frigid air, surveyed the stand of timber marked for felling.  Towering above him, the ancient trees, some older than Eli’s own grandfather, stood sentinel against the steely grey sky. This particular patch, nestled deep in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, was known as the Whispering Pines, a name given for the susurrus of wind through the dense needles that sounded like hushed conversations.  Eli, a man built like the very trees he harvested – broad shouldered, with hands calloused and rough –  hefted his axe, the polished steel glinting in the weak sunlight.  This was his life, the rhythm of the forest his heartbeat. Today, however, the familiar comfort of the woods felt different, charged with a strange, unsettling stillness. The usual chatter of jays and chickadees was absent, replaced by a silence so profound it pressed against Eli’s eardrums.  He had a feeling, deep down in his gut, that something was wrong.
