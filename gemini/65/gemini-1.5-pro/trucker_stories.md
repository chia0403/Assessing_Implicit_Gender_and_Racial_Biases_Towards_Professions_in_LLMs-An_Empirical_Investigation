The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the faux-leather seats to a blistering temperature.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," living up to its name this sweltering July afternoon. Inside, Delilah "Dee" Jones squinted at the shimmering horizon, her knuckles white against the worn steering wheel. The air conditioning in her rig, Betsy, had given up the ghost somewhere outside of Fallon, leaving Dee to battle the oppressive heat with nothing but a lukewarm bottle of water and sheer grit.  She adjusted her trucker hat, emblazoned with the faded logo of "Jonesing for the Open Road," the small trucking company she'd inherited from her father, and sighed. This haul, a load of antique furniture bound for a collector in Austin, was supposed to be easy money.  But easy had a way of turning complicated out here in the Nevada desert.  Especially when you were hauling secrets as well as sofas.
