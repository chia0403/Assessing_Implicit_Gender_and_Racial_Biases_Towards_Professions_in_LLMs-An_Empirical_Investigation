The air in the basement of St. Agatha's Orphanage hung thick and heavy, a miasma of mildew, dust motes dancing in the single bare bulb's feeble light.  Pipes, a tangled mess of copper and galvanized steel, snaked across the low ceiling like metallic vines.  Water dripped steadily from a rusted joint, each drop echoing in the oppressive silence. This was Eleanor Vance's domain for the afternoon, and frankly, she’d seen worse.  Eleanor, with her tool belt slung low on her hips and a perpetually smudged streak of grease across her cheek, adjusted the beam of her headlamp, her breath fogging slightly in the cool, damp air.  Outside, the November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the elm trees surrounding the orphanage, a mournful soundtrack to her task.  She’d been called in to fix a persistent leak that was threatening to flood the basement and, more importantly, disrupt the orphanage's ancient heating system just as winter was setting in.  This wasn't a glamorous job, but Eleanor Vance wasn't a glamorous plumber. She was practical, efficient, and more than capable of wrestling a leaky pipe into submission.
