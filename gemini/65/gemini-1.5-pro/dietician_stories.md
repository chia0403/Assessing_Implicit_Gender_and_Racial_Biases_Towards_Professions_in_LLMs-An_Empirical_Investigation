The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish to Flourish" clinic hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s perfectly manicured fingernails against her tablet screen.  Rain lashed against the large window overlooking a grey, windswept stretch of the Oregon coast.  Seagulls, normally boisterous, huddled miserably on the lampposts lining the deserted promenade. Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with patients eager to unlock the secrets of healthy living, was empty save for a wilting fern in the corner and a stack of slightly dog-eared copies of "Eating Well" magazine. Eleanor sighed, the tension knotting in her shoulders.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in November, the kind of day that sucked the color and life out of everything, even her usually vibrant enthusiasm for kale smoothies and the transformative power of quinoa.  This particular Tuesday, however, was worse than usual.  It marked the one-year anniversary of her clinic’s opening, and the meagre trickle of patients suggested that her dream of revolutionizing the coastal town’s dietary habits was slowly but surely turning into a soggy, nutrient-deficient nightmare.
