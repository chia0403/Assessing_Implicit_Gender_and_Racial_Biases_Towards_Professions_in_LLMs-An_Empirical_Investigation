The biting November wind whipped around Coach Amelia "Amy" Rios as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field.  Floodlights cast stark shadows across the uneven ground, illuminating the dejected slump of the Northwood High Ravens.  They huddled together like a flock of bedraggled crows, their breath puffing out white clouds in the frigid air. The scoreboard glared down at them, a stark 28-7 testament to their crushing defeat.  This wasn't just any loss; this was the semi-final, the game that would have sent them to the State Championships. Now, their season was over, ending not with a bang, but a whimper in the small, forgotten town of Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Oregon wilderness.  The only sound louder than the wind was the raucous cheering of the opposing team, the Timberline Wolves, celebrating their victory on the opposite side of the field.  Amy clutched a steaming thermos of coffee, the warmth barely registering through her thick gloves.  This wasn't how she envisioned her first year as head coach ending.
