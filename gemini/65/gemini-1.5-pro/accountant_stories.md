Rain lashed against the window of Elias Thorne's tiny office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the anxious thrumming in his chest.  His office, tucked away on the third floor of a soot-stained building on Grimshaw Lane, overlooked a particularly dreary stretch of Manchester's industrial district.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp wool and coal smoke, a constant reminder of the city's gritty underbelly. Elias, a chartered accountant with a penchant for neatness and order, meticulously straightened a stack of invoices on his otherwise spotless desk. The green glass shade of his banker's lamp cast a small pool of warm light, a stark contrast to the gloom outside.  It was a Thursday evening, late in November, 1923, and the fog, typical for this time of year, had rolled in thick and fast, swallowing the already weak daylight. Elias, usually eager to leave the confines of his office, found himself strangely reluctant. Something felt amiss.
