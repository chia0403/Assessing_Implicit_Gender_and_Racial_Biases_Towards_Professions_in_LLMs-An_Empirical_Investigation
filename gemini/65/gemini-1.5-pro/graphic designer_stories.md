Rain lashed against the oversized windows of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's attic apartment, mimicking the frantic tapping of her stylus against her drawing tablet.  Neon signs from the Hong Kong street market below bled through the rain-streaked glass, painting distorted, ephemeral rainbows across her cluttered workspace.  Half-finished design mockups littered the surface of her worn oak desk, interspersed with empty takeout containers and precarious stacks of Pantone color guides.  The air hung thick with the scent of instant ramen and the slightly metallic tang of ozone.  Amy, clad in paint-splattered overalls and a faded band t-shirt, chewed nervously on the end of her stylus.  Tonight was the deadline for the biggest pitch of her career – rebranding the iconic Kowloon Ferry Company – and inspiration was proving as elusive as a taxi on a typhoon night.
