The scent of old paper and leather clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, a small, almost involuntary smile touching his lips.  The hushed whispers of turning pages, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of someone’s fingers on a keyboard searching the catalogue, the gentle sigh of the ancient ventilation system – these were the sounds of his sanctuary.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Peregrine Thorne, was the head librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, a grand, slightly dilapidated Victorian building nestled amongst towering pines on the edge of the sleepy, fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine.  The late October wind howled outside, rattling the leaded glass windows and scattering fallen leaves across the cobblestone walkway leading to the heavy oak doors. Inside, however, a warm, golden light spilled from the Tiffany lamps that dotted the reading room, illuminating rows upon rows of bookshelves that stretched towards the high, vaulted ceiling.  It was a Thursday afternoon, typically a quiet one, but Elias sensed a peculiar energy in the air, a subtle shift in the usual calm that made the fine hairs on the back of his neck prickle.
