The chipped ceramic mermaid on Amelia Reyes-Flores's desk stared blankly at the swirling snow outside.  December in Buffalo, New York was less than enchanting. Grey skies pressed down on the city, mirroring the grey carpet and grey walls of "Flights of Fancy" travel agency.  Amelia, bundled in a thick, emerald green cardigan despite the whirring space heater at her feet, tapped a chipped crimson nail against her keyboard. The only other sound in the small, cluttered office was the rhythmic tick of a grandfather clock tucked away in the corner, each tick a stark reminder of the rapidly approaching holiday season and the distinct lack of bookings.  Flights of Fancy, Ameliaâ€™s passion project and her sole source of income, was in danger of becoming a flight of fancy itself.
