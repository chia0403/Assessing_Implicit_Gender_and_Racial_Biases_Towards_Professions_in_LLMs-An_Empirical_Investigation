The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her cheek as she navigated the crime scene tape strung across the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor.  A gothic monstrosity perched on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, the manor seemed to exhale a palpable sense of dread. Rain lashed against the towering, leaded-glass windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor.  This wasn’t just any case; this was the return to the place that had birthed her nightmares, the place she had sworn never to revisit - the ancestral home of the notorious Blackwood family.  Twenty years ago, a tragedy had unfolded within these very walls, a tragedy that had irrevocably shaped Eleanor’s life and career choice.  Now, history seemed to be repeating itself. A single, flickering gas lamp illuminated a figure silhouetted in the upstairs window, Detective Inspector Davies, his presence a grim confirmation of Eleanor's fears.  This time, she wasn't just a witness.  This time, she was here to unravel the secrets Blackwood Manor held, secrets that whispered of madness and a darkness far older than the house itself.
