The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the aroma of roasting chestnuts doing little to thaw the November chill.  Greenwich Village, usually vibrant with street performers and bustling shoppers, felt subdued under the iron-grey sky.

Tonight was the launch party, a small gathering at The Cozy Corner Bookshop, a beloved local institution tucked between a vintage clothing store and an overflowing flower stall.  It was a dream come true, a culmination of years spent poring over research, writing late into the night, and tirelessly advocating for accessible, healthy eating in a city obsessed with convenience. But as the warm glow of the bookshop came into view, Eleanor couldn’t shake the feeling that something, somehow, was about to go terribly wrong.
