The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the "Open" sign that hung precariously from the faded awning of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice.  "Smile Brighter Dental," the sign proclaimed in cheerful, chipped paint, a stark contrast to the grey November sky above Port Blossom, Washington.  Inside, Eleanor Vance, DDS, tapped a restless foot against the worn linoleum, the rhythmic squeak a counterpoint to the mournful foghorn in the distance.  Her waiting room, usually bustling with nervous chatter and the rustle of magazines, was empty. This wasn't entirely unusual for a late Tuesday afternoon in a town where the primary source of excitement was the annual salmon run, but today, the stillness felt different, heavier, like a held breath before a storm.  The antique grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly, each second a tiny hammer blow against the silence.  Eleanor glanced at it, then back out the window, at the churning, steel-grey water.  Something was definitely off.
