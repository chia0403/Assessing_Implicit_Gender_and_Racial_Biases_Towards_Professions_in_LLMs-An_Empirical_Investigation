The biting wind whipped down from the Greystone Peaks, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of snow.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands tucked deep into his thick woolen coat, surveyed the quarry.  Towering slabs of granite, streaked with quartz and mica, rose around him like ancient, slumbering giants.  The quarry floor, normally a chaotic jumble of broken rock and dust, was now blanketed in a pristine layer of white, softening the harsh angles and lending an almost ethereal quality to the usually stark landscape. Nestled against the base of the tallest peak, the small village of Quarryside, Eliasâ€™s home for all his thirty years, clung to the mountainside like a stubborn lichen.  Smoke curled lazily from the chimneys of the stone cottages, promising warmth and the simple comforts Elias craved after a long day wrestling stone.  Today, however, comfort was a distant prospect.  Today, Elias had a rendezvous with a legend.
