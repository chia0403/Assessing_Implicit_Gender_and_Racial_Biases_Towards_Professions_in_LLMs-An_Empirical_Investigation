Rain lashed against the window of Adeline "Addie" Finch's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Tax season was officially over, the April 15th deadline a receding nightmare, yet the lingering scent of stale coffee and desperation still clung to the air like a shroud. Addie’s office, nestled above Sal’s Pizzeria in the perpetually damp basement of a three-story brick building on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was usually a haven of organized chaos.  Now, however, file folders lay scattered across her desk like fallen dominoes, a testament to the weeks of sleep deprivation and caffeine-fueled number crunching.  The only sound, besides the relentless drumming of rain, was the rhythmic dripping of a leaky pipe in the corner, a counterpoint to the persistent thrumming of anxiety in Addie's chest. This particular tax season had been… different. And not just because Mrs. Rosenblatt had insisted, for the third year running, that her pet chihuahua, Mr. Bojangles, was a legitimate business expense.
