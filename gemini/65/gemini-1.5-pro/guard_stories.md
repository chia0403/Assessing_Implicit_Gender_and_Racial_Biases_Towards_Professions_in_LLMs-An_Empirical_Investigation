The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak, the icy tendrils snaking through the gaps in his armour and chilling him to the bone. He stamped his feet, the heavy clang of metal on the cobblestones echoing across the deserted courtyard of Castle Drakon.  Jagged peaks clawed at the bruised purple sky, their snow-capped summits disappearing into the swirling mist that perpetually shrouded the ancient fortress.  Built from black basalt and perched precariously on the edge of a sheer precipice, Drakon Castle was a formidable bastion against the wild, untamed lands that stretched northwards.  Tonight, Elias's duty was a lonely vigil on the western ramparts, a position exposed to the full fury of the elements and offering a panoramic view of the treacherous Whispering Woods, a place whispered to be haunted by creatures older than the castle itself.
