The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of brine and pine needles and slapping against the mismatched windows of The Salty Spoon. Inside, the air hung thick and warm, redolent with garlic, thyme, and the faint sweetness of simmering apples.  Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, head chef and sole proprietor of the tiny diner, hummed a bolero as she expertly flipped a crab cake, the rhythmic sizzle a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a distant foghorn. The Salty Spoon, nestled in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Washington, was Esme’s sanctuary, a kaleidoscope of chipped porcelain, mismatched chairs, and the comforting aroma of home-cooked meals.  It was a world away from the Michelin-starred kitchens of her past, a world she’d deliberately chosen, a world where she could finally cook with her heart, not for accolades. But the tranquility of Port Blossom, like the calm before a storm, was about to be disrupted.
