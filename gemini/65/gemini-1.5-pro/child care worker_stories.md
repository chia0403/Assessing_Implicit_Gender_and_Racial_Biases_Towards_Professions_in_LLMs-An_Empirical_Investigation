The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of sunscreen and slightly overripe bananas.  A cacophony of tiny voices, giggling, shrieking, and babbling, filled the brightly colored playroom of "Little Sprouts Daycare."  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the vibrant finger paintings clinging precariously to the walls.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, with her hair pulled back in a messy bun and a smudge of purple paint on her cheek, knelt amongst a group of toddlers, patiently guiding chubby fingers as they attempted to stack brightly colored blocks.  Outside, in the small, fenced-in playground, the older children chased each other around a miniature pirate ship, their excited shouts punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of the swing set.  It was a typical Tuesday morning at Little Sprouts, a haven of controlled chaos nestled in the heart of suburban Willow Creek.
