The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life.  It was a Thursday in late November, and the biting Chicago wind howled outside, rattling the large windows that showcased a grey, steel-and-glass cityscape. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, hunched over a massive drafting table, the cool metal pressing against her forearms.  The scent of blueprint ink, aged paper, and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma she’d come to associate with deadlines and the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly rendered design.  Around her, the large, open-plan office buzzed with low conversations and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards, but Amelia existed in her own small world, a world of precise lines, exacting measurements, and the dream of one day seeing her name, not just her drafts, on a finished building. Today, however, that dream felt particularly distant.  Spread out before her were the revised plans for the Gold Coast condominium complex – revisions she’d been tasked with completing by the end of the week, revisions that felt less like creative design and more like tedious busywork.
