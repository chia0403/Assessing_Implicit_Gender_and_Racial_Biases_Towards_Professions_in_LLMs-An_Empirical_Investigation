The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mimi" Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking Portwenn Cove.  The Cornish wind, a constant companion in this remote village, tugged at the loose strands of her dark braid and whipped the edges of her canvas, threatening to tear it from the makeshift easel fashioned from driftwood and fishing rope. Below, the small, brightly painted fishing boats bobbed in the turquoise water, their vibrant hulls a stark contrast to the grey, brooding sky. Mimi, bundled in a thick, woolen sweater the colour of a stormy sea, squinted against the glare of the late afternoon sun, momentarily blinded by its reflection off the choppy waves. This wild, untamed beauty, this symphony of blues and greys, was her muse.  For six months, Mimi had made the abandoned fisherman's hut perched above the cove her studio, seeking solace and inspiration in the solitude of the Cornish coastline.  Here, far from the bustling galleries and stifling expectations of London, she could finally breathe, finally *paint*.
