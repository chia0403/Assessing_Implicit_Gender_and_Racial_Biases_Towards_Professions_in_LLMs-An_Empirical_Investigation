The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's veterinary clinic.  Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, occasionally obscuring the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Wind River Range. Inside, the clinic was a haven of warmth and the faint, comforting scent of hay and disinfectant.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, was hunched over a trembling Labrador retriever, a stethoscope pressed against its chest.  The dog, a grizzled veteran named Gus, whined softly, his brown eyes clouded with pain.  The only other sound was the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady pulse against the backdrop of the howling wind.  This small, isolated clinic, perched on the edge of nowhere, was Eleanor's sanctuary, her life's work, and her constant challenge.  The nearest town, a speck on the horizon called Harmony Creek, was a forty-minute drive on a good day, and even then, help could be scarce.  Out here, Eleanor was often the only thing standing between life and death for the creatures of this harsh and unforgiving land.
