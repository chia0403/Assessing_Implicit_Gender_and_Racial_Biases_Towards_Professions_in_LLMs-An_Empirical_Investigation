The aroma of burnt sugar and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume clinging to the brick walls of Eleanor Ainsworth's bakery.  "The Gilded Crumb" sat nestled between a perpetually bustling laundromat and a dusty antique shop on Sycamore Street, a narrow, cobbled lane in the heart of Old Haven.  The town itself, a quaint seaside village in Maine, was known for two things: its erratic weather and Eleanor's exquisite pastries.  The wind, a restless spirit off the Atlantic, howled a mournful tune against the large bay window, rattling the panes and scattering fallen leaves across the pavement outside. Inside, however, a warm glow emanated from the bakery, a beacon against the encroaching grey of a November afternoon.  Eleanor, her hands dusted with flour and a smudge of chocolate on her cheek, surveyed the damage: a tray of caramelized apple tarts, blackened beyond redemption.
