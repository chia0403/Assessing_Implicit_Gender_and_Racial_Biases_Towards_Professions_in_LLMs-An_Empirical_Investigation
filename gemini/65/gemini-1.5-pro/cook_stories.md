The clatter of pots and pans was Amelia "Milly" Dupres's morning symphony.  The pre-dawn light, filtering through the grimy windows of The Salty Spoon diner, painted streaks of grey and pale gold across the worn linoleum floor. Milly, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun secured with a chipped chopstick, hummed along to the rhythmic sizzle of bacon on the flattop. The Salty Spoon, nestled between a pawn shop and a laundromat on the fringes of Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't much to look at. Its faded turquoise paint peeled in the salty air, and the neon sign out front flickered erratically, sometimes spelling "The Slty Soon." But for Milly, it was home, and the greasy spoon's regulars, a motley crew of fishermen, truckers, and town eccentrics, were her family.
