The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven, Illinois. Inside, amidst the aroma of hairspray and the hum of dryers, Beatrice "Bea" Florence Clementine Dubois meticulously snipped the split ends from Mrs. Henderson's permed bob.  Oakhaven, a town where everyone knew everyone else's business, usually buzzed with gossip, but tonight, a strange stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic click of Bea's shears and the drumming of the rain against the large salon window.  Bea, a woman whose own life was as carefully styled as her clients' updos, sensed something was amiss, a prickle of unease beneath her perfectly powdered skin.  The radio, usually tuned to the local easy-listening station, emitted only static, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.
