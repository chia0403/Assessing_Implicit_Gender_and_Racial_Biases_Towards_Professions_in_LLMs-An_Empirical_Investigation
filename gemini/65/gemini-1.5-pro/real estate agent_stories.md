The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia Hayes as she adjusted the "For Sale" sign staked into the frost-kissed lawn.  Crimson and gold maples framed the Victorian house, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the peeling grey paint of its wraparound porch.  Ravenswood Manor, a once-grand neighborhood on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts, had fallen on harder times.  Most of the stately homes, like this one on Withering Lane, bore the scars of neglect – cracked windows, overgrown gardens, and an air of forgotten elegance. Amelia, however, saw potential.  She always did.  This house, with its intricate gingerbread trim and turret peeking through the branches, was a sleeping beauty just waiting for the right buyer to awaken it.  This time, though, a shiver traced its way down her spine, a feeling beyond the chill in the air.  Something about this house felt… different.
