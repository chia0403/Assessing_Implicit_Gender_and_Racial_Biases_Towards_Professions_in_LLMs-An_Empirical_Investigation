The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh, pushing in the humid Charleston air, thick with the scent of jasmine and old money.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded glass panes above, splashed across the polished marble floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the perpetual twilight of the lobby.  Ornate columns, capped with gilded acanthus leaves, stretched towards the impossibly high ceiling, where a fresco depicting cherubic figures frolicking amidst fluffy clouds looked down with benign indifference. This was Silas Finch's domain.  He, in his crisp, scarlet uniform with gleaming brass buttons, was the silent conductor of this symphony of wealth and whispers, a human cog in the well-oiled machine of the Grand Majestic.  He stood poised by the imposing mahogany reception desk, his cap clutched respectfully in his hands, waiting for the next arrival, the next suitcase to heft, the next whispered request for a discreet errand.  The air crackled with anticipation; a thunderstorm brewed on the horizon, mirroring the unease twisting in Silas's gut.  He had a feeling this wasn't going to be an ordinary Tuesday.
