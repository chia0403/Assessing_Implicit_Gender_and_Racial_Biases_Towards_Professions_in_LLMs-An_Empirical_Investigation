The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Siren, a mournful counterpoint to the bluesy wail of a harmonica leaking from the jukebox.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of salt, stale beer, and desperation.  Behind the scarred mahogany bar, Amelia "Amy" Rousseau polished a glass with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent half her life in this dimly lit sanctuary. The Siren clung to the edge of Port Blossom, a dilapidated fishing town on the Oregon coast, where the fog rolled in as thick as the local gossip and secrets washed ashore with the tide.  Tonight, the only other occupant was Old Man Hemlock, nursing a lukewarm whiskey and staring out the rain-streaked window, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by the harsh sea wind. Amy knew he wouldn't speak until he was good and ready, so she let the silence settle, broken only by the rhythmic clinking of her polishing cloth and the relentless drumming of the storm.  Something told her tonight was going to be different. The air crackled with a kind of expectant energy, the kind that preceded… something.  She just didn’t know what.
