The biting November wind whipped around Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Thorne as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre, a cigarette clutched between numb fingers.  Ash drifted down onto the rust-eaten metal grating, mirroring the decay that permeated every corner of the once-grand building.  Above her, a flickering neon sign, missing half its letters, buzzed erratically, proclaiming the theatre's dubious existence. Below, the grimy streets of New Carthage, Ohio, bustled with the pre-Thanksgiving rush, oblivious to the turmoil brewing within the theatre's crumbling walls. Bea, in her worn leather jacket and paint-splattered scarf, exhaled a plume of smoke that vanished into the swirling grey sky.  Opening night for her avant-garde production of "Macbeth" was a mere week away, and everything that could go wrong, had.  The lead actor had eloped with the costume designer, the set was half-built, and the theatre's owner was threatening eviction.  Bea took a final drag, the cherry glowing like a defiant ember in the twilight.  "Showtime," she muttered, her voice barely audible above the wind's mournful howl.
