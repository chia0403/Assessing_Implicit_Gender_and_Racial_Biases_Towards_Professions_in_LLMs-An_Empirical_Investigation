Her breath plumed out, momentarily obscuring the already fading neon sign of the Stargazer Motel, its flickering "V" a testament to her unfinished work.  The motel, a relic of the 1950s, stood alone on the edge of the vast, white plain, a lonely beacon for weary travelers and the occasional speed demon drawn to the legendary racing grounds.  Amy, bundled in her thickest work jacket, shifted her toolbox from one numb hand to the other, the metal cold against her gloved fingers. The sun had dipped below the horizon, leaving a bruised purple smear across the sky, and the first stars were beginning to prick through the deepening twilight.  She had promised the motel owner, a crotchety old woman named Mrs. Oâ€™Malley, that the sign would be fixed by nightfall, and Amy, despite the encroaching darkness and the unsettling quiet of the salt flats, was determined to keep her word.
