The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Zephyr's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs a constant, soothing drumbeat. Her cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish coastline near the tiny, windswept village of Polridmouth, was a haven, a sanctuary from the clamor of London and the suffocating grip of writer's block.

Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the stacks of half-finished manuscripts and overflowing bookshelves that lined the walls.
