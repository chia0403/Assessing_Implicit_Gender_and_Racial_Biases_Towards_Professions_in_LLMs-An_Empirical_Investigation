The relentless Florida humidity clung to Elias Thorne like a damp shroud, plastering his crisp white shirt to his back.  He adjusted his tie, the knot feeling tighter than a hangman's noose in the oppressive heat.  His polished oxfords clicked on the cracked pavement as he walked towards the ramshackle two-story house, its peeling paint the color of a forgotten bruise.  Spanish moss draped from the ancient oaks surrounding the property, giving the whole scene an air of melancholy decay.  Elias, a meticulously organized insurance agent with Allstate, was here to assess the damage from a recent hurricane, a task he'd performed countless times in his ten-year career.  But something about this place, the quiet stillness, the almost palpable sense of secrets hidden within its weathered walls, sent a shiver down his spine that had nothing to do with the approaching storm clouds gathering on the horizon. The brass nameplate by the door, tarnished with age, read "Beauregard Estate."
