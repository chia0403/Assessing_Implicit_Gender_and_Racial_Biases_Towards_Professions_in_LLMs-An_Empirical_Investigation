The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, whistling a lonely tune through the skeletal branches of the ponderosa pines.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, dusting the already frost-covered asphalt.  Elias "Eli" Vance, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka that swallowed his lean frame, stamped his feet against the cold, the rhythmic thud a counterpoint to the whine of the wind.  The setting sun cast long, distorted shadows across the deserted highway, painting the snow-dusted landscape in hues of bruised purple and icy blue. Eli’s breath plumed before him, a ghostly white against the darkening sky. He was five miles outside the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it town of Harmony Ridge, Montana, population 312, tasked with replacing a section of damaged guardrail before the impending blizzard made the road impassable. The radio in his truck, parked just beyond the cone-marked work zone, crackled with static and the faint strains of a country song.  It was going to be a long, cold night.
