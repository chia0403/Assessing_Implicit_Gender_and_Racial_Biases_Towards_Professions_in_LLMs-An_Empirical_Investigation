The insistent buzz of the intercom, two short bursts followed by a long one, was Amelia Grace Hawthorne's least favourite part of her job. It heralded the arrival of another visitor to Hemlock & Harp, Purveyors of Fine Antiquities and Obscura, and consequently, another interruption to her meticulously organised filing system.  Amelia, perched on her velvet-upholstered stool behind the mahogany reception desk, sighed. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom of the shop, illuminating shelves crammed with tarnished silver lockets, chipped porcelain dolls, and taxidermied creatures with unsettlingly glassy eyes.  Hemlock & Harp resided on a narrow, cobbled street in the perpetually fog-shrouded city of Aethelburg, a place where gas lamps flickered even at midday and the scent of woodsmoke mingled with the tang of the nearby sea.  The shop itself was a labyrinthine space, its walls lined with dark oak panelling that seemed to absorb sound and light in equal measure, giving the impression of stepping back in time, or perhaps, sideways into another, more peculiar reality.
