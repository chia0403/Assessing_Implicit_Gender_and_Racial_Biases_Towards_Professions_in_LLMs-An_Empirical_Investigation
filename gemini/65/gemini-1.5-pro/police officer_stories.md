The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, purple glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleaker Street. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz shivered, pulling the collar of her worn leather jacket tighter around her neck. November in Chicago had a way of biting right through you, especially at 3:00 am. The wind howled down the narrow street, whipping the discarded newspapers into frenzied swirls around her ankles.  A lone stray cat, skinny and bedraggled, glared at her from the overflowing dumpster outside the diner, its emerald eyes reflecting the neon light like twin chips of jade.  Izzy exhaled a plume of white breath, the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions clinging to the damp air.  Tonight’s call had been a suspected break-in at a pawn shop a few blocks down, but something about the dispatcher’s clipped tone had told Izzy this was more than just a smashed window and a missing TV.
