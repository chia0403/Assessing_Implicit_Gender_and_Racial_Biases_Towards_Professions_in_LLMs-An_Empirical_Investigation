The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the otherwise quiet Tuesday afternoon.  His office, nestled in a converted Victorian house on the edge of the historic district of Oakhaven, Illinois, usually felt warm and inviting, a sanctuary of sorts. But today, the usual comforting scent of old books and brewing tea was overlaid with a palpable tension. Elias, a wiry man with kind eyes and a salt-and-pepper beard neatly trimmed, sat behind his heavy oak desk, the faint glow of his laptop screen reflecting in his glasses.  He tapped a pen against a leather-bound notepad, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the relentless rain, a subtle betrayal of the unease churning within him.  His next patient, a new referral shrouded in mystery, was late.  And in Elias's experience, late arrivals often carried the heaviest burdens.
