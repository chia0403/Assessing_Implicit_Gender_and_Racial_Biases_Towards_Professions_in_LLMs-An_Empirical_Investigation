Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her newest patient.  The room, usually a haven of calm with its muted earth tones and strategically placed philodendrons, felt charged with a nervous energy.  Located on the fifth floor of a stately pre-war building on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, the office overlooked the Public Garden, now a blur of green and grey under the downpour.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, observed the young man seated opposite her fidgeting with the silver ring on his thumb.  He hadn't spoken a word since arriving, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the distant wail of a siren cutting through the city's hushed symphony.  This was Elias Thorne's third session, and Eleanor was beginning to suspect his silence held more weight than any confession.
