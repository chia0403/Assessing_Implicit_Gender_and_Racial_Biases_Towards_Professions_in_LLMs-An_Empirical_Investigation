The biting wind whipped across the Alaskan tundra, stinging Amelia “Amy” Hayes’s cheeks even through the layers of fleece and thermal gear.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges, a stark contrast to the iron-grey expanse of the North Slope stretching out before her. Amy exhaled, a plume of white momentarily obscuring the gargantuan treads of the Caterpillar D11 dozer she’d just climbed into.  The cab, despite the humming heater, still held a chill, a metallic tang mixing with the faint scent of diesel. Around her, the sprawling construction site of the new Trans-Alaskan Pipeline access road was slowly shuddering to life.  Floodlights illuminated the churned earth, casting long, distorted shadows of the other heavy machines and the bundled figures of her fellow crew members preparing for another grueling day.  This far north, in the heart of Prudhoe Bay, winter’s grip was relentless, and the race against the rapidly approaching deep freeze was on.  Amy adjusted her hardhat, the faint rumble of the D11’s engine vibrating through her bones, a familiar comfort in this desolate, unforgiving landscape. Today's task: carve a path through a particularly stubborn ridge of permafrost.  A challenge, sure, but Amy lived for challenges.
