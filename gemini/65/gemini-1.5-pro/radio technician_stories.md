The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" buzzed a mournful B-flat, a counterpoint to the howl of the desert wind whipping through Harmony Gulch, Nevada. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and desperation.  Elara Josephine Reyes, her brow furrowed in concentration, perched precariously on a stool, a tangle of wires spilling from the ancient Zenith radio console like metallic entrails. Outside, the year was 1957, and the rock 'n' roll revolution was sweeping the nation. Inside, Harmony Gulchâ€™s only connection to the outside world was gasping its last, static crackling from the speaker like the death rattle of a desert lizard. Elara tapped a loose vacuum tube with her fingernail, a faint *ping* echoing in the otherwise silent diner. If she couldn't fix this thing, Harmony Gulch would be truly lost, swallowed whole by the vast, indifferent expanse of the Mojave.
