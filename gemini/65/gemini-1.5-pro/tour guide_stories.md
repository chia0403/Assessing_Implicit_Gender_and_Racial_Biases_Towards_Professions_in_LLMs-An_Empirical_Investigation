The humid air hung thick and heavy, draped like a damp velvet curtain over the crumbling Mayan ruins of Chichén Itzá.  Cicadas buzzed with a ferocity that rivaled the midday sun, their song echoing across the vast plaza.  Beatriz "Bea" Esperanza Ramirez, her name a melodious cascade as familiar to the stones as the chirp of the kiskadees, adjusted the wide-brimmed hat shading her face. A faded turquoise scarf, the color of the Caribbean she'd grown up beside, fluttered against her linen shirt.  This was her domain, her stage. For twenty years, Bea had guided countless souls through this ancient city, weaving tales of kings and gods, of sacrifices and celestial alignments, her voice a vibrant thread connecting the past to the present. But today, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual thrill of anticipation.  The tour group milling around her, a motley collection of sunburnt tourists clutching water bottles and cameras, seemed oblivious to the subtle shift in the atmosphere.  Bea, however, felt it – a prickling awareness, a sense of something ancient and powerful stirring beneath the sun-baked stones.
