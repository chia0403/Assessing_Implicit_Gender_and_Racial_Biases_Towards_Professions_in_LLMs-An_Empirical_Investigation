The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, cherry-red glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Eleanor Grace Holloway, or Ellie as everyone called her, wiped down yet another sticky Formica tabletop, the worn rag leaving streaks across the faded checkered pattern.  Midnight was fast approaching, and the Starlight, usually bustling with truckers and late-night wanderers, was eerily quiet. Only two occupied booths remained: a lone trucker hunched over a plate of lukewarm meatloaf, and a couple in the corner booth locked in a hushed, tense argument. Ellie sighed, the fluorescent lights buzzing above her like angry wasps.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful sound that seemed to echo the emptiness in her own heart.  She had a feeling this was going to be a long night.
