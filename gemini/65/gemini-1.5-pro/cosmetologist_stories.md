The pungent aroma of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting scent to Genevieve "Gen" Dubois.  Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down video rental store in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was her kingdom.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and painting distorted streaks of light across the faded floral wallpaper. It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically slow, but today was slower than usual.  Gen, perched on a rolling stool behind the reception desk, idly flipped through a dog-eared copy of "Cosmopolitan," her fiery red hair piled high in a gravity-defying bouffant.  The only other occupant of the salon was Mrs. Henderson, a regular, whose weekly blue rinse was processing beneath a mountain of plastic wrap.  The rhythmic whir of the hairdryer was the only sound besides the relentless drumming of the rain.  Suddenly, the bell above the door chimed, a discordant jingle in the otherwise quiet afternoon.
