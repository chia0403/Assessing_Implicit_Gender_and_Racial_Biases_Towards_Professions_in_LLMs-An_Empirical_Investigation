The humid Miami air hung heavy, thick with the scent of hibiscus and salt spray, a stark contrast to the crisp, air-conditioned sanctuary of "Nailed It," Amelia Rose Hernandez's nail salon. Nestled between a bustling botanica overflowing with Santería candles and a laundromat perpetually humming with the rhythm of spin cycles, Amelia’s small shop was a vibrant splash of flamingo pink and turquoise in the otherwise faded pastel landscape of Little Havana.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating rows of meticulously organized nail polish bottles, glittering like a rainbow of tiny jewels.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically slow, but Amelia, ever the optimist, was already prepping for the after-work rush, humming along to Celia Cruz while expertly shaping a set of acrylics. The small bell above the door chimed, announcing her first client, and Amelia, with a warm, practiced smile, greeted them with a lilting, "Buenos días! Welcome to Nailed It. What can I do for you today?"
