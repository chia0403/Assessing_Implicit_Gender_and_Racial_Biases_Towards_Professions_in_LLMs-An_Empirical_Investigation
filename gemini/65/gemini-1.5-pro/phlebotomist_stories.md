The pre-dawn chill seeped through the thin walls of Amelia Reyes’s tiny apartment, raising goosebumps on her arms as she pulled on her scrubs.  4:30 AM. Another day, another bleary-eyed stumble to St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Isabella Reyes, preferred the quiet solitude of these early mornings. It gave her time to steel herself for the day ahead: a symphony of needles, vials, and the occasional vasovagal syncope.  St. Jude's, a sprawling complex of brick and glass that dominated the otherwise modest skyline of Ashwood, Ohio, was a place of both hope and quiet despair.  The hushed reverence of the chapel, the beeping monitors, the ever-present scent of antiseptic – it was a world Amelia had inhabited for the past five years, a world she knew intimately, yet one that still held an element of the unknown within each patient's veins. This morning, however, a different kind of unease prickled at her. A thick fog had rolled in overnight, blanketing Ashwood in an eerie silence, a silence broken only by the rhythmic swoosh of the windshield wipers as Amelia drove towards the looming silhouette of the hospital.  Something felt different, off-kilter.
