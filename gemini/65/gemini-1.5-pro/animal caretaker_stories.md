The biting wind whipped Amelia “Milly” Petrova’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen yard, the crunch of snow under her thick boots the only sound louder than the mournful howl of the timber wolves housed in the far enclosure.  Dawn painted the snow-covered peaks of the Cascade Mountains a pale lavender, a stark contrast to the inky shadows clinging to the valleys of the sprawling Silver Creek Wildlife Sanctuary.  Milly, head caretaker and de facto mother to the sanctuary’s motley crew of rescued animals, inhaled the crisp air, a familiar mixture of pine needles, damp earth, and the faint, ever-present scent of hay.  The sanctuary, nestled in a secluded pocket of the Washington wilderness, was her life's work, a haven built on love, sweat, and an inexhaustible supply of animal crackers. Today, however, a different kind of chill settled deep in Milly's bones. A chill that had nothing to do with the December air and everything to do with the anonymous note she’d found tucked under her cabin door that morning.  A note containing a single, chilling sentence: “They aren’t as safe as you think.”
