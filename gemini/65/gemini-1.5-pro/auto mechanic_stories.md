The biting November wind whipped through the gaping maw of Elias Thorne's garage, swirling dust devils across the cracked concrete floor.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered space.  Wrenches hung haphazardly on the pegboard, interspersed with faded pin-up calendars and a hand-drawn diagram of a '67 Mustang engine.  Outside, the skeletal branches of a sycamore tree clawed at the overcast sky above the small town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, a place where rusty pickups outnumbered Teslas and the biggest excitement was the annual pie-eating contest at the county fair.  Elias, his calloused hands stained with grease and his brow furrowed in concentration, lay sprawled beneath a cherry-red '57 Chevy Bel Air, a wrench clenched between his teeth as he wrestled with a stubborn bolt. The radio, perched precariously on a stack of old tires, sputtered out a bluesy tune, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of metal against metal.  This was Elias's sanctuary, his church, his escape from the quiet desperation that seemed to permeate Harmony Creek like the ever-present smell of woodsmoke. But the quiet wouldn't last.  A sleek, black car, out of place amongst the town's usual clunkers, pulled up outside the garage, its headlights cutting through the gloom like a predator's eyes.
