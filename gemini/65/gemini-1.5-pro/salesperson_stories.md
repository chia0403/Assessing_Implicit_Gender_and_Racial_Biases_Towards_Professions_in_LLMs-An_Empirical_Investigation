The stale air of the Greyhound bus terminal clung to Amelia Grace Holloway like a damp towel.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped linoleum floor and the rows of worn plastic seats. Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Dustbowl, Oklahoma, was a bruised purple, promising another scorching summer day. Amelia clutched her briefcase, its cheap leather warmed by her hand, and shifted her weight, the worn heels of her sensible pumps digging into the unforgiving floor.  She was tired, her stomach growled with a hunger only slightly sated by the stale peanut butter crackers sheâ€™d choked down hours ago, and her throat was parched. Dustbowl was the last stop on this leg of her sales route, a town she'd dreaded since she'd first seen it marked on her itinerary.  It was the kind of place that seemed to suck the ambition right out of the sky along with the rain, leaving behind only cracked earth and broken dreams.  But Amelia had quota to meet, and Dustbowl, despite its name and general aura of despair, still held potential customers for Holloway Household Appliances.
