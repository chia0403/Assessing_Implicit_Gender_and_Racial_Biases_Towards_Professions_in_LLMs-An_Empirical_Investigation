The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the easel into position, the wind threatening to topple it onto the jagged rocks below.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, whipped his already wind-chapped lips.  He stood perched precariously on a narrow ledge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the dramatic cliffs of Cornwall rising behind him like the teeth of some slumbering giant.  His canvas, still pristine white, stared back at him, a stark challenge against the breathtaking chaos of the storm-tossed sea.  Elias, a painter whose palette usually favoured the gentle hues of sun-drenched Tuscan landscapes, found himself strangely captivated by the untamed beauty of this tempestuous coastline.  This was a world away from his usual serene subjects, a world that demanded a different kind of artistry, a fiercer brushstroke.
