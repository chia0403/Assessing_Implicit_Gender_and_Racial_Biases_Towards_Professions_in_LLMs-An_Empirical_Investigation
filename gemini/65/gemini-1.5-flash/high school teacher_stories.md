The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s increasingly frantic search.  It was 7:45 pm, the last lingering students long gone, the custodians already making their rounds with the rhythmic squeak of mop buckets.  Eleanor, however, remained, her sensible cardigan askew, papers scattered across her desk like fallen autumn leaves.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, unsettling sweetness of spilled cherry hand sanitizer – a lingering reminder of the chaotic day that had just ended.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song against the grimy windows, rattling the panes and mirroring the turmoil churning within her. Tonight, the usual post-school grading and lesson planning felt insignificant, overshadowed by a far more pressing concern: the disappearance of her prized, first-edition copy of "Wuthering Heights."
