The wind, a snarling, icy beast, clawed at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks as he wrestled a length of tar-soaked felt onto the steeply pitched roof.  Below, the town of Oakhaven huddled, a patchwork quilt of muted greys and browns under a sky the colour of a bruised plum.  A thin layer of fresh snow clung to everything â€“ the crooked chimneys, the frosted window panes, even the gnarled branches of the ancient oak that dominated the small square.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, grunted with exertion, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind.  He was perched precariously on the apex of Mrs. Gable's Victorian monstrosity, a house that seemed to defy gravity as much as Elias defied the biting cold. This wasn't just any roofing job; this was a battle against the elements, a test of skill and endurance against the unforgiving wrath of a late autumn storm.
