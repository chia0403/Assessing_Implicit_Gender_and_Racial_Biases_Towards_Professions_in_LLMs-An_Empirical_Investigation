The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a perfume as familiar to Aurelia “Rella” Blackwood as the feel of cold steel shears in her hand.  Rella’s salon, "The Snip & Stitch," nestled between a crumbling bakery and a perpetually-empty antique shop on Bleecker Street, was a haven of mismatched vintage furniture and the comforting hum of a tireless old hairdryer.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the chipped porcelain sink where Rella often found herself staring into her own tired reflection. Outside, the cacophony of New York City thrummed – a relentless beat to the quiet rhythm of her work.  Today, however, the usual comforting chaos felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, heavier even than the scent of Mrs. Gable’s disastrous attempt at home perming last Tuesday.  Something was about to happen.
