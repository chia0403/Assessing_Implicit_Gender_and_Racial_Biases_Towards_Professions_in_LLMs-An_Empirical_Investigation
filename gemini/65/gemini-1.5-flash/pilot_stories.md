The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Twin Otter, its metallic shriek swallowed by the vast, white expanse.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, clung to the fuselage, obscuring the already limited visibility.  Below, the endless, undulating plains of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched to the horizon, a desolate kingdom of frozen fury.  The air tasted of ozone and the chilling breath of the Southern Ocean, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this land.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, gripped the controls with gloved hands, her gaze fixed on the flickering instruments, a tiny island of warmth and technology in a sea of blinding white.  The radio crackled with static, a ghostly whisper against the wind's roar, a tenuous connection to the world beyond this frozen wasteland.  Her mission: a desperate supply run to a remote research station, battling not only the elements but also a growing unease that gnawed at her gut â€“ a feeling that this flight was anything but routine.
