The chipped porcelain doorknob felt cold beneath Seraphina “Sera” Moreau’s gloved hand.  A gust of wind, scented with woodsmoke and damp earth, whipped around her as she pushed it open, revealing a hallway swallowed by shadow.  Dust motes danced in the single, weak beam of her flashlight, illuminating peeling wallpaper patterned with faded roses – a morbidly cheerful backdrop to the crumbling grandeur of Blackwood Manor.  This wasn't the sleek, minimalist aesthetic Sera usually dealt with; this was a gothic ghost story waiting to happen, and as the owner of Moreau & Co. Interior Design, she was about to be its unlikely heroine.  The air hung heavy with the scent of decay, a counterpoint to the surprisingly vibrant scent of lavender clinging faintly to the worn velvet drapes.  Blackwood Manor, abandoned for decades, was poised on the precipice of collapse, both literally and figuratively, and Sera had been hired to breathe life – and perhaps a little bit of tasteful modernism – back into its decaying heart.
