The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the reinforced fabric of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s parka.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed skin despite the multiple layers of thermal gear.  Above, the sky was a bruised purple, the relentless twilight casting long, skeletal shadows from the research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the ice shelf.  The air itself tasted of ozone and frozen despair.  Eleanor, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the magnification on her high-powered binoculars, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering expanse of the Weddell Sea.  This wasn't the picturesque, pristine Antarctica of postcards; this was a landscape etched in harsh beauty, a frozen wilderness whispering secrets only a few dared to listen to – secrets Eleanor Vance was determined to uncover.
