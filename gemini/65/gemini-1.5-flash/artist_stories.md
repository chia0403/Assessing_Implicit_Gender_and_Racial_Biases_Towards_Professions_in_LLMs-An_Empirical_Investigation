The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mel” Hawthorne’s unruly auburn curls across her face as she wrestled the canvas onto the easel.  The flimsy metal legs threatened to give way under the weight of the oversized painting, a chaotic swirl of blues and greens that mirrored the turbulent sea churning against the jagged cliffs below.
