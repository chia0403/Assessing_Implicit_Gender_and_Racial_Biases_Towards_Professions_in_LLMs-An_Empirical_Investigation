The biting wind whipped across the obsidian peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  A lone figure, cloaked in thick furs the color of a winter sky, stood sentinel atop the crumbling watchtower.  His name was Kaelen Rhys, and for ten years, he’d been the sole guardian of the Whisperwind Pass, a treacherous throat of rock and ice that served as the only viable route through the Dragon's Tooth for miles.  The wind howled a mournful dirge around him, echoing the emptiness that had settled deep in his soul since the last patrol had gone missing, swallowed by the unforgiving wilderness.  Below, the pass stretched into a yawning chasm, a black ribbon snaking between jagged, snow-covered teeth that clawed at the bruised purple sky.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic thud of Kaelen’s heart, a steady drumbeat against the looming silence.
