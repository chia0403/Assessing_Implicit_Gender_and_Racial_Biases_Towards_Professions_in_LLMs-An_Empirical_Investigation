The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, the icy breath of the Cascade Mountains clinging to him like a shroud.  He stood perched precariously on the edge of a logging road, the raw, splintered wood digging into his worn leather boots. Below, the valley was a tapestry of snow-dusted evergreens, their branches heavy with the weight of recent snowfall.  The air hung still, broken only by the occasional creak of a burdened pine and the distant, mournful cry of a raven.  The smell of pine sap, damp earth, and woodsmoke – the familiar, earthy perfume of his life – was sharp in his nostrils.  This was the heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, a wilderness both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving, and Elias Thorne, with his calloused hands and eyes the colour of storm clouds, knew it intimately.
