The chipped Formica countertop of the Rusty Mug felt cold against Elara Vance's cheek as she rested her head, the faint scent of stale beer and spilled whiskey clinging to her like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the bar, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a hazy, orange smear.  Inside, the Rusty Mug was a refuge from the storm, a dimly lit haven of flickering candlelight, worn leather booths, and the low hum of conversation â€“ a stark contrast to the howling wind that threatened to rip the building from its foundations.  Elara, with her auburn braid escaping its haphazard bun and eyes the color of a stormy sea, was the only soul behind the bar, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clinking of ice in the well-worn glass dispenser.  Tonight, the usual Friday night bustle was absent, replaced by a palpable unease that settled heavy in the air, thicker even than the cigarette smoke clinging to the ceiling.
