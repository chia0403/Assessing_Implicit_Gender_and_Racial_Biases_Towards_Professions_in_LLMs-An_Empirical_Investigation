The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that had clung to Elias Thorne's workshop for as long as he could remember.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of his shop, "Thorne's Tailoring," on the cobbled side street of Silverstream.  The street itself was a narrow, winding thing, hemmed in by buildings that leaned towards each other like gossiping neighbours, their aged brick facades whispering tales of centuries past.  Elias, a man whose fingers were as nimble as a spider's and whose eyes held the weary wisdom of a seasoned craftsman, meticulously stitched a fine seam on a velvet waistcoat, the rhythmic hiss of his needle a counterpoint to the distant clatter of the town's bustling marketplace.  Outside, the late summer air thrummed with the energy of a town preparing for the annual Harvest Festival, but within the quiet sanctuary of his workshop, Elias found a different kind of peace.
