The rasp of stone on steel echoed through the cavern, a lonely counterpoint to the drip, drip, drip of water from unseen fissures.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single flickering oil lamp perched precariously on a nearby shelf, danced in the air, coating everything in a fine grey film.  This was Elias Thorne's world – a subterranean kingdom carved from the very heart of the mountain, a kingdom he ruled with hammer and chisel. Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and textured as the granite he shaped, breathed in the cool, damp air, the scent of wet earth and crushed stone filling his lungs.  His workbench, a broad slab of polished slate, was littered with tools – mallets, chisels of varying sizes, and a collection of oddly shaped scrapers, each honed to a razor's edge.  He worked in a space where the air hung thick with the scent of granite and the quiet hum of creation, far removed from the bustling marketplace of Oakhaven, a town nestled high in the valley above.
