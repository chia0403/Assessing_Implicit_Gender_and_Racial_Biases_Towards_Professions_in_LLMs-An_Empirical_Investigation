The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom" sign seemed to mirror the cracks in Eleanor’s own composure.  Rain lashed against the windows of Maplewood Elementary, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic thump-thump-thump of her heart.  It was the last day of school before summer break, a day usually brimming with the joyous chaos of children’s final exuberance, but this year felt different.  A heavy, oppressive silence hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic hiss of the leaky radiator and the occasional squeak of a chair leg scraping against the linoleum floor.  The scent of stale crayons and old carpet, usually comforting, felt suffocating tonight.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines usually outweighed her frown lines by a significant margin, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and she could feel it radiating from the usually vibrant heart of her classroom, now chillingly still under the pale glow of the fluorescent lights.
