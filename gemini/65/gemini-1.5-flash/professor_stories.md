Professor Armitage "Armi" Finch adjusted his spectacles, the faint scent of old paper and pipe tobacco clinging to the tweed of his elbow patches.  Rain lashed against the gothic windows of his study, a relentless drumming that mirrored the tempest brewing within him.

A half-empty cup of lukewarm tea sat beside a cluttered desk, its surface buried beneath a flurry of papers â€“ lecture notes, research drafts, and the ever-present, dog-eared copy of  "The Annotated Canterbury Tales."  Outside, the wind howled through the ancient oaks that guarded Blackwood Manor, their skeletal branches clawing at the stormy sky.  This was no ordinary storm; this was a storm that threatened not only the weather, but also the carefully constructed world Armitage Finch inhabited.
