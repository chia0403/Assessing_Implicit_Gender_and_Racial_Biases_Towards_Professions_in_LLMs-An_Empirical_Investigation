The biting November wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the reluctant goat, Bartholomew, back into his pen.  Bartholomew, a stubborn creature with a perpetually disgruntled expression, bleated his disapproval, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the uneven cobblestones of the farmyard, painting the weathered wooden fences and dilapidated barn in hues of bruised purple and fading orange.  This wasn't the picturesque countryside postcard many imagined when they thought of a veterinarian's life; this was Willow Creek Farm, nestled deep in the isolated, windswept valleys of the Scottish Highlands, a place where the veterinary emergencies were as unpredictable as the weather.  Evelyn, her gloved hands still smelling faintly of goat and antiseptic, straightened, her breath catching in her lungs. The sky, a bruised purple mirroring the farmyard, threatened snow.  Another long night lay ahead.
