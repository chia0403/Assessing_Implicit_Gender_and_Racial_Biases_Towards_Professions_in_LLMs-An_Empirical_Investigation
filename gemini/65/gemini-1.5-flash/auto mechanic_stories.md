The greasy scent of burnt motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin.  It mingled with the sharp tang of cleaning solvent and the faint, metallic sweetness of welding fumes, a perfume uniquely her own, the aroma of a life lived elbow-deep in the guts of internal combustion engines.  Amelia, or "Millie" as most of her customers knew her, leaned back against the worn, grease-stained workbench in her garage, "Hernandez's Auto," a name proudly emblazoned in faded, chipped paint above the door. The single bare bulb hanging from the rafters cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space, illuminating a chaotic symphony of tools, parts, and half-finished projects. Outside, the late afternoon sun bled crimson and gold across the dusty landscape of the Mojave Desert, painting the corrugated iron roof of the garage in fiery hues.  The only sound, besides the occasional groan of settling metal, was the rhythmic chirping of crickets, a stark counterpoint to the usual cacophony of wrenching and hammering that filled her days.  Tonight, however, an unsettling silence reigned, a silence heavier than the desert air itself.
