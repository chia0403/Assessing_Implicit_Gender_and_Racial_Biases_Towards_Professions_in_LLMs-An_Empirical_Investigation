The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Go" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Anya Petrova's Tuesday night.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume in this corner store nestled precariously between a laundromat perpetually smelling of bleach and a boarded-up auto repair shop.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless downpour of customers, each one a fleeting, demanding storm cloud in Anya's already hectic shift.  Tonight, the usual weary commuters and sleep-deprived college students were punctuated by a particularly unsettling silence punctuated only by the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner and the occasional frustrated sigh from Anya herself.  The clock ticked relentlessly towards midnight, promising only the bleak comfort of another lonely night in her cramped apartment above the bakery across the street.
