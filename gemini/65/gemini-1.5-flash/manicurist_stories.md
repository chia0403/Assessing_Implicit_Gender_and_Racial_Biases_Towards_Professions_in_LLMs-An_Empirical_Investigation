The chipped teal paint of Serenity Nails peeled away like a sunburnt tan, mirroring the flaking hope in Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather's heart.  The air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of lavender polish remover and simmering resentment.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the stagnant air above the chipped Formica countertop of her tiny salon, tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street.  Outside, the relentless New York summer pounded against the grimy windowpanes, a relentless rhythm echoing the anxieties drumming in Sera's chest.  This wasn't the bohemian dream she'd envisioned when she'd traded in her art school sketchpad for a nail file, but rent was due, and the only thing less vibrant than her business was the colour of her savings account.
