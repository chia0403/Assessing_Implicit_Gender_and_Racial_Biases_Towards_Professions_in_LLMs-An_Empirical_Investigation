Her cramped attic, nestled beneath the steeply-pitched roof of a centuries-old building in the Mala Strana district, was a far cry from the sleek, modern offices she’d left behind in London, but it was hers – a haven of overflowing bookshelves, precarious stacks of manuscripts, and the faint, comforting scent of old paper and pipe tobacco.  This was where Amelia Stone, literary editor extraordinaire, wrestled with words, shaping narratives, and trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to keep her life from unraveling as quickly as a cheap paperback.
