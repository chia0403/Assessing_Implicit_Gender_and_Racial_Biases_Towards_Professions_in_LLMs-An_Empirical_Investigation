The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Featherstonehaugh’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the chill that had settled deep in her bones.  It wasn’t the November wind rattling the ancient windowpanes of her office, though that certainly contributed.  No, this chill was a deeper, more pervasive thing, clinging to her like the scent of old paper and damp earth that permeated the air of Finch & Finch Accounting, a firm as weathered and grey as the cobbled street outside.  Finch & Finch occupied the top floor of a narrow, three-story building on Bleak Street, a thoroughfare so aptly named it felt like a curse.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the gas lamps into hazy orange orbs, while the rhythmic clang of a distant blacksmith’s hammer provided a mournful counterpoint to the city’s restless hum. Amelia, a meticulous bookkeeper with ink-stained fingers and a perpetually furrowed brow, sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm.  The ledger before her lay open, a testament to the chaotic finances of her latest client, a purveyor of dubious remedies and even more dubious morals.  It was going to be a long night.
