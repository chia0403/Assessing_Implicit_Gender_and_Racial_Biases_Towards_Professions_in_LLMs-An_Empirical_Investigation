The chipped paint of the "Happy Hippo" classroom smelled faintly of peanut butter and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak autumn sun slanting through the grimy window, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted ballerinas.  Thirty miniature tornadoes, otherwise known as five-year-olds, whirled around Ms. Eleanor Vance, their energy a vibrant, chaotic symphony of shrieks, giggles, and the rhythmic thump of tiny feet against the worn linoleum floor.  Eleanor, her usually neat bun slightly askew, surveyed the scene with a mixture of weary affection and the steely determination only a kindergarten teacher could possess.  Today's art project – finger painting autumn leaves – had devolved into a multi-sensory experience involving glitter glue explosions, rogue paintbrushes wielded like magic wands, and a surprisingly aggressive game of "who can make the biggest mud puddle on the carpet."
