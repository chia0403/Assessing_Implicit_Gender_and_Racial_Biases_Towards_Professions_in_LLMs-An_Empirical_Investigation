The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Elara Jean Blackwood’s fingertips, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise unremarkable diner called “The Cozy Corner.”  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the cracked linoleum floor, illuminating a landscape of faded red vinyl booths and a counter littered with faded sugar packets and the ghostly residue of spilled coffee.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway outside.  The only sounds beyond the incessant hum were the rhythmic clinking of Elara's own silverware as she polished it meticulously, and the mournful wail of a passing eighteen-wheeler.  The smell of stale grease and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a scent as familiar to Elara as her own reflection in the perpetually steamed-up mirror behind the counter.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet emptiness of the late-night shift felt…different.  Heavier.  Like a storm waiting to break, not just outside, but inside The Cozy Corner itself.
