The November wind howled a mournful tune around the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the windowpanes of Dr. Alistair Finch’s dental practice in the tiny village of Glencoe.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and something faintly floral – Mrs. MacIntyre’s lavender-infused mouthwash, a local specialty Alistair had grown accustomed to, though not particularly fond of.  A flickering fire in the hearth cast dancing shadows on the worn, tartan-upholstered chairs in the waiting room, a stark contrast to the gleaming, modern equipment humming quietly in the surgery beyond. Rain lashed against the stone walls of the building, a relentless drumming that seemed to mirror the persistent ache in Alistair’s own jaw, a consequence of a particularly stubborn molar he’d wrestled with earlier that day.  He rubbed his tired eyes, the reflection of the firelight momentarily blurring the panoramic view of the desolate but breathtaking landscape outside.
