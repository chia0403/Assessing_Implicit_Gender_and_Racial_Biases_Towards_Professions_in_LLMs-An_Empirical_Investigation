The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle shop cast a lurid, orange glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Rain, a relentless, sideways drizzle that seemed to seep into your very bones, hammered against the grimy windows of the small, cramped alleyway behind the shop.  Elara, a systems analyst for the city's notoriously underfunded and perpetually overwhelmed Department of Public Works, hunched deeper into her collar, the chill biting through even the multiple layers of clothing.  The air hung heavy with the smells of exhaust fumes, simmering broth, and something indefinably…off.  It was the kind of smell that clung to the edges of your perception, a low hum of disquiet beneath the louder symphony of the city. Tonight, however, that disquiet felt louder than usual.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a malfunctioning server rack – a sound only she could hear – vibrated through the concrete and into her very teeth.  It was a sound that spoke of more than just a hardware failure; it whispered of something far more sinister.
