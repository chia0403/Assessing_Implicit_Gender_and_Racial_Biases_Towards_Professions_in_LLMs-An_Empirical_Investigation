The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Edinburgh sprawling below.  The wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the loose panes and mimicking the unsettling tremor in her own chest.  Her office, situated in a converted townhouse on the shadowy side of a cobbled street, was usually a sanctuary – a space of calm and considered reflection.  Tonight, however, it felt like a cage. The flickering gas lamp on her desk cast long, dancing shadows across the Persian rug, transforming familiar objects into grotesque parodies of themselves.  Eleanor, usually a picture of composed professionalism, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  The latest patient file sat unopened on her desk, a stark white rectangle mocking her procrastination.  It was the case of Mr. Alistair Finch, and something about it – something beyond the official diagnosis – felt profoundly wrong.
