The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Dubois.  Sera, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a heart that held the secrets of a thousand hair dyes, surveyed her salon, "Shear Perfection," with a critical eye.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun slanting through the large, arched window overlooking Rue de la Paix.  Outside, Paris hummed with the usual chaotic melody of scooters, chattering tourists, and the distant, mournful sigh of a saxophone. Inside, however, a pristine calm reigned, disturbed only by the gentle whir of the hair dryers tucked away in their stylish, chrome alcoves.  Each station, meticulously organized with gleaming tools and carefully curated product lines, reflected Sera's meticulous nature and unwavering dedication to her craft.  Tonight, however, the usual serenity felt… different.  A tension, subtle yet palpable, vibrated in the air, like the static before a summer thunderstorm.
