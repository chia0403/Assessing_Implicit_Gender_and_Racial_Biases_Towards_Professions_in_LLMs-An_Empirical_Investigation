The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gavel" bar cast a lurid, emerald glow across Amelia Hernandezâ€™s rain-slicked trench coat.  The scent of stale beer and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia, a paralegal whose working hours often bled into the city's grittier underbelly.  This particular Tuesday night, however, the usual hum of low-level anxiety was amplified by the drumming rain and the insistent thrum of a distant siren.  Amelia hunched deeper into her collar, the cheap fabric offering little comfort against the November chill that gnawed at the edges of the city.  She was waiting, as she often did, nursing a lukewarm coffee and a growing sense of unease.  Tonight's wait, however, felt different; heavier, more charged with the potential for trouble.  The Golden Gavel, usually a haven for the city's less fortunate legal eagles and their even less fortunate clients, felt tonight like the eye of a storm.
