The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that piled high against the weathered fences of the Bar None Ranch.  A biting January sun, weak and pale, offered little warmth to the landscape, its feeble rays glinting off the icy surface of the frozen creek that snaked through the valley.  Above, the peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains stood stark and formidable against the vast, cerulean sky, their snow-laden slopes a silent testament to the harsh beauty of the Colorado high country.  Here, amidst the biting wind and unforgiving terrain, lived Silas "Buck" Blackwood, a man as rugged and resilient as the land he claimed.  His calloused hands, chapped and cracked from years of working the unforgiving earth, were currently occupied with mending a broken fence post, the rhythmic thud of his hammer a counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind.
