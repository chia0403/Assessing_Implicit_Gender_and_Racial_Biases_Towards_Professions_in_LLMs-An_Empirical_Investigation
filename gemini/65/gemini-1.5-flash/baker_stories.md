The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Thistlewick’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the iron groaning a familiar protest against the damp morning air.  Dust motes, disturbed by the draft, danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows of "The Honeycomb Hearth," a quaint, if somewhat dilapidated, building nestled on the edge of Oakhaven village.  The air inside, however, was a far cry from the biting cold outside.  The lingering warmth from the night’s baking clung to the aged wooden walls, mingling with the intoxicating aroma of yeast, cinnamon, and something uniquely Elara’s – a secret blend of herbs she used in her renowned sourdough.  The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the quiet hum of the bakery, a symphony of anticipation for the day's baking and the villagers who would soon fill its cozy interior.
