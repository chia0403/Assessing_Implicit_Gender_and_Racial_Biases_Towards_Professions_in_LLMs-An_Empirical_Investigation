The brine-soaked sawdust crunched under Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew's boots, a familiar counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of his cleaver.  It was a cold November morning in the town of Oakhaven, a place where the fog clung to the cobblestone streets like a shroud, and the scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts battled – and usually lost – to the ever-present aroma of blood.  Archie’s butcher shop, Bartholomew's Best Cuts, was nestled between Mrs. Periwinkle's perpetually-empty millinery and the perpetually-busy Golden Barrel Tavern, a testament to the town's peculiar priorities.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of iron and spice, a chilling perfume that hinted at the day's work ahead: a sizeable hog, two plump geese, and enough venison to feed half the town.  But Archie's mind wasn't on the meat; it was on the missing sausages.
