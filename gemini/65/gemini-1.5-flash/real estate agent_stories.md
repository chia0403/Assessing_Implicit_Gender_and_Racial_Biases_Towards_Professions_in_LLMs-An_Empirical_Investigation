The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and the promise of a thunderstorm.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, rhythmic soundtrack to the late afternoon, their chirping almost drowned out by the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of Amelia Blackwood's stilettos against the ancient, moss-draped bricks of Rainbow Row.

The late July sun beat down on her, reflecting harshly off the pastel-colored houses, their perfectly preserved facades a stark contrast to the simmering tension Amelia felt building inside her.
