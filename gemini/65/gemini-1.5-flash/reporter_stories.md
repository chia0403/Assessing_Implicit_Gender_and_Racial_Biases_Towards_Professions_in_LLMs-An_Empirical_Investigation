The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s trench coat around her legs as she hunched deeper into the shadows of the crumbling brick warehouse. Rain, a relentless grey curtain, obscured the already meager streetlights of the Docks district, leaving only the faint, greasy glow of a distant tavern to pierce the gloom.
