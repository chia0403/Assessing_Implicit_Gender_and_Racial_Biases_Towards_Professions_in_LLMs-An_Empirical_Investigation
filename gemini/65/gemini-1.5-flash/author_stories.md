The chipped paint of Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s writing desk flaked onto the manuscript spread before her like a miniature, literary snowstorm.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, unshaded lamp, danced in the languid afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of her attic studio.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, dried ink, and the faint, cloying sweetness of forgotten potpourri – a perfume as antiquated as the Victorian terraced house itself, nestled precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the tempestuous grey expanse of the North Sea.  Below, the waves crashed against the rocks with a relentless rhythm, a soundtrack to Amy’s writer’s block, a constant, gnawing reminder of the deadline looming closer with every thunderous roar.  Her latest novel, a historical mystery set in the same unforgiving landscape, lay unfinished, a testament to her current creative drought.
