The rasping breath of the north wind whistled a mournful tune across the frozen fields of Blackwood Farm, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  The wind, a familiar foe to Elias Thorne, bit at his exposed cheeks, stinging them despite the thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather straps of his satchel, its weight a comforting presence against his ribs.  The last sliver of sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Black Mountains, casting long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted landscape.  The farmhouse, a sturdy stone structure hunched against the elements like an old, weary man, offered a promise of warmth and a meager supper, but tonight, Eliasâ€™s heart felt colder than the biting wind.  He was late, far later than he should be, and a dread, cold and sharp as a shard of ice, pierced his usual stoicism.
