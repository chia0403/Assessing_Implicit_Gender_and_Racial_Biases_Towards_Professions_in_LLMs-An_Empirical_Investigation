Below, the cobblestone streets of the historic French Quarter shimmered, a labyrinth of wrought iron balconies and gas lamps, each potential hiding place for a disaster waiting to unfold. Tonight, the scent of jasmine was battling a more sinister aroma – a sharp, acrid tang that spoke of smoke and something far worse.
