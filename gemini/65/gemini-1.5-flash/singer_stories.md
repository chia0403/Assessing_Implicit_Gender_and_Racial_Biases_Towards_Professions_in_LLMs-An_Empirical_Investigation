The salt spray kissed Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's face as she braced herself against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a battered fishing trawler repurposed as a floating music venue. The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, vibrated with the low thrum of the aging engine and the anticipatory hush of the crowd gathered on the splintered wooden deck.  The setting sun bled fiery orange and purple across the churning Atlantic, casting long, dramatic shadows that danced with the bobbing fishing boats scattered across the horizon.  Tonight, the stage wasn't a polished hardwood floor bathed in spotlights, but a precarious platform built atop the trawler's hold, its edges secured with rusty ropes.  This was no glamorous concert hall; this was the rough-and-tumble heart of the fishing village of Port Blossom, and for Sera, it was home.
