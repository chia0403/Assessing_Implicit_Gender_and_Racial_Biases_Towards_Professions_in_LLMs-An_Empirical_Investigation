The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's hair across her face as she wrestled the back door of the ambulance open.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, antiseptic smell she usually associated with her work.  This wasn't the brightly lit emergency room of City General; this was the backwoods of rural Vermont, specifically a logging road so narrow two ambulances couldn’t pass, snaking its way up a mountainside steeper than any she’d ever encountered.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the pines, their branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Amy, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician with five years under her belt, felt a familiar knot of tension tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another call; the dispatcher's voice had been strained, the details vague – a "severe injury," "remote location," "no cell service." The only light came from the flashing strobe of her partner, Mark's, light bar.  It felt more like a beacon of hope in a sea of encroaching darkness than a simple warning signal.
