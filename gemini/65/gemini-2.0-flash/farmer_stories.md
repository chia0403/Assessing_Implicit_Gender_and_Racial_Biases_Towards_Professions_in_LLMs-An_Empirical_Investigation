## Story Opening:

The dust devils danced a frantic waltz across Silas Bartholomew's parched field, mimicking the whirlwind of worry churning in his gut. The late afternoon sun, a molten orange eye in the bruised sky, glared down on his struggling crops, baking the thirsty earth to a cracking crust. He ran a calloused hand over the withered leaves of a corn stalk, feeling the brittle dryness beneath his fingers. Another day, another degree hotter, and another nail hammered into the coffin of this year's harvest. If the rains didn't come soon, and Silas saw no sign of them in the hazy distance, he didn't know how he was going to feed his family, let alone make the bank loan payments.

## Setting:

The setting is Dust Bowl-era Oklahoma, specifically the small, isolated farming community of Harmony Ridge, circa 1935. Silas Bartholomew's farm is a patch of struggling existence carved out of the relentless plains. The land is flat, almost brutally so, stretching out to the horizon under a vast, unforgiving sky. His farmhouse is a simple, weathered structure, its paint long since peeled away by the harsh sun and wind. A rickety porch, shaded by a tattered canvas awning, offers a meager respite from the heat. Surrounding the house are the corn and wheat fields, now looking more like fields of straw than promise. A small, dry creek bed snakes its way along the edge of the property, a constant reminder of the water that used to flow freely. In the distance, the other farmhouses of Harmony Ridge are visible, each one a lonely island in a sea of dust, each one facing the same desperate struggle for survival. The air hangs thick with the smell of dry earth and the unspoken fear of a future with nothing to harvest.
