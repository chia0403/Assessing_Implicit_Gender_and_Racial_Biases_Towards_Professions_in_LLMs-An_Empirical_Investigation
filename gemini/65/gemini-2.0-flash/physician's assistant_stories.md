Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with all the requested elements:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent chirp of the cardiac monitor was a familiar soundtrack to Annelise Beatrice Moreau's life. But tonight, it was edged with a particular urgency that tightened the knot already forming in her stomach. She leaned closer to the patient, a young man barely out of his teens, his face pale and slick with sweat. The numbers on the screen flickered erratically â€“ heart rate plummeting, blood pressure diving.

"Doctor, we've got a problem in bed three!" Annelise called out, her voice crisp and professional despite the tremor she felt rising in her chest. She grabbed the crash cart, her practiced hands already sorting through the necessary equipment. This wasn't supposed to be happening. Not to him. Not after they'd stabilized him from the initial overdose.
The overhead fluorescents hummed, a monotonous drone in the escalating chaos. Annelise glanced at the clock: 2:17 AM. Another Thursday night, another battle against the tide. And tonight, it felt like they were losing.

**Setting:**

The setting is the Emergency Room of St. Jude's Hospital, a medium-sized, Level II trauma center located in the fictional, blue-collar city of Port Blossom, Maine. The ER is a labyrinth of brightly lit corridors, partitioned by flimsy curtains and buzzing with the constant activity of nurses, doctors, and orderlies. The air hangs thick with the scent of antiseptic, stale coffee, and the underlying metallic tang of blood. While modern and equipped to handle emergencies, St. Jude's is noticeably underfunded and understaffed, which adds a layer of constant stress to the already demanding environment.
