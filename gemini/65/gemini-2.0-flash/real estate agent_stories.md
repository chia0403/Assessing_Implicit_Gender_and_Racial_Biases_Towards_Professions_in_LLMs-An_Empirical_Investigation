The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of magnolias and something saltier, something inherently southern and old. It clung to Amelia Grace Rutherfordâ€™s perfectly styled blonde bob and threatened to wilt the crisp linen of her cream-colored blazer. She dabbed at her forehead with a silk handkerchief, already feeling the familiar beads of sweat gathering at her hairline.

Amelia stood on the veranda of the old Drayton House, its towering white columns shimmering under the relentless July sun. Spanish moss dripped from the ancient live oaks like weeping ghosts, whispering secrets only the wind could understand. The house itself, a grand example of pre-Civil War architecture, was in a state of genteel decay. Peeling paint revealed glimpses of the original faded yellow, and the wrought iron railings were crusted with rust. It was the kind of house that whispered stories of opulent parties, whispered secrets, and whispered of lives long past.

Amelia, a real estate agent with Calhoun & Daughters, had secured the exclusive listing. The Drayton House was a diamond in the rough, a crumbling relic on the precipice of either magnificent restoration or utter ruin. It sat on two prime acres overlooking the Cooper River, a location that could command a fortune. But its haunted reputation, and the sheer scale of the renovations required, had kept potential buyers at bay.

Amelia smiled, a practiced, dazzling smile that usually melted even the most skeptical of clients. Today, however, her smile felt forced, brittle. She wasn't just selling a house; she was selling a piece of history, a ghost story, a challenge. And she couldn't shake the feeling that the house, with its shadowed windows and silent, watchful presence, was silently judging her.
