**Story Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee clung to the air, a grim reminder of the day’s purpose. Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted the lapel of her charcoal suit, the crisp fabric a small rebellion against the oppressive atmosphere. The fluorescent lights hummed, mirroring the nervous energy that thrummed through her own veins. She took a slow, measured breath, attempting to quiet the doubt that gnawed at the edges of her professional calm. This wasn’t her first time in a place like this, but the weight of expectation, the silent judgment in the eyes of the detectives flanking her, always felt fresh, a cold hand on her spine.

Across the narrow, windowless observation room, separated by thick, one-way glass, sat her subject. Or rather, the object of her professional scrutiny. The man's movements were lethargic, almost feline in their slow grace. He sat perfectly still, head bowed, his dark hair obscuring his face. Eleanor knew, from the countless files she'd poured over, that those dark eyes, when raised, could hold a chilling emptiness, a void that sucked the air from the room. She was here to understand what lay behind that emptiness. She was here to unravel the twisted knot of his mind.

**Setting:**

The setting is a high-security wing of the fictional Hawthorne Correctional Facility, a state prison located in a remote, wooded area of western Massachusetts. Specifically, the opening scene takes place in an observation room overlooking the interrogation room. The walls are painted a drab, institutional beige, and the only furniture consists of a metal table, a couple of uncomfortable chairs, and the aforementioned one-way mirror. The overall atmosphere is sterile and isolating, designed to strip away any sense of control or power from the incarcerated. Outside the observation room, down a long corridor lined with heavy steel doors, lie the cells of the prison's most dangerous and volatile inmates. The hum of electricity and the rhythmic clang of distant doors punctuate the silence, a constant reminder of the controlled chaos that exists just beyond the observation room’s fragile barrier.
