Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a school psychologist:

**Setting:** The stifling heat of late August hung heavy over the small town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Cicadas buzzed a relentless chorus outside the window of the Harmony Creek Elementary School's guidance office. Inside, the air conditioning strained, groaning more than cooling. Construction crews worked on the new wing, adding to the din and the disruption. The scent of sawdust mingled with the faint aroma of stale coffee and disinfectant, a familiar perfume for this time of year.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the headache that had been threatening all morning. The school year hadn't even officially started, and already her inbox was overflowing. "Possible anxiety case in Mrs. Henderson's 2nd grade," one email declared in bold red letters. "Severe aggression incident on the playground, needs immediate intervention," another screamed. Eleanor sighed, leaning back in her worn office chair. The fabric stuck uncomfortably to her back. She hadn't even had time to unpack her books, and the 'Welcome Back' banner she'd hung with such optimistic fervor last week now felt like a cruel joke. A stack of evaluation forms, thick and intimidating, sat precariously balanced on the corner of her desk. Harmony Creek was a good town, a close-knit community, but like everywhere else, it had its share of struggles, and those struggles invariably landed on Eleanor's doorstep. Today, it seemed, they were arriving with a vengeance. The phone rang, a shrill, insistent bleat that shattered the already fragile peace of her morning. She answered it with a weary, "Dr. Ainsworth, school psychologist."
