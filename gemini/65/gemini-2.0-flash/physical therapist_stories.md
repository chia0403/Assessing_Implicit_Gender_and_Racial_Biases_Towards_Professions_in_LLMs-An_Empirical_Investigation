## Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid Atlanta air hung heavy, thick with the promise of a late afternoon thunderstorm. Cicadas buzzed a relentless chorus outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of "Restore & Revive," a brightly lit physical therapy clinic in the trendy West Midtown neighborhood. Inside, the rhythmic whir of a stationary bike fought for dominance over the soft jazz playing through the overhead speakers.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Mae "Ellie" Harding adjusted the resistance on the bike for Mrs. Gable, a sweet woman recovering from a hip replacement, her brow furrowed in concentration. "Just a few more minutes, Mrs. Gable. You're doing wonderfully!" Ellie offered a reassuring smile, her own chestnut hair pulled back in a practical ponytail. She glanced at the clock. Three PM. The afternoon lull was about to break, and the next wave of patients, a mix of weekend warriors and chronic pain sufferers, would be descending. Ellie sighed, a subtle sound that barely registered over the music. She loved her work, the tangible satisfaction of helping people regain their mobility and independence. But some days, the weight of their pain, both physical and emotional, felt heavier than the weight machines in the corner of the room. Today was shaping up to be one of those days.
