Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a phlebotomist named Abigail Iris Thorne:

**Setting:** The story opens on a bleak, overcast Tuesday morning in late October at the "Riverbend Urgent Care" clinic. Riverbend is a small town nestled along the muddy banks of the (surprise) Riverbend River, known more for its annual pumpkin festival and the persistent dampness that seemed to seep into everything than for its vibrant healthcare. The clinic itself is a converted two-story house, painted a faded, optimistic yellow that belies the general air of quiet desperation that hangs in the waiting room like a persistent cough.

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Abigail Iris Thorne’s morning. She stared at the small, red stain blooming on her freshly laundered white coat, a testament to the hazards of handling impatient toddlers and leaky Vacutainers before 8:00 AM. Abigail sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. 

“Just another Tuesday,” she muttered under her breath, the words barely audible above the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor in Exam Room 2.

She wiped the offending spot with a pre-moistened alcohol swab, the medicinal scent momentarily overpowering the lingering aroma of burnt coffee that clung to the clinic like a stubborn barnacle. Riverbend Urgent Care wasn't exactly the Mayo Clinic, but it was home. And for Abigail, home was where the veins were easy to find, the patients needed a kind word, and the coffee was perpetually too strong and slightly scorched. Today, however, promised to be more than just another Tuesday. The air felt thick with an unusual tension, a palpable sense of something shifting in the otherwise predictable humdrum of Riverbend.
