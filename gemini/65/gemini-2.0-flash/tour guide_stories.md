Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a tour guide named Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Setting:**

The setting is the sleepy, often-overlooked, but secretly charming, town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. Havenwood is a place where time seems to move a little slower. It's known for its antique shops, its abundance of rhododendrons that explode in a riot of pink and purple every spring, and the rumor of a lost gold mine somewhere in the surrounding hills. The heart of Havenwood is its town square, dominated by a slightly crooked clock tower that chimes with an unsettlingly cheerful rendition of "Oh! Susanna" every hour. Cobblestone streets wind past clapboard houses with rocking chairs on their porches, and the air is thick with the scent of pine and woodsmoke.

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, better known as "Bea" by anyone who could pronounce her full name without stumbling, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed sun hat and squinted at the assembled crowd. Ten people. Not a bad turnout for a Tuesday in Havenwood, where the most exciting event of the day was usually Mrs. Higgins' cat getting stuck in the oak tree in the town square.

Bea cleared her throat, the sound echoing slightly in the hushed anticipation. "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Havenwood Historic Haunts and Hidden Gems Walking Tour! I'm Bea, and for the next two hours, I'll be your guide through the fascinating, and occasionally spooky, history of our beloved town." She gave them a warm, practiced smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes. "Now, before we begin, I want to make one thing clear: I am not responsible for any sudden ghostly encounters, accidental stumbles into hidden gold mines, or spontaneous outbreaks of mountain clogging. You are all adults, I trust. Let’s try to keep it that way.” She paused, then added with a wink, "Although, if anyone *does* find the lost mine, I get ten percent."

Bea gestured with her hand-carved walking stick towards the crooked clock tower. "Our tour starts right here, at the heart of Havenwood, with the story of the 'Tick-Tock Terror' and the unfortunate clockmaker, Bartholomew Bumble, who swore he could hear the gears whispering to him..."
