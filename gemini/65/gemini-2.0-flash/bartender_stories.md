The clinking of ice in a shaker was the soundtrack to Johnathan "Johnny" Riley's life. On a Tuesday night like any other, the din of The Rusty Mug hung heavy in the air: a low thrum of drunken laughter, clattering glasses, and the mournful twang of a country song bleeding from the jukebox in the corner. The air, thick with the scent of spilled beer and cheap cologne, clung to Johnny's faded denim shirt as he deftly poured a shot of rye, the amber liquid a fiery glint against the worn mahogany of the bar.

The Rusty Mug wasn't much to look at. Nestled on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Oklahoma, it was a haven for cowboys, truckers, and the lonely hearts of a dying small town. The neon sign above the door, missing a crucial "R," flickered intermittently, spelling out "USTY MUG" â€“ a fitting testament to the place's age and the lives that had been lived within its dimly lit confines. Cobwebs clung to the dusty taxidermy deer head mounted above the cracked mirror behind the bar, a silent observer to countless nights of heartache and revelry. Outside, the vast, flat landscape of Oklahoma stretched out under a star-dusted sky, offering a silent contrast to the vibrant chaos brewing within.
