## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The harsh Arizona sun beat down on the turquoise stucco of "Desert Bloom Beauty," baking the cacti flanking the entrance until they practically shimmered. Inside, the air conditioning hummed a welcome, a constant battle against the outside inferno. Penelope Annabelle Hawthorne adjusted the lavender silk scarf around her neck, a futile attempt to keep stray hairs from escaping her perfectly coiffed blonde bob. She squinted at her reflection in the salon mirror, a fleeting flicker of doubt crossing her usually confident face. Today was the day. Today was the day she'd finally convince Mrs. Edith Blackwood, a woman whose skin was so tight Penelope suspected she slept in a vacuum-sealed bag, that botox *actually* worked. Lord help her.

**Setting:**

Desert Bloom Beauty is located in Scottsdale, Arizona, nestled amongst a strip of upscale boutiques and art galleries. The salon is a haven of pastel colors and delicate floral arrangements, a deliberate contrast to the harsh, unforgiving landscape outside. The walls are lined with framed diplomas and certifications, a testament to Penelope's dedication and skill. The air smells perpetually of lavender, coconut oil, and a faint hint of that potent hairspray Penelope favored. It's a place where the wealthy women of Scottsdale come to be pampered, preened, and perfected, clinging to the illusion of eternal youth under Penelope's careful ministrations. Outside, the desert stretches on, a silent reminder of time's relentless march.
