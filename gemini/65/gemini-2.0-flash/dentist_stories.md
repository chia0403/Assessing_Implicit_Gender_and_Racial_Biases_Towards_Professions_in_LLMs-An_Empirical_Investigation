## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, late afternoon air hung thick and heavy over Savannah, Georgia. Spanish moss dripped languidly from the ancient oak trees lining Abercorn Street, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched across the cobblestones. The sweet, almost cloying scent of honeysuckle mingled with the briny tang of the nearby river, creating a heady, intoxicating perfume unique to the Lowcountry. Inside the quaint, two-story building at number 422, the air conditioning hummed a valiant but ultimately failing battle against the Southern heat.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Alistair Bartholomew Grimshaw, D.D.S., stared at his reflection in the stainless steel surface of his dental mirror. He sighed, a sound that rustled the crisp, starched collar of his white lab coat. Alistair Bartholomew Grimshaw. Even his name soundedâ€¦ well, *old*. Just like his practice, just like Savannah itself. He smoothed a hand over his thinning, prematurely gray hair. At forty-two, he was hardly ancient, but the stress of running a solo practice in a city obsessed with sweet tea and notoriously bad dental hygiene was starting to take its toll. The whir of the overhead X-ray machine momentarily drowned out the mournful strains of a jazz tune drifting in from the open window. Today, like most days, had been a whirlwind of cavities, root canals, and lectures on the importance of flossing, all delivered with the patient charm of a man desperately trying to maintain a semblance of professionalism while secretly fantasizing about escaping to a remote, cavity-free island. He checked his schedule one last time. One more patient. Mrs. Eloise Davenport, for a post-operative checkup. He braced himself. Mrs. Davenport was charming, bless her heart, but she also possessed the uncanny ability to turn a simple ten-minute appointment into an hour-long dissertation on the genealogy of her prize-winning chihuahua, Princess Fluffybutt III. Alistair adjusted his glasses and pasted a smile on his face. Showtime.
