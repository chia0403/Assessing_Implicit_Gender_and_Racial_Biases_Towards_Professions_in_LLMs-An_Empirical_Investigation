## Story Opening:

The stale scent of mildew and despair clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' mustache like morning dew. He squinted, the weak beam of his headlamp cutting a pathetic swathe through the gloom under Mrs. Delacroix's Victorian monstrosity. He’d been crawling through this cramped, dirt-floored purgatory for the better part of an hour, his knees aching, his back screaming, and his optimism rapidly draining away.

The culprit, of course, was another busted pipe. He’d dealt with Mrs. Delacroix's plumbing woes more times than he cared to remember, and each visit felt like a descent into the bowels of some forgotten age. This time, though, felt… different. The air was heavier, thick with a sense of wrongness that had nothing to do with stagnant water and decaying organic matter. He could practically taste it – a metallic tang of fear mingled with the cloying sweetness of rot.

He’d found the leak, a rusty fissure spitting a thin, angry stream onto the already soaked earth. But it wasn’t the leak that made him hesitate. It was the glint of something unnatural, something reflecting his headlamp's beam back at him with an unnerving intensity. He reached out, his gloved hand trembling slightly, and brushed away a clump of clinging mud. What he uncovered was far more disturbing than a simple plumbing problem.

## Setting:

**The Delacroix Mansion, Oakwood, Illinois, October 27th, 1988.**

The Delacroix Mansion was a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Oakwood. Built in the late 19th century, it was a testament to misguided ambition and questionable taste. Its dark, imposing facade was characterized by crumbling gargoyles, pointed arch windows, and a general air of dilapidation. The paint was peeling, the garden overgrown, and the entire structure seemed to sigh with the weight of forgotten memories.

The mansion had been owned by the Delacroix family for generations, a lineage whispered about in hushed tones throughout Oakwood. Legends abounded, tales of eccentric inventors, tragic love affairs, and whispers of darker secrets hidden within its shadowed walls. Now, it was solely occupied by the aging and increasingly eccentric Mrs. Elara Delacroix, a woman who clung to the past with the fervor of a drowning man grasping for driftwood. The basement, where Bart found himself, was the oldest part of the house, a dark and labyrinthine network of crawlspaces and forgotten rooms that felt like a direct link to the mansion's unsettling history.
