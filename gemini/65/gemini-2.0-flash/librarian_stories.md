The faint scent of aging paper and lemon polish hung in the air, a comforting aroma that Amelia Beatrice Plumtree had come to associate with home. Outside, the blustery October wind rattled the ancient windows of the Northwood Library, threatening to tear the last stubborn leaves from the skeletal branches of the oak trees lining Elm Street. Amelia, however, was lost in the quiet hum of the reading room, surrounded by towering stacks of silent stories.

Her fingers, perpetually stained with faint traces of ink and dust, danced across the keyboard of her aging computer. The monitor glowed with a list of overdue notices, a gentle reminder of the libraryâ€™s place in the sleepy, somewhat forgetful, town of Northwood. She sighed, a small puff of breath that misted momentarily in the cool air. Northwood wasn't exactly a hotbed of literary enthusiasm.

Northwood was a town clinging to the edge of the Catskills, its main industry the fading memory of a once-thriving lumber mill. Generations had grown up, packed their bags, and left, drawn to the allure of brighter cities and quicker fortunes. Those who remained were either too stubborn, too comfortable, or, like Amelia, too rooted in the past to imagine leaving.

Amelia Beatrice Plumtree loved Northwood. And she loved its library, a creaky, Victorian-era building that had been her sanctuary since she was a little girl, escaping the often-chaotic energy of her own large, boisterous family. She knew every inch of its hallowed halls, every dusty corner, and, she suspected, almost every book within its walls. The Northwood Library was more than just a job; it was her legacy, her purpose, and, perhaps, her only real adventure.
