Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a clinical psychologist named Dr. Evelyn Reed:

**Setting:**

The biting November wind howled around the corners of St. Jude's Hospital in Evanston, Illinois, rattling the frosted windows of Dr. Evelyn Reed's ground-floor office. The room itself was a carefully cultivated sanctuary of muted earth tones: a worn, but comfortable, leather armchair for patients, a watercolor landscape of a serene lake hanging over a crack in the wall she kept meaning to fix, and a small, struggling ficus tree bravely battling the inadequate sunlight. Outside, the skeletal branches of bare trees clawed at the gray sky, a visual metaphor for the anxieties and uncertainties that often filled the air within these walls. The air held the faint scent of lemon polish and institutional antiseptic, a constant reminder of the delicate balance between healing and the realities of mental illness.

Dr. Evelyn Reed took another sip of her lukewarm Earl Grey tea, the familiar bergamot barely registering on her tired palate. It was late, nearing 9 PM, and the hospital's fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, adding to the draining weariness that clung to her like a second skin. Her last patient of the day, a young woman battling severe postpartum depression, had finally left, her shoulders slumped with a fragile hope that Evelyn had desperately tried to instill. Evelyn leaned back in her ergonomically correct, yet still uncomfortable, office chair and closed her eyes. The image of the woman's tear-streaked face flickered behind her eyelids, a reminder of the heavy weight she carried each day. A sudden, sharp knock on her door startled her.

"Come in," she said, her voice a little rough around the edges.

The door creaked open, revealing not a nurse or another doctor, but a grim-faced police detective, his trench coat damp with the lingering drizzle. "Dr. Evelyn Reed?" he asked, his voice devoid of pleasantries. "I need to ask you some questions about one of your former patients..."
