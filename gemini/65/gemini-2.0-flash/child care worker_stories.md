Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, turning the outdoor playground into a blurry, impressionistic painting of wet slides and swaying swing sets. Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging a small circle on the glass. 

It was Tuesday, which meant "Terrific Tuesday" crafts, which meant an abundance of glitter, despite Amelia's best efforts to suggest alternatives. Her fingers, still shimmering stubbornly gold from the morning's activities, drummed a nervous rhythm on the counter. The storm was worsening, and Mrs. Henderson, little Timmyâ€™s perpetually flustered mother, had just called to say she was stuck in traffic due to a fallen tree. That meant Amelia, with her already frazzled nerves and the weight of eight energetic four-year-olds, was stuck here too, at least until the rain let up and the roads cleared. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a soundtrack to the swirling chaos in her stomach. Today, "Terrific Tuesday" felt anything but.
