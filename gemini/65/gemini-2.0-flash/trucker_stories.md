## Story Opening:

The dashboard clock bled a sickly green 3:17 AM across Delores "Dee" Mae Jefferson's face. Outside, the Nevada desert was a black void punctuated by the rhythmic swish-swish of her wipers batting at a stubborn, spitting rain. The radio, usually blaring classic country or a spirited debate about the merits of chrome, was silent, choked off by the static-laced whispers of the storm rolling in. Dee yawned, the sound echoing in the cavernous cab of her Peterbilt, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy." The rumble of the engine was a comforting hum, a familiar heartbeat in the isolating darkness. She took a swig of lukewarm coffee from her thermos, the metallic tang doing little to dispel the fog of exhaustion clinging to her like the desert dust to Betsy’s mud flaps. She'd been hauling lithium batteries from the Gigafactory near Reno to a distribution center outside of Denver for the past fourteen hours, and the endless, flat stretch of Interstate 80 was beginning to play tricks on her eyes.

"Just gotta make it to the Flying J outside Elko," she muttered to herself, the words swallowed by the wind. "Grab a shower, some real coffee, and maybe even a decent slice of pie. That’s the promise, Dee Mae."

But even as she spoke, a flicker of unease wormed its way into her gut. The air, already thick with humidity, seemed to grow heavier, charged with an unnatural stillness. The wind, which had been a constant companion, abruptly died. Even the rain seemed to hold its breath, suspended in mid-air. Dee squinted, her gaze fixed on the road ahead, but all she saw was an impenetrable black curtain. Something wasn't right. Something felt...wrong.

## Setting:

The story opens on a rainy night in the Nevada desert, specifically on Interstate 80, approximately 50 miles west of Elko, Nevada. The landscape is desolate and unforgiving: a vast, flat expanse broken only by occasional scrub brush and the distant silhouette of jagged mountains shrouded in mist. The only source of light comes from Dee's truck headlights, piercing the darkness in a feeble attempt to illuminate the road ahead. The inside of Dee's Peterbilt cab is a well-worn, comfortable space: a mobile sanctuary filled with the familiar scent of leather, diesel, and stale coffee. Maps, logbooks, and family photos are scattered across the dashboard, alongside a collection of well-loved cassette tapes. The rain outside beats against the cab like a relentless drummer, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that amplifies the feeling of isolation. The only signs of civilization are the occasional distant lights of a passing car or the flickering neon signs of a lonely roadside diner, swallowed by the vastness of the desert.
