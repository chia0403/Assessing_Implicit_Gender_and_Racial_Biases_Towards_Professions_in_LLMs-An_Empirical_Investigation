## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Amelia Eleanor Vance's face as she leaned against the railing of the fishing trawler, the rhythmic churn of the engine a comforting hum against the symphony of squawking gulls. Dawn was bleeding across the horizon, painting the choppy, grey waters of the Scottish coast in hues of bruised purple and defiant gold. The biting wind, sharp enough to draw tears, did little to quell the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.

"You alright there, lass?" a gruff voice boomed beside her. A weathered hand, calloused and smelling of fish, offered her a steaming mug.

Amelia took it with a grateful smile, the warmth seeping into her chilled fingers. "Just… letting the sea air clear my head, Hamish."

He chuckled, a sound like pebbles tumbling down a hill. "Aye, the North Sea has a way of doing that. Especially when you're running from something."

Amelia swallowed, the tea tasting faintly of brine. He wasn't wrong. She was running. Running from the pressures of Hollywood, from the crushing weight of expectation, from the acrimonious divorce plastered across every gossip rag in America. Running to… well, she wasn't entirely sure yet. She just knew she needed space, a place to breathe, and maybe, just maybe, find the flicker of inspiration that had been extinguished somewhere between wrap parties and studio boardrooms.

## Setting:

The story opens in the remote Scottish fishing village of **Port Cullen**, nestled on the rugged coast of the Moray Firth. The village is a cluster of stone cottages huddled together for protection against the relentless sea winds, painted in a palette of faded blues, greens, and whites. The air is thick with the salty tang of the ocean and the earthy aroma of peat fires burning in hearths. Fishing trawlers, weathered and scarred by years of battling the North Sea, bob gently in the harbor. A lone, imposing lighthouse stands sentinel on a rocky promontory, its beam a constant, reassuring presence in the often-turbulent landscape. The landscape surrounding the village is a tapestry of rolling, windswept hills covered in heather and gorse, leading to dramatic cliffs that plunge into the churning waters below.
