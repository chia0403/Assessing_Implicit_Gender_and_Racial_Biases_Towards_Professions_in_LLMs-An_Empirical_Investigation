## Story Opening:

The morning clung to the valley like a stubborn burr, its chill seeping into Elias Thorne’s bones despite the thick wool of his coat. He squinted, the rising sun a blinding orange smear on the horizon. The air smelled of damp earth and sage, the scent both comforting and a reminder of the endless work ahead. A hawk, sharp against the brightening sky, wheeled overhead, its lonely cry echoing across the vastness of Thorne Valley Ranch.

Elias spat, a dark stream landing on the dust-caked ground. He’d been up for hours, checking on a calving mare, and the weariness was settling in, a familiar weight on his shoulders. But he pushed it aside. Complaining wouldn’t fix a broken fence, nor would it fill the empty bellies of his cattle. Elias Thorne, all sixty-two years and weathered grit of him, had a ranch to run. And damn the aches and pains, he'd run it until the day he died.

## Setting:

**Thorne Valley Ranch** sprawls across the high plains of eastern Montana, a tapestry of golden grasslands, rocky outcrops, and ribbons of cottonwood trees lining the winding Snake Creek. The ranch house, a sturdy two-story building made of weathered logs, sits nestled at the base of a low ridge, offering a panoramic view of the valley. Outbuildings, corrals, and barns dot the landscape, each a testament to decades of hard work and stubborn perseverance. The air is often dry and windswept, carrying the scent of sagebrush and the distant murmur of cattle. The closest town, Dust Devil Gulch, is a dusty, forgotten speck on the map, a half-hour drive down a rutted dirt road. Isolation is a constant companion here, but so is the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape.
