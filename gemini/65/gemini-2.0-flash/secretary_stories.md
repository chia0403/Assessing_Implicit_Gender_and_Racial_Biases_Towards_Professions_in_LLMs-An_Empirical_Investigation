The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights was a song of tedium Beatrice Eleanor Humphrey knew intimately. It was a melody that had underscored every letter typed, every file sorted, every coffee cup filled for the past six years at Consolidated Industries. She was perched, as always, at her desk – a beige island in a sea of identical beige desks – on the fifth floor, in the typing pool. Outside, the Chicago skyline was a jagged testament to ambition, a steel and glass embodiment of all the things Beatrice felt she wasn't.

The year was 1957, and the air in the office hung heavy with cigarette smoke and the unspoken expectations of a woman her age. Marriage, babies, suburban bliss – these were the things whispered about in the ladies' room, displayed on engagement rings and baby shower invitations. But Beatrice harbored a secret, a flickering ember of ambition that refused to be extinguished by the relentless rhythm of office life. She dreamed not of diaper changes and pot roasts, but of words, of stories, of a life lived beyond the confines of the typing pool.
