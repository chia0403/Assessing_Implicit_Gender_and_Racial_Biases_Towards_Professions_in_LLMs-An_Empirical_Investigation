The scent of cedar shavings and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that clung to Silas Thorne like a second skin. Sunlight, fractured by the grimy panes of the workshop's single window, painted dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the Cornish sea roared a steady, rhythmic pulse, a stark contrast to the intricate, silent work happening within. Silas, his weathered hands calloused and stained with wood stain, squinted at the half-finished cradle resting on his workbench. He ran a thumb along the smooth, curved edge of the rocking base, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. It was for Martha Penrose, down by the harbour; her first child was due in the spring. A simple thing, this cradle, but Silas poured all his care and precision into it, the same way he did with every piece he created. Each dovetail joint, each carefully sanded surface, a testament to the patience and skill he'd honed over thirty years in this very workshop, the salty air his constant companion. Today, though, the usual solace eluded him. The cradle was nearly finished, yet a knot of anxiety tightened in his chest, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as the damp that plagued the old stone walls.
