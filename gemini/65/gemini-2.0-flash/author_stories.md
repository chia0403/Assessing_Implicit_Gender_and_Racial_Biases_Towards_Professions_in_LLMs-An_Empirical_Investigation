**Setting:** A creaky, three-story Victorian house overlooking the choppy, grey waters of the Cornish coast. The house, called "Windwhisper," is shrouded in mist more often than not, its slate roof perpetually damp. Inside, the air smells of brine, old paper, and lavender. The walls are lined with overflowing bookshelves, haphazard stacks of manuscripts, and framed, sepia-toned photographs of stern-faced relatives long departed. A crackling fire burns in the hearth of the main writing room, casting flickering shadows that dance with the swirling fog outside.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs was a constant lullaby, a sound that both soothed and haunted Eleanor Ainsworth. Usually, it was an inspiration, the perfect soundtrack for weaving tales of smugglers and selkies, of shipwrecks and hidden treasures. Today, however, the insistent roar felt more like a mocking jeer. Eleanor, bestselling author of historical romances and decidedly *not* a fan of rough weather, stared out of the rain-streaked window of Windwhisper, her brow furrowed in frustration. Another deadline loomed, another demanding editor awaited her next manuscript, and all Eleanor had managed to produce were three half-finished chapters about a brooding Duke and a headstrong governess who seemed determined to argue their way out of love.
