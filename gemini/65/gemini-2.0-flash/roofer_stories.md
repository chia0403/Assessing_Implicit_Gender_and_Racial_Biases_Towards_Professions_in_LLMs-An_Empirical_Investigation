The shingle dust swirled around Franklin Delano "Frank" O'Malley like a perpetual, miniature dust devil, clinging to the sweat on his brow and etching temporary maps in the lines of his hands. The late August sun beat down with the unapologetic ferocity of a rejected lover, turning the black asphalt shingles into molten, sticky traps for anything that dared to touch them. Frank hated August. Hated the heat, hated the sweat, and especially hated how the tar smell of the shingles seemed to permeate everything â€“ his clothes, his lunch, even his dreams.

He was perched atop the gabled roof of the old Victorian at 23 Willow Creek Lane, a picturesque street in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom, a postcard-perfect coastal town, was known for its quaint lobster shacks, its perpetually misty mornings, and its stubbornly old houses that clung to the cliffs like barnacles. This particular house, "Sea Song Cottage" as the hand-painted sign swinging precariously from the porch declared, was one of the oldest, a faded beauty clinging to the glory of a bygone era. Its gingerbread trim was peeling, the paint was cracked and blistered, and the roof, well, the roof was Frank's current purgatory.

He'd inherited O'Malley Roofing from his father, who had inherited it from *his* father, a long line of O'Malleys who had hammered, sweated, and cursed their way across the rooftops of Port Blossom for generations. Frank loved the town, loved the history woven into the very timbers of these houses, but sometimes, like now, staring down into the dizzying drop to Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning petunias, he wished he'd followed his dream of becoming a marine biologist. At least then, the only thing threatening to kill him would be a rogue wave or a particularly grumpy lobster.
