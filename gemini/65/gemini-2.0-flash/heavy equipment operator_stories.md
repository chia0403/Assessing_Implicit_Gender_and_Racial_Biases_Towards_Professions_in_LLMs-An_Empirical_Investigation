Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a heavy equipment operator:

**Opening and Setting:**

The dust devil danced across the cracked earth of the former Thompson farm, a swirling brown phantom that momentarily obscured the skeletal remains of the old barn.  The heat vibrated off the metal skin of the Caterpillar D10 bulldozer, creating a shimmering mirage that made the already desolate landscape seem even more alien.  Inside the cab, breathing through a bandana pulled up over his nose, **Franklin Ulysses Bartlett** leaned forward, squinting against the harsh glare.

This wasn't farming anymore.  This was controlled demolition, landscape surgery on a grand scale, and Franklin was the surgeon, wielding 70 tons of steel and diesel fury.  He was building the foundations for the 'Harmony Ridge' luxury housing development - a future filled with manicured lawns, infinity pools, and the echoing laughter of children who would never know the grit and hardship that had once soaked into this very soil.  He ran a calloused hand over the worn leather of his seat, a sigh escaping his lips. Another day, another piece of the past scraped clean.
