## Story Opening:

The turbulence hit just as Amelia Grace Davies was handing a screaming toddler a juice box. The orange liquid sloshed precariously in the cardboard container, threatening to become an airborne projectile. Amelia winced, bracing a hand against the overhead bin as the Boeing 777 dipped with a sudden, gut-wrenching lurch. "Just a little bump, folks!" she announced, her voice laced with practiced cheer, even as her stomach did a somersault that rivaled the plane's. "Please fasten your seatbelts!"

She managed to secure the juice box in the toddler's chubby hand, offering a reassuring smile to the frazzled mother, then hurried towards the galley. The clatter of metal and the panicked whispers of her fellow crew members filled the air. Amelia knew this wasn't just a little bump. This felt different.

## Setting:

The story opens aboard British Airways Flight BA249, a transatlantic flight from London Heathrow (LHR) to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City. They are approximately 3 hours into the flight, somewhere over the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. Outside, the sky is a monotonous, cloud-strewn grey, offering no visible horizon. Inside, the cabin is a microcosm of modern travel: a mix of weary business travelers slumped in their lie-flat seats, families juggling restless children, and wide-eyed tourists glued to their in-flight entertainment. The air is thick with the recycled air and the lingering scent of lukewarm coffee and microwaved meals. The plane, despite its age, boasts the signature British Airways navy and cream interior, a silent promise of comfort and safety that felt increasingly hollow with each violent jolt.
