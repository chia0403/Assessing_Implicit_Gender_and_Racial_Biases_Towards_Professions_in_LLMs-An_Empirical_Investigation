## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The air hung thick and humid in the sweltering mid-July heat of Charleston, South Carolina. Spanish moss dripped languidly from ancient oak trees lining Legare Street, casting dappled shadows that offered little respite. Wrought iron gates, intricate as lace, stood guard before meticulously manicured gardens that whispered of old money and stubborn tradition. The scent of salt air mingled with the heady fragrance of confederate jasmine and the richer, earthy aroma of freshly turned soil.

**Opening:**

Sweat beaded on Alistair Finch's brow, plastering strands of sandy hair to his forehead. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a muddy streak that did little to improve his appearance. Alistair, all elbows and knees at six foot two, looked more like a scarecrow than a seasoned landscaper as he wrestled with the recalcitrant roots of a struggling camellia bush. He muttered a curse under his breath that mingled with the rhythmic chirping of cicadas. This particular specimen, a prized 'Debutante' variety, was the centerpiece of Mrs. Henrietta Beauregard’s courtyard garden, a courtyard he was beginning to loathe with every fiber of his being.

"Honestly," he mumbled, tugging harder, "you'd think a flower named 'Debutante' would be a little less… difficult."

The bush remained stubbornly rooted, mocking him with its sparse, browning leaves. Mrs. Beauregard, with her beady eyes and razor-sharp pronouncements, was due to inspect his progress any minute. Alistair knew that if this damn camellia wasn't thriving, his career, his livelihood, and quite possibly his sanity, were hanging precariously in the balance, right alongside those drooping petals. He needed a miracle, and fast.
