## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of antiseptic stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's nostrils, a familiar comfort that belied the tension coiling in her gut. She scrubbed harder, the swirling motion mirroring the frantic thoughts circling in her head. Twenty minutes. That's all she had left to prepare before she had to face him. Twenty minutes to brace herself against the inevitable onslaught of questions, accusations, and the suffocating weight of expectations. Twenty minutes before she had to walk into OR 3 and save a man she deeply resented. The rhythmic hum of the ventilation system did little to soothe her nerves. The metal sink gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting a pale, drawn version of herself. Eleanor sighed, twisting the faucet shut. This wasnâ€™t about him, she reminded herself. This was about the oath she had taken, the dedication she had sworn. This was about saving a life. But God, it was going to be the hardest surgery of her career.

## Setting:

The story opens in the scrub room adjacent to Operating Room 3 at St. Jude's Mercy Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The hospital is a large, modern complex, renowned for its advanced trauma center and pioneering surgical techniques. The scrub room itself is spartan and functional. Stainless steel surfaces gleam under bright, clinical lighting. The walls are a pale, institutional green. A dispenser of surgical hand scrub hangs near the sink. A small, rectangular mirror reflects the sterile environment. Through a small window, Eleanor can see the OR itself being prepped: the glint of chrome instruments, the hushed movements of the surgical team, the intimidating figure of the surgical lamp hovering above the operating table. The air is thick with anticipation and the subtle, metallic tang of medical supplies. The overall impression is one of intense focus and controlled precision, a sharp contrast to the inner turmoil brewing within Eleanor.
