## Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Eleanor Vance's hands, but the heat barely penetrated the chill settling deep in her bones. Outside, a relentless October rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Ramsey County Courthouse. She stared out at the blurred cityscape, a melancholic symphony of greys punctuated by the angry red glare of brake lights. Another day, another deluge of despair and bad decisions trickling through her office.

Eleanor had been doing this – walking the tightrope between compassion and cynicism as a probation officer – for seven years now. Seven years of parole hearings, drug tests, halfway house visits, and the constant, gnawing feeling that she was either failing someone miserably or being expertly played. Today felt especially weighted. She had a meeting with a new parolee, a kid fresh out of Stillwater Prison, charged with armed robbery. His file painted a grim picture: broken home, history of petty theft, volatile temper.

Eleanor sighed, the steamy breath fogging the glass momentarily. She knew the stats. She knew the odds were stacked against him. But somewhere, buried beneath the layers of bureaucratic procedure and mandated supervision, a tiny flicker of hope always remained. It had to. Because if that flicker died, then what was the point of any of it?

## Setting:

The Ramsey County Courthouse, St. Paul, Minnesota. Specifically, Eleanor Vance's cramped, windowless office on the third floor. The walls are painted a depressing shade of beige, adorned with a motivational poster featuring a photo of a soaring eagle and the phrase "Reach for Your Dreams." A worn, overflowing bookcase houses thick legal tomes and dog-eared copies of psychology textbooks. Her desk is a chaotic landscape of open files, sticky notes bearing cryptic reminders, and a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels. The scent of cheap coffee and impending doom hangs perpetually in the air. The overall impression is one of bureaucratic neglect and the weary resignation of those who work within its confines.
