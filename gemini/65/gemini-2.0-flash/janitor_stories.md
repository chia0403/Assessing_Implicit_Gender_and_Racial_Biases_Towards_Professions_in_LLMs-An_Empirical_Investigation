## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The grand, echoing halls of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. It is 2:30 AM, hours after the final curtain call of *Tosca*, and the air hangs thick with the lingering scent of hairspray, velvet, and the ghosts of arias. Dust motes dance in the weak beams of the emergency lights, painting fleeting patterns across the ornate plasterwork and the plush, empty seats.

**Story Opening:**

Augustus Bellweather, a man who preferred the comforting predictability of routine to the flamboyant unpredictability of the stage, hummed a tuneless melody as he wrestled his heavy-duty vacuum cleaner up the final flight of stairs to the Grand Tier. The opera house, in its post-performance slumber, felt vast and lonely. Augustus, head janitor for the night shift, had been tasked with cleaning this section first. He’d rather start in the orchestra pit, where at least he could imagine the disembodied music still reverberating, but Mr. Henderson, the daytime supervisor, was a stickler for alphabetical order, and Augustus was, if nothing else, a creature of habit. He plugged in the vacuum, the sudden roar a rude awakening in the silent theater. As the machine sputtered to life, Augustus couldn’t help but wonder, as he did every night, if any of those famous sopranos, any of those divas with their earth-shattering voices, had ever noticed him, the man who kept their temple clean. He doubted it. To them, he was just another part of the scenery, like the dusty velvet ropes or the faded gold leaf. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck, a sense of being watched, made him pause, vacuum suspended mid-air. He switched it off, plunging the Grand Tier into near silence once more. And then he heard it, a faint, almost imperceptible sob, coming from the depths of Box 4.
