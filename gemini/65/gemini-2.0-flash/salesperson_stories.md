## Story Opening & Setting:

The stale coffee was a familiar comfort against the pre-dawn chill, the kind that seeped into your bones despite the industrial-strength heater sputtering feebly in the corner. Agatha Primrose Butterfield, Regional Sales Representative for Everbright Cleaning Solutions, stared out the grime-streaked window of the Rusty Mug Diner. Outside, the skeletal remains of the once-booming steel town of Ironridge, Pennsylvania, slumbered under a blanket of grey. The sky, mirroring the town, threatened rain.

Agatha chewed on the inside of her cheek, the taste of lukewarm coffee grounding her. Today was it. Today was the day she either salvaged her quarterly numbers or faced a very unpleasant conversation with Harold back at headquarters. Ironridge wasn't exactly teeming with opportunities these days. The steel mills had closed down years ago, leaving behind a legacy of rust, resentment, and a persistent, stubborn kind of dirt that clung to everything. But Agatha, armed with her Everbright sample kit and a smile that could melt glaciers (when she remembered to use it), was determined to find someone, *anyone*, who needed a superior all-purpose cleaner. Even in a town that seemed to have given up on hope, Agatha Primrose Butterfield wasn't about to give up on her commission. This morning, she was targeting the Ironridge Historical Society - a last ditch effort to convince them that Everbright could preserve the tarnished legacy of their town, one artifact at a time.
