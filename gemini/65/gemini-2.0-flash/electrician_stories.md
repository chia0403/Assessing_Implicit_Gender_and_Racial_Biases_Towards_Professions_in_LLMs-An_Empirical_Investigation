## Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the rooftop of the abandoned textile mill, a constant, insistent howl that tried to tear Finnian O'Malley from his perch. Below, the skeletal remains of the old factory loomed, a gothic silhouette against the bruised twilight sky. Finnian ignored the chill, his gloved fingers working deftly, stripping the copper wire from a salvaged generator panel. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eye, but he didn't pause. He needed this working, and he needed it working tonight.

## Setting:

The year is 2047. The once-bustling city of Atheria has been reduced to a sprawling ghost town after the collapse of the Global Energy Grid, an event known simply as "The Blackout." Society has fractured, with scattered settlements clinging to survival in the ruins of the old world. 

Finnian operates out of what remains of his family's electrical repair shop in the Lower District, a precarious zone of makeshift housing and scavenged resources. He's become something of a local legend, the only electrician brave (or foolhardy) enough to venture into the dangerous, derelict zones surrounding Atheria in search of the parts and materials needed to keep the community powered. The mill itself is on the outskirts, a long abandoned relic of a forgotten era, rumored to be infested with scavenging gangs and, according to some of the older residents, something far more sinister lurking in its depths.
