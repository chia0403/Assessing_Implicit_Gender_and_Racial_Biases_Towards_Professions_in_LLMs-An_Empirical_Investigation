The late afternoon sun, thick and syrupy with August heat, stained the dusty windows of "Coastal Calm," Olivia Grace Bellweather's tiny massage therapy studio. Located above Mrs. Petrov's legendary pierogi shop on Ocean Avenue, Coastal Calm was anything but calm. The constant rumble of delivery trucks, the clatter of Mrs. Petrov’s pots and pans downstairs, and the persistent squawk of the seagulls fighting over discarded fries created a cacophony that Olivia had, over the years, learned to filter out. Still, today, even the seagulls seemed particularly insistent, their cries mirroring the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.

Olivia Grace Bellweather, a woman whose hands usually possessed the power to unravel the tightest muscles, nervously wrung her own. Sweat trickled down her temples, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair to her forehead. The aromatherapy diffuser, usually emitting a soothing blend of lavender and eucalyptus, was emitting… nothing. She’d forgotten to refill it. Just one more thing to add to the growing list of things that felt slightly off-kilter.

She peered through the lace curtains at the street below. A group of teenagers, sporting sun-bleached hair and flip-flops, were skateboarding down the sidewalk, their laughter echoing up to her window. Seaside Heights, New Jersey, was a vibrant, sometimes chaotic, place, especially during the summer season. But it was home. And tomorrow, everything was about to change. Or, at least, that’s what Mrs. Petrov had warned her.
