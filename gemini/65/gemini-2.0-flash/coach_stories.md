## Story Opening:

The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy over the cracked asphalt of the McKinley High School parking lot, smelling faintly of exhaust fumes and burnt ambition. Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Rodriguez, her breath puffing out in white clouds, slammed the trunk of her battered Honda Civic shut. The echo reverberated around the mostly deserted lot, a lonely sound that mirrored the knot in her stomach. Today wasn't just the start of another grueling track and field season; it was the day she had to tell them.

## Setting:

McKinley High, a sprawling, red-brick monstrosity built in the 1950s, stood like a sentinel overlooking the faded glory of Milltown, Pennsylvania. Once a thriving hub for steel manufacturing, Milltown had slowly decayed over the last few decades, leaving behind a trail of boarded-up storefronts and broken promises. The high school, despite its age and some unfortunate asbestos scares, remained the heart of the community, a place where dreams, however small or improbable, still flickered.

Specifically, Ellie found herself in the school's parking lot, a vast expanse of grey marred by potholes and faded yellow lines. A single flickering fluorescent light cast a sickly glow over the chain-link fence that separated the lot from the overgrown football field. The crisp, early spring air promised warmer days, but right now, it only served to amplify the chill that settled deep in Ellie's bones. The track and field shed, a corrugated metal shack crammed with hurdles, javelins, and the ghosts of past victories, loomed in the distance, a beacon and a burden all in one.
