## Story Opening:

The biting wind howled through the skeletal framework of the abandoned radar tower, a mournful song that only Thomas Ashton, and perhaps the ghosts he was starting to believe in, could hear. Inside the cramped, windowless room at the base of the tower, Thomas huddled closer to the sputtering kerosene heater, its meager warmth doing little to penetrate the chill that had seeped into his bones. He blew on his numb fingers, then returned to the tangled mess of wires and vacuum tubes before him, his brow furrowed in concentration. He had to get the transmitter working. He *needed* to.

## Setting:

**Location:** The abandoned RADAR Station ECHO-7, perched on the windswept cliffs overlooking the North Sea, on the coast of Scotland. The station was decommissioned in the late 1960s and left to rot, its once-imposing radar dish a rusty, silent sentinel against the unforgiving sky.

**Time:** Late November, 1983. The days are short, the nights are long, and the weather is consistently brutal.

**Atmosphere:** Isolated, bleak, and permeated with a sense of forgotten purpose. The station is falling apart, paint peeling, rust eating away at the metal structures, and the interior cluttered with debris left behind decades ago. The air is thick with the smell of salt, decay, and the faint, metallic tang of old electronics.
