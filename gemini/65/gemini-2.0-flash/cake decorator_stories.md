## Story Opening:

The hum of the walk-in refrigerator was Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's only companion in the pre-dawn chill. Frost clung to her eyelashes as she pulled open the heavy door, the scent of butter and sugar rushing out to greet her like a familiar, comforting hug. Inside, row upon row of naked cakes, still faintly warm from the oven, stood waiting patiently for their transformation. Today was going to be a beast. Three weddings, a bar mitzvah, and a surprise birthday party, all clamoring for Agnes’s artistry. She sighed, a wisp of breath clouding in the cool air, and pulled out the largest of the wedding tiers – a six-layered lemon sponge, destined to be adorned with cascading sugar roses and spun-sugar vines.

## Setting:

**The Sugared Plum**, Agnes's quaint, slightly chaotic, and undeniably charming cake shop, nestled in the heart of the picturesque town of Willow Creek, Maine. The shop's exterior boasted a pastel pink facade, complete with window boxes overflowing with vibrant petunias in the summer and miniature evergreens dusted with fake snow in the winter. Inside, the air perpetually smelled of vanilla and warm spices. Tables, draped with mismatched floral tablecloths, held tantalizing samples of Agnes's creations: miniature chocolate lava cakes, delicate macarons, and towering cupcakes topped with swirling peaks of buttercream. In the back, separated from the display area by a beaded curtain that jingled with every movement, was Agnes's domain: a gleaming stainless steel kitchen, overflowing with piping bags, spatulas, edible glitter, and a dizzying array of food coloring. Every surface was dusted with a fine layer of powdered sugar, a testament to Agnes's dedicated and slightly messy craft.
