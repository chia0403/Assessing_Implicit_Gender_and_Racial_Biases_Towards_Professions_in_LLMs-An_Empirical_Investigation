**Opening:**

The klaxon shrieked, a banshee wail that ripped through the midday calm, sending a jolt of adrenaline straight into the veins of every firefighter in Station 12.  A collective groan, the scrape of chairs against linoleum, and the slam of locker doors echoed the begrudging acceptance of duty.  For Firefighter Alistair James Davies, the dread was a familiar dance partner. He’d learned to tango with it years ago, back when the smell of smoke still made him nauseous instead of numb.  He was halfway through a lukewarm cup of coffee and a crossword puzzle he’d been wrestling with for a week ("Six letters, biblical boat..." Ugh.) when the alarm cut through his concentration.  He slammed the mug down, the remaining liquid sloshing onto the already stained table, and instinctively reached for his turnout gear.  He knew, with the cold certainty that settled deep in his gut, that this one wouldn't be a simple cat-in-a-tree call.  This one felt different.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the gritty industrial district of North Point, a sprawling area of warehouses, factories, and dockyards that clung precariously to the edge of the city.  Station 12, a brick building seasoned by decades of soot and salt air, stood sentinel at the district's heart. The station itself was a testament to the blue-collar grit of the neighborhood.  The interior was utilitarian and well-worn:  a common room with mismatched furniture, a communal kitchen that perpetually smelled of burnt coffee and reheated leftovers, and a cramped bunk room where the firefighters stole precious hours of rest between calls.  Outside, the roar of traffic blended with the clang of metal from the nearby shipyards, a constant reminder of the relentless pace of the city.  Overhead, the sky was often a bruised purple, choked with the exhaust of industry. Even on a clear day, the air carried a faint tang of oil and something indefinably chemical, a scent Alistair knew intimately.  It was the smell of North Point, the smell of danger, and the smell of home.
