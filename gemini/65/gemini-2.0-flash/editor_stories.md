Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring an editor named Evelyn Eleanor Rosewood:

**Setting:**

The setting is a cluttered, yet charming, bookshop called "The Literary Nook" in the quaint, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The Nook is known for its towering shelves, the pervasive scent of aged paper and sea salt, and a resident ginger cat named Hemingway, who believes he owns the best sunbeam in the window. Outside, the salty air whips through the narrow streets, carrying the cries of gulls and the distant foghorn’s mournful wail. It is late October, and the town is preparing for its annual "Haunted Harbor" festival, a celebration of all things spooky.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Eleanor Rosewood, perched precariously on a wobbly stool amidst a teetering stack of Victorian gothic novels, adjusted her spectacles and sighed. The flickering fluorescent lights of The Literary Nook hummed a discordant tune, a fitting soundtrack to her current predicament. She had promised Mrs. Higgins, the bookshop's eccentric owner, she’d organize the "Spooky Reads" display before the Haunted Harbor festival kicked off. Instead, she’d unearthed a manuscript hidden between the pages of a first edition “Dracula.” It was bound in faded, blood-red leather, the title embossed in unsettlingly sharp letters: *The Lighthouse Keeper's Lament.* Against her better judgement, Evelyn had cracked it open, and now found herself completely absorbed. Even a seasoned editor like herself couldn't deny the raw, unnerving power emanating from the yellowed pages. It was unsettling, compelling, and possibly cursed. Just then, Hemingway, the shop cat, leapt onto the precarious book pile, sending a cascade of paperbacks tumbling to the floor. Evelyn yelped, clutching the red manuscript to her chest. "Hemingway, you furry fiend," she muttered, "You always know when I'm onto something."
