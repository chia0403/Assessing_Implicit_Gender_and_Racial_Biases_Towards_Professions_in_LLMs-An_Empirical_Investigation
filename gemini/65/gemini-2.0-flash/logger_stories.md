Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a logger protagonist:

**Setting:**

The year is 1932. The place is a rugged, remote logging camp nestled deep in the heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State. Towering Douglas firs and Western hemlocks blot out much of the sky, casting the camp in a perpetual twilight. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and woodsmoke. The camp itself is a collection of rough-hewn cabins, a mess hall smelling perpetually of coffee and stew, a blacksmith shop ringing with the clang of hammer on steel, and a network of muddy trails leading into the seemingly endless forest. The constant background noise is the whine of crosscut saws, the thud of falling trees, and the distant roar of the Skookumchuck River, which carries the felled timber downstream. Life here is hard, unforgiving, and deeply connected to the rhythms of the natural world.

**Opening:**

Jedediah "Jed" Bartholomew spat a stream of tobacco juice onto the muddy ground, the brown stain darkening the already sodden earth. The damp chill of a late autumn morning clung to his bones, seeping through the layers of his wool shirt and oilskin jacket.  He ran a calloused hand over the stubble on his chin, the rasp rough against his skin.  Above him, the skeletal branches of a half-felled Douglas fir clawed at the grey sky, a stark reminder of the brutal work that lay ahead.  Today was the day.  He could feel it in his gut, the same nervous flutter he always got before felling a particularly massive tree.  This one, they called "The Widowmaker," a giant whose top had been snapped off in a previous storm, leaving it dangerously unbalanced.  Jedediah had spent the better part of the last week sharpening his axe and studying the tree, calculating the angles, anticipating the fall.  If he made one wrong move, Widowmaker wouldn't just claim timber; she'd claim a life. And Jedediah Bartholomew had no intention of letting that be his.
