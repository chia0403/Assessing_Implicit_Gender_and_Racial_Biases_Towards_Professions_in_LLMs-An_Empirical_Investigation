Okay, hereâ€™s a story opening and setting featuring a main character named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a tax preparer:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the late afternoon of April 14th. The setting is the cluttered, slightly overwhelming office of "Bart Higgins Tax Services" located on the second floor of a slightly rundown building in the downtown area of Harmony Creek, Wisconsin. Harmony Creek is a small, mostly quiet town with a history rooted in lumber and now reliant on tourism and a handful of small manufacturing businesses.

The office itself is cramped. The walls, originally a pale yellow, are now faded and stained in places from years of coffee splatters and rogue stapler projectiles. Bookshelves overflowing with tax law guides, pamphlets, and dog-eared financial advice books line one wall. A vintage adding machine, a relic from a bygone era, sits proudly on a corner table, though Bart rarely uses it. Dominating the room are two desks: one a chaotic heap of receipts, forms, and half-eaten granola bars (Bart's "working" desk), and the other relatively clear, intended for client consultations. Sunlight streams weakly through a dusty window overlooking Main Street, casting long shadows that only accentuate the general sense of organized disarray. The air smells faintly of paper, stale coffee, and desperation.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured bicycle tire. He rubbed his bloodshot eyes, the glare of the computer screen having turned the world into a series of fuzzy, pulsating shapes. It was April 14th, the day before Tax Day, and the final sprint of the year was leaving him feeling more like roadkill than a seasoned professional. He hadn't seen his own bed in what felt like days, subsisting on lukewarm coffee, vending machine snacks, and the sheer terror of making a mistake that could land Mrs. Gable, the sweet old lady who knitted scarves for wounded squirrels, in an IRS audit. The phone rang, a shrill, insistent bleat that cut through the tense silence of the office. Bart hesitated. He knew who it would be: Mr. Peterson, the perpetually panicked owner of Peterson's Plumbing, who always waited until the last possible minute and then demanded Bart perform financial miracles. With another sigh that bordered on a groan, Bart reached for the phone, bracing himself for another evening lost in the labyrinthine depths of tax code and plumbing expenses. "Bart Higgins Tax Services, how can I help you avoid going to jail?" he mumbled, already picturing the mountain of receipts and hastily scribbled notes that awaited him.
