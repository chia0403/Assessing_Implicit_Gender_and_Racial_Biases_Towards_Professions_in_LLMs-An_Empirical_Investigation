Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a graphic designer as the main character:

**Opening:**

The insistent chirp of the morning’s first email clawed Penelope Astraea Bloom out of a dream involving rogue Pantone swatches and a disapproving Helvetica font. Groaning, she smacked the snooze button, a hollow victory because she already knew what awaited: a barrage of increasingly frantic emails from Brenda at “Organic Oasis” demanding, no, *pleading* for, a tenth iteration of their new kombucha label. Brenda’s notes were always a glorious, maddening paradox: “More earthy, but also vibrant! And can you make the bubbles more… alive?” Penelope was starting to suspect Brenda had achieved enlightenment through fermented tea and was now speaking in koans that only kombucha could truly understand.

**Setting:**

Penelope’s apartment was a riot of controlled chaos, a visual testament to her profession. Located on the top floor of a converted textile mill in the trendy (and rapidly gentrifying) Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia, the loft space boasted exposed brick walls, soaring ceilings, and enormous windows that flooded the room with natural light – light Penelope often blocked with thick blackout curtains to better view her meticulously calibrated monitors. One wall was dedicated to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase overflowing with design books, art catalogues, and vintage typography specimens. Another wall was a pinboard covered in sketches, inspiration clippings, and various color palettes, a chaotic tapestry representing the tangled web of her creative process.  A sleek, modern desk, meticulously organized with Wacom tablets, drawing tools, and several half-empty mugs of Earl Grey tea, sat center stage, facing the windows. The overall impression was one of organized creativity battling a slow, creeping entropy, much like Penelope herself.
