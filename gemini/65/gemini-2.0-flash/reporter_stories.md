## Story Opening:

The clatter of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the Starlight Diner was nearly enough to drown out the murmur of late-night truckers and bleary-eyed waitresses.  Nearly.  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her fingers stained with newsprint and the remnants of cheap cherry pie, leaned closer to her informant, a man who smelled distinctly of diesel and desperation.

"You're telling me...he just vanished?" Ellie scribbled furiously in her notepad, the flimsy pages threatening to disintegrate under the damp assault.  

The informant, a burly fellow with a greasy ponytail and a nervous twitch in his left eye, swallowed hard. "Clean gone, Ellie. Like he evaporated. One minute he's fixing a flat on the access road, the next...poof.  Just the truck sittin' there, engine still warm, like he was raptured or somethin'."

Ellie glanced out the rain-streaked window, the neon glow of the Starlight painting the downpour in hues of lurid pink and electric blue. "And the police are calling it...?"

He snorted, a sound that suggested deep distrust. "A runaway. Says he probably had gambling debts. Bullshit. Tommy wouldn't leave his truck.  That thing was his baby."

Ellie tapped her pen against the notepad, her mind already piecing together the fragments of the story.  Gambling debts.  A missing truck driver.  And the deafening silence of the authorities.  This could be bigger than just a runaway. This could be her ticket out of Harmony Creek.

## Setting:

**Harmony Creek, Ohio.** A town clinging desperately to the fringes of the Appalachian foothills, Harmony Creek was once a thriving coal mining community. Now, the mines were mostly played out, leaving behind a landscape scarred with abandoned shafts and a population grappling with unemployment and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The Starlight Diner, a greasy spoon establishment that had seen better days, was the town's unofficial meeting place, where secrets whispered over lukewarm coffee and the promise of something, anything, better, hung heavy in the air.  The diner sat just off Highway 33, the main artery that connected Harmony Creek to the rest of the world, a road that for many, only led one way - out. The year is 2008, the cusp of the economic downturn, and the anxieties of a nation are simmering beneath the surface of small-town life.
