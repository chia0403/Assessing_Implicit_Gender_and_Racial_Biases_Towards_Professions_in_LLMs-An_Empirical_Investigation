**Setting:** The oppressive humidity of a Georgia summer hung thick in the air, even inside the cheerfully decorated walls of "Smiles by the Sea," a dental practice nestled in the quaint coastal town of Port Royale. Seabirds squawked mournfully outside, their cries a constant soundtrack to the rhythmic whirring of the high-speed handpiece.

**Opening:**

Coraline Beatrice Bellweather wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the latex glove sticking uncomfortably to her clammy skin. Mrs. Henderson, a notoriously chatty woman with a penchant for seashell-themed sweaters, was mid-sentence about the dramatic theft of her prize-winning conch when Coraline noticed it: a small, greyish patch on the gum line next to Mrs. Henderson’s lower left molar. It looked…wrong. Really wrong. Coraline had seen a lot of things in her years as a dental hygienist, from the horrific aftermath of neglected cavities to the surprising tenacity of popcorn kernels wedged in the most improbable places. But this…this gave her a shiver that had nothing to do with the overly enthusiastic air conditioning. Mrs. Henderson, oblivious, continued her seashell saga, punctuated by the gentle slurping noises of the saliva ejector. Coraline took a deep breath, forcing a professional smile. “Mrs. Henderson,” she said, her voice betraying just a flicker of unease. “That’s fascinating. But, I'm noticing something I’d like Dr. Albright to take a look at.” The squawking seabirds outside seemed to grow louder, as if echoing the unsettling feeling that was rapidly blooming in Coraline’s chest. This was going to be more than just a routine cleaning.
