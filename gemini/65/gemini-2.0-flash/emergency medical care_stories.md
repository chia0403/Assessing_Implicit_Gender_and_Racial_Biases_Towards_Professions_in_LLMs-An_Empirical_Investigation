Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is an emergency medical care provider:

**Setting:** A bustling city street in the heart of Chicago, near Millennium Park. It's a crisp autumn afternoon, the air thick with the scent of roasted nuts and exhaust fumes. Tourists mill about, snapping photos of "The Bean" and the vibrant fall foliage lining Michigan Avenue. A cacophony of car horns, bus brakes, and street performers vying for attention fills the air.

**Story Opening:**

The first scream was swallowed by the urban roar, just another blip in the city's constant hum. But then came another, sharper, laced with unmistakable terror.  Dr. Alistair "Al" Finch, MD, EMT-P, hadn't even finished his first bite of the lukewarm Chicago-style hot dog heâ€™d grabbed from a street vendor. He'd been trying to enjoy a brief lunch break, leaning against the side of his Medic One ambulance, parked strategically near the park's entrance. Now, the half-eaten dog fell to the pavement, a casualty of his instincts.

Alistair's hand reflexively reached for his radio. "Medic One to Dispatch, possible incident, Millennium Park vicinity. Requesting confirmation." His voice was calm, a practiced mask he wore over the adrenaline surging through him. He scanned the crowd, already moving toward the source of the disturbance, his eyes trained to cut through the chaos and identify the point of origin. The second scream had been followed by a rising murmur, a wave of worried voices washing over the festive sounds of the afternoon. Whatever was happening, it was escalating fast. Alistair knew he had maybe seconds to make a difference.
