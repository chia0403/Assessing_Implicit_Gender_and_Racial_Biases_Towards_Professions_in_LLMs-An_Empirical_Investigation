The biting November wind whipped Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a shade of crimson she usually only saw after a marathon. She pulled her wool scarf higher, tightening the knot under her chin. It did little to combat the chill that seemed to seep into her very bones, a chill amplified by the scene before her: a gutted storefront, Christmas lights still strung across the window frame, flashing cheerfully in stark contrast to the yellow police tape crisscrossing the entrance.

The setting was the heart of Little Italy, a vibrant tapestry of family-owned restaurants and shops that clung to old-world traditions with fierce pride. Mulberry Street, usually bustling with tourists and the aroma of garlic and espresso, was unnaturally quiet. The only sound, besides the mournful groan of the wind, was the distant wail of a siren, a sound Izzy had come to associate with too many nights just like this one. The sign above the ransacked storefront, once brightly lit, now hung askew, the flickering neon revealing the name: “Salvatore’s Trattoria – Est. 1952.”
