The stale smell of rain-soaked newspaper and cheap whisky clung to the air in August Craineâ€™s office like a persistent hangover. He hated Mondays, especially Mondays that felt like they'd already lasted a lifetime. Sunlight, or what passed for it in this perpetually overcast corner of San Francisco's Tenderloin district, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Across the street, the neon sign for the "Happy Hour Haven" flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the scarred mahogany desk where August sat nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. The only other adornment in the cramped room, besides the obligatory fedora hanging on a coat rack that looked ready to collapse, was a framed black and white photograph of his late partner, Leo, grinning mischievously. Leo had always said the only thing thinner than August's patience was the threadbare carpet. He missed Leo's jokes, and, frankly, just about everything else about the man.

This was August Craine's world. A world of shadows and secrets, of desperate whispers and broken promises. A world he understood, even if he didn't always like it. And it was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
