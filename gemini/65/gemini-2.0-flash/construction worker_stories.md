The air hung thick and humid, a pre-dawn soup laced with the scent of diesel and damp earth. Giovanni “Gio” Rossi, a man built like a brick outhouse with hands like shovels, squinted against the faint pre-sunrise glow bleeding over the Jersey City skyline. His breath puffed out in small white clouds as he unhooked the chain securing his trusty, if somewhat battered, GMC Sierra to the chain-link fence surrounding the construction site.

This wasn’t just any construction site. This was the Liberty Pointe Tower, a shimmering glass needle that promised to scrape the very underbelly of the heavens. Gio had been on the crew since they broke ground, a year and a half ago. He’d helped pour the foundations that burrowed deep into the bedrock, wrestled rebar that felt like angry snakes, and navigated the precarious dance of cranes and steel beams that now defined the emerging cityscape.

He’d seen sunrises paint the Hudson River in shades of fire and molten gold from this very spot countless times. But this morning felt different. A low, humming thrum, barely perceptible, vibrated through the metal of his truck. He glanced at the towering structure, its unfinished upper floors reaching for the sky like skeletal fingers. Something was off, a subtle discordance in the symphony of urban noise that usually greeted him. He just couldn't quite put his finger on it.
