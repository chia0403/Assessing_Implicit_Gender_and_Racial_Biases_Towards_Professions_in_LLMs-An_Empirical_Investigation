**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic *cling-cling* of the elevator bell was a constant, almost comforting, counterpoint to the swirling chaos of the Grand Imperial Hotel lobby. For Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, it was the soundtrack of his existence. He knew that sound, and the accompanying subtle vibration in the polished marble floor, like he knew the lines on his own worn leather gloves. Today, however, the routine was off. The air crackled with a barely suppressed energy, thicker than usual. Tourists in garish Hawaiian shirts jostled with impeccably tailored diplomats, their faces tense. Bart noticed a flicker of something – fear? – in the usually bored eyes of Mrs. Abernathy, the hotel's concierge, a woman who'd seen everything from spilled champagne at celebrity weddings to a live monkey escaping from a visiting sheikh's entourage. Something was definitely brewing at the Grand Imperial, and Bartholomew Finch, bellhop extraordinaire, had a feeling it was about to spill all over him.

**Setting:**

The Grand Imperial Hotel stands as a beacon of old-world elegance in the heart of the bustling city of Aethelburg. Built in the roaring twenties, it's a monument to Art Deco grandeur. The lobby is a cavernous space, dominated by soaring ceilings adorned with intricate plasterwork and shimmering chandeliers. Polished marble floors reflect the light, creating a dazzling effect. Rich mahogany paneling lines the walls, punctuated by ornate gilded mirrors. The air is thick with the scent of expensive perfume, old money, and the faintest hint of something indefinably illicit. A long, curving reception desk runs along one side, staffed by impeccably dressed individuals with practiced smiles. Beyond, plush velvet seating areas offer respite from the city's relentless energy. Despite its age, the Grand Imperial isn't simply a museum piece; it's a living, breathing organism, constantly humming with the activity of its diverse clientele - from foreign dignitaries to movie stars, and the occasional shady character slipping through the back entrance. The hotel is a microcosm of the world, a place where secrets are whispered, deals are struck, and fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye.
