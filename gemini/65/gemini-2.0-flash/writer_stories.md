## Opening:

Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic percussion that mirrored the frantic tapping of Elara Beatrice Finch's fingers on the chipped, mahogany desk. She hated writing in storms. The claustrophobia of the low-ceilinged attic combined with the relentless drumming on the glass always made her feel like she was trapped inside a tin can being shaken by a giant. Tonight, though, she had no choice. The deadline for "Crimson Hollow," her third (and, God willing, *last*) installment in the wildly popular "Whispers of the Willowwood" fantasy series, loomed like a particularly grumpy troll.

## Setting:

Elara's attic sanctuary was in the rambling, three-story Victorian she’d inherited from her eccentric aunt Agatha. Nestled in the quaint, yet perpetually drizzly, town of Bramblebrook, nestled on the edge of the real-life Willowwood Forest, the house was affectionately known by the locals as "The Madwoman's Manor." While Agatha hadn’t been mad, exactly, she *had* been a prolific collector of oddities: taxidermied birds with unsettlingly bright eyes, antique clocks that chimed on their own peculiar schedule, and shelves upon shelves of dusty, leather-bound books filled with cryptic scribblings and unsettling illustrations.

The attic itself was a testament to Agatha's chaotic spirit. Cobwebs draped like shimmering curtains over forgotten trinkets. Stacks of yellowed newspapers threatened to topple over, and a mannequin, draped in a tattered wedding dress, stood sentinel in the corner, its blank stare unnerving. A single, bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light over the room, illuminating Elara’s small workspace - the aforementioned mahogany desk, cluttered with manuscripts, half-empty teacups, and a perpetually overflowing ashtray. The only splashes of color came from a well-worn map of Willowwood, pinned haphazardly to the wall, and a photograph of Elara and Agatha, taken years ago, both beaming at the camera, oblivious to the writing deadlines and the restless ghosts that seemed to linger in the shadows of Bramblebrook.
