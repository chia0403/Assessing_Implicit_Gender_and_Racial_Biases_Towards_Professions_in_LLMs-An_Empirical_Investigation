## Story Opening:

The chipped paint on the wrought iron balcony felt rough under Elara Beatrice Ainsworth's fingertips, a stark contrast to the silk samples tucked into her battered leather tote. She squinted, shielding her eyes from the fierce Savannah sun as it glinted off the Spanish moss draped like ghostly shawls from the live oak trees. A low hum, the soundtrack of summer in the South, vibrated in the air - cicadas serenading the decay and rebirth that permeated everything here. Inside, she could hear Mrs. Delacroix clearing her throat, a delicate, brittle sound that spoke of decades spent within these very walls. Elara took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of jasmine and old money, and plastered on her most charming smile. Time to work her magic.

## Setting:

The Delacroix Mansion, located in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia, was a monument to fading grandeur. Built in the late 1800s, the three-story Victorian house boasted intricate gingerbread trim, a sprawling veranda, and a decaying elegance that both captivated and intimidated. Inside, the rooms were cavernous and shadowed, filled with antique furniture cloaked in dust covers and portraits of stern-faced ancestors. The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax polish and a lingering, almost palpable sense of secrets. Outside, the grounds were overgrown and untamed, a wild contrast to the manicured lawns that dotted the more affluent sections of the city. The mansion stood as a relic of a bygone era, a silent testament to the changing tides of fortune and the stubborn refusal of its occupants to let go of the past.
