**Story Opening and Setting:**

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. October had claimed the city of Ashwood, Massachusetts, painting its brick row houses and cobblestone streets in shades of rust and amber. A persistent drizzle, more mist than rain, clung to everything, turning the world into a watercolor painting bled by melancholy.

Inside, Julian Reed, architect, stood hunched over a blueprints spread across his drawing table. A single desk lamp cast a pool of warm light, highlighting the meticulous lines of his drafting pen and the furrowed brow above his wire-rimmed glasses. The room itself was a study in controlled chaos. Books on architectural history jostled for space with meticulously crafted models of his designs. Samples of brick, slate, and reclaimed wood were propped against the walls like forgotten art.
