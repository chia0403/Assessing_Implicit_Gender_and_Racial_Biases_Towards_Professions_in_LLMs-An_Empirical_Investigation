Henrietta surveyed her shop, a sanctuary of swirling, barber-shop blues and candy-striped accents tucked away on a quiet corner of Savannah's Victorian district. Sheâ€™d poured her heart, and every last penny, into this place. The vintage barber chair, lovingly restored, stood gleaming under the soft glow of a Tiffany-style lamp. The scent of lavender shampoo mingled with the faint, lingering aroma of her grandmother's rosewater hair tonic.

But the stack of unpaid bills on her antique desk told a different story, a story of slow days and tighter margins. Today, though, she was determined to turn the page. Today, Henrietta Bellwether would not only cut hair, she would cut her own path to success, one perfectly executed bob at a time.
