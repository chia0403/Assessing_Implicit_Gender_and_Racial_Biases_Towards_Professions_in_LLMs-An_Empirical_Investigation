## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:**

The pre-dawn chill clung to the cobbled streets of Rouen like a stubborn fog. The air, thick with the promise of rain and the lingering scent of the Seine, hung heavy over the Rue du Gros-Horloge. The magnificent clock, its single gilded hand poised to strike five, was the only splash of gold in the otherwise grey tableau. Across the narrow street, nestled between a perfumery promising exotic oils from Araby and a milliner still shuttered tight, stood "Boucherie Dubois et Fils" â€“ the butcher shop of choice for discerning Rouennais.

**Opening:**

Jean-Luc Dubois cursed under his breath as he fumbled with the iron keys, his breath puffing out in white clouds. The lock, stubborn as a Corsican donkey, refused to yield. He jammed the key in again, twisting with unnecessary force. Finally, with a groan that echoed through the silent street, the lock clicked open. He pushed open the heavy oak door, the familiar scent of sawdust, blood, and aging meat washing over him like a comforting wave, even on a morning as bleak as this. Jean-Luc, his hands already chapped and red from the cold, stepped inside his domain, the Boucherie Dubois, ready to face another day of slicing, chopping, and satisfying the carnivorous appetites of Rouen. The dim light filtering in from the street barely illuminated the rows of gleaming hooks hanging empty, awaiting their meaty bounty. He shivered, not just from the cold, but with a certain anticipation. Today was market day, and Jean-Luc intended to have the finest selection of cuts on the entire Rue du Gros-Horloge.
