The aroma of aged paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar scent that almost, but not quite, masked the faint whiff of mildew rising from the basement stacks. Prudence Abigail Abernathy, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, adjusted the flickering gas lamp above her desk. Dust motes danced in the weak light, mirroring the nervous flutter in her stomach.

An anomaly so glaring, so improbable, it threatened to unravel everything she thought she knew about the foundations of her beloved city. The date on the page stared back at her: June 14th, 1803. And next to it, a single entry, stark and unsettling: "Payment to: The Alchemist's Guild. For Services Rendered."
