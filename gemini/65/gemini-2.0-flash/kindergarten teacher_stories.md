The scent of Elmer's glue and stale Cheerios hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Miss Penelope Primrose, kindergarten teacher extraordinaire. Her classroom, the brightly colored "Butterfly Bungalow" at Sunny Meadows Elementary, was a chaotic explosion of construction paper, glitter, and half-finished art projects. A lopsided mobile of construction paper butterflies, each bearing the sticky fingerprint of a five-year-old, spun gently above a circle of tiny, paint-splattered chairs. This was Penelope's domain, her haven, the epicenter of glitter-induced happiness and occasional, earth-shattering meltdowns. It was a Tuesday morning, which, in kindergarten-teacher-speak, meant "prepare for anything." The sun streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, and Penelope, armed with a half-eaten granola bar and an optimistic smile, braced herself for the day.
