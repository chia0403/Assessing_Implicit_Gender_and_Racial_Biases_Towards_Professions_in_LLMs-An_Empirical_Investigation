The scent of a thousand promises hung heavy in the air of "Petals & Prose," a small, unassuming florist shop nestled on a quiet, cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town. Dust motes danced in the single ray of afternoon sun that pierced through the antique lace curtains adorning the window, illuminating a riot of color â€“ scarlet roses jostling with vibrant sunflowers, delicate lilies whispering secrets to plump peonies.

She hummed softly, a tuneless melody that blended with the gentle murmur of the city filtering through the thick stone walls. Today, however, the symphony felt dissonant. The irises, usually so calming, seemed to prickle with a nervous energy that mirrored her own.
