## Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, mirroring the low-grade anxiety buzzing in Mr. Alistair Humphrey’s chest. Another Monday, another mountain of student anxieties to scale. He took a long sip of his lukewarm coffee, the taste doing little to dispel the lingering echo of Mrs. Henderson’s frantic voice from the voicemail he’d just finished listening to. Apparently, young Timmy was threatening to glue his desk to the ceiling in protest against the upcoming history exam. Alistair sighed. Just another day in paradise. He glanced at the overflowing inbox on his computer screen, its blinking notification a silent scream for attention. He knew he should start drafting some encouraging emails, maybe even schedule a few emergency "chat" sessions, but the sheer volume of it all felt…suffocating. He pushed back from his desk, the ancient wheels of his chair squeaking in protest. He needed air.

## Setting:

Mr. Alistair Humphrey's office at Northwood High School was a study in controlled chaos. On the surface, it appeared organized. Diplomas and inspirational posters adorned the pale blue walls. A well-worn armchair sat invitingly in the corner, draped with a crocheted afghan he’d secretly commissioned from his Aunt Mildred. However, a closer inspection revealed the truth. Stacks of college brochures threatened to topple from the overflowing shelves. Post-it notes, scribbled with cryptic reminders and appointment times, clung to every available surface. His desk, a relic from the school's founding in the 1950s, bore the battle scars of years of student doodles and nervous fidgeting. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, lingering aroma of teenage angst. The window offered a view of the perpetually overcast parking lot, a depressing reminder of the bleak Northwest weather that often mirrored the emotional climate inside the school. The ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner was the only sound that managed to cut through the relentless hum of the building and the persistent murmur of teenage drama just beyond the closed door.
