## Opening:

The damp stone pressed against Alistair Thorne's back, a familiar discomfort that he barely registered after ten years of standing sentinel in the Citadel. He adjusted his worn leather jerkin, the movement barely disturbing the hushed quiet of the West Gate. A cold, salt-laced wind howled from the churning ocean below, carrying the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls. He pulled the brim of his helmet lower, shielding his eyes from the relentless spray. He'd seen worse storms, far worse, but tonight felt different. Tonight, the wind seemed to whisper secrets he couldn't quite decipher, secrets that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck and tasted like impending doom.

## Setting:

The Citadel of Veridian stood perched on the jagged cliffs of the Iron Coast, a formidable fortress carved from the same dark grey stone as the land itself. Centuries old, it had weathered countless storms and repelled countless invaders. Its towering walls, etched with intricate carvings depicting legendary battles, were a testament to the resilience of the people of Aethelgard. The West Gate, where Alistair stood guard, was a narrow passage carved into the cliff face, the only landward approach to the Citadel. Beyond the gate lay a treacherous path, barely wide enough for a single horse, that wound its way up from the tempestuous shores below. The air was thick with the scent of salt, damp stone, and the faint, lingering aroma of woodsmoke from the braziers that burned eternally on the battlements above. The sky, usually a vibrant blue, was tonight a swirling canvas of bruised purples and angry greys, mirroring the tumultuous sea below.
