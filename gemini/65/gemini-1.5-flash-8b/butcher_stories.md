The chill of the early morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, a familiar companion to the butcher who called the "Crimson Cleaver" his shop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows of the narrow alleyway, illuminating a mosaic of chipped paint and overflowing flowerpots, a testament to the city's haphazard charm.  Barty, his face already etched with the lines of a life spent around meat and steel, pulled on his heavy apron, the coarse linen scratching against his skin.  The scent of roasted coffee, mingled with the pungent aroma of blood and spices, hung thick in the air, a daily symphony only a butcher could fully appreciate.  The Crimson Cleaver, a small but sturdy establishment nestled between a pawnbroker's stall and a bakery, was his sanctuary, his kingdom, and his life.
