The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Sterling's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the narrow, cobblestone street.  Leafy branches, skeletal and grey against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the chipped paint of the Victorian houses lining the street.  This was the heart of Blackwood, a neighborhood known less for its modern amenities and more for its history – a history whispered in the creaking eaves and the rustling, ancient trees that seemed to watch over everything from their lofty perches.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a penchant for the quirky and a nose for a hidden gem, adored Blackwood.  But tonight, the neighborhood felt particularly… unsettled.

The air, usually thick with the scent of woodsmoke from the nearby cottages, carried a different, more unsettling aroma – something metallic, almost acrid.  And the silence, usually punctuated by the distant barking of a dog or the rhythmic clatter of a passing trolley, was unnervingly profound.  This particular listing, a decaying but undeniably charming three-story home perched at the very edge of the Blackwood woods, felt heavier than ever.  Amy pushed the heavy oak door open and stepped inside, the chill air immediately tightening around her.  The house, once a bustling hub of life, now echoed with the silence of forgotten memories.
