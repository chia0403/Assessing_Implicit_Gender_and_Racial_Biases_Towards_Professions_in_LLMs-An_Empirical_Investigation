The biting wind, a relentless, icy serpent, whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks and rattling the loose gravel in the bed of his battered pickup.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and gray, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the lone figure hunched over his work.  Sunrise, a pale, bruised fingertip against the horizon, offered little solace.  This was the eastern edge of the Badlands, a region where the earth seemed to writhe in protest at any attempt to tame it, and Elias, a highway maintenance worker, was the unwelcome intruder.

His name, etched into the weathered metal of his work boots, was a testament to the harsh beauty of the land.  Elias Thorne.  Not a name that whispered tales of romance or adventure, but one that spoke of endless stretches of asphalt, fractured concrete, and the tireless struggle to keep the arteries of the nation, this particular artery, functioning.  He was, in essence, the guardian of this desolate landscape, a man who navigated a realm where the only sounds were the groaning of the wind and the rhythmic thud of his jackhammer against rock. The year was 1956.
