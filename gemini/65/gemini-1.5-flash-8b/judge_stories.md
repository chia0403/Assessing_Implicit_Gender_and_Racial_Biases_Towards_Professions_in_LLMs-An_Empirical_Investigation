The biting wind whipped through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the Blackwood Court, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and something else, something vaguely metallic, something unsettling.  Justice Bartholomew "Barty"  Grimstone, a man whose face, etched with the lines of countless trials and sleepless nights, was as weathered as the ancient courthouse itself, shivered.  The courtroom, or what remained of it, was a cavernous space, lit only by the flickering flames of a hearth in the far corner.  Dust motes danced in the meager light, settling on the worn wooden benches where a handful of hushed figures huddled against the chill.  A single, flickering candle on a rickety table illuminated the ornate, yet stained, gavel resting within Barty's outstretched hand.  He traced the carvings with a finger, the feeling of the rough, cold wood a stark contrast to the weight of the world resting on his shoulders.

Outside, the jagged peaks of the Black Mountains loomed, their silhouettes shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  The valley below, choked with gnarled trees and whispering streams, felt both a prisoner and a custodian of the secrets whispered in these stone walls.  The court, once a place of hushed reverence, now felt like a tomb, and Barty knew this particular case, this one clinging to the edge of the precipice of ancient mysteries and whispered rumours, would be a trial not just of the accused, but of the very heart of Blackwood itself.
