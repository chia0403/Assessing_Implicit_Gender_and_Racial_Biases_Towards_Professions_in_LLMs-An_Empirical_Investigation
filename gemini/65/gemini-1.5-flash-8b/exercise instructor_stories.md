The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym buzzed, a relentless hum that vibrated through Amelia Hawthorne's worn-out sneakers.  Sweat, clinging to her tank top, stung her eyes as she demonstrated a variation of the Romanian deadlift.  Her voice, usually a confident, encouraging baritone, cracked slightly.  Today, the energy felt drained, not just from the grueling workout she was leading, but from a growing, persistent feeling of unease.  The rhythmic thud of weights echoed around the cavernous space, a stark contrast to the quiet turmoil within her.

The gym, situated in the heart of a bustling, yet somehow faded, industrial district of the city, was a testament to Amelia's meticulous design sense.  Steel beams, exposed brick, and minimalist furniture created a gritty, yet stylish atmosphere.  Rows of gleaming, high-tech treadmills and weight machines stood like silent sentinels, reflecting the harsh overhead lights.  Outside, the city's relentless symphony of honking cars and sirens blended into the backdrop, providing a constant reminder of the world beyond the walls of Ironclad. A small, dusty window above the reception desk offered a fleeting view of a crumbling factory building next door; its broken windows like vacant eyes peering into the fitness center.  A sense of encroaching stillness hung in the air, a feeling Amelia couldn't quite place, but one that amplified her inner anxieties.
