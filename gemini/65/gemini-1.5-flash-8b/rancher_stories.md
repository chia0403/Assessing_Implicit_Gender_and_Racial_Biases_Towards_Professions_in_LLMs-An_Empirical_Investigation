The sun, a molten disc in the bruised sky, beat down on the sparse scrub, turning the already-dry earth to a shimmering mirage.  Elias, a man hardened by years under the unforgiving New Mexico sun, squinted.  The cattle, his livelihood, his family’s legacy, were huddled closer to the few remaining water holes, their ribs showing beneath the thin layers of hide.  This was the heart of the drought, and it was consuming everything in its path, including Elias's hope.  He traced the weathered lines of the worn leather on his chaps, the familiar texture a comforting anchor in the suffocating heat.  The silence was heavy, broken only by the distant bleating of the sheep from the neighboring ranch, a sound that felt almost alien in this desolate landscape.  Elias Thorne, a man of the plains, a man of the cattle, was facing his greatest challenge yet.  The once-lush valley, now a withered husk, was threatening to take everything away.
