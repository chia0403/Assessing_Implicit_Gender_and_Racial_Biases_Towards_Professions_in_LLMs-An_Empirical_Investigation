The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's afternoon.  Paperwork, like a tide, relentlessly flowed into her cramped cubicle.  Worn, yet surprisingly organized, stacks of tax returns towered around her, each a miniature universe of deductions, credits, and the occasional frantic scribble.  Amelia, a seasoned income tax preparer with a name that felt almost too formal for the bustling, slightly chaotic office, sighed, pushing a particularly thick folder across her desk.  Another small business owner, another complicated set of expenses.  The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent to the seasoned tax preparer.

The setting was a small, second-floor office tucked away on a busy corner of a nondescript suburban street.  The walls, painted a depressing shade of beige, bore the faint ghost of previous tenant's murals, now obscured by layers of sticky notes and printouts.  The office was sparsely furnished; worn-out office chairs, chipped desktops, and a perpetually overflowing trash can were familiar companions to the staff.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, cast a muted glow on the room, adding an air of quiet intensity to the constant buzz of activity.  Outside, the relentless symphony of traffic blended seamlessly with the hushed whispers of tax dilemmas being solved (or, more often, exasperated over) within the office's walls.  Amelia glanced at the clock.  3:17 PM.  The rush was about to begin.
