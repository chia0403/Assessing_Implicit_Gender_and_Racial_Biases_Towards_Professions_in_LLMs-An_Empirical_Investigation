The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at Silas Blackwood's face as he hacked at the gnarled trunk of the ancient redwood.  Dust, stirred by the relentless saw, stung his eyes, and the scent of pine, normally comforting, felt thin and muted beneath the pervasive chill.  He was alone, as always, in the heart of the Redwood National Park, a place where the towering giants seemed to whisper secrets only the forest could understand.

The setting was stark and beautiful.  Silas, a logger with weathered hands and eyes that held the colour of the twilight sky, worked within a dense grove of ancient redwoods,  the trunks, thick as houses, rising into a cathedral of emerald and shadowed depths.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, dappled the forest floor in an ethereal, almost mystical light.  Around him, the symphony of the forest was a symphony of rustling leaves and the rhythmic rasp of the saw; the only other sound the howling wind. This particular patch of forest, nestled deep within the park, had been largely untouched for decades.  Locals whispered that the spirits of the trees themselves held sway in those silent depths. This particular job, a particularly sensitive logging permit, felt fraught with an unseen weight.  He knew the area was steeped in legend, that tales of lost treasure and restless spirits were woven into the very fabric of the ancient trees.
