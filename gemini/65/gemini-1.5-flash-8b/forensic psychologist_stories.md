Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned asylum, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Vance's thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something indefinably metallic, hung heavy in the musty corridors of Blackwood Manor.  It had been three weeks since the initial call, three weeks of piecing together fragmented memories, and three weeks since the weight of this case had settled, leaden, on her shoulders.  Blackwood Manor, a crumbling monument to forgotten therapies and fractured minds, now held the key to understanding a string of disturbingly similar murders.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, dilapidated Victorian mansion located in the secluded, rain-swept Blackwood Valley, nestled deep within the English countryside. The mansion, once a prestigious institution for the mentally unwell, now stood as a monument to its troubled past.  The crumbling walls, stained with the grime of years, hinted at the horrors that had been concealed within its halls.  The oppressive atmosphere, saturated with the chill of forgotten anguish, permeated every room, twisting the light into eerie shadows that danced with the flickering gas lamps. The surrounding Blackwood Valley was equally bleak, draped in a perpetual mist that seemed to amplify the silence and isolation.
