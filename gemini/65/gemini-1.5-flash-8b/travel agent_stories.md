The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Cavendish’s hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Outside, the rain hammered against the picture window of her tiny, but exquisitely organised, office in the heart of bustling Covent Garden.  Rain-slicked cobblestones reflected the flickering gaslight, casting long, dancing shadows across the overflowing flower stalls and the murmuring crowds.  Amelia, a travel agent with a name as evocative as the destinations she sold, meticulously plotted a route across a faded map of the Himalayas.  Her office, crammed with brochures, travel journals, and half-eaten croissants, was a testament to her passion – a kaleidoscope of wanderlust manifested in the organised chaos.  Amelia knew that the journey, and the stories it would hold, were just waiting to be unearthed.
