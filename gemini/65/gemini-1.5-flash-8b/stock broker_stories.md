The fluorescent hum of the trading floor, a symphony of frantic keyboard clicks and the low thrum of distant server farms, vibrated through Alistair Finch's bones.  He wasn't immune to the pressure, wasn't immune to the relentless, almost palpable energy radiating from the packed room of Wall Street's elite.  His palms, slick with nervous sweat, gripped the polished mahogany desk, the faint smell of aged leather mingling with the stale coffee and the ever-present aroma of impending doom, or perhaps, triumph.  Alistair Finch, a stockbroker of uncommon ambition and even more uncommon ruthlessness, knew this was where the battle was fought.

The year was 2024.  The city of New York, a concrete jungle perpetually bathed in the harsh glare of fluorescent lights, held its breath.  The sky, a bruised grey, reflected the anxieties of the financial world, mirrored in the anxious faces around him.  Alistair sat in the dimly lit trading pit, a maelstrom of activity swirling around him.  The roar of the market, a cacophony of buy and sell orders, surged through the room, threatening to swallow him whole.  High-rise buildings, glass-fronted and imposing, stretched into the sky, a concrete forest surrounding the heart of the financial beast.  The air thrummed with the unspoken expectations and unspoken deadlines.  This was the breeding ground for fortunes and the graveyard for dreams; this was Alistair's domain.
