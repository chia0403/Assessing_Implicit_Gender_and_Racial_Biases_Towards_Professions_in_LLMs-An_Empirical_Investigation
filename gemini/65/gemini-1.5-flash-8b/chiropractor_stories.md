The rhythmic *click-clack* of Dr. Eleanor Vance's shoes on the polished linoleum floor echoed through the quiet clinic.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of the large windows, painted stripes across the waiting room, dappling the dust motes dancing in the air.  A faint scent of lavender and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had become intimately familiar to Eleanor over the past ten years.  Outside, the vibrant green of the summer foliage contrasted sharply with the muted grey of the overcast sky, a premonition of the stormy weather that often accompanied the humidity of late June.  Eleanor sighed, adjusting the strap of her worn leather satchel, a familiar weight that held more than just tools and paperwork.  Today felt particularly heavy, burdened not by a backlog of patients but by a premonition of a storm brewing within her own life.


The clinic, "Vance Wellness," a small but meticulously maintained space, was located in the heart of a quiet, tree-lined suburb of Oakhaven.  Homes with manicured lawns and overflowing gardens lined the streets, a stark contrast to the more gritty, industrial areas further out.  The quaint shops and cafes that dotted the neighborhood were a comforting counterpoint to the fast-paced world of the city just beyond. Eleanor found solace in the quiet rhythm of her small practice, the quiet community around her, and the quiet, measured movements she made through her days.  Yet, today, an uncharacteristic unease clung to the air, a subtle shift that resonated with the weight in her chest.
