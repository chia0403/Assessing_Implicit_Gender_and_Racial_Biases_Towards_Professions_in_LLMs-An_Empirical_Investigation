The air in the drafting room hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the almost-tangible pressure of countless, meticulously drawn lines.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the meticulously organized array of blueprints spread across the drawing tables.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker with hands calloused but surprisingly delicate, traced the outline of a complex hydraulic system with a practiced, almost hypnotic, precision.  The rhythmic scratching of his pencil against the tracing paper was the only sound that competed with the quiet hum of the old, overworked air conditioner.

Elias Thorne's workstation, nestled in a corner of the sprawling drafting room, was a testament to his meticulous nature.  Each instrument, from the precise dividers to the exquisitely sharpened pencils, was arranged with a nearly military orderliness. A faded, slightly cracked, photograph of a younger Elias, beaming alongside a vintage steam locomotive, was pinned to the corner of his drawing board.  The locomotive was a stark contrast to the sterile world of steel beams and concrete pillars dominating the rest of the room. A small, ceramic teapot, chipped at the handle, and a single, withered sunflower sat on his cluttered desk, silent companions in the daily grind. The building itself, the sprawling steel and brick structure of the Consolidated Engineering Works, had a history as long and intricate as the blueprints Elias was working on.  This was the heart of industrial America, a place where dreams of bridges spanning canyons and skyscrapers piercing the clouds were sketched and built, one precise line at a time.
