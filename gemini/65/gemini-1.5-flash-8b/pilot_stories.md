Amy gripped the controls of her sleek, custom-built twin-engine aircraft, the "Phoenix," its metallic skin gleaming dully in the filtered light.  The air was thin, the world a vast expanse of icy grandeur, and Amy, a veteran pilot with eyes as sharp as the mountain peaks, felt a familiar tremor of exhilaration, and a prickle of unease.  The radio crackled, static echoing in the silence of the high altitude.  A voice, gruff and distant, reported a distress signal. A signal originating from a location off the beaten track, shrouded in the dense clouds clinging to the valley, near the legendary Whispering Glacier.  The distress call had a strange urgency about it; something more than the usual mechanical hiccup or a pilot's miscalculation.  Amyâ€™s heart, a steady drum against her ribs, picked up the beat.  The Phoenix, her trusty steed of the skies, was all she had.
