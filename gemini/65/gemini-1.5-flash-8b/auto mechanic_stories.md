The greasy haze hung low in the air of "Rusty's Wrench & Wheel," a tiny garage nestled between a bakery and a struggling antique shop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused like ancient leather, moved with the practiced ease of a seasoned conductor, wrestled with a mangled motorcycle engine.  The air, thick with the smell of burnt oil and something indefinably floral (a mystery Barty swore was coming from Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning hydrangeas across the street), thrummed with the low growl of the machine.  Barty, a man built like a sturdy oak, with eyes the colour of faded, well-worn copper, concentrated intensely, his brow furrowed. He had been working on this particular Harley-Davidson for three days, and the stubborn engine stubbornly refused to cooperate.
