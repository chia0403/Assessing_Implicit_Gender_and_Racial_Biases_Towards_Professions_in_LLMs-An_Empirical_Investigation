The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Seven thirty-five AM, the same time every weekday.  The scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of yesterday's takeout wafted through the air-conditioned reception area, a familiar, if slightly depressing, aroma.  Amelia, a petite woman with a cascade of auburn hair perpetually escaping her neatly tied bun, meticulously arranged a stack of brochures, each one showcasing a different architectural marvel â€“ a modern glass tower, a rustic stone cottage, a futuristic spaceship-like home.

The office, nestled on the 12th floor of a gleaming skyscraper in the heart of Manhattan, offered panoramic views of the city's concrete jungle. But Amelia, staring at the endless expanse of skyscrapers and streetlights, felt more trapped than inspired.  A perpetual drizzle outside mirrored the grey monotony of her existence.  It was the same every day, an endless loop of answering phones, fielding questions from potential clients about the newest building project, and dealing with the incessant demands of a company that valued efficiency above all else.  Amelia was the silent keeper of the doors, the gatekeeper to the architects' world of creativity and, ironically, solitude.
