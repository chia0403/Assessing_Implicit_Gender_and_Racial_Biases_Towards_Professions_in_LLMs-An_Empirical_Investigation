The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's coat around her ankles as she hurried across the sprawling, snow-covered grounds of Blackwood Manor.  Frozen breath puffed out in white clouds around her face.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece looming darkly against the grey sky, felt more ominous than usual tonight.  Not just because of the encroaching blizzard, but because of the hushed whispers circulating amongst the staff.  Tonight, something was profoundly wrong at Blackwood Manor, and Amelia, Head Animal Caretaker, felt it in the very bones of her being.  The air itself seemed to vibrate with an unnatural tension.

Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the Derbyshire Peak District, was a place of ancient grandeur and unsettling secrets.  Its imposing silhouette, with its numerous turrets and crumbling stonework, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast, snow-dusted gardens.  Ivy clung to the decaying walls, thick and intertwined like skeletal fingers, and the silence, broken only by the wind's mournful cries, seemed to amplify the unnatural chill in the air.  Within the manor's ancient walls lived not only a collection of exotic creatures – rare birds,  spectacular felines, and strange, almost mythical beasts – but a legacy of enigmatic events, and a history shrouded in whispers of the uncanny.  Amelia, despite having worked at Blackwood for five years, still felt a prickle of unease whenever she stepped inside.  It wasn't just the hushed tones and the shadowy corners; it was a feeling that something, or someone, was watching.
