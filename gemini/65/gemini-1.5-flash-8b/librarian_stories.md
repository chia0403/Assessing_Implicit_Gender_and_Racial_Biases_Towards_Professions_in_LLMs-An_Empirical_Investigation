The flickering fluorescent lights of the Central Library hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic rustle of pages and the occasional hushed cough.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the high, arched windows of the Dewey Decimal section, illuminating tiny particles of forgotten knowledge.  Eleanor Ainsworth, a librarian with eyes the colour of faded midnight and a quiet intensity that belied her gentle nature, meticulously catalogued a rare first edition of "The Canterbury Tales."  The book, bound in leather the colour of aged wine, smelled faintly of cedar and time.  She ran a finger along the embossed crest, a tiny, almost imperceptible dragon entwined with a scroll.  This was more than just a book; it was a portal to another era, a hushed whisper from the past.  The library itself, a sprawling behemoth of knowledge and hushed reverence, had always been Eleanor's sanctuary.  But lately, the whispers had become more pronounced, and the sanctuary felt less secure.
