The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded lavender that had seen better days, seemed to hum with a quiet energy.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a smiling sun, spilled across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's meticulously arranged sensory table.  Today, the table was a riot of textures:  cool, smooth stones, fuzzy pom-poms, crinkly tissue paper, and oddly satisfyingly bumpy clay.  Amelia, a kindergarten teacher with eyes the colour of warm honey and a laugh that could melt glaciers, surveyed her charges, a flurry of tiny, colourful bodies flitting around her.  It was the penultimate day before the summer break, and the air vibrated with a palpable sense of anticipation.  Outside, the sweet scent of honeysuckle mingled with the distant rumble of construction.  She knew this was the quiet before the storm.
