The biting wind whipped across the exposed moorland, stinging Dr. Elara Blackwood's cheeks as she adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel.  The skeletal remains of a ruined stone cottage, barely more than a crumbling silhouette against the bruised purple sky, marked the location.  This was the remote village of Whisperwind, a place whispered about in hushed tones by those who dared venture near, a place where the whispers weren't just of the wind, but of the uncanny.  Elara, a physician with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a steely resolve, had come here not for the picturesque, but for a patient â€“ a young woman whose illness defied any known medical explanation.  Her name was Isolde, and the locals spoke of her being touched by something ancient, something...otherworldly.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, heavy with the scent of pine and something else, something faintly metallic, a scent that clung to the edges of her awareness, unsettling and profoundly unsettling.
