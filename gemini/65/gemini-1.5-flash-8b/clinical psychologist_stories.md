Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s chest.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile waiting room, highlighting the anxious shifts in the bodies of her patients.  Each cough, each sigh, each rustle of paper was amplified by the oppressive silence, broken only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the adjoining restroom.  Eleanor, her clinical psychologist's demeanor a carefully constructed mask over the turmoil within, adjusted the strap of her worn leather tote bag.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful soundtrack to the unspoken anxieties swirling beneath the surface of her small town, Havenwood.  Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the jagged Cascade Mountains, a place where the beauty of the landscape seemed to mock the struggles of its inhabitants.  This Tuesday, the rain brought with it a fresh case.
