The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained with the bittersweet hues of yesterday's fades and highlights, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of his barbershop, "The Rusty Razor."  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, hummed with the low thrum of a forgotten conversation, carried on the breeze whistling through the broken window pane.  Barty, his brow furrowed in contemplation, meticulously trimmed a stray wisp of grey from a customer's meticulously-combed sideburn.  The rhythmic snip-snip of the clippers, a familiar counterpoint to the quiet murmur of the city outside, was the only sound for several minutes.  Today, however, there was a different tremor in the air, an undercurrent of unease that had nothing to do with the usual Tuesday afternoon lull.  It felt...wrong.

The Rusty Razor wasn't exactly a bustling salon.  Situated on a side street in the burgeoning, yet somehow always melancholic, district of Aethelgard, it was more of a haven for the overlooked, the quiet souls who sought refuge in the familiar squeak of the barber's chair and the comforting presence of a well-honed razor.  Aethelgard was a city of muted colours, painted with a palette of greys and browns.  Tall, imposing, ancient buildings that seemed to have weathered time itself lined the narrow streets.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by countless footsteps, creaked softly beneath the shoes of the hurried passersby, a constant, rhythmic pulse in the city's otherwise quiet heart.  A palpable sense of history clung to the air, as if every stone whispered stories of generations long past.  Barty, a fixture in Aethelgard for as long as anyone could remember, knew these stories, felt them in the subtle shifts of the light, in the murmur of the city, in the very pulse of the forgotten streets around him.
