The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a constant, almost oppressive thrum that vibrated through Amelia "Amy" Carter's bones.  The sterile white walls reflected the frantic activity, a ballet of hurried footsteps and the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of heart monitors.  A fresh, sickly sweet smell of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a familiar, yet nauseating, aroma of the night shift.  Amy, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude's Hospital, felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders.  It was 2:17 AM, and the ER was already a maelstrom of crisis.  Outside, the city pulsed with an unseen rhythm, oblivious to the frantic urgency within the walls.  Amy's own exhaustion, compounded by the growing sense of unease, tugged at the edges of her composure.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, anticipating the next crisis.
