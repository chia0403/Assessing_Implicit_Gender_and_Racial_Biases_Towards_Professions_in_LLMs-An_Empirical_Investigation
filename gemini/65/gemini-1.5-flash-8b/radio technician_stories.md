The flickering neon sign of "Radio Rex" cast an oily sheen across the rain-slicked street, reflecting in the puddles like fractured mirrors.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder and ozone, a familiar comfort to Elias Thorne, a radio technician of uncommon skill and even more uncommon patience.  His workshop, crammed into a cramped space above the bustling electronics market, was a symphony of humming transformers and crackling static.  Cobwebs, thick as spun moonlight, clung to the exposed wires draped across every available surface.  Elias, a man weathered by years of troubleshooting faulty circuits and whispered secrets transmitted over airwaves, perched precariously on a stool, his fingers dancing across a tangle of wires.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion against the backdrop of the radio's faint, distorted signal.  The insistent buzzing from the receiver, a battered vintage model heâ€™d scavenged from a forgotten junkyard, was the only soundtrack to his solitary vigil.  Tonight, the signal was unlike any he'd encountered before.
