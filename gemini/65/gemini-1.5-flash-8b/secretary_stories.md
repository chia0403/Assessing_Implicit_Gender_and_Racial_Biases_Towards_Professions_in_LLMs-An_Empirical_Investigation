The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the executive suite.  Amelia Josephine Finch, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, felt a tremor in her normally steady hands.  Across the room, the rhythmic clack of Mr. Harding's typewriter, a vintage relic that seemed to groan with every keystroke, was the only sound louder than the frantic beat of Amelia's own heart.  Today was the day.  The day she'd finally submitted the proposal, the one that could make or break her small, struggling advertising agency.  Sweat prickled her forehead beneath the slightly too-tight, navy blazer she'd chosen for its "professional" appearance.  This wasn't just a presentation; it was a gamble, a leap of faith into a world far beyond the comforting, if slightly suffocating, confines of her role as secretary.  

Setting:

The executive suite was a small, but imposing, office on the fourth floor of a towering, Art Deco building on the corner of Fifth and Madison avenues in New York City.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of afternoon sunlight that pierced the heavy drapes, illuminating the polished mahogany desk and the ornate, brass-trimmed filing cabinets that lined one wall.  A palpable tension, thick as the New York air, hung in the room, a silent premonition of the decisions about to be made.  Outside, the city roared with a symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a soundtrack to the silent drama unfolding within.
