The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the drafty window of her tiny office.  Rain lashed against the grimy storefront of "Numbers & Nuggets," a storefront more evocative of a forgotten corner deli than a financial powerhouse.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for pencil skirts and perfectly sharpened No. 2 pencils, surveyed the chaotic landscape of receipts, invoices, and crumpled tax forms scattered across her desk.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other, except for the insistent, almost tangible feeling of unease hanging in the air.  The numbers, normally her comforting language, now seemed to dance with a sinister rhythm, whispering warnings she couldn't quite decipher. The smell of stale coffee and mildew, a familiar fixture in her small workspace, seemed particularly heavy tonight.  The city, usually a symphony of honking taxis and hurried footsteps, was muted, almost silent, except for the relentless drumming of the rain.  Her small, cluttered office, nestled in the heart of a once-bustling, now slightly run-down, section of the city, felt like an island besieged.
