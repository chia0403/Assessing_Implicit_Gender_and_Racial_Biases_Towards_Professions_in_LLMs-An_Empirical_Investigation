The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the Blackwood Hollow, swirling around the half-finished shed that was her current obsession.  Oak timbers, their rough-hewn surfaces scarred by the relentless sun and rain, lay scattered like fallen giants.  Amelia, a carpenter with hands as sure and strong as seasoned oak, knelt amidst the chaos, a small, chipped chisel gripped tightly in her calloused fingers.  The midday sun, already sinking towards the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched and twisted like the branches of gnarled, ancient trees.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, hung heavy and still, a stark contrast to the relentless howl of the wind.  This was Blackwood Hollow, a place both beautiful and brutal, a place where even the most resilient souls could crumble under the weight of solitude and harsh reality.  The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic thump of Amelia's hammer against the wood, a counterpoint to the symphony of the approaching storm.
