The flickering fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the hushed whispers and the rhythmic thump of hurried footsteps.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light, illuminating the chipped paint and faded posters advertising upcoming dances and charity events.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion echoing the anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  It was a Tuesday, a typical Tuesday, yet today felt different, heavy with a sense of foreboding.  Her steel-grey trench coat, usually a shield against the world, felt more like a lead weight.

Eleanor Vance, a school psychologist at Northwood High for the past five years, found herself at the very center of this storm.  The school, nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, was a seemingly ordinary place.  However, a series of increasingly disturbing incidents –  a surge in student self-harm, heightened anxiety levels among the student body, and a noticeable decline in overall well-being – had painted a picture far darker than the picturesque valley outside.  The vibrant, bustling town that Northwood was known for felt constricted, suffocated by the invisible threads of fear and unspoken trauma.
