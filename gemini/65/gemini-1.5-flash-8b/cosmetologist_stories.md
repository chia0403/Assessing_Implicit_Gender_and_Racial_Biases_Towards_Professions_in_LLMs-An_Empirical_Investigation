The scent of jasmine and freshly-cut hair hung heavy in the air of "Golden Scissors," a salon tucked away on a quiet side street of the bustling city.  Rain hammered against the grimy storefront windows, mirroring the restless energy simmering beneath Amelia Rose Blackwood's carefully manicured nails.  She, a cosmetologist with a sharp eye for detail and a practiced hand, meticulously applied a streak of auburn dye to the unruly curls of a client, a young woman named Chloe, whose anxieties were as intricate as the knots in her hair.  Tonight, however, the usual chatter and clinking of shears felt muted, replaced by a low hum of unease.  The rhythmic drumming of rain, coupled with the hushed whispers circulating through the salon staff, heightened the palpable tension. Amelia felt it, a prickling sensation beneath the surface of her calm exterior.  Something was amiss.  Tonight, the whispers might just reveal a truth more profound than any carefully sculpted hairstyle.
