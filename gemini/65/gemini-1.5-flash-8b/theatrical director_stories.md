The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the crumbling brick walls of the "Grand Guignol," a theatre long past its prime.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating chipped plaster and the faded grandeur of a once-lavish auditorium.  This was the domain of  Amelia Beatrice Blackwood, a theatrical director whose reputation, like the theatre itself, was a patchwork of brilliance and despair.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of raven hair that seemed to absorb the surrounding darkness, surveyed the stage.  A single, bare bulb hung precariously, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling debris.  Empty wooden crates and discarded props littered the backstage area, mute witnesses to countless productions.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and forgotten dreams.  Amelia ran a hand through her hair, the faint sound lost in the echoing silence of the building.  This season, a play exploring the treacherous nature of ambition and the corrosive power of envy, called "Shadows of the Stage," was set to premiere.  It promised to be a controversial piece, both in its content and the director's unwavering belief in its theatrical potential.
