The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" store hummed, a monotonous drone that vibrated through Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s tired bones.  Empty pizza boxes, discarded shopping bags, and the faint scent of stale coffee clung to the air, a familiar aroma of late-night retail.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of frustrated shoppers and ringing cash registers was muted, almost silent.  It was almost 2 AM, and Amelia was the sole guardian of aisle 17, home to the mysteriously popular, if slightly questionable, collection of novelty socks.  

The store, sprawling and cavernous, was a testament to its ambitious name.  From towering stacks of strangely-shaped lamps to shelves groaning under the weight of miniature sculptures of oddly-dressed squirrels, the space felt chaotic and overwhelming, even in its stillness.  Long shadows stretched across the aisles, swallowed by the deep recesses of the store.  Beyond the hazy glow of the entrance, the city outside lay hushed, lost in the quiet embrace of the pre-dawn hours.
