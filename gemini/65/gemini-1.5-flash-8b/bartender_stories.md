The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sparrow" Finch, illuminating the fine dust motes dancing in the air above the polished mahogany bar.  The air, thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the faint, almost comforting aroma of burnt sugar from the perpetually sputtering espresso machine, hung heavy.  Sparrow, a woman sculpted from quiet strength and sharp angles, expertly poured a shot of something amber-hued into a chipped mug.  The rhythmic clinking of glasses, the low murmur of conversation, and the occasional outburst of laughter formed a soundtrack to her solitary vigil.

The Rusty Mug, a dive bar nestled in the shadows of the crumbling Victorian architecture of Blackwood, wasn't known for its clientele.  Regulars were a colourful mix of the down-on-their-luck, the lost-in-thought, and the perpetually disgruntled.  Blackwood itself was a town clinging to the fringes of the modern world, a place where whispers of forgotten magic and ancient secrets mingled with the harsh reality of coal-dust-choked streets and looming, ominous industrial factories.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mimicking the constant, unyielding drumming of Sparrow's heartbeat.  Tonight, the silence was unnervingly pregnant.
