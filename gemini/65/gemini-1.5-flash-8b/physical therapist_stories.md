Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the physiotherapy clinic, a relentless drumbeat that echoed the rhythmic throb in Amelia Blackwood's temples.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and disinfectant, hung heavy in the small, cluttered space.  Sunlight, fractured into pale shards through the grime-coated windows, barely illuminated the rows of exercise equipment, their metal surfaces gleaming with a muted, almost spectral light.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, knelt beside a young woman named Elara.  Elara's delicate face was etched with frustration, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues she usually wore.  Now, a monochrome palette of grey and muted blue spoke volumes about her recent fall.

The clinic, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling, yet somehow melancholic, city of Aethelgard, was a testament to its owner's pragmatic nature.  Built on the site of a once-grand bakery, now almost entirely consumed by ivy and overgrown with weeds, the structure was more utilitarian than elegant.  The faint aroma of stale sourdough lingered, a ghost of the past, a constant reminder of the transformations that life, and injuries, could bring.  A single, flickering fluorescent light hung precariously above, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the pain Elara was trying to overcome.  The city outside, shrouded in a thick veil of rain, reflected the somber mood within the walls of the tiny clinic.
