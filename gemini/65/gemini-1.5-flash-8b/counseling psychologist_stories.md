Sunlight rarely penetrated the gloom of the street, but the rain-slicked cobblestones outside whispered tales of lives lived and lost, echoing the unspoken struggles that flooded her office.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows across the room, illuminating the stacks of paperwork and the half-empty bottle of chamomile tea beside her computer.  It was a Tuesday, and already, the weight of the week, the whispered concerns of her clients, were pressing down on her like a physical burden.
