The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Rodriguez's oversized denim jacket, stinging her cheeks as she pulled the worn leather of the steering wheel tighter.  The Alaskan highway stretched before her like a fractured spine of asphalt, disappearing into the bruised twilight of a late October evening.  Dust devils danced in the thinning light, swirling around the battered cab of her rig, the "Iron Horse," a faded emerald green behemoth that had seen more winters than she cared to count.  Her destination:  the remote mining town of Quartz Creek, nestled deep within the Brooks Range, where the air was as thin as her patience.

The setting sun painted the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple, casting long, skeletal shadows across the endless expanse of tundra.  Towering, jagged mountains, sculpted by millennia of ice and wind, rose like ancient, petrified sentinels on either side of the highway.  A biting chill clung to the air, a constant reminder of the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness.  Small, frost-bitten trees clung to life against the desolate backdrop, their skeletal branches reaching towards the inky sky. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic crunch of the Iron Horse's tires on the frozen gravel, felt thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket over the vast landscape.
