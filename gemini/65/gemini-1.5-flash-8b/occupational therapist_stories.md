Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's head.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and antiseptic, hung heavy in the small, sparsely furnished room.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting long, distorted shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Elara Blackwood, a seasoned occupational therapist, stared at the splayed fingers of a patient, a young woman named Anya, whose hands trembled uncontrollably.  Outside, the storm raged on, a chaotic symphony of thunder and wind echoing the turmoil within the small clinic, nestled in the heart of the forgotten industrial district.  The rhythmic clanging of factory machinery, a constant hum from a nearby abandoned steel mill, blended with the frantic beating of Elara's own pulse.  This was her world â€“ a world of fractured limbs, damaged minds, and the stubborn resilience of the human spirit.
