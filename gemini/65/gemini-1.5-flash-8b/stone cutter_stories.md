The wind, a restless hand, clawed at the exposed flank of Mount Silvanus, whispering tales of ages past through the jagged, grey stone.  Dust, fine as powdered charcoal, swirled around Elara Stoneheart, stinging her eyes and coating her rough, calloused hands.  Her workshop, a small, cavernous space carved into the mountainside, was a symphony of muted percussion – the rhythmic clang of her hammer against the stubborn granite, the groan of the heavy stone as it yielded to her relentless will.  Elara, her face etched with the same hardness as the mountain, focused intently on the task before her – shaping a weathered boulder into a majestic sphinx, a guardian for the village nestled at the foot of the mountain.  The village of Whisperwind, a place of whispers and legends, relied on her skill.  Her father, a revered stone-cutter before her, had instilled in her a deep connection to the mountains, a reverence for the stone, and a quiet confidence in her own ability.  This sphinx was more than just a carving; it was a promise, a testament to her dedication, her strength, and the enduring spirit of Whisperwind.
