The aroma of sugared almonds and buttercream hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's pale, freckled skin like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty floral prints of the cafe's curtains, illuminated the swirling clouds of frosting on a meticulously crafted tiered wedding cake.  Amy, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the vibrant colours of a rainbow, meticulously piped a delicate rose onto the topmost layer. Her hands, nimble and precise, moved with a practiced grace that belied the tremor that occasionally vibrated through her fingertips.  The cafe, "The Sugarplum," was a small, almost forgotten haven nestled on a side street, filled with the muted hum of conversations and the clinking of china.  Dusty, floral wallpaper adorned the walls, and antique furniture, polished to a high sheen, suggested a bygone era of elegance.  A chipped porcelain cat figurine perched precariously on a corner shelf, a silent observer of Amyâ€™s artistry. Today, though, the silence was almost oppressive, broken only by the rhythmic whir of Amy's electric whisk and the occasional sigh escaping her lips. Outside, the city roared, a symphony of traffic and hurried footsteps, but within the cafe, a quiet, almost melancholic energy reigned supreme.  Amy knew this feeling all too well. It was the quiet before the storm.
