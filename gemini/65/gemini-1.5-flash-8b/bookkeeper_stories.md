The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Tally Ho" accounting firm cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Butterfield's desk.  Paper, in a dizzying array of colours and sizes, sprawled like a chaotic battlefield across its surface.

Amelia, a bookkeeper of unparalleled dedication, hunched over her worn keyboard, her fingers flying across the keys in a rhythmic dance of data entry.  Outside, the city roared – a symphony of honking taxis, screeching brakes, and the distant wail of sirens – a stark contrast to the hushed, almost oppressive quiet of her workspace. This was her life, and for now, her only world.
