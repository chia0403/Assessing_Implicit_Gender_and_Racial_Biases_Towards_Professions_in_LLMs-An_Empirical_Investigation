The flickering neon sign of "Leaky Pipes & Sparkling Fixtures" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a constant, unwelcome companion, dripped from the rusted gutters and pooled in the uneven pavement.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, licensed plumber extraordinaire, or at least, that’s what his business card claimed.  Tonight, the rain hammered down with a vengeance, mirroring the storm brewing inside Barty.  He hated the city's relentless downpours.  He hated the endless stream of clogged drains and overflowing toilets.  He hated the feeling of being perpetually one step behind, always chasing the next flood.  He hated the smell of mildew and despair that clung to the damp air of the alley, a smell that seemed to cling to him as well.  Tonight, however, a different scent mingled with the dampness: something sweet and floral, unlike anything he’d smelled before.  It beckoned him, pulling him deeper into the alley's gloom, where something far more intriguing than a stubborn clog awaited.
