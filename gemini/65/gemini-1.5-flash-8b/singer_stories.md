The chipped paint of the "Rusty Spoon" clung to the walls like a forgotten lover, a faded floral pattern whispering tales of a bygone era.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the low hum of the jukebox.  Inside, bathed in the flickering neon glow of the "Singin' Serenade" sign, Amelia Nightingale, a singer with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice that could shatter glass, sat hunched over a worn, vinyl-covered table.  A half-eaten plate of greasy fries sat before her, a testament to the late-night hunger that often accompanied the late-night gigs.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  Tonight, Amelia was facing not only the relentless rhythm of the rain, but also a voice inside her that echoed the emptiness of the city that had swallowed her whole.
