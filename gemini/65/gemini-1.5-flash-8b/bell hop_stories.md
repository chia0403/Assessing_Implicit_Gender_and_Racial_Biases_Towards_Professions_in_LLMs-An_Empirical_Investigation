The brass bell, polished to a dazzling gleam, hung suspended in the oppressive stillness of the lobby.  It seemed to mock Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Jr., with its silent, unwavering brilliance.  He, Barty, was currently attempting to polish a tarnished brass letter opener, the task assigned to him by the perpetually scowling Mr. Grimshaw, the head bellhop. The grand hotel, The Astorian, loomed over the city like a slumbering giant, its immense facade draped in a thick veil of early morning mist.  The city itself, a sprawling metropolis of steel and stone, lay shrouded in the same damp, gray blanket.  Barty, with his slightly too-large uniform and perpetually worried brow, felt the weight of the world – and the looming threat of a bad review – pressing down upon him. Rain, a relentless, rhythmic drumming on the massive windows, amplified the silence of the empty lobby, broken only by the soft hiss of the steam heating the pipes beneath his feet.
