The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air of Silas Blackwood's workshop, a comforting aroma that had been his constant companion for thirty years.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the small, high-ceilinged room, illuminating the intricate patterns meticulously pinned to the tailor's board.  Silas Blackwood, a man whose hands, though gnarled with age, still possessed a surprising dexterity, meticulously snipped a thread, his eyes focused on the shimmering silk fabric draped over a nearby mannequin.  He was a master of his craft, a whisper of a tailor in a city teeming with bustling activity and louder voices.  The city of Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis known for its magnificent architecture and even more magnificent wardrobes, was his domain.  A quiet, contemplative existence, woven meticulously into the fabric of his work.  He lived and breathed tailoring. But today, a piece of fabric different from anything he had ever touched hung from a nearby hook.  A dark, unfamiliar velvet, bearing an almost imperceptible, silver thread, whispered tales of a world beyond the city walls.
