The chipped paint on the walls of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed with a low, insistent buzz, a soundtrack composed of tiny shrieks of delight, hushed whispers, and the rhythmic clinking of plastic toys.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the frantic patter of Amelia Rose Butterfield's racing thoughts.  She, a twenty-year-old child care worker with eyes the colour of warm honey, found herself trapped in a whirlwind of crying toddlers and a mountain of un-sorted laundry.  Her meticulously planned schedule, a document meticulously scribbled in a small spiral notebook, was a crumpled mess in her hands.  A particularly persistent, three-year-old named Leo was clinging to her leg, demanding a "story-time" that involved spinning around and around until he was dizzy.


The daycare itself was a small, bright yellow building nestled amongst a cluster of modest houses on the edge of a sprawling, industrial estate.  Smoke curled lazily from the factory chimneys in the distance, a stark contrast to the vibrant colours of the crayons and paints scattered across the brightly lit playroom.  A faint scent of disinfectant mixed with the ever-present aroma of spilled juice and freshly baked cookies, a constant reminder of the duality of the day's activities.  The cheerful, slightly chaotic energy of the children, their laughter and tears, created a living, breathing tapestry in the space, painting a picture both joyous and slightly overwhelming.
