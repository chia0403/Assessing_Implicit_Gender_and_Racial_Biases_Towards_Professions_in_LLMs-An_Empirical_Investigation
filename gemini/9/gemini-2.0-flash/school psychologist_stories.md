## Story Opening:

The stale, metallic tang of instant coffee clung to Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s throat. It was a Tuesday, which meant it was already halfway to Friday, and yet it felt like the week was a concrete block chained to her ankles. She stared blearily out her office window, watching the gaggle of middle schoolers huddled near the bike racks, their voices a muffled hum that barely penetrated the thick, soundproof glass. Usually, their youthful energy brought her a flicker of something positive, but today, even that was dimmed by the paperwork mountain looming on her desk. Another ADHD evaluation. Another suspected case of bullying. Another parent convinced their child was gifted simply because they could recite the alphabet backwards. Eleanor sighed, a weary sound that seemed to deflate her even further into her worn-out office chair. She needed a vacation. Or maybe just a decent cup of coffee.

## Setting:

**Location:** Creekwood Middle School, a sprawling, single-story brick building nestled in the affluent, yet surprisingly bland, suburb of Creekwood, Ohio. The school prides itself on its "state-of-the-art" learning environment, which mostly translates to a slightly newer building than the neighboring high school and a perpetually malfunctioning smartboard in the library.

**Eleanor's Office:** A small, windowless room tucked away in the administrative wing, near the nurse's office. The walls are painted a soothing (and therefore, ubiquitous) shade of institutional green. Eleanor has attempted to personalize the space with a framed print of Van Gogh's "Starry Night," a collection of brightly colored stress balls, and a hand-drawn "Believe in Yourself" poster courtesy of a particularly anxious 6th grader. Despite her best efforts, the room still feels sterile and temporary, like she's just passing through, waiting for a better, less emotionally taxing assignment to come along. The desk is overflowing with folders, assessment reports, and half-eaten granola bars. The air is perpetually stuffy and smells faintly of disinfectant and despair.
