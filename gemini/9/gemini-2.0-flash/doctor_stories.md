The pungent smell of disinfectant, warring with the subtle sweetness of antiseptic wipes, clung to the air of Dr. Amelia Rose Fairchild's office. Rain lashed against the tall, Victorian windows of the clinic, blurring the already fading autumnal colors of Maplewood, Connecticut. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, mimicking the knot of anxiety that had tightened in Amelia's chest all day. The late afternoon gloom pressed in, making the cheerful yellow walls seem almost suffocating.

Amelia sat hunched over her mahogany desk, the smooth surface reflecting the harsh light of the goose-neck lamp beside her. Paperwork, as always, threatened to engulf her; discharge summaries, insurance forms, and the ever-present stack of lab results waited patiently for her attention. She rubbed her tired eyes, the bridge of her nose aching. It wasn't just the paperwork that weighed on her. There was a disquieting feeling in the air, a subtle tension that even the rhythmic patter of the rain couldn't drown out. Maplewood, usually a haven of tranquility and idyllic charm, felt different tonight, a little darker, a littleâ€¦unsettled.
