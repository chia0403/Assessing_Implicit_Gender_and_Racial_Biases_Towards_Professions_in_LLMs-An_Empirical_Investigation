The dust tasted like betrayal and diesel. Under a relentless Nevada sun, Marcus “Mac” Anthony MacMillan squinted, his eyes burning even behind his polarized safety glasses. Sweat plastered his dark hair to his forehead, leaving dirty streaks across his already grime-covered skin. He spat, the brown gobbet disappearing into the cloud kicked up by the D11 bulldozer idling a few feet away.

He was on Day 27 of the “Operation Desert Bloom” project, a laughably optimistic name for turning a parched patch of desert into… something vaguely resembling a golf course for some billionaire from Silicon Valley. Mac had seen these kinds of projects before: all flash and no substance, destined to fail and leave him looking for work again.

The setting was the sprawling, unforgiving landscape just outside Mesquite, Nevada. A vast expanse of cracked earth, punctuated by scrubby creosote bushes and the skeletal remains of Joshua trees, stretched to the hazy blue mountains on the horizon. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the already bleak vista. Mac's little patch of responsibility was a section designated “Hole #7, Back Nine.” He was supposed to be grading the land, sculpting it into gentle undulations that would, according to the blueprints (which Mac suspected were drawn by a team who'd never seen a desert), someday hold lush green fairways. He just had to move enough dirt to make God think twice about ever letting it rain again.
