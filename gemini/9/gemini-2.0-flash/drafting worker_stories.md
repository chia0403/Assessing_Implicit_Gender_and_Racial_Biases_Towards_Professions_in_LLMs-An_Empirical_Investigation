## Story Opening and Setting

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of mechanical pencils echoed in the cavernous room, a discordant symphony only slightly muffled by the layers of tracing paper stacked high on every desk. Arthur Penhaligon squinted, pushing his spectacles further up his nose. Another bloody decimal point. He’d lost count of how many he’d fudged, or rather, strategically "adjusted" this week alone. Precision, that was the mantra. Precision or bust. Unfortunately, Arthur was feeling less like a precision instrument and more like a rusty cog in a machine that had long since stopped caring about its individual parts. He rubbed the sleep from his bleary eyes and stared at the blueprint sprawling across his drafting table. Another section of the Leviathan. Another incomprehensible jumble of pipes, valves, and pressure gauges designed to do… well, Arthur honestly didn’t know. He just drew them, meticulously replicating the architect's increasingly bizarre vision.

**Setting:**

The year is 1938. Arthur Penhaligon works for a small, but increasingly influential, engineering firm called "Ironclad Designs" located in the heart of Birmingham, England. The firm is housed in a sprawling, converted Victorian factory, its brick facade stained black with years of industrial grime. The drafting room, where Arthur spends the majority of his waking hours, is a vast, dimly lit space. Rows upon rows of drafting tables stretch into the gloom, each illuminated by a harsh, green-shaded lamp. The air is thick with the smell of ink, paper, and a faint undercurrent of coal smoke that permeates everything in Birmingham. The walls are plastered with technical drawings, schematics, and cryptic notes scribbled in various hands. A perpetually hissing radiator sputters in the corner, fighting a losing battle against the damp chill that seeps in through the large, grimy windows. Outside, the rumble of lorries and the clang of hammers from the nearby shipyards provide a constant reminder of the city's tireless industrial heart. This is a world on the cusp of war, a world where blueprints hold the key to power, and Arthur Penhaligon, stuck in its monotonous rhythm, is about to stumble upon something far bigger than himself.
