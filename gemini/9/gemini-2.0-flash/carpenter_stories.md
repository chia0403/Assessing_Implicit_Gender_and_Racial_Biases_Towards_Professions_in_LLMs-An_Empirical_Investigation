The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient, gnarled oak that stood sentinel over the harbor. Inside the cluttered warmth of his workshop, the scent of sawdust, linseed oil, and beeswax battled the salty tang of the ocean air that seeped in through the cracks in the windowpanes. Elias Thorne, his full name, was a carpenter, and his calloused hands, stained with walnut and mahogany, moved with a practiced grace that belied their strength.

Heâ€™d been sanding the curve of a rocking horse leg for what felt like hours, the repetitive motion a balm against the quiet ache in his bones. Outside, the fishing boats bobbed restlessly at their moorings, a silent testament to the perilous lives they led, just as his own hands, calloused and worn, testified to the constant labor of shaping wood into objects of both beauty and utility. Elias Thorne lived and worked in Port Blossom, a small, windswept village clinging to the rugged coastline of Northumbria. It was a place where the rhythm of life was dictated by the tide, where the sea both provided and threatened, and where the whisper of ancient legends lingered in the salt-laced air.

He was a man of few words, Elias, content in the company of his tools and the familiar grain of the timber he worked with. But tonight, the usual solace eluded him. The rocking horse, a commission for young Thomas Abernathy, was nearing completion, but Elias couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease. It wasn't the wood, nor the design, both were perfect. It was a feeling, a persistent whisper in the back of his mind that told him something was amiss, something was about to change in quiet, predictable Port Blossom. He paused his sanding, the coarse grit of the paper still scratching against the wood, and looked out the window at the churning grey sea, a familiar knot tightening in his stomach.
