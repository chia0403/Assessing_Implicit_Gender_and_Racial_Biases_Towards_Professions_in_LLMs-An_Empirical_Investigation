The clatter of the beverage cart rattled down the aisle like a rusty tin can being kicked down a cobblestone street. Amelia Josephine Hernandez plastered a smile on her face, a practiced expression that could soothe even the most turbulence-induced terror in a passenger. The pre-dawn light, a bruised purple bleeding into a weak orange, filtered through the grime-streaked windows of the Boeing 777, illuminating the cabin in a sickly, ethereal glow. 

They were somewhere over the North Atlantic, hurtling through the frigid darkness on their way from London Heathrow to JFK. Amelia could feel the low hum of the engines vibrating through her shoes, a constant, comforting drone that had become white noise to her after eight years in the sky. Most of the passengers were slumped in their seats, lost in the oblivion of sleep or the mesmerizing glow of their personal entertainment screens. But Amelia was acutely aware of everything: the rhythmic snore of the man in 23B, the faint scent of lavender emanating from the woman in 11A, the persistent blinking of the call button in 34C. Even at 30,000 feet, thousands of miles from the familiar comfort of her Brooklyn apartment, Amelia was on duty, a silent guardian of the sky.
