## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of burnt almonds and simmering cardamom hung heavy in the air, a fragrant battle waged against the stale, sterile smell of the hospital. Dr. Iris Eleanor Thorne sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, was attempting her weekly rendition of a "healthy" Bakewell tart. Iris suspected the only thing healthy about it was the lack of actual cherries. She was just about to open the door to the communal kitchen, armed with a cheerful smile and a pre-prepared lecture on mindful snacking, when her phone buzzed. The caller ID flashed "Dad." Iris groaned inwardly. Today was *not* the day for Dad's existential questions about the evils of refined sugar.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the bustling, yet perpetually understaffed, St. Augustine's General Hospital in the charming, if slightly rundown, seaside town of Whitstable, Kent, England. The hospital, a sprawling brick building built in the early 20th century, is a hodgepodge of architectural styles, reflecting its constant, yet often haphazard, additions over the decades. Iris's office, nestled in the heart of the Outpatient Services wing, is a small, brightly-lit space crammed with pamphlets on healthy eating, anatomical posters (mostly focusing on the digestive system), and overflowing filing cabinets. Outside, the salty tang of the sea mixes with the clatter of ambulances and the distant cries of seagulls, a constant reminder of the life and, unfortunately, death that pulsates within St. Augustine's walls. The hospital gardens, a riot of colorful, if slightly overgrown, flowerbeds, offer a brief respite from the clinical environment, a place where Iris often seeks solace between consultations and meetings.
