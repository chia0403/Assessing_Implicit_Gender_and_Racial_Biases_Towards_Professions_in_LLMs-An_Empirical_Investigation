## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The opulent, yet suffocatingly quiet, Rosewater Manor, nestled on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic Ocean in Cornwall, England. The house, built in the late 19th century, was a testament to Victorian excess, with its labyrinthine corridors, ornate carvings, and a distinct aroma of beeswax, damp stone, and lingering despair.

**Story Opening:**

The chill of the pre-dawn air seeped through the ancient stone walls of Rosewater Manor, nipping at the exposed skin of Evelyn Maeve Penhaligon's hands as she wrestled with the heavy velvet curtains in the grand drawing room. The first slivers of light were just beginning to paint the grey sky a watery pink, and the ocean, usually a restless behemoth, seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of the coming day. Evelyn shivered, pulling her threadbare wool cardigan tighter around her.

"Another day, another dust bunny," she muttered to herself, her voice barely a whisper in the cavernous room. It had been five years since she'd started working at Rosewater, five years spent polishing silver, dusting priceless antiques, and trying to ignore the ghosts that seemed to cling to every corner of the house. She knew every creak in the floorboards, every shadow that danced in the flickering candlelight, and every whispered rumour surrounding the reclusive Lord Rosewater, her enigmatic employer.

The heavy scent of lilies, perpetually kept fresh in a crystal vase on the mantlepiece, hung heavy in the air. Evelyn hated lilies. They were beautiful, yes, but they reminded her of funerals, of loss, of the secrets buried deep within Rosewater Manor's stony heart. And lately, she couldn't shake the feeling that those secrets were starting to stir.
