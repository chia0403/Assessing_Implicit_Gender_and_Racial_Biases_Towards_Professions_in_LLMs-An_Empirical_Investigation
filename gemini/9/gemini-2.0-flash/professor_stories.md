**Story Opening:**

The stale scent of aged parchment and forgotten brilliance clung to Professor Alistair Quentin Blackwood like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, the familiar aroma a comforting counterpoint to the nagging anxiety that gnawed at him. He traced a finger across the faded gold lettering of a massive, leather-bound tome â€“ *De Rerum Natura,* Lucretius's philosophical poem about the nature of things. This particular edition was a 1483 Aldine printing, a treasure that made his palms sweat just thinking about its value. He closed the book with a soft thud, the sound echoing in the cavernous room. It was almost time.

**Setting:**

The setting is the Rare Books Room of the Blackwood University Library, nestled in the heart of Oxford, England. This room isn't just a room; it's a sanctuary, a repository of centuries of human thought and endeavor. High, vaulted ceilings, stained-glass windows depicting scenes from ancient myths, and heavy oak shelves stretching to the rafters create an atmosphere of hushed reverence. The air is perpetually cool and dry, maintained at a precise temperature and humidity to preserve the delicate volumes within. The only light comes from the tall, arched windows and strategically placed, low-wattage lamps that cast long, dancing shadows. Tables are scattered throughout, each equipped with soft, lambskin mats for handling the fragile books. The silence is broken only by the occasional rustle of pages and the distant chiming of the university bells.
