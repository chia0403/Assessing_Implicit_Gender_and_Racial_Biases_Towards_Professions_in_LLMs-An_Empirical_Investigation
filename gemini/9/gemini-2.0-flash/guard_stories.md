## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The shimmering heat haze rising from the cracked, ochre paving stones of Akhet-Aten felt heavier than usual, pressing down on the city like the judgement of the gods themselves. Akhet-Aten, the City of the Horizon, built by the heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten, was a city of stark contrasts. Gleaming white limestone temples dedicated to the Aten, the sun disc, stood proud against the relentless azure sky, yet their shadows cast long, jagged fingers across the dusty, impoverished alleyways where the common folk eked out a meager existence. The air was thick with the scent of incense, dust, and the faint, unsettling odor of desperation.

**Opening:** Amenemhat, a sturdy, sun-baked man whose name meant "Amun is at the Forefront," felt the familiar grit of sand between his calloused toes as he shifted his weight. He gripped the shaft of his khopesh tighter, the polished bronze warm against his palm. The midday sun beat down on him relentlessly, turning his worn leather breastplate into a miniature furnace. His duty station, the entrance to the Great Aten Temple, was usually a scene of bustling activity, priests in flowing white linen robes bustling in and out, offerings of fruit and flowers carried in ornate baskets. But today, an unnatural stillness had settled over the city. Even the usual throng of supplicants and merchants was absent, leaving Amenemhat alone with his thoughts, and a creeping sense of unease. Something was wrong. He could feel it in the very air, heavy and pregnant with a silent, unspoken dread. He scanned the empty plaza, his eyes narrowed behind the kohl-rimmed gaze of a seasoned guard, and wondered what awaited him at the next sunrise.
