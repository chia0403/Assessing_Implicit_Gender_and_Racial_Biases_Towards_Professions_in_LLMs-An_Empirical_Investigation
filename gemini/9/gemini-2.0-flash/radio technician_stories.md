The hum of a thousand forgotten frequencies vibrated through Arthur Percival Finch's bones, a familiar lullaby in the belly of the beast. His beast, in this case, being the antiquated radio shack perched atop Beacon Hill, overlooking the churning, grey expanse of the North Sea. Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, clawing at the corrugated iron walls and rattling the skeletal antennae that reached skyward like begging fingers. Inside, however, Arthur was king of his domain. A chaotic kingdom of tangled wires, glowing vacuum tubes, and the ghostly echoes of voices lost to the ether.

The year was 1938. A year pregnant with unspoken fears, a year Arthur spent largely oblivious to the brewing storm in Europe, his world confined to the crackling pronouncements and distant melodies that filled the airwaves. The walls of the shack were plastered with schematics, faded maps dotted with shipping lanes, and yellowed newspaper clippings detailing daring rescues at sea, all silent witnesses to the lonely vigil Arthur maintained. He was the last line of communication for ships navigating the treacherous waters, a vital link in a world increasingly reliant on technology he barely understood, yet intimately controlled.
