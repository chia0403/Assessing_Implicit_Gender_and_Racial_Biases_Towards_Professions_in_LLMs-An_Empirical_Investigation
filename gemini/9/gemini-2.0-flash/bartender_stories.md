## Opening:

The humid air of the French Quarter clung to everything, thick and sweet with the ghosts of jazz and spilled liquor. Marie Laveau Dubois wiped down the sticky countertop of "The Crimson Knot" with a practiced hand, her movements economical and efficient. Outside, the cacophony of Bourbon Street roared – a beast demanding to be fed with beads, cheap cocktails, and fleeting moments of revelry. Inside, The Crimson Knot hummed with a quieter energy, a sanctuary for those seeking a different kind of oblivion.

Tonight, though, even the quiet hum felt strained. Marie could sense it in the restless shift of the shadows, in the way the old oak bar seemed to groan beneath her touch. It wasn't just the approach of All Hallows' Eve, though that certainly played a part. Something else was brewing, a storm far more potent than the hurricane warnings flashing across the news. Something connected to the stories, to the secrets she kept tucked deep within the heart of this city, and deep within her own.
## Setting:

The Crimson Knot was tucked away on a cobblestone alleyway just off Bourbon Street, a refuge from the madness. Its exterior was unassuming: a plain wooden door painted a deep, blood-red, the color echoed in the velvet drapes that hung heavily over the single window. A simple, hand-carved sign depicting a tangled, crimson rope was the only indication of its existence.

Inside, the atmosphere was intimate and dimly lit. Candles flickered on polished mahogany tables, casting dancing shadows on the exposed brick walls. Bottles of rare spirits lined the back bar, illuminated by a warm, amber glow. Herbs hung drying from the ceiling, their potent aromas mingling with the scent of aged wood and the faint, almost medicinal, smell of Marie's signature concoctions.

The bar itself was the centerpiece, a massive slab of oak worn smooth by generations of elbows and spilled drinks. Etched into its surface were intricate patterns, a swirling tapestry of Celtic knots and Creole symbols that seemed to shift and change depending on the angle of the light. The Crimson Knot wasn’t just a bar; it was a living, breathing entity, steeped in the history and magic of New Orleans. It was Marie Laveau Dubois’ legacy, and her responsibility.
