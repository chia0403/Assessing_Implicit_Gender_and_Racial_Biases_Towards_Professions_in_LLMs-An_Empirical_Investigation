## Story Opening:

The smoke curled from a forgotten cigarette butt in the overflowing ashtray, mimicking the wisps of steam rising from the dregs of my lukewarm coffee. Outside, the November rain hammered against the grimy windows of my office, painting the already bleak cityscape in shades of grey. Not exactly a postcard day. And not exactly the kind of day that screamed " lucrative new case," either. Just another Tuesday in the life of, well, me.

The buzzer on my door, a cheap, shrill thing that had long ago lost its will to live, sliced through the monotony. I debated ignoring it. Most likely it was Mrs. Periwinkle from upstairs complaining about the tap-dancing lessons I decidedly *wasn't* giving at 3 AM. But something in the insistent buzz, a tremor that wasn't just electrical interference, made me relent.

"Yeah?" I rasped into the intercom, my voice rusty from disuse.

A breathy voice, laced with an almost comical amount of nervous energy, crackled back. "Is... is this the office of Detective Archibald Finch?"

I sighed. My name. Always a conversation starter. "It is. And who's asking?"

"It's… complicated. Can I come up?"

Complicated. The two words that fueled my entire profession. "Suit yourself. Third floor. Look for the door that looks like it's trying to escape."

## Setting:

Detective Archibald Finch's office occupied the third floor of a pre-war brick building on the less-than-glamorous edge of downtown Oakhaven. The building, once a bustling hub of small businesses, now felt like a relic of a bygone era, clinging to life with a stubborn tenacity. The peeling paint on the exterior walls hinted at years of neglect, and the perpetually flickering fluorescent lights in the hallway did little to dispel the gloom.

Finch's office itself was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of files teetered precariously on every surface, interspersed with half-eaten sandwiches, empty coffee cups, and a collection of discarded disguises – a fake mustache clinging forlornly to a chipped porcelain cat figurine, a pair of oversized spectacles perched precariously on a stack of old newspapers. The furniture was mismatched and worn, a motley collection of discarded pieces salvaged from various sources. A tattered Persian rug covered most of the scarred wooden floor, adding a touch of faded elegance to the otherwise drab surroundings. The only concession to modernity was a battered desktop computer, its screen perpetually displaying a dizzying array of open browser windows and partially written reports. The pervasive aroma of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and unspoken secrets hung heavy in the air, a fitting olfactory summary of Archibald Finch's life.
