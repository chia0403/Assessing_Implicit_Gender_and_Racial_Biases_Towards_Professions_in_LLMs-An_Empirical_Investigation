Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dentist:

**Story Opening:**

The drill whined, a high-pitched shriek that usually sent shivers down spines. But for Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, it was the soundtrack to her Tuesday. She adjusted her magnification loupes, the bright overhead light reflecting in their lenses, and focused on the molar in front of her. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, was snoring gently, mouth agape, a testament to Eleanor's numbing skills, if not exactly complimentary.

Suddenly, the power flickered. The drill stuttered, coughed, and then died, plunging Eleanor into near silence, save for the hum of the ancient fluorescent lights. Mrs. Higgins remained blissfully unaware, her rhythmic snores continuing unabated. Eleanor sighed. This was becoming a habit.

"Oh, youâ€™ve got to be kidding me, Gladys," Eleanor muttered under her breath, referring to the temperamental generator that powered half of her practice.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's dental practice, "Ainsworth Family Dentistry," was located in the sleepy, somewhat crumbling coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The building itself was a converted Victorian house, painted a hopeful, yet faded, shade of robin's egg blue. The wrap-around porch sagged slightly, and one of the gingerbread trim pieces was noticeably missing.

Inside, Eleanor had tried her best to create a welcoming atmosphere, fighting against the inherent clinical sterility of a dentist's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating antique furniture and a collection of seascape paintings by local artists. She kept a basket of freshly baked cookies (gluten-free, of course, for the health-conscious patients) in the waiting room, and always played calming classical music.

However, the charming facade couldn't completely hide the age of the building. The plumbing gurgled ominously, the floorboards creaked with every step, and, as Eleanor had just been reminded, the generator was on its last legs. Port Blossom wasn't exactly booming, and keeping the practice afloat was a constant challenge. But Eleanor loved her community, even the ones with the toughest tartar build-up, and she was determined to stay.
