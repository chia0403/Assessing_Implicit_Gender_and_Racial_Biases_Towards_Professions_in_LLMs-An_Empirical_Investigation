The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a mournful tune, a stark counterpoint to the silence of Dr. Evelyn Mallory Reed's lab. Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminated against the rows of meticulously labeled beakers and bubbling flasks. The lab, located on the forgotten third floor of the derelict St. Bartholomew's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, was a testament to Evelyn's tenacity and the university's diminishing faith in her work. Cobwebs clung to the corners, and the faint scent of formaldehyde mingled with the musty odor of decay, a reminder of the building's former life and the countless lost causes it housed.
