The flickering neon sign of the "Starlight Diner" cast a greasy halo on the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Amelia Grace Carter, fresh off a grueling twelve-hour shift, sank into a vinyl booth, the red seat groaning in protest. Her bones ached, her eyes burned, and the phantom wail of a siren still echoed in her ears. It was 3:17 AM in Havenwood, Ohio â€“ a town where hope went to die and 911 calls were more likely to involve a broken heart than a broken bone. Havenwood, nestled deep in the rust belt, was a place where the steel mills had long since shut down, taking with them the dreams and livelihoods of generations. The diner, a lonely beacon on the edge of town, was a sanctuary for the shift workers, the lost souls, and Amelia, who often found herself seeking solace in its greasy comfort food and the quiet hum of its ancient refrigerator after facing the worst the town had to offer.
