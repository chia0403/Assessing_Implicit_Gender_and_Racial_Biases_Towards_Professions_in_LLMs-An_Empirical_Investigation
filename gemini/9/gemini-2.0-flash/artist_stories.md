The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, stinging Rosaline Evelyn Hawthorne's cheeks as she wrestled her easel against the gusts. She cursed under her breath, securing the worn wooden legs with a practiced hand. It was November, the sky a bruised plum color that bled into the slate grey water. This was her favorite time of year to paint, though. The starkness of it all, the brutal honesty of the coming winter, it fueled her.

She was perched precariously on a rocky outcrop jutting out from Discovery Park, a sprawling green haven tucked away on the edge of Seattle. Below her, the beach was a strip of rough sand littered with driftwood, each piece sculpted by the relentless tide into grotesque, beautiful shapes. In the distance, the Olympic Mountains rose like jagged teeth, their peaks dusted with an early snowfall.

This place, this moment, felt raw and real, and that's precisely what Rosaline was after. Forget the tourist-friendly sunshine and cherry blossoms; she wanted to capture the Seattle that lived beneath the surface, the Seattle of grit and resilience, the Seattle that reflected the quiet storms raging inside her own soul. The Seattle that whispered secrets to the wind. She tightened her grip on her palette knife, ready to wrestle that truth onto the canvas.
