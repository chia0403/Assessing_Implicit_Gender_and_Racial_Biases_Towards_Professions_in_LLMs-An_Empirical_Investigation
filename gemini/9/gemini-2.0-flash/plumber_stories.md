## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, again. Elias Finnigan wrestled it back into position, muttering a string of profanities that would make a sailor blush. He was starting to regret that third cup of coffee. Not just the jitters, but the fact that his already overflowing bladder was now screaming for relief.

He gave the corroded nut one final, Herculean tug. It held firm. "Come on, you bastard," Elias growled, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. This was it, the decisive moment. He heaved.

With a screech that echoed through the echoing Victorian mansion, the nut finally gave way. Unfortunately, it took half the pipe with it.

A geyser of rusty water erupted, coating Elias from head to toe in a deluge that smelled vaguely of mildew and regret.

"Motherf-"

Before he could finish the sentence, a shriek, sharp as a shard of glass, cut him off.

## Setting:

The setting is a dilapidated, three-story Victorian mansion perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning, gray waters of the Pacific Ocean near Mendocino, California. Known as "Seacliff Manor," it was once a beacon of opulent wealth, built in the late 1800s by a shipping magnate. Now, however, peeling paint clung to its ornate trim like decaying skin, and the overgrown gardens choked with weeds and brambles seemed to claw at the foundation. The interior, despite being furnished with antique furniture draped in moth-eaten linen, felt cold and damp, permeated with the constant, mournful sigh of the ocean wind whistling through cracked windowpanes. The house has been purchased sight-unseen by a reclusive millionaire rumored to be interested in renovating it into a luxury retreat, but for now, itâ€™s little more than a haunted, crumbling shell, inhabited only by dust, spiders, and the occasional unfortunate plumber.
