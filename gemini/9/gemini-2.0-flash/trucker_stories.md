The jangling wind chimes over the porch of the Route 66 Diner were a discordant symphony to Jedediah Silas Calhoun’s ears. He hunched his shoulders deeper into his worn denim jacket, the scent of diesel and stale coffee clinging to him like a second skin. The diner, perched precariously on the edge of Winslow, Arizona, was a neon beacon in the pre-dawn gloom, a familiar pitstop in a life lived between the white lines. Jedediah had been hauling cargo across this dusty landscape for twenty years, and this particular diner, with its faded glory and perpetually sticky vinyl booths, had become a sort of second home. He’d seen waitresses come and go, watched the owners age and bicker, and even witnessed a couple of full-blown fistfights fueled by bad whiskey and broken dreams. But this morning, something felt different. A stillness hung in the air, broken only by the mournful howl of a distant coyote and the ever-present hum of the approaching interstate. The air was heavy with the promise of a scorching day, but Jedediah felt a shiver run down his spine, a premonition that this run to Albuquerque was going to be anything but ordinary.
