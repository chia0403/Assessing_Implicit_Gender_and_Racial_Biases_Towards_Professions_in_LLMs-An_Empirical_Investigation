Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a chiropractor:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun slanted through the panoramic windows of "Spinal Harmony," Dr. Eleanor Vance's chiropractic clinic. Located on the third floor of a newly renovated industrial building in the trendy "Loft District" of Minneapolis, the space was a study in calming contradictions. Exposed brick walls and steel beams were softened by warm, natural light, potted succulents, and the gentle hum of a water feature near the reception desk. Outside, the distant rumble of city traffic blended with the rhythmic clatter of the light rail, creating a surprisingly soothing urban symphony. The scent of lavender essential oil hung subtly in the air, a conscious effort by Eleanor to create a sanctuary from the stress of modern life.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance scrubbed her hands with clinical precision, the gritty texture of the antiseptic soap a familiar comfort. It was almost closing time, and the last patient of the day, a marathon runner with a persistent piriformis issue, had finally hobbled out, clutching a bag of ice and a prescription for deep tissue massage. Eleanor glanced at the wall clock: 5:57 PM. Just enough time to answer a few emails before succumbing to the siren call of a glass of pinot grigio and a good book.

But as she turned towards her computer, the chime of the entrance door echoed through the otherwise empty clinic. Eleanor sighed inwardly. Latecomers were the bane of her existence, especially on a Friday. With a practiced smile plastered on her face, she peered around the corner of the reception desk. Standing awkwardly in the entryway, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, was a man she hadn’t seen in over fifteen years – a man she desperately hoped she’d never see again.
