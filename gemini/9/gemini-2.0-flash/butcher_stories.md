Okay, here's a story opening, introducing our main character, the butcher:

**Setting:** The small, perpetually chilly town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the perpetually gray Whispering Mountains. The year is 1938. Oakhaven's central square, dominated by a gnarled oak tree that has seen more winters than most of its residents, is usually quiet save for the occasional rumble of a coal truck or the clatter of Mrs. Higgins' hens escaping their coop.

**Opening:**

The first scream shredded the morning quiet like a poorly sharpened cleaver through gristle. Arthur Percival Finch, proprietor of Finch's Finest Cuts and Sausage Emporium, paused mid-slice. Heâ€™d been meticulously trimming a pork belly, humming a jaunty tune under his breath, the familiar scent of sawdust and cured meats clinging to his apron. The scream, raw and terrified, was followed by the frantic barking of dogs down by the square. Arthur, a man whose meaty hands were more accustomed to wielding a boning knife than a weapon, felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine. He wiped his hands on his stained apron, the humming dying in his throat, and peered out the fogged-over window of his shop. Something was definitely amiss in Oakhaven.
