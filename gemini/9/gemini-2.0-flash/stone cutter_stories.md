The biting wind whipped off the Grey Peaks, stinging Thomas Ashton's cheeks as he hefted another slab of granite onto the cart. It was a particularly stubborn piece, riddled with veins of quartz that glittered mockingly under the pale, predawn light. His breath plumed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the sprawling quarry that was his life, his prison, and his legacy.

The Quarry of Whispering Winds, as it was known locally, was carved into the very base of the Grey Peaks, a jagged wound in the earth that echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammers and the rasp of saws. Generations of Ashtons had toiled here, wresting the cold, unyielding stone from the mountain's grip. Thomas, the latest in the line, felt the weight of that history settle heavy on his shoulders with each passing sunrise. The air tasted of granite dust, the scent clinging to his clothes, his skin, even his dreams. Shacks, built from scraps of discarded stone and wood, clung precariously to the edge of the quarry, a ramshackle village born from necessity and bound together by the shared hardship of the stone. This was not a place for beauty, or leisure, or even much hope. This was a place for stone, and for the men and women who bled their lives into its extraction.
