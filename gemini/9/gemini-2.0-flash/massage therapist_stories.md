The low hum of the Himalayan salt lamp did little to disguise the anxiety thrumming beneath Maya Elena Rodriguez's skin. Outside, a blustery March wind clawed at the windows of Serenity Now Massage, her tiny studio tucked away in the back of a converted Victorian house in Salem, Massachusetts. The kind of wind that howled ghost stories and threatened to snatch unwary tourists right off the cobbled streets.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and chamomile, a carefully curated aroma designed to soothe frazzled nerves. Problem was, Maya’s own nerves felt anything but soothed. Her next client was scheduled to arrive in fifteen minutes, and while she prided herself on her ability to melt away tension, this particular appointment felt different. Off.

A premonition, perhaps? Salem had that effect on people, especially those like Maya, who possessed a certain…sensitivity. She’d spent the last five years building a reputation for intuitive massage, for sensing the hidden knots and aches that even her clients couldn't articulate. But this feeling wasn't about a knot. It was something more pervasive, a chill that went bone deep, mirroring the icy gusts rattling the old building. Maybe she just needed more tea.
