The chipped mug warmed Amelia Stone's hands, the ceramic a familiar comfort in the biting Chicago wind that whipped around her. Steam curled from the lukewarm coffee, a pathetic imitation of the heat she craved. Outside, Lake Michigan was a roiling grey beast, its waves slamming against the seawall with a thunderous roar that vibrated through the floorboards of her tiny apartment.

Amelia, thirty-two and fiercely independent, was a journalist, not the glamorous kind you saw on TV, but the kind who dug in the dirt, chasing down stories that others dismissed as unimportant. She worked for the "Chicago Sentinel," a paper struggling to stay afloat in a sea of online news, a place where integrity still mattered, even if it meant she barely scraped by. Her apartment, above a bustling Polish bakery on Milwaukee Avenue, reflected her financial situation: mismatched furniture scavenged from thrift stores, walls plastered with clippings and story notes, and a persistent aroma of sweet poppy seed filling that clung to everything.

This morning, however, the aroma did little to soothe the knot of unease in her stomach. The story she'd been working on for the past three months – a deep dive into the questionable land acquisitions of Alderman Richard Harding – was starting to feel less like a promising lead and more like a dangerous game of cat and mouse. Harding was a powerful man, and Amelia knew that poking around in his affairs came with risks. But the whispers she’d been hearing, the hushed conversations and disappearing documents, told her something rotten was festering beneath the polished surface of Chicago politics. And Amelia Stone, despite the gnawing fear, was determined to unearth it.
