## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dr. Alistair Humphrey adjusted the sterile, slightly too-bright lamp hanging above Mrs. Gable's left leg. The fluorescent hum, usually a soothing white noise in the bustling clinic, felt particularly grating this morning. Alistair pressed gently on Mrs. Gable's contracted hamstring, feeling the familiar resistance, the knot of tension that seemed to embody years of stubbornness and inactivity. "Okay, Mrs. Gable, let's try a little deeper stretch today. Just tell me if you feel any sharp pain, not just discomfort."

Mrs. Gable, a woman whose wrinkles told stories as vividly as any novel, huffed. "Sharp pain is all I feel these days, Doctor. Sharp pain and the regret of ever trying to tap dance in my sixties."

Alistair chuckled, a low, rumbling sound that he hoped conveyed both reassurance and genuine amusement. He knew her story well â€“ the overzealous attempt at rediscovering her youth, the pulled hamstring, the subsequent avoidance of any movement, and finally, his appointment card clutched tightly in her trembling hand. Getting Mrs. Gable moving again wasn't just about restoring function; it was about restoring hope. But some days, like today, the weight of other people's broken bodies and spirits felt particularly heavy. He inhaled deeply, forcing a smile he hoped reached his eyes. "Well, Mrs. Gable, we're going to turn that sharp pain into a dull ache, and that regret into a victory dance, even if it's just a little toe-tapping."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the "Rise & Rehab" clinic, a physical therapy practice located in the heart of vibrant and slightly chaotic downtown Portland, Oregon. Situated on the second floor of a converted brick warehouse, the clinic boasts exposed piping, high ceilings, and large windows overlooking a bustling street filled with food carts, eccentric pedestrians, and the constant hum of city life. Inside, the clinic is a mix of modern functionality and industrial chic. The reception area is bright and welcoming, with a comfortable seating area, a water cooler, and a constantly rotating collection of local art. Beyond the reception desk lies a large open gym space filled with various pieces of equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, and resistance bands. Individual treatment rooms line the perimeter, offering privacy for more delicate examinations and therapies. The air is usually filled with the scent of antiseptic, liniment, and the faint, lingering aroma of someone's forgotten protein shake. A large whiteboard in the break room displays staff schedules, inspirational quotes, and the occasional passive-aggressive note about cleaning out the shared refrigerator. Despite its modern aesthetic, the clinic feels lived-in, a place where sweat, tears, and triumphs are commonplace.
