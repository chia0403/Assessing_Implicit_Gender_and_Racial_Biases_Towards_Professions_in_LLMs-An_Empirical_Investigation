## Story Opening:

The brass buttons on Albert Reginald Bartholomew’s uniform dug into his stomach as he wrestled the enormous Louis Vuitton trunk off the luggage cart. Its owner, a woman shimmering with more diamonds than the chandeliers in the Grand Ballroom, hadn’t even blinked as she passed it off to him with a dismissive flick of her heavily manicured hand. Albert knew the type. Used to getting what they wanted, leaving a trail of crumpled hundred-dollar bills and exhausted bellhops in their wake. He hated them, and he suspected they hated him right back, or rather, didn't see him at all. He adjusted his cap, the stiff brim digging into his forehead, and grunted as he hauled the trunk towards the gleaming brass elevator doors. Maybe today, just maybe, there would be a decent tip. He caught his reflection in the polished surface – a lean, almost gaunt face, framed by neatly combed brown hair, and eyes that held a world of observation behind their polite, professional smile. He looked tired, older than his twenty-three years. The elevator pinged, the doors sliding open with a practiced sigh, revealing a mirrored interior and the bored expression of the elevator operator, a young woman with a cascade of auburn curls. He barely registered her presence as he heaved the trunk inside. He just wanted to get this behemoth to Suite 407 and escape back to the anonymity of the lobby.

## Setting:

The year is 1938. The setting is the Grand Imperial Hotel, located in the heart of bustling New York City. A monument to Art Deco extravagance, the hotel boasts soaring ceilings adorned with intricate plasterwork, marble floors that gleam under the light of crystal chandeliers, and a constant hum of activity. A stream of well-heeled guests, ranging from socialites dripping in jewels to businessmen with briefcases bursting with secrets, navigate the opulent lobby. The air is thick with the scent of expensive perfume, freshly cut flowers, and the faint, lingering aroma of cigar smoke. The rhythmic click of high heels on marble, the muffled conversations, and the distant strains of a jazz band from the hotel's exclusive nightclub all contribute to the vibrant, almost frenetic atmosphere of the Grand Imperial. It is a place where dreams are made and broken, secrets are whispered, and fortunes are won and lost - and where Albert Reginald Bartholomew is just another cog in the intricate, gilded machine.
