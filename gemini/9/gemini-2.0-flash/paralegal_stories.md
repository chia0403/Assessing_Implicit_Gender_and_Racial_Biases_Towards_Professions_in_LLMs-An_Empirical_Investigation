Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of the main character as a paralegal:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Cassandra "Cassie" Blake's hands, but couldn't quite thaw the chill that had settled deep in her bones since 3:00 AM. Three AM, the hour she’d woken in a cold sweat, the details of the client file, "Hendersen vs. GlobalTrans," swirling in her mind like the sickly sweet steam rising from her half-finished coffee. It wasn’t just the mountain of discovery documents, or the late-night phone calls from a frantic Mr. Hendersen, convinced GlobalTrans was deliberately trying to bury him in red tape. It was the *feeling*, the subtle hum of wrongness that resonated from every page she read. Something was being hidden, meticulously, and her gut, a notoriously reliable compass in the murky waters of litigation, told her it was a big one. Today, she was going to start digging.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the bustling and slightly claustrophobic law offices of Klein, Roth & Associates, located on the 27th floor of the Sterling Building in downtown Chicago. The office is a mix of old-school mahogany and modern glass, reflecting the firm's attempt to balance tradition with a forward-thinking image. Cassie's corner office, barely large enough to swing a cat, is crammed with stacks of files, legal textbooks, and sticky notes plastered with deadlines and reminders. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grimy city haze, casting a perpetually gray pall over everything. The air is thick with the scent of expensive coffee, cheap copy paper, and the faint undercurrent of desperation that clings to every lawyer in the building.
