The harsh, fluorescent lights of Manny’s Auto Repair hummed a monotonous tune, a song Amelia Rose Callahan had grown to both resent and rely on. It was five in the morning, still dark out, and the desert air that seeped in through the open bay doors was biting, carrying the scent of dust and something vaguely metallic. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a greasy ponytail and her hands already stained with the grime of the day before, shivered despite her thick flannel shirt. The air compressor kicked on with a wheeze, shaking the concrete floor and making the wrenches hanging on the wall rattle in their slots.

Manny’s wasn't pretty. It was a sprawling, ramshackle building on the outskirts of Harmony Ridge, Arizona, a town clinging to the edge of the Sonoran Desert like a stubborn burr. The place was crammed with the carcasses of forgotten vehicles, the ghosts of automotive dreams. Rusty pickup trucks with sun-baked paint sat alongside dented sedans with blown engines, all patiently awaiting their turn under Amelia's skilled hands. A faded sign above the office door, barely legible, proclaimed "Manny's: We Get You Back on the Road (Eventually)."

Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, was already under the hood of a battered Ford F-150, its engine spitting and sputtering like a grumpy old man. This was her sanctuary, her kingdom. The smell of oil and gasoline was as comforting to her as the scent of lavender was to some. She was a master of metal, a whisperer of engines, and in this dusty, chaotic corner of Arizona, Amelia Rose Callahan found her peace.
