**Opening:**

The ringing phone sliced through the pre-dawn stillness like a diamond through glass. Bartholomew Jonathan Featherstone IV groaned, burying his face deeper into the goose-down pillow. Seven AM on a Saturday? Only one person would dare interrupt his precious sleep. He knew, even before he squinted at the caller ID, it was Agnes, his mother. And he knew, with a chilling certainty, that she was about to unleash a tsunami of familial obligation upon him. He fumbled for the phone, bracing himself.

"Bartholomew, darling! Did I wake you?" Her voice, high and bright, could shatter glass even without the benefit of a telephone.

Bartholomew sighed, scrubbing sleep from his eyes. "No, Mother. I was just about toâ€¦ jog." A blatant lie, but one he hoped would buy him a little peace.

"Wonderful! Then you'll be perfectly refreshed for the Sotheby's auction this afternoon! The Van Derlyn family portrait is finally being sold, and you know how much your Aunt Millicent admired it! It simply must stay in the family!"

Bartholomew pinched the bridge of his nose. This was going to be a long day.

**Setting:**

Bartholomew Jonathan Featherstone IV resided in a sprawling, albeit slightly sterile, penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. His design aesthetic, if one could call it that, leaned heavily towards "expensive but soulless." Gleaming white walls were adorned with abstract art he didn't understand but knew was "important." The furniture, mostly Italian leather and chrome, looked pristine enough to belong in a showroom. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a testament to his rarely-used cleaning service. The only real sign of life was a meticulously organized bar stocked with rare single-malt scotches and a collection of antique crystal glasses, evidence of Bartholomew's preference for liquid assets over, well, practically anything else. From his balcony, on a clear day, one could see the iconic skyscrapers of Wall Street, a constant reminder of the world he dominated, and the anxieties that came with it. It was a place of privilege, of calculated risks and even more calculated displays of wealth. It was, in short, everything Bartholomew had worked for, and sometimes, it felt like a gilded cage.
