The clock on the wall of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom, a relic of the Cold War era with faded numerals and a stubborn tick, was mocking her. It read 3:17 PM. Another thirteen minutes. Thirteen more minutes of forced patience while her class of sophomores slowly, excruciatingly, completed their assigned paragraphs on the symbolism of Gatsby’s green light. She leaned back in her squeaky, ergonomic chair, a gift from her husband, Mark, for surviving her fifth year at Northwood High.

Northwood High, nestled in the sleepy, oak-lined suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut, was a place of quiet privilege. The students were bright, mostly well-behaved, and overwhelmingly destined for Ivy League schools. Eleanor, however, often felt like she was treading water in a sea of cashmere sweaters and trust funds. She, the product of a blue-collar upbringing in a working-class town an hour south, felt a perpetual imposter syndrome, even after seven years of teaching English Literature within those hallowed, brick walls. The scent of old textbooks and floor wax permeated the air, a comforting if slightly melancholic aroma that spoke of generations of students who had passed through these very desks, grappling with Shakespeare and Salinger.
