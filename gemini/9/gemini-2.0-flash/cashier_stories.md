Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on our main character, a cashier:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of "Penny Pincher Pantry" hummed a monotonous tune that was, by now, an integral part of Bethany Grace Hawthorne's internal soundtrack.  Another Tuesday, another tsunami of expired coupons and questionable produce.  She scanned a carton of bruised peaches with a sigh that threatened to escape her lips like a trapped bird.  Mrs. Henderson was at the end of her checkout lane. Mrs. Henderson was *always* at the end of her checkout lane, a veritable harbinger of price checks and complaints about the "shrinkflation" of canned beans.  Bethany plastered on her best Customer Service Smile - the one that didn't quite reach her eyes - and prepared for battle.  This time, though, something was different. Mrs. Henderson's usual scowl was gone, replaced by a strange mixture of bewilderment and excitement. Instead of a mountain of groceries, she clutched a single, dusty bottle of something that looked vaguely alchemical, a cork sealed precariously with wax.

**Setting:**

Penny Pincher Pantry is a small, locally owned grocery store located in the slightly down-on-its-luck town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  It's the kind of place where the linoleum is perpetually sticky, the "fresh" produce often bears a suspicious resemblance to something that might be growing in a forgotten corner of your refrigerator, and the clientele consists primarily of retirees, struggling families, and the occasional college student looking for a cheap meal. The store is situated on the main drag, sandwiched between a laundromat that hasn't seen a fresh coat of paint since the 1970s and a pawn shop with a neon sign that flickers intermittently like a dying star.  Inside, the shelves are crammed with off-brand cereals, slightly dented canned goods, and a wide array of questionable-looking meats. The air always smells faintly of stale coffee and floor cleaner, a uniquely Penny Pincher Pantry aroma that Bethany has, unfortunately, grown accustomed to. The checkout lanes, of which there are only four (two usually closed), are equipped with ancient cash registers that often malfunction, spitting out receipts at random intervals and requiring a gentle, but firm, tap to coax them back into working order.
