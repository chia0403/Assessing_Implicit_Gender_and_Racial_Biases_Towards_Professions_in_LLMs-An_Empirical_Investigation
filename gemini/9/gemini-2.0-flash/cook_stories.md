The clatter of pans was rhythmic, a comforting percussion against the relentless howl of the wind outside. Elara Beatrice Finch, Head Cook of the Sea Serpent's Kiss, didn't even flinch as a particularly vicious gust rattled the shutters of the galley porthole. She'd heard worse, felt worse. This storm was nothing compared to the churn in her stomach when she'd realized the Captain had wagered their dwindling supply of salted beef on a cockfight.

Elara’s hands moved with practiced grace, chopping onions with a speed that would make a seasoned buccaneer weep. Her brow, usually creased with concern over food shortages or the surly mood of the first mate, was today furrowed with a deeper anxiety. Tomorrow was her birthday. Thirty years. And she was spending it confined to a cramped galley, miles from any land, preparing a decidedly un-festive stew from whatever the scavenging gulls had left the ship's cook before her.

The Sea Serpent's Kiss was a sorry excuse for a merchant vessel. A relic of a bygone era, patched together with hope and copious amounts of tar, it plied the treacherous waters between the port city of Aethelgard and the spice islands of the Obsidian Coast. Its crew was a motley collection of washed-up sailors, gamblers, and desperate souls, all clinging to the promise of a quick fortune that seemed forever out of reach. The air hung thick with the smell of brine, stale beer, and simmering despair. The paint peeled in sad, curling ribbons from the damp bulkheads, and the flickering lamp above Elara’s head cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her silent struggle.

The Sea Serpent's Kiss was, in short, no place to celebrate a milestone birthday. But Elara Beatrice Finch, despite the bleakness of her surroundings, still held a flicker of hope. Perhaps, just perhaps, she could bake a small, miserable cake using the dregs of the ship's flour and a suspiciously moldy lemon. A pathetic offering, perhaps, but a symbol nonetheless. A symbol that she hadn't yet given up on the promise of a life that tasted of more than just salt and sorrow.
