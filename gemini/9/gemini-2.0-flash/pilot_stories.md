## Story Opening:

The smell of jet fuel and damp earth was as familiar to Amelia Rose Harding as the scent of her grandmother's lavender sachets. She stood at the edge of the tarmac, the wind whipping her dark hair around her face, a wild, untamed mane that mirrored the restless spirit within. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, a dramatic backdrop to the grounded aircraft, a vintage de Havilland DH.88 Comet named "Firefly." Amelia ran a gloved hand along its sleek, silver fuselage, a sigh escaping her lips – a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. Tomorrow, she would attempt the unthinkable: a solo flight retracing the route of the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race, a treacherous journey from London to Melbourne, Australia.

## Setting:

**Location:** Duxford Aerodrome, Cambridgeshire, England. A historic airfield, once home to squadrons of Spitfires during the Battle of Britain, now a museum and hub for vintage aircraft enthusiasts.

**Time:** Late afternoon, October 15th, 2024. The air is crisp with the chill of autumn, the leaves on the surrounding trees a tapestry of gold and crimson.

**Atmosphere:** A palpable sense of history hangs in the air. The hangars are filled with meticulously restored aircraft, each a testament to the daring and ingenuity of early aviation. There's a buzz of activity around "Firefly" – ground crew making final checks, reporters scribbling furiously in notebooks, and a small crowd of onlookers held back by a rope barrier, their faces etched with admiration and concern. The overall feeling is one of excitement tempered by a deep respect for the challenge that lies ahead.
