The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Officer Isabella Rose Alvarez’s cheeks as she stared out at the churning grey water. It was the kind of late October day that made you question your life choices, especially if those choices involved standing patrol in a Chicago park at 3 AM. The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the sky, their leaves long gone, leaving behind a landscape both desolate and beautiful.

The glow of the distant city skyline was a comforting beacon in the inky blackness, but here, nestled in Lincoln Park’s shadowy heart, the only light came from the pale, almost mocking, streetlamps and the weak beam of her flashlight. She pulled her collar tighter, the leather creaking in protest, and listened. The only sounds were the wind, the rhythmic crash of waves against the breakwater, and the distant, mournful wail of a passing train.

Isabella sighed, the condensation forming a small cloud in the frigid air. It was her fifth year on the force, and while she loved the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of bringing criminals to justice, nights like these, nights filled with nothing but bone-chilling wind and the heavy weight of solitude, tested her resolve. Tonight felt different, though. An unsettling hum, a prickling at the back of her neck, suggested she wasn't alone. Not alone at all.
