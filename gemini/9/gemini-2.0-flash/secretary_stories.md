## Story Opening:

The clatter of Mrs. Periwinkle's ancient typewriter echoed through the office, a percussive counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. Agnus Dei played softly on the radio, a stark contrast to the seedy nature of the files scattered across Agnes Beatrice Miller's desk. Divorce settlements, blackmail schemes, and whispers of corporate espionage - all in a day's work for the secretary of "Silas Blackwood Investigations," a firm known for its discretion and, Agnes suspected, a little more. 

Agnes sighed, the weight of the confidential files pressing down on her like a physical burden. She longed for the days when she dreamed of becoming a librarian, surrounded by the hushed reverence of knowledge, not the grubby secrets of morally bankrupt businessmen. But the war had changed everything, and a girl needed a job.

## Setting:

The story is set in 1947, in the dimly lit, slightly dilapidated office of Silas Blackwood Investigations, located on the second floor of a nondescript building in the heart of smoky London. The office is a study in organized chaos. Files are stacked precariously on shelves that threaten to buckle under the weight. The air is thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke and cheap coffee. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grime-covered windows, casting long, melancholic shadows across the room. The decor is strictly utilitarian, comprised of heavy oak furniture and a threadbare rug that has seen better days. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation, a feeling that hangs heavy in the air, mirroring the anxieties of a city still recovering from the devastation of war.
