The insistent chirping of her phone shattered the quiet dawn, slicing through the comfortable pre-coffee fog in Eleanor Rose Cavendish's brain. She groaned, batting blindly at the nightstand until her fingers fumbled across the cool glass surface. The screen glared accusingly, displaying a message from her work. "Urgent - need OT coverage at Sunny Meadows. Overflowing with patients. Can you come in early?"

Eleanor groaned again, this time louder. Sunny Meadows Rehabilitation Center. It wasn't her primary location; she usually worked with children with developmental delays at the pediatric clinic downtown. Sunny Meadows was all geriatric patients, most recovering from strokes or surgeries, desperately trying to regain their independence. While she respected the work and understood its importance, the slow, deliberate pace, the constant reminders of mortality, were… challenging. Especially before 7 AM.

Eleanor reluctantly swung her legs out of bed. The floral wallpaper in her small, sun-drenched bedroom, normally cheerful, seemed to mock her current lack of enthusiasm. Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, illuminating the carefully arranged collection of seashells on her windowsill – memories of happier, sunnier days. A half-finished cross-stitch project lay abandoned on the bedside table, depicting a vibrant hummingbird hovering near a fuchsia flower. Eleanor sighed. It was a scene that felt a million miles away from the linoleum floors and institutional smell of Sunny Meadows. Today, she traded hummingbirds for hip replacements, and fuchsia for physiotherapy. At least the patients were grateful.
