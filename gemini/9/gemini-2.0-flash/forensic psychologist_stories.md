## The Story Opening:

The air in the interview room was thick with stale coffee and unspoken accusation. Dr. Evelyn Reed, a forensic psychologist with a reputation for cutting through bullshit like a hot knife through butter, leaned back in her chair, her gaze steady and unwavering on the man sitting across from her. His name was Marcus Thorne, and he radiated nervous energy, his hands fidgeting with the threadbare edge of the chair's vinyl seat. He was handsome, too, in a rugged, brooding sort of way, but Evelyn wasn't fooled by charm. She’d seen too many smooth operators hide behind carefully constructed facades.

"Mr. Thorne," Evelyn began, her voice calm and measured, a deliberate contrast to his palpable anxiety. "You understand that this assessment is a standard procedure in light of the circumstances."

He swallowed hard, the movement prominent in his throat. "Yes, Dr. Reed. I understand." His voice was a low rumble, almost hesitant.

"And those circumstances being," she pressed, drawing out the words slightly, "the discovery of your wife, Amelia, dead at the base of the cliffside overlooking the Blackwood Cove?"

A tremor ran through him, visible even under the harsh fluorescent lights. Evelyn held his gaze, waiting. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the hum of the ventilation system.  He finally met her eyes, his own dark with a pain that could be genuine… or meticulously rehearsed.

"An accident," he whispered. "It was just a terrible accident."

Evelyn knew the truth was buried somewhere beneath those carefully chosen words. Her job was to unearth it.

## The Setting:

**The Blackwood Correctional Facility, Mental Health Services Unit, Blackwood, Maine:**

The Blackwood Correctional Facility was a sprawling complex on the outskirts of a small, isolated town, surrounded by dense forests and the unforgiving Atlantic coastline. The Mental Health Services Unit was a separate, relatively modern wing of the facility, designed to house inmates with mental health needs and to provide a secure environment for psychological assessments and therapy sessions.  The building itself was sterile and utilitarian, constructed of cinder block and reinforced steel. The hallways were perpetually dim, lit by flickering fluorescent lights that cast long, unsettling shadows. The air was always slightly damp, carrying the scent of disinfectant and despair. The relentless sound of slamming cell doors and echoing voices provided a constant, oppressive backdrop.

Dr. Evelyn Reed’s office, small and sparsely furnished, offered little reprieve from the overall atmosphere.  A worn desk dominated the space, cluttered with case files and reports. A single, framed photograph of her daughter, Lily, perched precariously on the edge of the desk, a splash of vibrant color in the otherwise monochrome environment. The only window, too high to see out of, offered a sliver of grey sky, a constant reminder of the bleakness outside.  It was a place designed to extract information, to break down defenses, and to expose the darkest corners of the human psyche. And that was exactly why Dr. Evelyn Reed worked there.
