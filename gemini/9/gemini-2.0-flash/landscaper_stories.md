The early morning air hung thick and humid, clinging to the dew-soaked blades of grass like a persistent lover. Bartholomew Ulysses Finch, affectionately known as “Bart” by pretty much everyone who didn't want to trip over his tongue trying to pronounce his full moniker, squinted at the sprawling lawn before him. The sun hadn’t quite crested the horizon yet, but the sky was bleeding shades of bruised purple and optimistic orange, painting the manicured estate in an ethereal glow.

He was standing at the wrought-iron gates of Greywood Manor, a testament to old money and even older grudges. Bart had been landscaping for Mrs. Penelope Hawthorne, the manor's sole inhabitant, for the past five years, ever since her husband, the infamous shipping tycoon, passed away, leaving her with nothing but a fortune and a garden the size of a small village. Greywood was a place of stark contrasts: meticulously sculpted topiary nestled beside wild, overgrown patches, reflecting, Bart suspected, the complexities of Mrs. Hawthorne herself.

He inhaled the earthy scent of the soil, mixed with the sweet fragrance of roses and the slightly bitter aroma of boxwood. This was his canvas, his domain, where he could bring order to chaos, and beauty to the mundane. Today's task: tame the rose bushes that threatened to engulf the entire south-facing facade of the manor. He sighed, a small plume of condensation forming in the cool morning air. It was going to be a long day. Mrs. Hawthorne, as always, would be watching.
