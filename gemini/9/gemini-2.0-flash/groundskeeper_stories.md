Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper named Arthur Finch:

**Setting:**

The year is 1938. The place is Blackwood Estate, a sprawling, gothic revival mansion perched precariously on the cliffs of the Cornish coast in England. Blackwood had once been the pride of the area, home to generations of the wealthy Blackwood family. But now, the family is all but gone, save for a reclusive, aging matriarch who rarely leaves her darkened room. The estate itself has fallen into a state of genteel decay. While the house still stands imposing, the once manicured gardens are slowly being reclaimed by the wild Cornish landscape. Salt spray whips across the terraces, and the air is thick with the scent of sea and damp earth. Hidden paths wind through overgrown rhododendron bushes, and the stone statues stand cloaked in moss, their faces weathered by time and sea wind. The estate, as a whole, feels trapped in a perpetual state of twilight.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur Finch, a stooped man of sixty with hands gnarled like the roots of an ancient oak, straightened his back with a groan that echoed the lonely cry of a gull overhead. The salt-laced wind tugged at the brim of his tweed cap, threatening to snatch it into the churning grey sea below. He clutched the handle of his spade tighter, the familiar weight a small comfort in the face of the encroaching storm. Arthur had been the groundskeeper of Blackwood Estate for over thirty years, ever since he was a boy, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather before him. He knew every inch of this land, every twisted branch of the wind-battered trees, every hidden hollow where wildflowers stubbornly bloomed. He'd always considered it a place of beauty, even in its present state of decline.

But lately, a darkness had settled over Blackwood, deeper than the gloom of the perpetual Cornish weather. It wasn’t just the creeping weeds and the crumbling stonework. It was something else… something Arthur couldn’t quite name, but could feel settling in his bones. He'd been hearing whispers, carried on the wind perhaps, or maybe just the ramblings of an old man. Whispers of ancient pacts, of restless spirits, and of a secret buried deep within the heart of Blackwood. Arthur Finch had always dismissed such tales as folklore, the stuff of old wives and superstitious fishermen. But lately, the whispers felt… real. And he was beginning to fear that he was the only one left to listen.
