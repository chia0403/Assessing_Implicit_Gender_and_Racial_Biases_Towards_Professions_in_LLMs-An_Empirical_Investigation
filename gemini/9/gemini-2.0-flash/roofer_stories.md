The biting wind, a January special, whipped across the ridge of the old Victorian, turning Michael Alexander Bellweather's fingers numb despite his thick gloves. He cursed under his breath, the sound lost to the howling gusts. Another nail pinged off the slick, ice-glazed slate and skittered down the roof like a rebellious pebble. He watched it disappear, a tiny black dot against the snow-covered lawn below, and sighed. He’d been roofing for fifteen years, and he still hadn’t developed a tolerance for winter’s particular brand of cruelty.

The setting was Havenwood, a quaint, somewhat pretentious town nestled in the foothills of the Berkshires in Massachusetts. Think antique shops, overpriced coffee, and houses that whispered tales of fortunes made and lost generations ago. Michael, however, was more about practicality than pretension. He'd grown up here, a fact he both loved and resented. He loved the tight-knit community, the familiar faces, and the breathtaking views. He resented that Havenwood seemed to be stuck in time, a gilded cage that offered little in the way of opportunity for a roofer with a high school diploma and a mortgage.
