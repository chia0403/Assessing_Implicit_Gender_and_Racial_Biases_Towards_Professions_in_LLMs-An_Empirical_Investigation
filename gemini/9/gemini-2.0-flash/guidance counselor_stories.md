## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of McKinley High hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a song Amelia Jane Harding knew intimately. It was a song of teenage anxieties, parental pressures, and the ever-present, looming dread of the future. This particular Monday morning, the song was amplified by the persistent thrumming in Amelia's own temples. She blamed the three cups of lukewarm, institutional coffee she’d already consumed, and the fact that Sarah Miller, a bright but intensely nervous sophomore, was currently parked in the chair across from her, silently weeping into a crumpled tissue.

Amelia smoothed the already pristine surface of her desk, a reflex learned over a decade of navigating adolescent storms. "Sarah," she said gently, her voice calm and soothing, "Take your time. Just tell me what's on your mind."

Sarah hiccuped, her shoulders shaking. "I... I don't know what to do, Ms. Harding. Everything is... overwhelming."

Amelia smiled, a practiced but genuine expression of empathy. "That's okay. Overwhelming is something we can work with. Let's start with one small thing." She reached for the box of tissues on her desk, adorned with a cheerful cartoon of a graduating cap and a stack of textbooks, a small island of optimism in the sea of teenage despair. “Now, tell me about this Calculus test tomorrow…”

## Setting:

The guidance counselor's office at McKinley High was a small, square room, attempting to inject a sense of calm into the frenetic energy of the school. The walls were painted a soothing pale blue, and posters displaying motivational quotes – "Dream Big," "Believe in Yourself," "The Future is Yours" – were strategically placed to catch the eye.

Amelia's desk, an ancient behemoth of scarred oak, dominated one side of the room. It was meticulously organized, a testament to her need for control in a world often spiraling into chaos. Stacks of pamphlets on college applications, scholarship opportunities, and mental health resources were neatly arranged in trays. On the wall behind her hung framed certificates of her degrees and professional development, subtle reassurances of her qualifications.

Opposite the desk were two comfortable, mismatched chairs, softened by colorful throw pillows. A small bookshelf lined with well-worn copies of self-help books, career guides, and college catalogs completed the picture. The overall effect was a deliberate attempt to create a safe and welcoming space, a sanctuary amidst the storm of lockers slamming, bells ringing, and teenage drama that raged just outside the door. But even here, the faint scent of disinfectant and the relentless hum of the fluorescent lights served as constant reminders that this was, ultimately, still a school.
