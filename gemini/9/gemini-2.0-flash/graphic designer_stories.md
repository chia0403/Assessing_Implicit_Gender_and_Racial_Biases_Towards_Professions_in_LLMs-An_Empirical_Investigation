## Story Opening:

The chipped, enamel mug warmed Amelia "Millie" Rosewood's hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window. Another Tuesday, another deluge. Just the kind of weather that made her crave comfort and avoid anything resembling actual work. But comfort wasn't paying the rent, and avoiding work meant staring at the dauntingly blank screen of her iMac.

Millie sighed, the steam from her Earl Grey misting her glasses. She knew the deadline loomed large: finalize the branding package for "Pawsitive Vibes," a new dog-walking and grooming service. Cute, fluffy, and guaranteed to be a hit. Except, Millie’s creative well felt drier than a week-old dog biscuit.

She took a long sip, the lukewarm tea doing little to ignite the spark she desperately needed. The truth was, Millie felt adrift. The passion that had driven her through art school, the thrill of crafting a brand identity from scratch, felt like a distant memory. Lately, everything she designed felt…generic. Forced. Like she was just going through the motions.

Maybe, she thought with a grimace, it was time to seriously consider that offer from her uncle to join the family plumbing business. At least there, the creativity wouldn’t be judged on its aesthetic appeal. It would be judged on whether it kept people from being knee-deep in sewage.

## Setting:

Millie's apartment was a small, one-bedroom in the vibrant but increasingly gentrified neighbourhood of Fishtown, Philadelphia. The exposed brick walls were adorned with a chaotic mix of her own illustrations - bold, abstract patterns and quirky character designs - alongside framed prints of classic mid-century modern posters. The space was filled with a comfortable disarray: overflowing bookshelves, stacks of art supplies, and a perpetually tangled web of charging cables. Sunlight, when it actually dared to grace Philadelphia with its presence, would flood the room, highlighting the bright, primary colours that Millie favoured. But today, the oppressive grey of the sky bled into every corner, casting long, melancholic shadows across her drafting table. In the background, the muffled sounds of city traffic, perpetually punctuated by the bleating horns of impatient drivers, served as a constant, low-level hum that usually fueled Millie's creativity, but today only amplified her sense of isolation.
