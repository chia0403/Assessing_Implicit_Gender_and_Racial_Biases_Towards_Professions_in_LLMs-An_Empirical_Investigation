## Story Opening:

The air in the smoky, velvet-draped back room of The Velvet Nightingale was thick enough to chew. Cigarette smoke swirled under the single, dim bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, painting dancing shadows on the faces gathered around the low table. Laughter, fueled by cheap whiskey and raw ambition, punctuated the tense silence. Tonight was make-or-break night for many of them, and the tension was palpable. Tonight, they all auditioned for "The Serpent's Kiss," a notorious touring cabaret known for its scandalous reputation and its star-making power. 

Across the room, fidgeting with the frayed hem of her emerald green dress, stood Seraphina Eloise Bellweather. She took a deep breath, the scent of stale beer and desperation doing little to calm her racing heart. Her turn was next.

## Setting:

**The Velvet Nightingale**, a seedy speakeasy tucked away on a forgotten side street in 1940s New Orleans. The walls are painted a dark, almost bruised purple, offset by heavy, velvet curtains that attempt (and fail) to muffle the raucous sounds of the main bar. The air is always thick with the aroma of cheap liquor, cigarette smoke, and the faint, lingering scent of patchouli. The tables are small and rickety, covered with worn tablecloths stained with countless spills. A single, bare stage sits in the corner, usually occupied by a blues band or a burlesque dancer. The entire place feels like a secret, a place where dreams are both born and shattered. It's a place where Seraphina hopes to finally find her voice.
