The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Thorne's hands, its floral design worn almost smooth from years of constant use. Outside, the relentless Scottish rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of her cottage, blurring the already indistinct outline of the Loch Ness beyond. "Another day, another deluge," she muttered, the steam from the Earl Grey tea momentarily fogging her spectacles. Amelia, a writer of whimsical children’s stories under the pen name "A.B. Thorne," found it increasingly difficult to summon the joy required to create tales of dancing hedgehogs and singing sunflowers when the world outside her cozy haven seemed perpetually draped in shades of grey.

Her writing cottage, "The Scribbler's Nook," was a testament to her love of stories. Overflowing bookshelves lined the walls, threatening to topple over with first editions, tattered paperbacks, and manuscripts in varying stages of completion. Stacks of research books sat precariously balanced on antique furniture, vying for space with piles of discarded drafts and half-eaten biscuits. A worn, velvet armchair sat nestled in the corner, bathed in the soft glow of a Tiffany lamp, its cushions permanently imprinted with the shape of her favourite writing spot. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, lavender potpourri, and the faint, lingering aroma of pipe tobacco – a ghost of her late grandfather, who had gifted her this very cottage and instilled in her a love for the power of words. Nessie’s watery legend might have been the source of local folklore, but for Amelia Beatrice Thorne, *this* cottage was the stuff of her own, very real, stories.
