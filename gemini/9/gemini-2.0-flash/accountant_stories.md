The fluorescent lights of Bloom & Bradshaw hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew Quentin’s life. He’d come to find it almost comforting, a steady pulse against the silent chaos of spreadsheets. Outside, the late afternoon sky bled a bruised purple against the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago, but here, on the 27th floor, the only light that mattered was the pale, artificial glow that illuminated his meticulously organized cubicle.

It was the end of a long Tuesday, and his eyes felt gritty, as if he'd been staring directly into the sun, not just at the relentless stream of numbers scrolling across his dual monitors. He had just finished reconciling the accounts for a particularly difficult client – a trendy restaurant known for its questionable expense reports and a penchant for claiming artisanal cheese graters as "essential kitchen equipment" – and the tension in his shoulders was finally beginning to ease. He reached for his lukewarm mug of Earl Grey tea, the aroma a faint, floral counterpoint to the sterile air of the office.
