## Story Opening:

The ledger lay open before Eleanor Astrid Finch, its crisp, cream pages illuminated by the soft glow of her desk lamp. Outside, the incessant Birmingham rain drummed a melancholic rhythm against the windowpanes of "Finch & Finch, Purveyors of Fine Wools & Sundries," the family business she had reluctantly inherited. Usually, the neat columns of figures soothed her, a comforting order in a chaotic world. Tonight, however, they felt like bars on a cage. 

A sigh escaped Eleanor's lips, misting briefly in the cold air. She was stuck. Not just with balancing the books for a business that, let's be honest, wasn't exactly setting the world on fire, but also with the suffocating weight of expectation that came with the Finch name. Grandmother Finch, bless her cotton socks (and she had plenty, considering the wool business), had always envisioned Eleanor taking over, marrying a nice, sensible man, and producing a new generation of Finch wool purveyors.

Instead, Eleanor dreamed of something entirely different. Something more... dangerous. Something that didn't involve painstakingly recording the fluctuating price of merino. She glanced at the newspaper tucked beneath her ledger. A headline screamed: "Eminent Professor Vanishes! Search Intensifies!" A thrill, sharp and forbidden, ran through her. Professor Alistair Pembroke, a man sheâ€™d only ever read about, was gone. And for some reason, deep down, Eleanor felt like the ledger, and the rain, and the wool, were all suddenly less important. A single drop of ink, blotting a carefully calculated figure, seemed to agree.

## Setting:

The story takes place in **Birmingham, England, in the late autumn of 1938.** 

**Finch & Finch, Purveyors of Fine Wools & Sundries,** is located on a quiet street in a slightly fading, but still respectable, neighbourhood. The shop itself is a classic example of Edwardian architecture, with a large, plate-glass window displaying skeins of brightly coloured wool, knitting needles, and various haberdashery items. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of lanolin and mothballs. Dark wooden shelves line the walls, stacked high with bolts of fabric and carefully organized bins of buttons. A narrow counter separates the sales area from a small, cluttered office at the back, where Eleanor spends most of her time poring over ledgers and invoices.

The atmosphere is one of quiet, almost melancholic, respectability. The Finch family has been running the business for generations, and while it's not thriving, it provides a comfortable, if somewhat stifling, existence for Eleanor. The looming threat of war, barely whispered in polite society, hangs heavy in the air, adding to the sense of unease and the feeling that everything is about to change.
