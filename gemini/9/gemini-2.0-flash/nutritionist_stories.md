## Story Opening:

The aroma of roasting garlic and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, faintly antiseptic scent clinging to Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Thorne like a second skin after a long day at the clinic. She sighed, loosening the top button of her crisp, white blouse. Even after ten years of advising people on the transformative power of food, Evelyn sometimes felt like she was operating from the outside, a conductor leading an orchestra she couldn't quite hear.

Tonight, however, was for her.

## Setting:

Evelyn stood in the galley kitchen of her narrow, three-story townhouse in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. Exposed brick walls, remnants of its original 19th-century construction, were painted a calming shade of celadon green. Stainless steel appliances gleamed under the soft glow of pendant lights hanging over a butcher block island, currently serving as a temporary landing zone for a haphazard stack of cookbooks, a half-empty glass of red wine, and a scattering of chopped vegetables. Through the window, barely visible past the delicate, wrought-iron fire escape, the gaslights of Charles Street flickered, casting dancing shadows across the cobblestone. It was a cozy, almost claustrophobic space, reflecting Evelynâ€™s own meticulous nature and the quiet, contained life she had built for herself within the bustling city.
