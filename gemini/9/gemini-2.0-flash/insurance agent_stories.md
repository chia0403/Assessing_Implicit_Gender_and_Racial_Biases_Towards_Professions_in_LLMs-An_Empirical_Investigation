Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing our insurance agent protagonist:

**Setting:** The muggy, late-August air hung heavy over the small town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The kind of heat that made the cicadas scream incessantly and pavement ripple like liquid. Dust devils, born of the dry cornfields surrounding the town, danced on Main Street, kicking up grit and forgotten dreams. Harmony Creek was a place where time moved at a glacial pace, where gossip was the town’s primary industry, and where everyone knew everyone else's business – and their insurance provider.

**Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air inside "Good Hands Insurance," the only insurance agency in Harmony Creek. Mildred Periwinkle, a woman whose wrinkles told stories that her voice never would, was arguing, again, about her prize-winning zucchini and hail damage. "But Mr. Henderson," she wailed, her voice cracking, "it was a *champion* zucchini! My Agnes wouldn't have stood a chance without her zucchini shield! Are you saying a measly hundred dollars covers years of dedicated zucchini care?"

**Barnaby Finch," sighed, running a weary hand through his thinning brown hair. His full name was Barnaby Finch, and at 38 years old, he felt about 78. "Mrs. Periwinkle, as we've discussed, your policy covers actual cash value after depreciation...""** He leaned back in his creaky swivel chair, the springs groaning in protest. He was an insurance agent, not a zucchini appraiser, yet somehow, his days were filled with more horticultural debates than actuarial calculations. Today, he was sure of it, his day was going to be a bad one, and Mildred Periwinkle and her zucchini were only the opening act.
