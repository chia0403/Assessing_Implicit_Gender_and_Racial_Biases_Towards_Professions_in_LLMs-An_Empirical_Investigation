## The Dust Speaks

**Setting:** Harmony Valley, Oklahoma, 1935. The valley, once verdant and aptly named, now lay choked with the fine, red dust that seemed to seep into everything - skin, lungs, dreams. The houses, once gleaming white farmhouses, were now stained terracotta, their windows squinting against the perpetual glare of the sun reflecting off the endless, barren fields. The once proud, fertile land was scarred with deep gullies, testament to the relentless wind and the years of drought. A lone, skeletal windmill groaned in the distance, a mournful siren song in the oppressive silence.

**Opening:**

The dust spoke to Jeremiah Silas Hawkins in the low, whispering tones he’d grown to recognize. It rasped against the dry stalks of the few scraggly wheat plants clinging desperately to life in his field, a litany of despair. He ran a calloused hand over the brittle heads, feeling the grit embed itself deeper in the lines of his palm, lines that once promised a bountiful harvest, a thriving family, a future. Now, they spoke only of failure.

Jeremiah Silas Hawkins, a man weathered by sun and worry, knelt amidst the desolation, his eyes, the color of faded denim, scanning the horizon. Not for rain, he no longer held that naive hope. He was looking for the telltale plume of dust signaling another family fleeing Harmony Valley, another piece of his past crumbling away into the red abyss. He could practically taste the dust, a metallic, bitter tang that coated his tongue and fueled his growing anger. He was damned if he’d let it win. He was damned if he’d let the dust speak the final word.
