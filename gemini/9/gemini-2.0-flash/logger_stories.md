Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and introducing our logger, Finnigan "Finn" O'Malley:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped through the towering pines of the Olympic National Forest, a vast expanse of green and grey clinging to the western slopes of Washington State's mountains. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and woodsmoke, held a bone-deep chill that promised a harsh winter. The ground underfoot was a treacherous mix of frozen mud, slick moss-covered logs, and deep snowdrifts already starting to accumulate in the shadows. Above, a bruised purple sky threatened more of the white stuff.

**Opening:**

Finnigan "Finn" O'Malley, a man built like a felled oak himself, braced his boots against the slick log, his breath puffing out in white clouds. The chainsaw, a roaring beast in his capable hands, whined as it chewed its way through the thick trunk of a Douglas Fir, a giant that had stood for over two centuries. Sawdust flew, stinging his cheeks and sticking to the thick, wool knit cap pulled low over his brow. Finn ignored it. His focus was laser sharp, each movement precise and deliberate. He knew these woods like the back of his hand, knew the way the wind shifted, the way the snow settled, the way the old trees groaned before they surrendered. Today, though, something felt… different. A prickling unease that ran deeper than the cold, a feeling that the forest was watching him, not with its usual indifferent gaze, but with something akin to… expectation. He shook his head, blaming it on the long hours and the encroaching winter. Superstition had no place in logging, but the feeling lingered, a cold knot in the pit of his stomach.
