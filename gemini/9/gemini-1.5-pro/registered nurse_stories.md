The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s ankles as she hurried across the sprawling parking lot of St. Jude’s Memorial Hospital.  The fluorescent lights of the ER entrance glowed a sickly yellow against the pre-dawn gloom, promising another long shift.  St. Jude’s, perched precariously on the edge of the Lake Superior shoreline in Duluth, Minnesota, was a fortress against the harsh elements, a beacon of hope in a landscape often dominated by snow and ice.  Tonight, however, the storm brewing within the hospital walls felt far more ominous than anything nature could conjure.  Amelia pulled her ID badge from beneath her thick wool coat, the plastic cold against her fingers, and swiped it at the entrance.  The familiar beep granted her access, and she stepped inside, the blast of antiseptic-laced air a stark contrast to the biting wind she’d just escaped. The cacophony of beeping monitors, hurried footsteps, and hushed conversations enveloped her, a soundtrack to a night she already knew would be anything but ordinary.
