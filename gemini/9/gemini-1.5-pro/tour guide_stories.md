The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes.  Agnes Periwinkle, clad in a vibrant teal shirt emblazoned with "Aloha ʻĀina Tours," squinted at the cloud of volcanic smog drifting lazily from Kilauea's summit.  Her trusty microphone, affectionately nicknamed "Millie," was clutched in her hand like a lifeline, its cord wrapped around her wrist twice for extra security.  Around her, a gaggle of tourists, ranging from sunburnt Midwesterners in khaki shorts to pale, camera-toting Europeans, shifted impatiently under the shade of a giant banyan tree just outside Volcanoes National Park's visitor center. Agnes had a feeling this particular tour, the "Lava Love Affair" sunset special, was going to be…interesting.
