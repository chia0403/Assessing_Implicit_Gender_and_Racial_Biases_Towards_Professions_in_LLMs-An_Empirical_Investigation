The humid Miami air hung heavy, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a damp towel.  Sunrise painted the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay a shimmering coral, but Amy barely noticed.  Her focus was laser-sharp on the tangle of resistance bands strewn across the weathered wooden deck of the outdoor yoga studio.  "Sunrise Salute" was her most popular class at the exclusive Solara Wellness Retreat, and Amy, despite the pre-dawn hour, was already buzzing with energy.  Salt air mingled with the scent of hibiscus and sunscreen as the first of her devotees, clad in designer athleisure wear, began to arrive, their yoga mats tucked under their arms. This was Amy's sanctuary, a place where the anxieties of Miami's high-powered elite melted away with each carefully guided sun salutation.  But the serene facade of Solara, and of Amy herself, was about to be shattered.
