The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Drakonian Peaks, carrying with it the scent of pine and the ghostly whisper of crumbling granite.  The sky, a bruised purple, threatened snow.  Nestled precariously against the cliff face, a small, smoke-blackened forge clung to existence, its orange glow a defiant spark against the encroaching twilight. Inside, Elias Thorne, his hands calloused and scarred, meticulously chipped away at a block of obsidian, the rhythmic clang of his hammer echoing through the mountain valley.  Each strike was precise, measured, a testament to years spent coaxing beauty from unforgiving stone.  He wasn't merely a stone cutter; Elias was a sculptor of dreams, breathing life into the cold, unyielding heart of the mountain.  Tonight, however, his usual calm focus was replaced by a gnawing unease. The wind carried more than just the scent of pine; it carried a premonition of change, a whisper of something ancient and unsettling stirring within the depths of the Drakonian Peaks.
