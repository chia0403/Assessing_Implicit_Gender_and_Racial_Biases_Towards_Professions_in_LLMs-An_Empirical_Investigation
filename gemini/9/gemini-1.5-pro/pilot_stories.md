The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Captain Evelyn “Evie” Rousseau’s parka as she prepped her de Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  Glacier-carved peaks, dusted with fresh snow, loomed over the tiny airstrip carved out of the wilderness beside Lake Clark.  The pre-dawn sky, a bruised canvas of deep purples and inky blues, promised another frigid day in the Alaskan bush.  The only sounds were the rhythmic whirring of the Beaver’s propeller as Evie ran through her pre-flight checks and the distant howl of a sled dog, a lonely cry echoing through the crisp air.  This was Evie's office – a vast, untamed expanse of frozen lakes, dense spruce forests, and treacherous mountain passes.  Today's mission: deliver vital supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the Katmai National Park, a place accessible only by air.  Evie adjusted her fur-lined hood and climbed into the cockpit, the familiar smell of aviation fuel and worn leather a comforting welcome. This was where she belonged, on the edge of civilization, with the sky as her only companion.
