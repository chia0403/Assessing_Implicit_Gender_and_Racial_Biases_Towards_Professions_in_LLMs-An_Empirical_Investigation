The insistent chirping of a malfunctioning fluorescent light was the soundtrack to Elara Vance's Tuesday. It buzzed and flickered above her head, casting an erratic strobe light effect across the polished mahogany reception desk of Veritas Investments.  Elara, perched on her ergonomic chair, ignored it as best she could, focusing instead on the intricate knot she was tying in the corner of a client brochure. Outside, the relentless London drizzle plastered the windows with a sheet of grey, blurring the sharp lines of the skyscrapers that clawed at the overcast sky.  The air inside the pristine, minimalist lobby was thick with the scent of expensive coffee and the faint, metallic tang of impending rain. Veritas occupied the entire 37th floor, a testament to its success in a city teeming with financial ambition.  At 8:57 am, three minutes before the official start of the workday, Elara straightened a stack of perfectly aligned business cards, preparing for the onslaught of calls, appointments, and the occasional misplaced millionaire.
