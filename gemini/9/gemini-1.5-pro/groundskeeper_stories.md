The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, scattering crimson and gold leaves across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor.  Frost crunched beneath Elias Thorne's boots as he made his rounds, a thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in his gloved hand. The manor, a sprawling Victorian behemoth of grey stone and leaded glass, loomed against the bruised twilight sky.  For twenty years, Elias had been its sole groundskeeper, intimately familiar with every dip and curve of the land, every gnarled root and hidden bloom. He knew the secrets the gardens whispered in the changing seasons, the stories etched in the stone walls, and the unsettling quiet that clung to the place like a shroud. This evening, however, a different kind of silence held the air, a preternatural stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck.  It was the kind of silence that preceded a storm, or perhaps something far worse.
