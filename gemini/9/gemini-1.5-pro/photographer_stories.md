The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she crouched low, her breath misting in the pre-dawn air. The salt spray from the churning Atlantic stung her cheeks, a familiar discomfort she barely registered anymore.

Before her, the sky above the jagged cliffs of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands, was beginning to bleed color.  A bruised purple gave way to streaks of fiery orange and rose, illuminating the ancient Dún Aonghasa fort perched precariously on the cliff edge. Mia had been chasing this sunrise for three days, battling unpredictable Irish weather and the relentless, gnawing doubt that plagues every artist. Today, finally, the elements seemed to be cooperating.  This was the shot, the one that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of the island and, she hoped, launch her career.
