The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed like trapped wasps, a fitting soundtrack to the simmering chaos of registration day. Amelia Hayes, the school's guidance counselor, sat behind a mountain of paperwork, her office a small, cluttered oasis in the storm.  Sunlight, strained through the grime on the window, cast dusty stripes across the worn carpet. Outside, the echoing hallway buzzed with the nervous energy of students navigating new schedules and the boisterous greetings of friends reunited after a long summer. Amelia took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar scent of old textbooks and floor wax, a fragrance she both loathed and, oddly, found comforting. This was her battlefield, her domain, where dreams were nurtured, anxieties soothed, and futures, however tentatively, forged. Today, however, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a premonition that this year, the usual controlled chaos was about to give way to something far moreâ€¦ unpredictable.
