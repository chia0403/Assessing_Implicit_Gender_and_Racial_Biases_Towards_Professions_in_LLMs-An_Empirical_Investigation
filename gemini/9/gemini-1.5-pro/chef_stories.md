The Salty Spoon, nestled in the tiny, forgotten town of Port Blossom, Washington, was Eleanor's inheritance from her eccentric Aunt Millie, a woman whose culinary repertoire had consisted primarily of canned peaches and instant noodles.  Eleanor, trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, had initially viewed the diner as a temporary setback, a stepping stone back to the Michelin-starred world she craved.  But Port Blossom, with its quirky inhabitants and breathtaking sunsets, had a way of sinking its hooks into you.  And now, three years later, Eleanor found herself more at home amongst the chipped mugs and checkered tablecloths than she ever had amidst the pristine white linen of Parisian restaurants.  This morning, however, felt different.  A storm was brewing, both outside and in.
