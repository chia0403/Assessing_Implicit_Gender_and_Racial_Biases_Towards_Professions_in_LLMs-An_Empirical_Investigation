Loose sketches of fantastical creatures and swirling Art Nouveau lettering littered the oak drafting table, illuminated by the warm glow of a vintage banker's lamp.

Amy, bundled in an oversized charcoal grey cardigan despite the stifling summer humidity, chewed on the end of her pen, staring at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen.  The deadline for the rebranding of the Prague National Theatre loomed like a gothic gargoyle, and her creative well had run inexplicably dry.  The usually vibrant cityscape visible through her attic window was shrouded in a misty grey, mirroring the fog in her mind.
