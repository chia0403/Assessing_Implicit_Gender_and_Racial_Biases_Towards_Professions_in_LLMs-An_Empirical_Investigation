The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the cobblestone streets of Port Blossom, Maine.  The tang of salt air mixed with the wood smoke curling from chimneys lining the harbor, a familiar and comforting scent that usually soothed Elias. Not today. Today, the wind felt like icy fingers clutching at him, mirroring the icy dread clenching his gut.  The quaint, brightly-painted storefronts of the seaside town, usually bustling with tourists even in the late autumn, were shuttered against the approaching storm.  Elias pulled his thick wool coat tighter around him, the collar scratching against the stubble of his beard. He hurried past the darkened windows of "The Salty Siren" pub, its warm, inviting glow extinguished for the first time in his memory. Something was wrong in Port Blossom, terribly wrong, and Elias, the town's only veterinarian, felt it down to his bones.
