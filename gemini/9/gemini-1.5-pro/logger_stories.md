The biting November wind howled down from Mount Katahdin, whipping snow devils across the frozen surface of Chesuncook Lake.  Elijah Jedediah Blackwood, his breath clouding the air around his thick, red beard, adjusted the earflaps of his worn plaid cap and surveyed the scene with narrowed eyes.  Towering pines, their branches heavy with snow, formed a dense, silent wall around the clearing.  The only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic chink of Elijah’s axe against the frozen earth as he sharpened it, the steel flashing in the weak sunlight filtering through the trees. This isolated logging camp, a collection of rough-hewn cabins and a rumbling sawmill powered by the nearby Chesuncook Stream, was his world for the next six months. Winter in the Maine North Woods was a brutal mistress, but Elijah knew her ways. He’d been born under these same pines, and the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke was as familiar to him as his own heartbeat. This year, however, something felt different. A strange unease, like a thin sheet of ice over the deep, dark waters of the lake, had settled over the camp.
