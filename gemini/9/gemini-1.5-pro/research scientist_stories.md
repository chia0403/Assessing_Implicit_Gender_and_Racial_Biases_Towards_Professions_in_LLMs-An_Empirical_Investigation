The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's lab coat around him as he surveyed the desolate landscape. Grey, volcanic rock stretched as far as the eye could see, punctuated by plumes of sulphurous steam hissing from fissures in the earth.  Above, a bruised, perpetually twilight sky cast an eerie glow over the research outpost, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to the edge of a caldera on Io, Jupiterâ€™s innermost Galilean moon. The outpost, officially designated the Volcani Research Station, but affectionately nicknamed "The Inferno" by its inhabitants, was humanity's first and only permanent extraterrestrial research facility, dedicated to studying the extreme volcanism and unique geological processes of this volatile world.  Elias, a geochemist specializing in planetary formation, had been stationed there for six months, and the isolation, while initially exciting, was beginning to weigh on him.  He pulled his thermal hood tighter around his face, the rebreather system whirring softly, and turned back towards the airlock, a metallic glint catching his eye in the distance. Something was moving out there, something that shouldn't be.
