The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Dew Drop Inn," a rhythm Amelia Reyes, full name Amelia Isabella Reyes, had come to both loathe and strangely find comfort in.  Nestled in the forgotten pocket of the Appalachian Mountains known as Blackwood Hollow, the inn was less charming and more...damp. Amelia huddled deeper into her threadbare coat, the chill seeping through the thin fabric despite the flickering gas heater in the corner.  Blackwood Hollow was a town steeped in secrets, whispered stories of mountain witches and forgotten feuds, the kind of place that thrived on shadows and rumor. And Amelia, a reporter for the struggling Charleston Chronicle, was here to uncover the truth behind its latest mystery â€“ the disappearance of the town's reclusive, and reportedly incredibly wealthy, matriarch,  Esmeralda Blackwood.  The air in the Dew Drop was thick with the scent of stale beer and woodsmoke, a grim backdrop to the silent, watchful stares of the locals.  Amelia took a sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a fitting reflection of her assignment.  This story, she felt in her gut, was going to be more than just a missing person case.
