The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually saccharine aroma that permeated Eliza Jane Hollingsworth's bakery, "Buttercream Dreams."  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the display of meticulously crafted sugar flowers within. Located in the heart of sleepy Willow Creek, Oregon, a town nestled amongst rolling hills and evergreen forests, the bakery was usually a beacon of warmth and sweetness. But tonight, the flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast long, distorted shadows across the pastel pink walls, and the cheerful gingham curtains seemed to droop with a sense of foreboding. Eliza Jane, her normally pristine apron smeared with chocolate ganache and worry lines etched deep into her forehead, stared at the smoking oven, a half-finished wedding cake teetering precariously within.  This was not how she'd envisioned spending the eve of the town's biggest social event of the year â€“ the Mayor's daughter's wedding.
