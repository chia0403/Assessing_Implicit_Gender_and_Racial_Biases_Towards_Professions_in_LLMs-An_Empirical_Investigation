The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled, a fragile counterpoint to the rumble of a passing lorry outside.  Rain lashed against the large shop window, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and hyacinths displayed within. Inside, the air hummed with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the subtle sweetness of freesia.  Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her fingers stained green from re-potting a fussy maidenhair fern, glanced up, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Bath, was her sanctuary, a vibrant oasis amidst the grey stone and often dreary weather. This Tuesday morning, however, felt particularly ominous. The wind howled, rattling the window panes, and Eliza couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual, perhaps even unsettling, was about to bloom.
