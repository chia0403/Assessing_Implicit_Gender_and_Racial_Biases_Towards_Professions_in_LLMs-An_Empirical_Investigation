Rain lashed against the window of Elias Thorne's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing in his gut.  Neon signs from the noodle bar across the street reflected in the slick asphalt of Clementine Street, painting the room in flickering hues of emerald and ruby. Elias, full name Elias Thatcher Thorne, adjusted his tie, the Windsor knot feeling like a noose.  He was an insurance agent, a purveyor of promises against the inevitable, but tonight, even he felt the precariousness of existence.  The chipped mug on his desk, a gift from his now-estranged wife, held the lukewarm remnants of his third coffee.  Ashbury Heights, usually a haven of bohemian charm, felt oppressive tonight, each gust of wind a whispered threat.  The file on his desk, thick with incident reports and photographs, concerned a claim unlike any heâ€™d seen before.  It involved a vintage Rolls Royce, a vanishing act, and a whispered rumour of something far stranger than a simple car theft.
