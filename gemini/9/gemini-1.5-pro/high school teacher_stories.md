The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the parking lot of Northwood High.  The skeletal branches of the elm trees lining the perimeter rattled like dry bones, their fallen leaves swirling in miniature tornadoes across the cracked asphalt.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow. It was the kind of bleak afternoon that made Eleanor long for the comforting glow of her fireplace and a mug of Earl Grey tea, not the fluorescent-lit confines of the faculty room and the inevitable stack of ungraded essays waiting on her desk.  Northwood, nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, was picturesque in the summer, a postcard-perfect blend of rolling hills and vibrant foliage. But in late autumn, its beauty turned stark, a melancholic reflection of the long, dark winter to come.  This particular afternoon, the air held not just the promise of snow, but also a palpable tension, a quiet unease that Eleanor couldn't quite put her finger on.
