The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a suitcase full of fabric swatches across the icy parking lot.  It was late November in Duluth, Minnesota, and the air, sharp with the scent of pine and impending snow, bit at any exposed skin. The sky, a bruised purple, threatened to unleash its frozen fury at any moment.  Amy, her breath clouding before her, finally reached the back of her beat-up Ford Focus, its faded blue paint a stark contrast to the pristine white of the surrounding landscape. This was her third sales call of the day, and her fingers, despite the thick wool gloves, were already numb.  The warm, inviting glow spilling from the windows of Periwinkle's Fabrics and Crafts beckoned her inside, promising a temporary reprieve from the glacial conditions. Amy, armed with her charm, her samples, and a thermos of lukewarm coffee, hoped this stop would finally land her a much-needed sale.
