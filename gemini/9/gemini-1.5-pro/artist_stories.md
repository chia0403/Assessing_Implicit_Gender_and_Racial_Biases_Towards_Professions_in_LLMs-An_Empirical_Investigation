The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning Bay of Biscay.  The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek, momentarily obscuring her view of the roiling turquoise water below.  Her fingers, stained with streaks of cobalt and crimson, clutched a worn leather-bound sketchbook.  The small fishing village of Port-Blanc, nestled in the crook of the Breton coastline, sprawled beneath her, a patchwork of slate-grey roofs and whitewashed walls, clinging to the granite like barnacles to a ship's hull.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and woodsmoke, vibrated with the cries of gulls and the distant rumble of fishing boats returning to harbor.  Elara inhaled deeply, the raw, untamed beauty of the scene filling her lungs, a canvas waiting to be captured. This was her haven, her muse, the place where the chaotic whispers of her soul found form and color.
