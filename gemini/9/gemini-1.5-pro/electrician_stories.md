The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, whistling a mournful tune that harmonized perfectly with the groan of Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s ancient work van.  The van, affectionately nicknamed “Sparky,” sputtered to a stop outside number 42, a dilapidated Victorian with peeling paint and an air of forgotten grandeur.  Gloom clung to the house like cobwebs, thickened by the prematurely darkening sky. Amy, bundled in a thick fleece jacket beneath her worn overalls, grabbed her toolbox from the passenger seat. Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she stepped onto the cracked pavement, the scent of damp leaves and woodsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The call had been vague – "flickering lights, possible wiring issue" – but the underlying tremor of anxiety in Mrs. Elara Harlow's voice had convinced Amy to squeeze in this last-minute house call before heading home. This was Oakhaven, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians where everyone knew everyone, and a tremor in Mrs. Harlow's voice carried more weight than a shouted warning.
