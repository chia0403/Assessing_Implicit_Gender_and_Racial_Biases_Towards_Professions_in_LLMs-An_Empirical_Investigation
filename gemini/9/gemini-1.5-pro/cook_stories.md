The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar, comforting symphony to Elias Thorne.  He hummed along, a low, rumbling tune only punctuated by the sizzle of onions hitting hot oil.  Elias, his hands dusted with flour and a smudge of tomato sauce on his cheek, was in his element.  His restaurant, "The Salt Cellar," nestled in the heart of fog-draped Port Blossom, Maine, was a haven of warmth and tantalizing aromas on this blustery October evening.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the rhythmic chopping of Elias's knife as he prepared the evening's special: a hearty clam chowder, his grandmother's recipe, a guaranteed balm against the encroaching chill.  Outside, the fishing boats bobbed restlessly in the harbor, their lights flickering like fireflies in the grey dusk, while inside, the cozy dining room, with its mismatched chairs and nautical d√©cor, slowly began to fill with the hungry murmur of arriving patrons.
