The biting wind that whipped down Chestnut Street tugged at the edges of Elias Thorne's meticulously crafted overcoat.  He clutched it tighter, the thick wool a small comfort against the November chill that seeped into the very bones of Philadelphia.  His shop, "Thorne & Needle," nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually gloomy apothecary, was a haven of warmth and the comforting scent of pressed linen and beeswax.  Gaslight flickered through the large front window, illuminating bolts of vibrant silks, sturdy tweeds, and delicate laces stacked with the precision of a card castle.  Inside, the rhythmic click of Elias's shears against fabric mingled with the crackling of the small stove in the corner, creating a soundtrack as familiar and comforting as his own heartbeat.  Tonight, however, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual serenity.  A single letter, edged in black, lay on his workbench, its stark presence a dark stain against the cheerful chaos of his craft.
