The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, tugging at the edges of her worn-out but beloved crimson scarf.  Flakes of gritty London snow, more sleet than anything truly festive, stung her cheeks as she hurried down Shaftesbury Avenue.  The neon glow of theatre marquees, usually a source of invigorating energy for Esme, tonight felt more like an assault on her already frayed nerves.  Above her, the ornate, gothic fa√ßade of the Grand Majestic Theatre loomed, a hulking Victorian beast shrouded in scaffolding. This was it.  After years spent directing fringe productions in dingy pub basements and repurposed warehouses, Esme was finally making her West End debut. The problem?  Her leading actress had just dramatically quit, three days before opening night, claiming artistic differences (read: Esme refused to let her bring her pet chihuahua, Princess Fluffybutt III, onstage for the pivotal balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet).
