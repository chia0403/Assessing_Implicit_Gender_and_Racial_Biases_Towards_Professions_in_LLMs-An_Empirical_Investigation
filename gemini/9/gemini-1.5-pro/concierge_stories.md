The rain hammered against the Art Deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a miniature explosion against the glass.  Inside, the lobby glowed with a warm, golden light, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp navy uniform, adjusted the orchid corsage perched on her lapel.  It was nearly midnight, the usual lull before the late-night revelers returned, and the lobby was eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the muted rumble of thunder punctuated the silence.  The Grand Majestic, perched on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, felt like a ship bracing itself against a storm, and Eleanor, at her mahogany podium, was its steadfast captain.
