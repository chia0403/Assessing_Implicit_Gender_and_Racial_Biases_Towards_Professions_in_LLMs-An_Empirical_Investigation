Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of Elias Thorne’s heart.  The single bare bulb hanging from the rafter swayed precariously, casting long, dancing shadows across the dust-motes swirling in the air.  The attic, usually a haven of forgotten memories and half-finished projects, felt oppressive tonight. Elias, his fingers stained with ink and his usually neatly trimmed beard a touch wilder than usual, hunched over a battered oak desk.  The manuscript pages, illuminated by a flickering desk lamp, told the tale of a cursed amulet and a forgotten island shrouded in mist – a story that was, perhaps, becoming a little too real for comfort. The air in the small, cramped space under the eaves of his Victorian home in the seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, grew thick with a strange, metallic scent, and Elias couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
