The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the dashboard to a scorching temperature.  Dust devils danced across the shimmering asphalt of Highway 50, nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America," and for good reason.  Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez squinted against the glare, her hand resting lightly on the worn leather of the steering wheel.  Her rig, nicknamed "The Wanderer," rumbled beneath her, a loyal steed carrying its precious cargo of frozen peaches towards Ely.  Miles of scrub brush and rust-colored rock stretched in every direction, broken only by the occasional skeletal remains of a juniper tree.  Esme, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, adjusted the bill of her faded baseball cap and hummed along to a mournful Hank Williams tune on the radio, the only sound besides the low thrum of the engine and the whisper of the desert wind. The air shimmered with the heat, blurring the distant mountains into hazy purple silhouettes.  She'd been on the road for five days, ever since picking up the load in Fresno, and even though Ely was still a good few hours out,  a knot of anticipation tightened in her chest.  This wasn't just another delivery. This one was personal.
