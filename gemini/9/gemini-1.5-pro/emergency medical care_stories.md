Raindrops, fat and heavy with the promise of a proper Louisiana downpour, splattered against the windshield as the vehicle weaved through the French Quarter, its flashing lights painting the historic buildings in fleeting strokes of red and blue.  It was just past midnight, the cobblestone streets slick with rain and reflecting the neon glow of the bars still spilling music and laughter onto the sidewalks. Mia, a seasoned paramedic with New Orleans Emergency Medical Services, gripped the metal bar above her head as they lurched around a corner, the scent of stale beer and beignets momentarily overpowering the antiseptic tang that perpetually clung to her uniform.  Dispatch had been terse: "22-year-old female, possible overdose, Bourbon Street."  Mia knew Bourbon Street. She knew the dark corners, the deceptive allure, and the potential for things to go south in a heartbeat. Tonight, felt like one of those heartbeats.
