Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Kress Building, blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street. Inside, Amelia Reyes, a paralegal at the prestigious but soul-crushing firm of Albright, Finch & Stern, hunched over a mountain of discovery documents. The stale air hung thick with the scent of cheap instant coffee and the faint, metallic tang of impending doom. It wasn't the workload that bothered Amelia – she could handle a thousand billable hours if she had to. It was the case.  The Cartwright vs. Cartwright divorce had devolved into a vicious, sprawling mess, fueled by equal parts infidelity, embezzlement, and pure, unadulterated spite.  The Kress Building, a relic of a bygone era, seemed to amplify the case's toxic energy, its echoing hallways whispering secrets of broken promises and shattered lives. Amelia rubbed her temples, feeling a headache blossom behind her eyes.  This wasn’t how she'd imagined her life as a paralegal.  Certainly not at Albright, Finch & Stern, and definitely not in a city like St. Augustine, Florida, where the Spanish moss draped like funereal shrouds over the ancient oaks, mirroring the suffocating weight of the case files piled high on her desk.
