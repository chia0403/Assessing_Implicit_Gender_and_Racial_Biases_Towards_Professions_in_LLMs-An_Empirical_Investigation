The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the ancient windowpanes of the Orcas Island Medical Clinic. Rain lashed against the glass, obscuring the usually breathtaking view of the snow-capped Olympic Mountains. Inside, the waiting room was quiet save for the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional sniffle from a young boy clutching a stuffed walrus. Amelia Reyes, PA-C, tapped a pen against her teeth, scanning the patient chart in her hands.  The ferry from Anacortes had been delayed due to the storm, meaning most of her afternoon appointments were running late. This also meant Ameliaâ€™s own escape from the tiny island clinic, and the pervasive smell of antiseptic that clung to everything, would also be delayed. She sighed, a wisp of breath fogging the glass, and glanced again at the clock.  5:47 pm.  Another hour, at least, before she could trade her lab coat for a thick sweater and a mug of hot tea by the fire in her small cottage overlooking the tumultuous sea.
