The salt spray kissed Amelia "Milly" Reyes's face as she wrestled a FOR SALE sign into the unforgiving sand.  A gust of wind whipped her dark hair across her eyes, momentarily obscuring the breathtaking view of turquoise waves crashing against the volcanic rock formations of the Canary Islands. This particular slice of paradise, on the less-trafficked island of La Gomera, was proving more challenging than her usual Tenerife listings.  The villa, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic, boasted unparalleled beauty, but its remote location and winding access road were definite deterrents. Milly adjusted the sign, ensuring it was perfectly positioned to catch the fleeting glimpses of sunlight breaking through the brooding clouds. This sale, if she could pull it off, would be a game-changer. Not only would the commission be substantial, but landing a client like this – a reclusive tech millionaire seeking utter privacy – would open doors to a whole new echelon of clientele.  But La Gomera held secrets, whispered on the wind and hidden in the deep ravines, and Milly had a growing feeling this property came with more than just a stunning ocean view.
