The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the metal sign above Elias Thorne's shop: "Thorne Family Butchers, Est. 1888."  Salt spray speckled the frosted window, blurring the view of the carcasses hanging within, their pale forms illuminated by a single bare bulb.  Grimsby, a town clinging to the Lincolnshire coast like a barnacle to a hull, was shrouded in a pre-dawn gloom, the only sound the mournful cry of gulls and the distant rumble of a trawler returning to port.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, unlocked the heavy door, the metallic clang echoing in the desolate streets.  Inside, the chill clung to the tiled walls and stainless steel surfaces.  The air smelled of iron and sawdust, a familiar scent that Elias, after thirty years, barely registered anymore.  He switched on the string of bare bulbs hanging above the cutting block, their harsh light revealing the tools of his trade: gleaming cleavers, honed knives, and a heavy, well-worn bone saw.  Another day in the life of a Grimsby butcher was about to begin.
