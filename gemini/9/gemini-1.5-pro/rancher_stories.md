The wind, a constant companion in the high desert, whipped at Amelia Josephine Reyes's chambray shirt as she surveyed the parched landscape. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling ochre and burnt umber against a sky the color of faded turquoise.  Her ranch, the sprawling Bar C Ranch, stretched out before her like a rumpled brown blanket tucked between the jagged peaks of the Sangre de Cristo mountains and the seemingly endless expanse of New Mexico desert. The sun, a molten disc sinking towards the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the pi√±on and juniper trees that dotted the mesas.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its cry a mournful echo in the vast stillness.  This year, the rains had been scarce, whispering promises they failed to keep, and the land, usually vibrant with life, wore a weary, desperate air.  Amelia, her weathered face etched with the lines of sun and worry, knew this drought threatened not just her livelihood, but a legacy generations of Reyeses had fought to protect.
