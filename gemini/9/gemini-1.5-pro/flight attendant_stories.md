The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice against glass.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, her navy-blue uniform crisp despite the twelve-hour flight from Dubai, surveyed the cabin.  The pre-dawn light filtering through the oval windows painted the sleeping faces of the passengers in shades of ethereal blue.  Outside, a vast expanse of the North Atlantic stretched like crumpled silk, the first hints of sunrise painting the horizon in streaks of apricot and rose.  The 747, a metal bird carrying its weary cargo, began its descent towards London Heathrow, the sprawling city lights twinkling below like a scattered handful of diamonds.  Mia felt the familiar tug of exhaustion, but a prickle of anticipation kept her alert.  This layover, unlike the others, held a promise, a secret rendezvous she'd been looking forward to for months.  A rendezvous that could change everything.
