The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, a town nestled so deep in the Appalachian Mountains that sunlight seemed a scarce commodity. The library, a sturdy stone building with leaded glass windows, was the one place where light, both literal and metaphorical, still thrived.  Inside, Amelia Persephone Hawthorne, her auburn hair piled atop her head in a precarious bun, surveyed her domain.  The scent of old paper and aged leather hung in the air, a comforting perfume that Amelia had inhaled since childhood.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic tapping of her own heart. Today wasn't just any Tuesday; today, the Hollow Creek Library was receiving a donation from the notoriously reclusive Beaumont estate, a collection rumored to contain books older than the town itself.
