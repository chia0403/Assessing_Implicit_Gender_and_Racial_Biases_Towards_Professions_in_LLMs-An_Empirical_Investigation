The insistent California sun, already high and hot at 8:15 a.m., slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom, illuminating motes of chalk dust dancing in the air.  Palm trees swayed lazily just beyond the chain-link fence of Arroyo Vista Elementary, their fronds whispering secrets only the Santa Ana winds could understand.

Mrs. Vance, a woman whose gentle smile belied the steel in her spine forged over fifteen years of teaching, stood at the front of the room, a half-eaten apple perched precariously on her desk beside a stack of ungraded spelling tests. The air conditioner sputtered valiantly, but it was losing the battle against the encroaching heat and rising tide of pre-recess energy. This Friday, the last Friday of the school year, promised to be the longest – and potentially most chaotic – day of Mrs. Vance's career.
