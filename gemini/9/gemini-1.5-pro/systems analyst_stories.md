Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Aisling O'Malley's 27th-floor office, the city lights blurring into a shimmering, impressionistic canvas.  Below, the Dublin traffic crawled along the quays, headlights reflecting like scattered jewels on the slick cobblestones. Inside, the air hummed with the quiet thrum of servers and the gentle click-clack of Aisling's keyboard.  It was 11:47 pm, a Tuesday, and Aisling, a systems analyst for Keltic Financial, was the only person left on the floor.  A half-eaten container of cold noodles sat beside her ergonomic mouse, a testament to the urgency of the task at hand – patching a critical vulnerability in the company’s online banking system before it could be exploited. The air tasted of stale coffee and the faint metallic tang of impending disaster.  Aisling, however, was focused. Her fingers danced across the keys, lines of code scrolling across her screen like a waterfall of cryptic symbols, each one a bulwark against the unseen tide threatening to engulf Keltic’s digital fortress.
