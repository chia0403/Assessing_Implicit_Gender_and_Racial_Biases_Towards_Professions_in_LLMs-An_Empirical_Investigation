The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the near-deserted playground of Maplewood Elementary.  The rusted swing set creaked a mournful song, the only sound besides the rhythmic swoosh of his own breath clouding the frigid air.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow.  Elias tugged his scarf higher, burying his chin in the soft wool.  He was already late for his 4:30 meeting with Mrs. Peterson, third-grade teacher and apparent keeper of eight-year-old Noah Albrightâ€™s increasingly troubled soul.  Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, affluent suburb of Oakhaven, was usually a picture of cheerful, upper-middle-class normalcy.  But tonight, under the oppressive pre-winter gloom, the squat brick building and its surrounding asphalt expanse felt strangely menacing.  Elias had a knot in his stomach, a feeling he usually attributed to too much coffee, but tonight it felt different, colder, like a premonition of something unsettling lurking just beneath the surface of this placid town.
