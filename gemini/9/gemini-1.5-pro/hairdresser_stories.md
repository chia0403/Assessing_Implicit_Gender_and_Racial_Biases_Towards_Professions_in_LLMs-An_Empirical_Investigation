The aroma of burnt sugar and coconut hung heavy in the air, a permanent fixture at "Curl Up & Dye," the salon Amelia "Amy" Dubois owned and operated in the heart of Magnolia Springs, Mississippi.  Magnolia Springs was the kind of town where everybody knew your name, your mama's name, and probably the name of the dog you had when you were six.  Spanish moss draped like ghostly beards from the ancient oaks that lined Main Street, casting long, languid shadows over the pastel-colored storefronts.  Inside Curl Up & Dye, the story was much the same, only swapped with the electric hum of hair dryers and the rhythmic snip of Amy's shears. The late afternoon sun, filtered through the salon's large front window, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, a peaceful scene momentarily shattered by the jangle of the front door bell.
