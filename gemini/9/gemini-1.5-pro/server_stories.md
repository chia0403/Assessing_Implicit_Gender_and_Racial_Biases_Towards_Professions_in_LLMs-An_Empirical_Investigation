The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, iridescent glow on the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced hand, her dark eyes scanning the mostly empty booths. It was a Tuesday night, bordering on Wednesday morning, and the usual late-night crowd of insomniacs and poets hadn't materialized. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already distorted view of the city outside. Amy sighed, the humid air clinging to her like a second skin. The only other person in the diner was a lone figure hunched over a bowl of chili in the far corner booth, his face obscured by the shadow of a fedora.  Amy had a feeling this was going to be a long, slow shift.
