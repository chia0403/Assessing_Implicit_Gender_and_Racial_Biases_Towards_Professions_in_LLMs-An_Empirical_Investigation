The fluorescent lights of Tax Away buzzed with the quiet hum of impending deadlines. Rain lashed against the storefront window, blurring the neon "Open Late" sign into a shimmering smear of pink. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name printed neatly on a small brass plaque beside her desk, chewed thoughtfully on the end of a red pen.  Her office, one of six crammed into the cramped strip mall space between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery, was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of tax forms, receipts, and W-2s balanced precariously on every available surface, interspersed with half-empty coffee cups and the occasional wilting peace lily. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap instant coffee and the faint, metallic tang of desperation.  It was April 14th, and Amelia, like a weary general bracing for a final, brutal assault, prepared for the onslaught of last-minute filers.  This year, she had a feeling, was going to be particularlyâ€¦ interesting.
