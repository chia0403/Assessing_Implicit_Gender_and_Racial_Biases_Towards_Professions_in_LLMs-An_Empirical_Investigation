The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra “Cass” Valentine’s ankles as she stood on the precipice of the abandoned quarry, her breath clouding the air like a miniature ghost.  Below, the rusty chassis of a vintage Ford Thunderbird, half-submerged in the murky water, glinted under the steel-grey sky. This was it. The climactic scene. The moment that would either make or break her sophomore film, "The Devil's Quarry." Cass clutched the worn copy of her screenplay, its pages flapping like trapped birds. The air buzzed with the nervous energy of the crew, huddled in thick parkas and huddled around flickering monitors, a small island of light and activity in the vast, desolate landscape of the Peak District National Park in Derbyshire, England.  This isolated, windswept location, with its brooding atmosphere and whispers of local legend, was perfect for her neo-noir thriller, but the rapidly approaching winter was proving to be a formidable adversary.
