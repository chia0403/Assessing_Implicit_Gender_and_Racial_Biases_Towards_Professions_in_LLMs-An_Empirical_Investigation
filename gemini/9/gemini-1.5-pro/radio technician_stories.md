The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Bonneville Salt Flats, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks and making her regret not layering up under her thick parka.  Her breath plumed out in white puffs, dissipating against the backdrop of the stark white landscape that stretched to the hazy, lavender-tinged mountains in the distance.  Five miles from the nearest paved road, surrounded by nothing but salt and sky, sat the mobile research station – a collection of trailers and jury-rigged antennae huddled together like penguins against the cold. Amy, her gloved hands crammed deep into her pockets, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  The rhythmic hum of the generators, usually a reassuring background noise, was punctuated by a disconcerting, intermittent crackle coming from the main communication dish. That crackle, a sound like frying bacon in the ethereal silence of the salt flats, was the reason Amy Reyes, chief radio technician for the Helios Project, was out here on a freezing February morning instead of enjoying a hot cup of coffee back in Wendover.
