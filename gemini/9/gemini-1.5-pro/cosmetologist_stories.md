The pungent scent of perm solution mingled with the sweet aroma of coconut oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Genevieve "Gen" Dubois like a second skin.  Her salon, "The Gilded Lily," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on Bleecker Street, was a haven of vibrant chaos.  Crimson walls pulsed with the rhythm of salsa music spilling from a battered boombox perched precariously on a stack of Vogue magazines.  Outside, the November wind howled, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the grimy sidewalk, but inside, the air was thick with warmth and the lively chatter of Gen's regulars.  This Tuesday morning, however, held a different kind of energy, a subtle electric hum that prickled Gen's skin and made the fine hairs on her arms stand on end.  She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something was about to change.  She could feel it in the way the light filtered through the dusty windowpanes, in the way Mrs. Rodriguez's chihuahua, Pepito, shivered restlessly in his rhinestone-studded carrier. Something big was brewing on Bleecker Street.
