The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face, momentarily obscuring the view of the churning North Sea from her clifftop cottage.  Perched precariously on the edge of the Yorkshire moors, the cottage, dubbed "Writer's Retreat" by the overly optimistic estate agent, boasted little more than a perpetually damp fireplace, a view that could steal your breath on a clear day, and an unnerving tendency to creak like a galleon in a storm.  Inside, Amelia, clad in a thick wool sweater the colour of a stormy sky and fingerless gloves, hunched over her ancient typewriter, the rhythmic clack of the keys a lonely counterpoint to the wind's mournful howl.  The deadline for her latest novel, a gothic thriller set in the very moors surrounding her, loomed like a guillotine, and the blank page in the typewriter seemed to mock her with its stark emptiness.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her as writer's block held her captive.
