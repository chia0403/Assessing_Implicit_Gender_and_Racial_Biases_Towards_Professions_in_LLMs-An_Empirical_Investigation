The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone street, his breath clouding the air. The wrought-iron streetlamps of Port Blossom, Maine, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling leaves.  A quaint seaside town, Port Blossom boasted a population just shy of two thousand, most of whom Elias had peered into the mouths of at some point during his fifteen years practicing at his small, shingle-hung clinic on Elm Street. This evening, however, his destination wasn't the familiar warmth of his office, but the imposing, gothic silhouette of Blackwood Manor perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning, slate-grey sea.  A chilling unease settled in his stomach, a sensation entirely unrelated to the icy wind. He'd been summoned there urgently, and the cryptic message from the housekeeper had mentioned only one thing: a toothache. A toothache that apparently warranted a house call to the most reclusive resident in Port Blossom.
