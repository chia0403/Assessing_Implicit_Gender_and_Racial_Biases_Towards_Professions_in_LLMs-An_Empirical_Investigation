The fluorescent lights of the Rainbow Rascals Daycare buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, pale glow over the chaos unfolding beneath them.  Tiny plastic dinosaurs waged war in the block corner, a rogue sippy cup leaked apple juice onto a meticulously crafted finger-painting of a purple sun, and two toddlers engaged in a spirited tug-of-war over a single, balding baby doll.

It was only 9:17 am, and already her carefully planned schedule of  sensory play and alphabet songs lay in tatters, casualties of the unpredictable whirlwind that was a Tuesday morning at Rainbow Rascals. Outside, the late September wind rattled the windows of the converted Victorian house, hinting at the approaching autumn chill. Inside, the temperature seemed to rise with every decibel of shrieks and giggles emanating from the ten tiny humans under Amelia's charge.
