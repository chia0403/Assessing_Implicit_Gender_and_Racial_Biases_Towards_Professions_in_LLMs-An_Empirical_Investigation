The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped inside Ms. Amelia Iris Thorne's classroom, punctuated the otherwise hushed stillness of a Sunday afternoon. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of the large bay window, cast long shadows across the brightly colored alphabet rug and miniature wooden furniture.  Rainbow Daycare, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, seaside town of Seabrook, Oregon, was usually a whirlwind of glitter, glue, and the joyous chaos of five-year-olds. Today, however, it was eerily quiet. Amelia, perched on a tiny chair at a miniature table, meticulously arranged construction paper cutouts of sea creatures for tomorrow's lesson on ocean life. The salty tang of the nearby Pacific hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that usually brought her peace, but today, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. Something felt...off.
