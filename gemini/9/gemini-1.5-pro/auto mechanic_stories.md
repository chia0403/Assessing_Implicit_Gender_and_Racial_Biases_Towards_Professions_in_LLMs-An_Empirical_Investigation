The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the corrugated iron walls of Rosie's Auto Repair, sending shivers down Elara Jane Holloway's spine.  Grease stained her fingernails black, a permanent fixture despite the industrial-strength soap she used. Her red hair, usually pulled back in a practical ponytail, had escaped its confines and danced around her face in the frenzy.  Rosie's, nestled between a rundown laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Oregon, wasn't much to look at.  The faded pink paint was peeling, the single gas pump out front wheezed like a dying man, and the yard overflowed with the carcasses of forgotten vehicles, each one a testament to Elara's ability to coax life back into metal and rubber. But it was hers. And within the chaotic confines of Rosie's, Elara felt more at home than she ever had anywhere else. The smell of gasoline and hot metal, the rhythmic clang of her wrench against steel, the low hum of the radio playing classic rock - these were the comforts of her world.
