Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia "Em" Cartwright's head.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk, illuminating a half-eaten plate of stale cookies and a mountain of paperwork that seemed to grow with each passing hour.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and desperation.  Em, a real estate agent with a tenacity born of years spent navigating the treacherous tides of the Bayside real estate market, stared at the faded "For Lease" sign propped precariously against a window frame.  This was it, the final property on her list for the week.  The dilapidated Victorian at the edge of the rust-colored industrial park, a ghost town of forgotten factories and vacant warehouses.  The whispers of the neighbourhood—of the strange happenings, the unnerving quiet—were starting to feel more real than the palpable silence within the office.  The Bayside sun, usually a vibrant beacon, seemed to hide behind a perpetual veil of grey skies.
