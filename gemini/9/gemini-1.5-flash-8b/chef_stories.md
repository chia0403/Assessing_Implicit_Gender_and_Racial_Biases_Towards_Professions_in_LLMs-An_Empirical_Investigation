The air in Le Petit Coq hung thick with the scent of roasting thyme and simmering saffron.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rooster perched atop a meticulously arranged pile of fresh produce, illuminated the bustling kitchen.  Chef Antoine Dubois, a man whose face was perpetually etched with a mixture of concentration and playful mischief, moved with the practiced grace of a ballet dancer, his movements a symphony of precision and purpose.  He expertly flipped a crÃªpe, the delicate golden-brown disc catching the light like a miniature moon.  This was his kingdom, this chaotic, fragrant heart of Le Petit Coq, a tiny bistro tucked away on a cobbled Parisian street known for its charming cafes and even more charming secrets.
