The fluorescent hum of the clinic was a constant, low thrumming beneath Amelia "Amy"  Hartwell’s careful movements.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes of the fourth-floor nutrition clinic at the sprawling, grey Mercy Hospital, cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile white walls.  Amy, a registered dietician with a practiced efficiency that belied the ever-present tremor in her hands, meticulously weighed a handful of almonds.  Each nut, a tiny, imperfect sphere, was a tiny universe of potential, a symbol of the complicated dietary choices her patients faced, choices often dictated not by personal preference, but by dire necessity.  Mercy Hospital, a sprawling monument to both the city's grandeur and its entrenched poverty, housed a population more varied in their nutritional needs than any Amy could have anticipated.  From the frail, elderly patients struggling to maintain their independence on meager government rations to the young mothers struggling to provide for their families on a shoestring budget, the clinic was a microcosm of the city's socioeconomic struggles.  Today, a new patient—a young woman named Maria—stood before her, clutching a tattered shopping bag filled with staples. Amy’s heart, usually a metronome of measured analysis, felt a surprising jolt of empathy.  This was more than just another appointment; it was another thread in the intricate tapestry of the city’s nutritional health.
