The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  Elias Thorne, systems analyst extraordinaire (though he hated the term, preferring the more pragmatic "data wrangler"), stared at the shimmering rows of server racks.  Each rack, a miniature forest of humming metal, held the digital lifeblood of GlobalCom, a sprawling conglomerate that dictated the flow of information in the modern world.  Elias, hunched over his keyboard, was its unseen architect, its quiet keeper.  Tonight, however, the hum was different.  Not a shrill whine, not a deep groan, but a subtly distorted ripple that echoed through the otherwise silent machine hall.

The setting was the subterranean server farm, a sprawling cavernous complex tucked beneath the bustling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto.  Massive cooling units, the size of small cars, coughed out icy air, struggling to contain the heat generated by the thousands of interconnected processors.  Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering down from the high-bay fluorescent fixtures, illuminating the gleaming metal and the intricate networks of cables that snaked across the floor like ancient, living veins.  The air smelled faintly of ozone and burnt circuits, a familiar perfume to Elias. Tonight, though, a sharper metallic tang mingled with the usual scent, a faint, acrid smell hinting at something amiss deep within the core of the system.
