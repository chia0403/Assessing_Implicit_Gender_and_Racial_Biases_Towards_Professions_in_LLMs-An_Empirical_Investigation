The chipped paint of the gallery walls, a faded symphony of blues and greens, seemed to sigh with the afternoon heat.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a canvas propped precariously on an easel.  Elara Nightingale, her name a whispered promise of ethereal beauty, crouched beside it, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The palette knife, a familiar weight in her hand, scraped against the thick impasto, creating a symphony of muted tones.  The air, thick with the scent of turpentine and linseed oil, hung heavy in the small, almost forgotten, gallery tucked away on the cobbled side streets of Old Port Town.  This was not the gleaming, high-traffic art space of the city centre. This was a haven, a refuge, a sanctuary where Elara could lose herself in the vibrant dance of colour and form.  The gallery, once bustling with tourists and art aficionados, was now a quiet haven, its only inhabitants the dust motes and Elara.
