The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, tailor to the King's finest.  His workshop, tucked away on a cobbled alley off the Grand Promenade, was a symphony of hushed whispers and the rhythmic click of his needle.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering buildings of Veridia, cast long shadows across the room, illuminating the intricate patterns meticulously pinned to the finest silks.  Barty, a man whose hands seemed to possess a life of their own, wrestled with a particularly stubborn thread, his brow furrowed in concentration.  A burst of lively chatter from the street outside momentarily distracted him, a reminder of the bustling world beyond his quiet sanctuary. The Grand Promenade bustled with noblemen in elaborate velvet robes, ladies in flowing silks, and merchants hawking their wares.  He could practically taste the extravagance of their lives, but within his workshop, a different kind of luxury blossomed: the luxury of creation, the quiet satisfaction of crafting beauty from nothing more than thread and cloth.
