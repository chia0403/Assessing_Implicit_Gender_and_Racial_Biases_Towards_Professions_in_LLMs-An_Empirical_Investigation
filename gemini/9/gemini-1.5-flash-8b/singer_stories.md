This was Elara Nightingale's stage, albeit a less-than-grand one.  Elara Nightingale, twenty-two years old, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of bruised plums and a voice that could melt glaciers, perched precariously on a stool, a worn guitar case at her feet.  The tiny, smoky room held a collection of regulars: the weary truck driver nursing a stout; the perpetually scowling artist sketching in a corner; the gossiping women huddled over a chipped table.  Tonight, they were her audience, and tonight, she was theirs.
