The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from years of lukewarm water and forgotten teaspoons, reflected Agnes Periwinkle's face.  Not a pretty reflection, truth be told.  The lines etched around her eyes, the dullness of her greying hair pulled back in a tight bun, spoke volumes of a life spent polishing mahogany, scrubbing grime, and quietly tending to the needs of others.  Today, however, a new kind of grime clung to her, a gritty, unsettling feeling in the pit of her stomach.

Agnes Periwinkle, housekeeper for the esteemed Lord Ashworth, found herself staring at the intricate silver tea service, the delicate floral patterns almost mocking her.  Lord Ashworth, a man who’d once held a kingdom in his palm, now sat slumped over a mahogany desk, a single, unlit candle casting long, melancholic shadows across the vast library.  The grand estate, normally a symphony of bustling activity, was eerily silent, the only sound the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the hall.

This was not the grand estate of Ashworth Manor she knew.  This was… something else entirely.  A palpable sense of impending doom hung heavy in the air, a chill that had nothing to do with the autumnal air outside.  A thick fog, a suffocating shroud, had settled over the normally vibrant house, and Agnes felt the hairs on her arms prickle.  Outside, the once-familiar trees seemed to loom, their branches gnarled and reaching, like grasping fingers.  Something was amiss, and Agnes, with her practiced eye for detail, knew it instinctively.
