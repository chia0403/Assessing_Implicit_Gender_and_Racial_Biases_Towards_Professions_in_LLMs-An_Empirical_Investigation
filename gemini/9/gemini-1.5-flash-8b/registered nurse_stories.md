The fluorescent hum of the emergency room was a constant, low thrum, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's life for the past five years.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the flickering shadows cast by the emergency lights, were a familiar backdrop.  Tonight, however, the usual chaos felt amplified, a cacophony of beeping monitors and strained voices punctuated by the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a heart monitor that was, quite literally, racing.  Eleanor, RN, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  Her name, usually just a whisper in the flurry of activity, felt somehow heavy in the air.  The scent of antiseptic and fear hung thick in the humid air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood. This wasn't just another night.  This night felt different.  It felt…wrong.

The ER at St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, aging facility in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying section of the city, was a microcosm of urban anxieties.  The chipped paint on the walls, the slightly out-of-date equipment, and the constant, hurried pace spoke volumes about the area’s history.  Across the hall, in the waiting room, a young couple sat hunched together, their faces pale and etched with worry.  In the adjacent trauma bay, a seasoned paramedic was working tirelessly to stabilize a patient with severe injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident.  Eleanor, standing at the head of the resuscitation bay, felt a tremor of empathy as she watched, her breath hitching in her throat.  She had seen too many faces etched with fear, too many lives hanging precariously in the balance.  The fluorescent lights seemed to glare down on her, highlighting the fatigue etched on her face.
