The chill of dawn, sharper than any chisel, bit into Elias Thorne's exposed skin.  He pulled his worn leather jerkin tighter, the coarse wool offering little comfort against the biting wind whipping across the jagged peaks of the Greystone Mountains.  Below, nestled in the valley like a sleeping serpent, lay the village of Ashwood.  Smoke curled lazily from its chimneys, a fragile thread against the bruised purple sky.  Elias, a stone cutter of formidable reputation, had been working here for three seasons, carving the mountain face into a series of intricately sculpted facades that would one day house the grandest houses in the land. The sun, a grudging orange orb, finally broke above the peaks, painting the valley in streaks of rose and gold. This was his third day on the northern face, and already he felt the relentless stone whispering secrets to the wind.  Elias traced the lines of the intricate carving with his calloused finger, the cold stone mirroring the quiet determination in his heart.
