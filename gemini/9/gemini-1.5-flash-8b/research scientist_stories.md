The rhythmic hum of the cyclotron filled Dr.  Elara Vance's lab, a symphony of controlled chaos that was her world.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of her cramped, cluttered office at the Institute for Advanced Subatomic Research.  A half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned on a cluttered desk, overflowing with papers, charts, and disassembled components of various contraptions that looked suspiciously like oversized, repurposed coffee makers.  Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, hunched over a complex diagram, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridia thrummed with a relentless energy, a constant, unyielding backdrop to the quiet intensity of her work.  The year was 2247.
