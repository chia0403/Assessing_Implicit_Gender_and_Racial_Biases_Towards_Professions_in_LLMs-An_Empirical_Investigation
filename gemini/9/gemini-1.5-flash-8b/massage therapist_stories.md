Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Zenith Spa," a small, unassuming building nestled amongst towering, ancient redwood trees in the coastal town of Alderbrook.  Inside, amidst the scent of lavender and sandalwood, Amelia "Amara"  Everhart, a massage therapist with hands as steady as the ocean tides and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of the mountains, worked her magic on a client.  The rhythmic kneading of muscles, the soft sighs of relaxation, and the gentle murmur of the rain outside created a symphony of tranquilityâ€”a stark contrast to the tempest brewing within the confines of the town's hidden history.  Alderbrook, beautiful and isolated, kept its secrets close, its secrets that Amara was beginning to suspect were about to be revealed.
