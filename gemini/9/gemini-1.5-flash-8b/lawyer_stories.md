Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Law Offices of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch," a cramped, perpetually damp space tucked between a fishmonger and a laundromat on the edge of the Rust Belt.  Barty Finch, a junior lawyer with a perpetually rumpled suit and eyes that held the weariness of a man ten years older, stared out at the deluge.  The city, usually a cacophony of honking taxis and shouting vendors, was muted, swallowed by the relentless downpour.  His only companions were the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the corner, and the insistent buzzing of a forgotten phone in the corner. The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and desperation.  He wasn't looking forward to the day.  Cases like this one, a tangled web of corporate malfeasance and meticulously crafted lies, usually left him feeling like a drowning man clutching at splinters.  This one, however, smelled different. It smelled... *wrong*.
