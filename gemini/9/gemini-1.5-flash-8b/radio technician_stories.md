The flickering neon sign of the "Radio Shack Emporium" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked streets of New Haven, 1948.  Inside, amidst the whirring transformers and the pungent smell of solder and ozone, Elias Thorne, Radio Technician extraordinaire, meticulously adjusted a complex array of dials and knobs.  He was hunched over a workbench, his calloused hands moving with practiced grace, the faint glow of a cathode ray tube illuminating his focused face.  The air in the cramped workshop buzzed with the low hum of electricity, the rhythmic click-clack of tools echoing in the relative silence.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, lashing rain against the storefront windows, a soundtrack to the relentless hum of the city and Elias's own thoughts.
