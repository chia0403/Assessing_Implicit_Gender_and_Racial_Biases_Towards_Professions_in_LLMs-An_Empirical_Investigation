Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the rehabilitation centre, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Grayson’s thoughts.  The sterile white walls of the physiotherapy gym seemed to press in around her, the fluorescent lights buzzing with a disquieting energy.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist, stared down at the tangle of limbs and tangled emotions sprawled across the exercise mat.  The scent of antiseptic and sweat hung heavy in the air, a potent cocktail of the day's work.  Her hands, usually deft and sure, trembled slightly as she adjusted the splints on the patient's fractured arm.  This was another Monday, another mountain to climb, another life – or at least a piece of one – struggling to be rebuilt.

The rehabilitation centre, a sprawling, beige-painted building on the outskirts of the town, was a stark contrast to the vibrant green hills that stretched out behind it.  A lonely sentinel, it overlooked the faded grandeur of a once bustling industrial area.  Empty factory spaces huddled together like forgotten memories, their windows like hollow eyes staring blankly at the passing rain. The rhythmic drip of water from the gutters echoed the slow, measured progress of recovery—some quicker, some agonizingly slow.  Inside, the echo of muttered prayers, quiet sobs, and the soft click of therapy equipment filled the air. This place, Amelia knew, held the key to mending broken lives, but sometimes, it felt like the only thing it mended was the heart.
