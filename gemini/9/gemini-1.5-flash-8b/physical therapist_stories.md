Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayesâ€™ thoughts.  The small, cluttered physiotherapy practice, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast town of Ashwood, was usually a sanctuary of quiet, focused movements and the soft hum of conversation.  Today, it was a battlefield.  A young woman, no older than twenty, lay on the examination table, her face pale and drawn, her breathing shallow and ragged.  Amelia, her brow furrowed, felt a cold dread seep into her bones. This wasn't just another sprained ankle or pulled muscle; this was something far more sinister.

The setting was the Ashwood Physiotherapy Clinic, a small, two-room building that had seen better days.  Sunlight rarely penetrated the gloom of the windows, and the faint smell of antiseptic and old linoleum hung heavy in the air.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light from the single overhead fluorescent bulb, highlighting the chipped paint and worn wallpaper that lined the walls.  Outside, the town of Ashwood, nestled between rolling hills and shrouded in a perpetual mist, felt as if it held its breath, mirroring the tension in the room.
