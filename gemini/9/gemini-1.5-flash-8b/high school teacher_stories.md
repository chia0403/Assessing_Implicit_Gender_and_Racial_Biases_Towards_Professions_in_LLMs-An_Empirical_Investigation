The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic tapping of pens on paper.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a scene of quiet concentration.  Eleventh graders, faces illuminated by the pale light, wrestled with the complexities of the French Revolution, their brows furrowed in varying degrees of frustration and comprehension. Eleanor, a woman whose auburn hair had begun to show the threads of gray around her temples, leaned against the chipped wooden desk, a worn copy of *The French Revolution* resting open in her lap.  She’d taught this unit a hundred times, yet the echoes of Robespierre and the guillotine still resonated with a chilling familiarity.  Outside, the clamor of the school day – the relentless ebb and flow of students, teachers, and administrative staff – was muted by the thick brick walls of the dilapidated high school.  This particular Tuesday felt unusually heavy.  Not just the weight of the curriculum, but something more profound, something that clung to the air like the scent of old books and stale coffee. The quiet in the room felt more like a pressure than a respite.
