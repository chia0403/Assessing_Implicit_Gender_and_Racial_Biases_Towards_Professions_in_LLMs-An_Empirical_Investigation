The fluorescent hum of the waiting room was a constant, low thrumming, barely audible above the soft click-clack of Amelia Hawthorne's heels against the polished linoleum.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Hawthorne, chiropractor, adjusted her crisp white lab coat, the subtle scent of lavender oil clinging to the fabric.  The room, a small but perfectly functional space in the heart of a bustling suburban town, was a study in muted grays and beiges.  A few posters advertising the benefits of regular spinal adjustments, featuring impossibly flexible figures, hung lifelessly on the walls.  A single, ancient oak rocking chair sat by the window, its worn wood whispering tales of countless hours spent waiting, hopes held, and anxieties pondered.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns, turning the usually vibrant green into a muted emerald.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the towering maple trees lining the street, a sound that seemed to punctuate the quiet expectancy of the waiting room.  Amelia, her mind already wrestling with the day's backlog of patients, could almost feel the subtle vibrations of the stress radiating from the people seated around her.
