The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed Blackwood Manor.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the leaded glass windows of the caretaker's small, isolated cottage, mirroring the storm brewing within Elara Blackwood.  She, Elara Blackwood, Animal Caretaker for the Manor, huddled deeper into her worn wool coat, the scent of damp earth and pine needles clinging to her clothes.  The manor itself, a looming silhouette against the bruised sky, seemed to press down on the cottage like a suffocating blanket.  For weeks, the strange whispers had followed her, the unsettling rustlings in the overgrown gardens, the unsettling silence that echoed from the echoing halls.  Her days were a relentless cycle of feeding, cleaning, and checking on the creatures entrusted to her care, a constant vigil against the encroaching darkness that now felt palpable, not just in the weather, but in the very air she breathed.

The Manor, a sprawling gothic masterpiece, had stood for centuries.  Its many rooms, filled with faded tapestries and dusty furniture, held secrets whispered on the wind, secrets that Elara felt tugging at her.  Grand halls, once echoing with laughter and music, now echoed only with the soft sighs of the animals she cared for: a flock of exotic birds in gilded cages, a collection of unusually large and silent rabbits in the hidden aviary, and a sleek panther named Shadow, whose emerald eyes held an unnerving intelligence.  The grounds, once manicured and orderly, were now choked by weeds and overgrown paths. The very stones seemed to breathe with a forgotten magic, a magic Elara felt growing closer, more potent, with each passing day.  The chill of the November air was a physical manifestation of this encroaching presence.
