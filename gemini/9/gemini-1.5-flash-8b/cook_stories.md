The aroma of rosemary and thyme, thick as a fog, hung heavy in the air of the little trattoria, "La Dolce Vita."  Sunlight, fractured by the Venetian blinds, dappled the worn wooden tables, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air.  This was the domain of  Giovanni  "Gino"  Fontana, a man whose hands, stained ochre and crimson from years of wielding a knife, moved with the precision of a master sculptor.  Gino, at thirty-seven, considered himself a culinary artisan, a purveyor of flavour, not just a cook.  Tonight, however, the scent of impending chaos mingled with the spice.  A particularly demanding group of tourists, their accents a cacophony of exasperated syllables, were grumbling at the table nearest the entrance.  Their orders were already a challenge, a bizarre and flavourless mix of pasta dishes and foreign ingredients Gino had never encountered.  And he, Gino Fontana, was about to face the ultimate test of his culinary prowess, his patience, and perhaps, his sanity.
