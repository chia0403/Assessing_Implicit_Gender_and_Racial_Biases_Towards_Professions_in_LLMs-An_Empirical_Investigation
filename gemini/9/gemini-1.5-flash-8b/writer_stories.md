Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Writer's Retreat," a ramshackle building nestled deep in the whispering pines of Blackwood Forest.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a writer with eyes the color of storm clouds and a perpetually rumpled tweed jacket, hunched over a worn, leather-bound notebook.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a comforting, almost oppressive blanket against the ceaseless drumming outside.  He’d arrived at the retreat a week ago, hoping to escape the relentless demands of his agent and the clamoring expectations of the publishing world, hoping for inspiration.  Instead, he’d been plagued by a profound emptiness, a void in his usually prolific mind.  The only solace he found was in the rhythmic thud of the rain, a constant, unyielding companion to his creative drought.  The faded, floral wallpaper of the tiny study, once a source of whimsical charm, now seemed a mockery of his current state of mind. He traced the name of the book he was struggling to write - "Whisperwind" - in the rain-streaked margin with a trembling pen.
