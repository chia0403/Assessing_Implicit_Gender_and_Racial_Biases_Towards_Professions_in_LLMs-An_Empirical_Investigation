The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the chipped paint of the caretaker's shed.  Elias Thorne, Groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor, shivered, pulling his threadbare wool scarf tighter around his neck.  The November air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, felt particularly unkind this year.  He squinted at the sprawling estate, its gothic turrets disappearing into the swirling grey mist.  Blackwood Manor, a monument to forgotten grandeur, stood stark and silent, a brooding presence on the windswept hilltop.  Elias, a wiry man with weathered hands and eyes that held the secrets of countless seasons, knew it better than anyone.  He was the guardian of its hidden passages, its whispering walls, and the silent stories etched into the very stones.

The grounds, once meticulously manicured, now lay under a blanket of frost.  Dead leaves crunched beneath his worn boots as he made his nightly rounds, a solitary figure against the looming darkness.  The air hummed with an unsettling quiet, broken only by the mournful cries of unseen birds and the occasional creak of an unseen window.  A chill, deeper than the frost, seemed to seep into Elias' bones, a feeling he recognized as the prelude to somethingâ€¦unnatural.  Tonight, something felt different.
