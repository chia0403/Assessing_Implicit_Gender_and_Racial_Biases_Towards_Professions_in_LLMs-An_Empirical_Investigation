The biting November wind whipped Amelia Seraphina Blackwood's charcoal-grey coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks and rattling the thin, metal frame of her sketchbook.  The cobbled alley, barely a passage between towering, soot-stained brick buildings, was choked with a damp, earthy smell that clung to her clothes and seeped into her lungs.  London, 1888.  A city suffocating with the promise of progress and the relentless weight of poverty.  Street urchins, their faces smeared with grime, darted between Ameliaâ€™s ankles, their cries swallowed by the roar of the city.  Amelia, barely sixteen, felt the familiar ache of a thousand unspoken stories in the very air she breathed. This was the heart of it all; the pulse of London, beating in the rhythm of her own hurried footsteps.  She clutched the sketchbook tighter, the faintest lines of a raven perched on a crumbling gargoyle already sketched.  Tonight, she was determined to capture more than just the city's grim beauty, more than just a fleeting portrait of the shadowed alley. Tonight, she hoped to uncover the secret story whispered on the wind.
