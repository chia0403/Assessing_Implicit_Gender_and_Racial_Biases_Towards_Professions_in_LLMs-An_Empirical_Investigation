The chipped porcelain sink, a pale, almost ghostly white against the muted floral wallpaper, reflected the late afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light filtering through the mismatched, floral-patterned curtains of Amelia "Poppy" Butterfield's tiny shop, "Blooming Bouquets."  The scent of jasmine, lilies, and something faintly sweet and unfamiliar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, lingering aroma of yesterday's freshly cut roses.  Poppy, a wisp of a woman with hair the colour of faded cinnamon and eyes that held the depth of a summer sky, meticulously arranged a bouquet of vibrant crimson dahlias. Each petal, each stem, seemed to hold a secret, waiting for the right hand to unveil it.  Outside, the rhythmic chirping of cicadas swelled, a counterpoint to the quiet hum of the city outside the shop's small, unassuming window. This was Poppy's sanctuary, her haven, and her world.  The only other sound was the gentle clinking of a nearby train, a rhythmic pulse echoing the quiet pulse of her life.
