The flickering neon sign of "Speedy Pipes" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of the Lower Quarter.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion against the already cacophonous symphony of the alley.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with grease-stained overalls clinging to his lean frame, wrestled with a particularly stubborn drainpipe.  Water, the very element he dealt with on a daily basis, seemed determined to outwit him tonight.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and the metallic tang of old pipes, hung heavy in the cramped workshop.  Barty's brow was furrowed in concentration, his calloused fingers working furiously on the corroded joint.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of the rain matched the frantic rhythm of his heart.  Tonight, it wasn't just a clogged drain he was fighting, but a mounting sense of dread, a feeling that something wasn't quite right.
