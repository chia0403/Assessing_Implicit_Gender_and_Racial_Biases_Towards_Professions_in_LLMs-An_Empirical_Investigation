The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Milly"  Fitzwilliam's worn jacket, stinging her cheeks and rattling the loose rivets in her worn work boots.  Dust, kicked up by the passing semi-trucks, coated everything in a fine, gritty haze.  The relentless sun beat down on the vast, empty expanse of the Arizona desert highway, a shimmering ribbon of asphalt stretching to the horizon.  Milly, her calloused hands gripping the worn handle of her pickaxe, surveyed the pothole that had sprung up overnight, a festering wound in the otherwise smooth surface.  It was another day, another pothole, another reminder of the relentless, punishing beauty of the desert.  The year was 2042.
