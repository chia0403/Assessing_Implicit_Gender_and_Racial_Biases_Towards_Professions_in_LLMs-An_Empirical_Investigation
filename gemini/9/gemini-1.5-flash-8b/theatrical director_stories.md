The biting November wind whipped across the cobblestones of Covent Garden, stinging Amelia Nightingale's cheeks as she hurried towards the Theatre Royal.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, plastered the already-soaking posters advertising the upcoming production of "The Tempest."  A single, flickering gas lamp cast a sickly yellow glow on her umbrella, illuminating the swirling mist that seemed to cling to the ancient stone buildings like a shroud.  Amelia, a tempestuous woman herself, felt a strange resonance between the inclement weather and the play she was preparing.  The theatre, a grand, brooding monument to forgotten glories, loomed before her, its ornate facade shrouded in an almost palpable sense of anticipation.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and old paper, a symphony of muted conversations and the muffled thrumming of unseen machinery.  Tonight, Amelia Nightingale, director of the Royal Shakespeare Company's production, had to make or break "The Tempest."
