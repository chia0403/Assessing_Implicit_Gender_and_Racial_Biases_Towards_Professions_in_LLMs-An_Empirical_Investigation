The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Amelia "Ames" Stone's cheeks as she fought the hydraulics on the CAT 390.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heartbeat.  Twenty-five miles east of the nearest town, the sun beat down mercilessly on the vast, ochre landscape, turning the air into a thick, shimmering soup.  Her target: a stubborn boulder, the size of a small house, wedged stubbornly into the channel of the abandoned Dry Riverbed.  This wasn't just another day on the job for Ames; this was personal.  Her grandfather, Silas Stone, a legendary prospector, had disappeared near this very spot decades ago.  Local lore whispered tales of a hidden treasure, a buried fortune, tucked away somewhere within the treacherous canyon walls. And Ames, driven by a stubborn streak and an insatiable thirst for answers, was determined to find it.

Setting:

The desolate, sun-baked expanse of the Mojave Desert, 25 miles east of a ghost town named Harmony Gulch.  The Dry Riverbed, now a maze of canyons and crumbling rock, snakes through the landscape, promising untold secrets in its dusty depths.  The air is thick with the scent of sagebrush and the unsettling silence of the desert.  Hints of decaying machinery and scattered remnants of old mining camps pepper the vista, serving as silent witnesses to the vanished past.
