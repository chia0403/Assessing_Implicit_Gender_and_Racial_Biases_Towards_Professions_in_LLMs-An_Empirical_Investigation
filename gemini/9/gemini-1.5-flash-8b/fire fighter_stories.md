The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees lining the perimeter of the Blackwood Forest.  Snow, already knee-deep in places, swirled around Amelia "Em" Blackwood's boots as she surveyed the scene.  The flickering orange glow of the burning cabin, nestled deep within the forest's embrace, painted the already dim sky in a macabre light.  The air, thick with the acrid smell of pine and smoke, hung heavy, choking.  Em, a seasoned firefighter with the Blackwood County Volunteer Fire Department, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another fire; it felt...wrong.


**Setting:** Blackwood Forest, a remote, sprawling woodland on the edge of Blackwood County, Massachusetts.  The forest, with its ancient trees, dense undergrowth, and winding paths, had a reputation for holding secrets and whispers of the past.  The cabin, a weathered structure built of rough-hewn logs, stood at the very heart of a cluster of towering pines, practically swallowed by the dense forest. The village of Blackwood, nestled at the forest's edge, was a tight-knit community with a history woven with the very fabric of the woods.
