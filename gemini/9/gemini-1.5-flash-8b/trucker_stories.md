The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Amelia "Milly"  Harding's cheeks.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the crimson dust into miniature tornadoes that obscured the horizon.  Her rig, a battered but loyal Freightliner named "The Iron Horse," groaned under the weight of the shipment, a low rumble that echoed in the empty expanse.  Milly gripped the worn steering wheel, knuckles white, as the sun dipped below the jagged silhouette of the Rockies, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange.  She was miles from the nearest town,  Lost Creek, a ghost of a settlement barely clinging to the edge of civilization,  and even the faintest sliver of light seemed miles away.  The only company was the relentless, wind-sculpted prairie stretching out before her, endless and unforgiving.


The setting is the American West,  specifically the vast, arid plains of Wyoming or a similarly sparsely populated region. The time is likely late afternoon or early evening, given the description of the setting sun.  The mood is one of isolation, danger, and quiet desperation.  Milly's determination to reach her destination is contrasted against the harsh and unforgiving landscape.
