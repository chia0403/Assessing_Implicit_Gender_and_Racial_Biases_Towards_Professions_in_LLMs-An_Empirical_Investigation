The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a relentless, almost mournful, tune.  Rain hammered against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, a rhythmic counterpoint to the panicked whispers and the urgent beeps of medical equipment.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her name etched into the worn leather of her lab coat, stared down at the young man sprawled on the gurney.  His face, pale and drawn, was a mask of pain.  The air, already thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, was now tinged with the metallic tang of blood.

The setting was the bustling, yet oddly quiet, emergency room of a large urban hospital on a stormy night in late autumn.  The constant rush of patients, the chaotic symphony of sirens and medical instruments, was momentarily stilled, replaced by a palpable tension.  Eleanor, a cardiothoracic surgeon with a reputation for calm under pressure, felt the weight of the situation press down on her, a tangible force in this sterile, high-tech environment. She was already deep in thought about the unseen damage to the young man's chest, even before the first scans were taken. This particular case, like so many others, felt different.  A prickling sense of foreboding, a feeling she couldn't quite place, coiled within her.
