The biting wind, a relentless, skeletal hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Dust devils, miniature cyclones of ochre and despair, danced across the parched earth, mocking the withered stalks of his wheat.  The year was 1887, and the drought, a relentless beast, had swallowed the Colorado plains whole.  Not just the crops, but the very spirit of the land seemed to be wilting under the relentless sun.  Elias, his hands calloused and cracked like the parched soil, felt the weight of the year pressing down on him.  He was a farmer, a man of the land, and he was failing.  His farm, once a vibrant tapestry of life, was now a desolate canvas painted in shades of grey and rust.  The once proud, towering sunflowers were flattened, their faces turned away from the merciless light.  The creek, usually a gurgling ribbon of life, was reduced to a threadbare trickle, barely whispering through the gravelly bed.  This was not the fertile valley his grandfather had known, and it was not the life he had envisioned for himself.
