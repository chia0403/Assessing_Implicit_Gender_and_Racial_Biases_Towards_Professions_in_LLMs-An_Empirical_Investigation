The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty's Wrenching Wonders," the aroma of burnt oil and cheap coffee mingling with the faint scent of exhaust fumes.  Amelia "Amy"  Charleston, her name practically a whisper against the incessant whir of the air compressor and clatter of wrenches, hunched over a sputtering, four-wheeled nightmare of a minivan.  The faded crimson paint was a testament to its numerous past lives, the interior a patchwork of duct tape and desperation.  This particular minivan, affectionately nicknamed "The Wandering Whale" by the local kids, had been brought in by a woman with eyes the color of storm clouds, a woman who looked like she'd wrestled a bear for breakfast.

The shop, a cramped but surprisingly organized space crammed into a small strip mall on the edge of the Rust Belt town of Ashbury, was Amy's kingdom.  Rows of meticulously organized tools lined the walls, each one seemingly poised for its next moment of glory.  A chipped porcelain mug, filled with lukewarm coffee, sat on a workbench, a solitary sentinel amidst the chaos.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the overhead fluorescent lights.  The rhythmic thump of Amy's knuckles against metal, punctuated by the occasional frustrated sigh, was the only soundtrack to the day.  The shop clock, its hands stubbornly fixed on 2:17 PM, seemed to mock the slow, methodical progress of the repair.
