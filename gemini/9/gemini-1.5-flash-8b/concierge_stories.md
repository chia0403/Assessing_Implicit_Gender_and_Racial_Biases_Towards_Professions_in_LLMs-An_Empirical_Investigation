The scent of rain-soaked asphalt and freshly brewed coffee hung heavy in the air of the Grand Cavendish Hotel.  Rain hammered against the oversized, leaded glass windows of the lobby, a rhythmic counterpoint to the soft hum of conversation and the occasional clinking of champagne flutes.  Amelia "Amy"  Seraphina  Delacroix, the Grand Cavendish's resident concierge, traced a delicate pattern in the condensation on the mahogany desk.  Her crisp, navy uniform, tailored to perfection, barely seemed to ripple as she listened to the murmur of voices.  Today, as always, the sheer volume of requests, demands, and whispered secrets felt like a symphonyâ€”a symphony she was tasked with orchestrating, her calm demeanor the only visible conductor.  The hotel, a majestic monument to gilded ages and discreet service, was her stage.  It was a stage she inhabited with quiet expertise, her keen observation a secret weapon in a world of fleeting whims and demanding personalities.
