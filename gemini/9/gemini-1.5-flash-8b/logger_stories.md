The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, whipped at Silas Blackwood's face.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather coat, the icy grip of the Alaskan wilderness seeping into his very bones.  Snow, the consistency of powdered sugar, swirled around his boots, obscuring the already treacherous path winding up the mountainside.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and the metallic tang of approaching storm, was the only companion in this stark, unforgiving landscape.

Silas Blackwood, a logger with eyes the color of glacial ice and hands calloused to the point of almost being a second skin, surveyed the scene.  This wasn't just any timber. This was the ancient, untouched heartwood of the Frostfang Range, whispered to hold more secrets than any man could ever hope to uncover.  Legend spoke of a hidden valley, tucked away within these impenetrable woods, a place where the trees spoke in whispers and the very earth hummed with an ethereal energy.  Rumors, passed down through generations of loggers, told of untold riches and untold dangers.  Today, Silas was determined to find out for himself.
