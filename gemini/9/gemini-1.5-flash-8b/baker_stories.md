The scent of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, clung to the air around Amelia Nightingale, weaving through the swirling grey London fog.  Rain hammered against the chipped slate roof of her tiny bakery, "The Crumb & Thistle," a name she'd chosen with a mixture of fondness and defiance.  The tiny shop, tucked away on a cobbled alley off Drury Lane, was a haven of warmth and fragrant chaos.  Flour dusted every surface, from the worn wooden tables to the apron Amelia wore, a faded crimson now stained with the unmistakable marks of years spent kneading dough.  Before her, a gleaming copper bowl bubbled with a rich, golden dough, waiting to be shaped into the day's batch of sourdough rolls.

Outside, the fog hung thick and heavy, obscuring the gas lamps and wrapping the city in an almost mystical gloom.  The muffled sounds of the city – carriages clattering, distant shouts, the rhythmic clang of hammers – were swallowed by the thick air, leaving only the constant patter of the rain and the comforting warmth of the oven for Amelia to focus on.  It was a Tuesday, a day Amelia always felt pulled towards the solitary rhythm of her craft.
