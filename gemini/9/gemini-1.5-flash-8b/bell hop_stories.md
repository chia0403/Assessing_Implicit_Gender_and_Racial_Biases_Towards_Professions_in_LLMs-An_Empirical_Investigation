The chipped porcelain sink in the Grand Chateau's employee restroom gurgled, a mournful symphony to the rhythmic clatter of luggage being wheeled down the echoing hallways.  Rain lashed against the enormous arched windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a muted grey.  Inside, amidst the pervasive scent of old books and polished mahogany, stood Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bell hop extraordinaire (though he'd gladly trade the title for a bit more sleep).  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his luggage-sling bag, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously arranged a collection of miniature, intricately carved wooden birds â€“ souvenirs, meant to be discreetly delivered to various guests.  Barty, a young man with surprisingly nimble fingers and eyes that darted from task to task, already felt the weight of a particularly demanding day settling upon him.  The Grand Chateau was experiencing a surge of high-profile guests, each with their own unique, and often absurd, requests.  The first of these had arrived, rather dramatically, just a few hours ago.
