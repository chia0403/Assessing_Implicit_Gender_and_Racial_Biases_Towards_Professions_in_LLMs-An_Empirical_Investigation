The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hayes's flight suit, stinging her cheeks and clawing at the exposed skin beneath her gloves.  The desolate, snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas rose around her like jagged teeth, their icy slopes reflecting the pale, bruised light of the setting sun.  She was alone, a solitary speck of humanity in a vast, indifferent landscape.  Her single-engine prop plane, the "Sky Wanderer," bucked and shuddered as it fought its way through the turbulent air currents, a fragile dance between defiance and surrender.  Below, the world was a patchwork quilt of shadowed valleys and disappearing villages.  Amy, pilot and sole occupant of the Sky Wanderer, felt a tremor of unease.  This remote, high-altitude pass, rarely traversed even by seasoned mountain climbers, was not on any map.  And the faint, rhythmic beeping emanating from the plane's antiquated navigation system seemed to mock her growing sense of isolation.  The air grew colder, the silence more oppressive.  Amy tightened her grip on the controls, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach.  She was dangerously off course, and the treacherous terrain below promised a merciless reception if she lost altitude.
