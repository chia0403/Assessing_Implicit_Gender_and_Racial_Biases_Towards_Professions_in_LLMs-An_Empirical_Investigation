The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the cracked earth of the Montana plains, stinging Amelia "Em"  Everhart's face.

Her gaze drifted to the jagged peaks of the Sapphire Mountains, a grim sentinel against the pale sky.  This was no longer the lush valley her father had known.  This was a land of hardship, and Em was determined to survive it, not just for herself, but for the future of the Everhart ranch.
