The chipped paint of the "Razor's Edge" barber shop clung to the walls like sun-baked skin. Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  A faint aroma of lavender and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the subtle scent of antiseptic.  This was the sanctuary, or rather, the makeshift haven, of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, barber extraordinaire, and the last bastion of traditional cuts in the crumbling heart of Oakhaven.  Barty, a man with a weathered face etched with the stories of countless trims, snips, and the occasional whispered secrets, hunched over his worn-out barber's chair, meticulously trimming the unruly mane of a customer.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of the clippers, a familiar lullaby in this quiet corner of the world, was the only sound that broke the stillness of the afternoon.
