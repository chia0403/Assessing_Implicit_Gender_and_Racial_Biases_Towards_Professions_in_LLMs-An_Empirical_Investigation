The fluorescent lights of the "Everyday Essentials" grocery store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's day.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy windows, cast long shadows across the aisles, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  The scent of stale coffee, cheap detergent, and something vaguely floral hung heavy in the air, a perfume unique to late-afternoon Tuesdays.  Amelia, a cashier with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of unspoken stories, scanned another plastic bag filled with ramen noodles and instant mashed potatoes.  The clatter of the register, the rhythmic beep of the scanner, the quiet murmur of customers – it was all a familiar symphony of the mundane.  Today, though, the notes seemed a little sharper, a little…off-key.  This particular Tuesday felt different, not in a dramatic way, but in the way a chipped teacup feels different from a pristine one, both holding the same liquid.
