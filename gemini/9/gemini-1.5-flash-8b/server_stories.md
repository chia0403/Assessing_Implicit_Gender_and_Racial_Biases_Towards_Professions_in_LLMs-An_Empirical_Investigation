The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones, illuminating the swirling clouds of cigarette smoke that clung to the entrance like a greasy shroud.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and cheap perfume.  Elias Thorne, a young man with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair like tangled seaweed, wiped a sticky coaster with a practiced hand.  He was a server at The Rusty Mug, a greasy spoon diner tucked away on a forgotten side street of the city, a place where the world seemed to slow to a crawl.  Tonight, it felt particularly sluggish.  The few patrons present were hunched over their mugs, lost in their own private dramas, or perhaps just in the comforting oblivion of a Tuesday night.  The chipped Formica tables, stained with countless breakfasts and spilled drinks, reflected the dim light in a disturbing mosaic.  A single, sputtering gas heater coughed in the corner, battling the chill that seemed to seep into the very bones of the establishment. The rhythmic clinking of silverware against porcelain was the only sound that broke the monotonous hum of the night.
