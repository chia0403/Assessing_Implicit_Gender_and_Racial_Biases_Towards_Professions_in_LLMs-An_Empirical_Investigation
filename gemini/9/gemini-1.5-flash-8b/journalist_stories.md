The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Spur Saloon" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorne's face, highlighting the dark circles beneath her eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the deserted main street of Dustbowl Gulch.  Dust, fine and relentless, coated everything – her worn leather jacket, the cracked asphalt beneath her boots, and the faded posters plastered onto the storefronts advertising long-forgotten saloons and fortunes found.  Dustbowl Gulch was a ghost town, a monument to forgotten dreams and busted hopes.  Amelia Hawthorne, seasoned investigative journalist for the "Prairie Post," was here to unearth a truth buried deeper than the ancient wells.

Her assignment:  a missing-persons case that had gone cold, a young rancher,  Jasper Blackwood, vanished without a trace just a month ago.  Rumours swirled like tumbleweeds in the wind – whispers of a land deal gone wrong, shady dealings with a mysterious prospector named Silas Stone, and a hidden cache of gold somewhere in the deserted canyons.  Amelia, ever the pragmatist, knew that only digging through the grimy details could reveal the truth.
