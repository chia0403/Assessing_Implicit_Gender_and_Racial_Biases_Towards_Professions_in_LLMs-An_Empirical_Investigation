The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" megastore hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Kensington's footsteps.  She navigated the labyrinthine aisles of household goods, her eyes scanning the rows of gleaming appliances, colorful cookware, and meticulously arranged textiles.  Today, the air, usually thick with the scent of freshly-waxed floors and bargain-priced perfume, was oddly still.  A low, expectant buzz seemed to emanate from the throngs of shoppers, a buzz amplified by the unsettling silence of the mannequins in the display windows, frozen mid-task like silent sentinels of a forgotten age. Amelia, a dedicated and usually cheerful salesperson, felt a prickle of unease, a feeling she couldn't quite place.  It wasn't fear, but a subtle sense of impending change, a shift in the familiar landscape of her job and, perhaps, the world around her.

The store, sprawling across three floors, housed a dizzying array of products – everything from miniature bonsai trees to oversized inflatable hot tubs.  The aroma of cinnamon and pine from the faux-wood furniture on the upper level mingled with the metallic tang of freshly-sharpened cutlery and the faint scent of cleaning fluid in the lower level's home goods department.  Sunlight, filtered through the massive skylights, cast long, dancing shadows across the tiled floors, highlighting the rows of merchandise.  This particular Saturday, the store buzzed with an unusual energy, a combination of anticipation and trepidation.  A palpable sense of something different hung heavy in the air, even as shoppers continued their usual routines – haggling over prices, comparing models, pushing shopping carts filled with potential acquisitions. Amelia, though, felt a shiver of unease, as if the very fabric of the store, the fabric of her own life, were on the verge of unraveling.
