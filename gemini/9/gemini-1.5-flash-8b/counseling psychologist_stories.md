Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, unassuming clinic, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the turmoil churning within Dr. Eleanor Vance’s chest.  The office, tucked away on a side street in the grey, perpetually overcast town of Ashwood, was a study in muted tones – muted beige walls, muted floral wallpaper, muted despair.  Sunlight, a rare visitor, struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long shadows that danced with the condensation dripping from the windowpanes.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with five years of experience, stared out at the grey landscape, the rhythmic drumming of the rain a soundtrack to her mounting anxiety.  Today, she had a new patient – a teenager named Liam, whose family had recently moved from a vibrant city life to Ashwood, a place where the only vibrant things seemed to be the perpetual rain and the whispers of rumour that followed each new arrival.
