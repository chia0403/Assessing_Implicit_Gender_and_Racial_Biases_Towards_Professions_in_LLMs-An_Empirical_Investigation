The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Ashworth's hands, the steam curling around her face like a hesitant apology.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the perpetual gloom clinging to the city, a damp blanket draped over the cobbled streets.  Amelia, a travel agent with the surprisingly cheerful moniker of "Wanderlust Whispers," surveyed her cluttered office.  Stacks of brochures, overflowing with exotic destinations, jostled for space with overflowing in-trays, each one a miniature promise of faraway lands.  Her desk, a small island in a sea of paper and travel paraphernalia, was littered with itinerary drafts, scribbled notes in various languages, and a half-eaten croissant.  Today, however, it held something more substantial than a discarded pastry wrapper:  a handwritten letter, embossed with the crest of a family she’d never met.  The address, penned in elegant script, was tucked into a sealed envelope, promising a trip she’d never anticipated.  It read:  "The Count of Veridia's Estate,  Villaggio del Sole, Italy."
