The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked alleyway.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something faintly floral, a residue from the last lingering customer.  Behind the bar, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose prematurely greying hair seemed to absorb the dim light, meticulously wiped down a glass.  He was a bartender, a chronicler of whispered secrets and silent sorrows, a confidant for the transient souls who sought refuge in the dimly lit haven of the Rusty Mug.  Tonight, however, the usual low hum of conversation was absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness, a silence thicker than the Guinness already piled high in the frosty glass tank.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the storm brewing within Barty, a storm he couldn't quite place.
