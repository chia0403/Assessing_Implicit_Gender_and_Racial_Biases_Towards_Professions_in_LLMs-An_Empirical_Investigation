The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Relly" Nightingale could conjure. Relly, owner and sole stylist of "Shear Genius," a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port city of Porthaven, was wrestling with a particularly stubborn tangle of auburn hair. The client, a frazzled woman named Mrs. Periwinkle who resembled a startled squirrel, fidgeted impatiently under the salon's single, flickering chandelier.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within Relly's own mind.  Outside, the grey North Sea churned, its waves echoing the chaotic rhythm of the city that pressed in on Porthaven's crumbling, yet charming, waterfront.  Tonight, however, the usual seaside tranquility was replaced by a palpable unease, a silence broken only by the rhythmic snip-snip of Relly's shears and the distant, mournful cry of a gull.
