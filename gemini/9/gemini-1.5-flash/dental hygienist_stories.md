The fluorescent lights of "Pearlescent Smiles Dental" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of Dr. Albright's drill echoing from the next room.  A faint scent of cinnamon and antiseptic hung in the air, a familiar aroma to Seraphina "Sera" Lancaster, RDH.  Sera, with her perpetually tired but kind eyes and hands still slightly damp from scrubbing the latest patient's teeth, meticulously arranged her instruments on the stainless steel tray.  The clock on the wall ticked impatiently towards lunchtime, a mere hour away, but the waiting room remained stubbornly full, a testament to Dr. Albright's popularity (and possibly, Sera's efficient cleaning skills).  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling street of downtown Charleston, South Carolina, its warmth a stark contrast to the cool, clinical atmosphere of the dental practice.  Today, however, the usual predictable rhythm of her workday feltâ€¦off.  A peculiar tension hung in the air, a feeling as subtle and persistent as a lingering piece of popcorn between someone's molars.
