The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, howled across the desolate moorland, whipping Elias Thorne’s thick wool cloak around him like a frantic bird.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the granite he shaped, squinted against the spitting rain.  The air, thick with the scent of peat smoke and brine from the distant, storm-tossed sea, carried the mournful cry of gulls.  He stood on the windswept cliff edge overlooking the grey, churning expanse of the North Sea, his chisel clutched loosely in his gloved hand, the unfinished head of a gargoyle half-formed in the rough-hewn block of stone before him.  The village of Portwenn, a cluster of slate-roofed cottages clinging precariously to the cliffside, was barely visible through the driving rain, a huddled, defiant testament to the unforgiving beauty of the Cornish coast.  This was Elias’s world; a world of unforgiving elements and unforgiving stone, a world where the only constant was the relentless rhythm of hammer meeting chisel.
