The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a symphony of ice groaning and metal creaking.  Snow, driven by gale-force winds, plastered itself against the reinforced windows of his cramped laboratory, obscuring the already limited view of the desolate, white landscape.
