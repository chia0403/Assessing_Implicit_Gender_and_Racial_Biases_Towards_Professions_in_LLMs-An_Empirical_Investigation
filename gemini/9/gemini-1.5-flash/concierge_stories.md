The scent of aged leather and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting aroma to Aurelia "Auri" Moreau.  Rain lashed against the towering glass windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, blurring the already hazy Parisian night into a shimmering, indistinct canvas.  Auri, the hotel's concierge, perched on her high stool behind the meticulously polished mahogany desk, its surface gleaming under the soft glow of the desk lamp. The worn leather of her favorite chair creaked a subtle protest under her weight as she meticulously checked her schedule, the crisp white paper practically vibrating with the weight of expectation. Tonight, the Grand Majestic was buzzing with a particularly exclusive clientele: a film premiere, a high-stakes business negotiation, and a whispered rumour of a clandestine meeting between two notoriously elusive art collectors.  It was, in short, a perfect night for chaos, and Auri, with a sigh of quiet satisfaction, prepared to navigate it all.
