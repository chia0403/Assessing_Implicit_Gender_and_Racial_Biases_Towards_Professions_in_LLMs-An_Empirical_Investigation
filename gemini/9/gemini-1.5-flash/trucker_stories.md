The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the "Desert Bloom," its chrome gleaming dully under the bruised purple light of the pre-dawn sky.  Around him, the Nevada desert stretched, a vast, unforgiving canvas painted in shades of ochre and grey.  Jagged mountains, silhouetted against the lightening east, clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers.  The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and the metallic tang of exhaust fumes, a familiar perfume to Bart, one that had permeated his life for the last twenty years.  He was alone, miles from the nearest town, the only sound the rhythmic hum of the tires on the blacktop and the insistent whisper of the wind whistling through the gaps in his rig's aging chassis.  This was his domain, a landscape both beautiful and brutal, a place where a man could be lost and found all in the same breath.  This morning, Bart Higgins was lost in thought, lost in the miles, and utterly lost in the weight of a secret heâ€™d been carrying for far too long.
