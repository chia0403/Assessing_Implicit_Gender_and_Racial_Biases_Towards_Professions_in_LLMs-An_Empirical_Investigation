The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the easel into position.  The canvas, a pristine expanse of heavy linen, remained stubbornly blank, a stark contrast to the riotous colours exploding across the cliffs of Cornwall.  Below, the Atlantic roared its disapproval of the encroaching twilight, churning whitecaps against the jagged rocks like a frothing, angry beast.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls, a melancholic soundtrack to Amelia’s struggle.  Her small, weather-beaten cottage, barely clinging to the cliffside, seemed a fragile sentinel against the raw power of the sea, a reflection perhaps, of the fragile state of her own artistic spirit.
