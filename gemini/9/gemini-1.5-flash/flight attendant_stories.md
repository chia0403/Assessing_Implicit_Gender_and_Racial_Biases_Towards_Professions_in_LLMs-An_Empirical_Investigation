The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera”  Montgomery.  It clung to the plush, navy-blue fabric of her uniform, clinging like the persistent anxiety that gnawed at the edges of her usually cheerful disposition.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Denver International Airport bled from bruised purple to a hesitant, watery grey.  The colossal terminal, a concrete behemoth humming with a low, almost imperceptible thrum of activity, was still largely shrouded in the quiet before the storm – the storm of early morning departures, that is.  Sera, however, felt a different kind of tempest brewing, a personal one that had nothing to do with delayed flights or unruly passengers.  It started subtly, a prickle at the back of her neck, a disquieting premonition that settled deep in her bones, whispering warnings she couldn't quite decipher.  This wasn't just another Tuesday morning flight to Chicago.  This felt… different.
