The salt spray kissed Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s face as she hauled the last crate of day-old sourdough onto the rickety dock.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, hung heavy above the churning grey waters of the Bristol Channel.  Port Gaverne, a cluster of weather-beaten houses clinging to a cliff face like barnacles to a hull, was a far cry from the Michelin-starred kitchens Amy had left behind in London.  But the promise of a life less frantic, a life closer to the source of her ingredients, had lured her to this remote Cornish village, where the only sounds louder than the seagulls were the rhythmic clang of the fishing boats and the insistent whisper of the wind.  Her new restaurant, "The Mariner's Kettle," sat nestled between a fishmonger's and a wool shop, its freshly painted blue sign a vibrant splash of colour against the muted tones of the village.  Inside, the aroma of baking bread and simmering seafood hinted at the culinary revolution Amy was about to unleash on Port Gaverne.
