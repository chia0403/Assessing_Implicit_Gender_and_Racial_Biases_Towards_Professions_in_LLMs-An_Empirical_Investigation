The biting wind whipped at Silas Blackwood's beard, stinging his cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn, leather-lined coat, the smell of pine and damp earth clinging to its fabric like a second skin.  Around him, the ancient Redwood forest of Northern California stood sentinel, a cathedral of towering giants that scraped the bruised, twilight sky.  Silas, his face weathered like driftwood and his hands calloused as granite, paused on the snow-dusted logging road, the growl of his chainsaw still echoing in the stillness.  The air, usually thick with the scent of sap and wood resin, was today thin and sharp with the promise of a blizzard.  His breath plumed out before him, a ghostly white in the gathering gloom, as he surveyed the behemoths he'd felled that day â€“ giants that had stood for centuries, now lying prone, their lives abruptly ended by the sharp bite of steel.  Tonight, the forest felt less like a workplace and more like a graveyard.
