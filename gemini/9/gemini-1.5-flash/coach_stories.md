The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's hair across her face as she surveyed the windswept lacrosse field.  Frozen breath plumed from her lips, mirroring the ghostly exhalations of the few hardy souls still practicing their stickwork under the fading light.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of the field clawed at the bruised purple sky, their silhouettes sharp against the encroaching twilight.  This was the end of the season, the bitter end, for the struggling girls' varsity lacrosse team at Northwood High, and Amy, their head coach, felt the chill seep deeper than the bone-numbing wind. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled the air, a stark counterpoint to the vibrant green of the field, a vibrant green that felt more like a mocking reminder of the lost summer and the lost season.
