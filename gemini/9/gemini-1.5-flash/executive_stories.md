The air in Amelia Katherine Hayesâ€™s corner office hung thick with the scent of expensive leather and simmering resentment.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the fifty-second floor, blurring the cityscape of Chicago into a hazy, impressionistic painting of grey and black.  Amelia, CEO of Hayes Global Investments, stared out at the storm, her reflection a stark counterpoint to the turbulent weather outside.  The polished mahogany of her desk gleamed under the soft light, reflecting the sharp angles of her jaw and the steely glint in her usually warm hazel eyes.  Tonight, however, warmth was absent, replaced by a chilling determination that mirrored the storm raging beyond the glass.  The hushed silence of the empty office was broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a relentless soundtrack to the impending confrontation that loomed larger than the Chicago skyline itself.
