The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Blackwood's exposed cheeks as she navigated the dew-slicked paths of Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary.  A symphony of chirps and rustles, the usual pre-sunrise chorus of the sanctuary, was punctuated by the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of a particularly disgruntled capybara stamping its oversized feet.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and something faintlyâ€¦musky.  Elara, bundled in layers of fleece and practical waterproofs, smiled despite the cold.  Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was her kingdom, a sprawling haven teeming with rescued and rehabilitated creatures, both big and small, each with their own unique demands and personalities.  Today, however, promised to be particularly challenging.  A new arrival, a notoriously temperamental snow leopard, was due to be transferred from the Portland Zoo, and Elara, the head animal caretaker, felt the familiar knot of responsibility tighten in her stomach.
