The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s weathered Cessna 185, a song punctuated by the rhythmic crunch of skis on the freshly fallen snow.  Evie, bundled in layers of fleece and Gore-Tex, squinted through the swirling blizzard, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The small airstrip at Kwethluk, nestled precariously between the Kuskokwim River and a sprawling expanse of birch forest, was barely visible through the whiteout.  It was late January, the heart of winter, and the air hung heavy with the scent of pine and the metallic tang of frozen river.  This wasn't just a flight; it was a battle against the elements, a dance with death performed every day by those who dared to call the Alaskan wilderness their office.
