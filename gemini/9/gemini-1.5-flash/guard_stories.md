The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and something else… something metallic and faintly sickening.  A lone raven, black as midnight oil, circled overhead, its harsh cry echoing the unease that gnawed at  Sergeant Valerius Thorne's gut.  Valerius, a man carved from granite and seasoned by fifteen years on the border patrol, tightened his grip on the worn leather of his scabbard. The wind howled like a banshee, a fitting soundtrack to the desolate, snow-dusted outpost he called home – Fort Bastion, the last line of defense against the encroaching Shadowlands.  The flickering torchlight cast long, dancing shadows across the rough-hewn timber walls, highlighting the weariness etched into the faces of his fellow guards.  Tonight, the usual unease felt… different.  Heavier.  More ominous.
