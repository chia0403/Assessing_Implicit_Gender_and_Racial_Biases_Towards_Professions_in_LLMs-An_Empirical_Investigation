The chipped paint on the windowsill was the first thing Aurelia “Relia” Beaumont noticed, a tiny detail lost amidst the opulent chaos of Lord Ashworth’s drawing-room.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun struggling through the grimy panes, danced in the air, a silent ballet performed amongst velvet drapes the colour of a bruise and furniture so heavily gilded it seemed to groan under its own weight.  Relia, owner of Beaumont & Bloom Interiors, sighed, the scent of aged leather and decaying lilies doing little to improve her already frayed mood.  The Ashworth estate, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the tempestuous North Sea, was a monument to both grandeur and neglect; a fitting metaphor, she thought wryly, for her current client.
