The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air, a strange but oddly comforting perfume that clung to everything in "Shear Perfection," Amelia Jane Fitzwilliam's tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually rain-misted city of York.  Rain, a constant companion in this corner of England, drummed a steady rhythm against the leaded glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow spilling from the nearby pub.  Inside, Amelia, her hands stained a faint, henna-red from a recent dye job gone slightly awry, meticulously swept stray strands of hair from the worn, cherry-wood floor. The air thrummed with the quiet hum of a vintage hairdryer and the barely audible tick-tock of a grandfather clock that had probably witnessed more than its fair share of bad haircuts and broken hearts.
