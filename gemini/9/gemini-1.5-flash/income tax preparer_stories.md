The fluorescent lights of Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth's tiny tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the chaotic symphony of crumpled receipts, overflowing file folders, and the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window of her storefront in the somewhat-seedy, but undeniably charming,  historic district of Willow Creek, Oregon. The air smelled faintly of old paper, stale coffee, and the lingering scent of last year's peppermint mocha – a testament to the long hours Bea had endured during tax season.  Outside, the ancient oaks of Willow Creek Park swayed dramatically under the onslaught of the storm, their branches like gnarled fingers scratching at the bruised twilight sky.  Tonight, however, the storm raging outside was nothing compared to the one brewing inside Bea's heart.  A particularly thorny case – involving a suspiciously profitable alpaca farm – had her on the edge of a migraine.
