The wind, a rasping, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorneâ€™s weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Frost, a cruel sculptor, had etched intricate patterns onto the dying stalks of corn, transforming the once-golden expanse into a brittle, silver tapestry.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, pulled his worn wool cap lower, the thick fabric doing little to ward off the biting November chill that permeated the air of the Cumberland Valley.  The valley itself, usually a picture of bucolic serenity, was now a landscape of muted greys and browns, the vibrant hues of autumn long since faded, replaced by the stark promise of a harsh winter.  His farmhouse, a sturdy stone structure perched on a slight rise overlooking the land, seemed a distant, lonely beacon in the encroaching gloom.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the frozen ground, emphasizing the isolation of Elias Thorne and his struggling farm.
