The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to the plush velvet chairs and the chipped porcelain sink of Serenity Nails.  Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering, almost blinding expanse.  But inside, nestled between a bustling Italian restaurant and a vintage clothing boutique, a quiet hum of activity prevailed.  Amelia Hernandez, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of colours from a recent French manicure marathon, delicately filed the edge of a perfectly sculpted almond nail.  The rhythmic rasp of the file was a counterpoint to the rhythmic pulse of salsa music drifting from the restaurant next door, a familiar soundtrack to Amelia's life in South Beach.  Her small salon, a testament to years of hard work and a stubborn refusal to give up on her dreams, was her sanctuary, a tiny island of calm in the chaotic ocean of South Florida life.
