He sighed, pushing a stray strand of sandy blonde hair from his forehead, and adjusted his already sweat-dampened shirt.  Another sweltering day in paradise, and another appointment looming. This time, it was old Mrs. Higgins, and Alistair braced himself for the inevitable tale of her latest fishing trip, interwoven with complaints about a particularly stubborn molar.
