The chipped ceramic mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the gnawing anxiety that had settled in her stomach since sunrise.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Seattle.  Grey, perpetually overcast skies were a familiar comfort in this city, but today, the relentless downpour mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.  Her office, perched on the 27th floor of the sleek, glass-and-steel Zenith Tower, usually offered a calming vista – a sea of twinkling lights at night, a breathtaking panorama of Puget Sound during the day. But today, even the majestic Mount Rainier, usually a steadfast sentinel in the distance, was obscured by a thick veil of rain and mist.  Eleanor, usually a bastion of calm and rational thought for her clients, felt utterly adrift. The silence in her meticulously organized office, usually a haven of peaceful contemplation, pressed down on her like the heavy, wet air outside.  Today, her own carefully constructed walls felt dangerously close to crumbling.
