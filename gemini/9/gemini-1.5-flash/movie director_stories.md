The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate landscape.  Grey, churning clouds hung low over the skeletal remains of a once-grand Victorian mansion, its gothic turrets clawing at the bruised sky like skeletal fingers.  Thorns, thick as a man’s wrist, snaked across the crumbling stone walls, weaving a tapestry of decay that mirrored the fractured state of her latest project, "The Raven's Shadow."  This wasn't some picturesque English countryside; this was Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the brooding, windswept moors of Dartmoor, Devon, a location chosen less for its beauty and more for its unsettling, perfect atmosphere of gothic dread.  The film, a period horror piece, was already a month behind schedule, the budget hemorrhaging faster than a severed artery, and the lead actor, a notoriously temperamental thespian named Julian Thorne, was threatening to walk.  Mia pulled her heavy wool coat tighter, the chill seeping into her bones as she muttered a silent prayer for a miracle – or at least, a functioning heating system.
