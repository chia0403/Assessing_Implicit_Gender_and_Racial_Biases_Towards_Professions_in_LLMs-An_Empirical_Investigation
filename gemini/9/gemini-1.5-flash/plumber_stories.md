The flickering neon sign of "Joe's 24-Hour Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven.  The downpour, a relentless sheet of water mirroring the anxieties churning inside him, hammered against the corrugated iron roof above.  Thirty-year-old Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose calloused hands spoke of years spent wrestling with recalcitrant pipes and temperamental boilers, stared out at the storm.  His usually jovial face, framed by a week's worth of stubble, was etched with weariness.  The pungent aroma of stale coffee and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that clung to him like a second skin, a constant reminder of the long, lonely nights spent battling the city's plumbing woes.  Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of a sprawling metropolis, was a labyrinth of aging infrastructure and unpredictable plumbing emergencies â€“ Barty's domain, and his burden. Tonight, the burden felt particularly heavy.  The phone hadn't rung in hours, a silence more unnerving than the relentless drumming of the rain.
