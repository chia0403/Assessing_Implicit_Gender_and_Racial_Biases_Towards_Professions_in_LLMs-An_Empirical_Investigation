The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez's hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the pre-dawn chill that clung to the air like stubborn morning mist.  Outside her small, cluttered cottage, nestled deep within the redwood-shadowed hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the fog still clung to the cypress trees, their dark silhouettes stark against the nascent light.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore provided a constant, almost hypnotic soundtrack to the quiet solitude she cherished before the school day began.  Amelia, a high school English teacher at the prestigious, and perpetually stressed, Redwood Coast Academy, usually found this pre-dawn hour her only sanctuary, a fleeting moment of peace before the tidal wave of teenage anxieties and Shakespearean sonnets crashed over her.  Today, however, the usual tranquility felt tinged with a nervous anticipation. Something felt different, a subtle shift in the air, heavier than the fog, colder than the ocean breeze.
