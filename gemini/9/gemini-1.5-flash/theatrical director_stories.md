The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy stage door open.  Rain, a relentless, sideways deluge, plastered her already damp trench coat to her back.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a fitting aroma for the crumbling Victorian theatre that was her current obsession – the Grand Majestic Playhouse.  Its once-glorious façade, now chipped and stained, hinted at a past glory Amelia was determined to resurrect.  Inside, the cavernous space yawned before her, a skeletal frame of dusty velvet curtains, faded gilt, and the ghostly echo of a thousand forgotten performances.  The only light came from a single flickering bulb hanging precariously above the stage, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling dust motes.  Tonight, the Grand Majestic felt less like a theatre and more like a mausoleum, waiting for Amelia to breathe life back into its silent heart.
