The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the biting November wind rattling the windowpanes of "Petal Pushers," Aurelia Clementine Thorne's flower shop.

The shop, a charming if slightly dilapidated Victorian building nestled in the heart of Greyhaven, was usually bustling with the fragrance of a thousand blooms. Tonight, however, a lonely stillness reigned, broken only by the whisper of the wind and the occasional mournful chirp of a stray sparrow seeking shelter in the eaves.
