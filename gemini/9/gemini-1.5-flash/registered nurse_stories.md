Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic drone as Nurse Amelia Grace Dubois wrestled the stubborn oak door of the old plantation house open.  Rusting hinges protested with a shriek that echoed across the overgrown lawn, a counterpoint to the mournful cooing of doves hidden amongst the Spanish moss dripping from the ancient live oaks.  The house itself, Belle Reve, stood slumped in a posture of faded grandeur, its once-proud columns leaning like weary sentinels, the paint peeling from its once-white façade in ragged strips like sunburnt skin.
