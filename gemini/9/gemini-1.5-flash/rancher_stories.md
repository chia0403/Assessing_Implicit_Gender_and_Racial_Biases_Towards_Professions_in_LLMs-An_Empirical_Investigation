The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved the Wyoming landscape into a masterpiece of harsh beauty.  Jagged peaks, dusted with the first snowfall of autumn, clawed at a sky the color of bruised plums. Below, the sprawling ranch of the Broken Spur spread out like a rumpled, brown blanket, its fences a fragile scribble against the immensity of the land.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and despair, danced across the parched earth, mirroring the turmoil in the heart of Silas “Si” Blackwood, a man as weathered and rugged as the land he owned.  Si, at sixty-two, had seen more sunsets than most men, and each one seemed to etch another line onto his face, a map of hardship and resilience etched deep into his leathery skin.  The biting wind whipped at his worn Stetson, a familiar companion in this unforgiving land.
