The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the stubborn key into the lock of her clinic.  “Back in the saddle again,” she muttered, shoving the icy metal deeper into the worn brass.  The weathered clapboard of the building groaned a sympathetic sigh under the onslaught of the gale.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and old pine – a comforting, familiar aroma that always managed to chase away the chill, at least for a little while.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was picturesque, especially in its autumnal glory. But tonight, under the bruised purple sky, it felt isolated, even vulnerable.  The only sounds were the relentless wind howling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Main Street and the rhythmic creak of the clinic's sign, a hand-painted depiction of a perfectly aligned spine, swinging precariously in the storm.  Eleanor Vance, D.C., braced herself for another night of battling not only aching backs, but also the ever-present aches of a small-town life.
