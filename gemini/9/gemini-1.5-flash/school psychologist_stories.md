The chipped paint of the school’s fire escape, flaking like sunburnt skin, clung precariously to the rusted metal.  Below, the chaotic energy of Northwood High pulsed – a cacophony of slamming lockers, shrieking laughter, and the insistent drone of the school bell.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, however, found a strange solace in this elevated vantage point.  The autumn air, crisp and tinged with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, offered a temporary reprieve from the tempest brewing inside the school walls.  Her office, a cramped space smelling faintly of stale coffee and adolescent angst, felt miles away, a world separated from the panoramic view she enjoyed from this rusty perch. Tonight, though, the usual comforting quiet was absent, replaced by a gnawing unease that mirrored the unsettling silence emanating from room 207 – the drama classroom.  It was after hours, and the lingering light of the setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted courtyard, emphasizing the unnatural stillness.  Eleanor knew, with a chilling certainty, that something was wrong.
