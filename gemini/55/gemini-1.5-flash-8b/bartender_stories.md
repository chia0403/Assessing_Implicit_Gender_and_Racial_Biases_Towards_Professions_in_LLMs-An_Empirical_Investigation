The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's face, highlighting the smudges of ink under her eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a swirling vortex of cigarette smoke and hushed voices.  The bar, a cramped, dimly lit space crammed with chipped Formica tables and mismatched chairs, smelled faintly of stale beer and desperation.  Tonight, the regulars—a motley crew of weary truckers, lonely housewives, and lost souls—were unusually quiet.  A low hum, like a disturbed beehive, permeated the air, a tension thicker than the Guinness slowly settling in the bottom of a frosted glass.  Milly, with her perpetually tired smile and the practiced ease of a seasoned sailor navigating a stormy sea, expertly poured a shot of whiskey.  The clink of glass echoed uncomfortably in the stillness.  This was her world, this claustrophobic haven of whispered secrets and fleeting moments, where she was both a witness and a silent confidante.
