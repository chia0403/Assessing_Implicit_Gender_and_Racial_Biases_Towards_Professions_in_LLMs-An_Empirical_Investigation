Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Glittering Gems" jewelry store, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Stone.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sickly yellow glow over the meticulously arranged displays of sparkling gemstones.  Amy, a seasoned salesperson with a polished smile that often masked a simmering frustration, stared at the meticulously crafted emerald necklace.  It was a showpiece, a masterpiece of artistry and unparalleled value, yet it sat stubbornly untouched.  The store, a cramped space in the heart of the bustling, yet oddly melancholic, city of Aethelgard, was a testament to the slow death of a once-thriving business district.  Empty storefronts lined the cobblestones, mirroring the hollow feeling in Amy's chest.  Today felt like the last day of a long, agonizing summer, the air thick with the unspoken desperation of a dying economy.  The necklace, glittering mockingly, seemed to mock her very existence as a salesperson.
