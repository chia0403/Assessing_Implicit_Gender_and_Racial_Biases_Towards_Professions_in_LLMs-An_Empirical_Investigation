The biting London wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's trench coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered the brick walls and sent shivers down her spine, not just from the cold, but from the growing dread.  She clutched a battered, leather-bound notebook, its pages filled with frantic scribbles and frantic thoughts, the only warmth against the chill.  Above, the gargoyles on the decaying cathedral seemed to mock her, their stone faces etched with centuries of suffering and indifference, just like the studio executives she was about to confront.  Amy, Director of Visual Storytelling at the prestigious but creatively stagnant Nightingale Productions, knew this meeting could be her last.

**Setting:**  A damp, cobbled alleyway in the historic, yet decaying, heart of London's Soho district, leading to the imposing gothic grandeur of a centuries-old cathedral. The air is thick with the smell of rain and damp earth.  Inside, the cramped and dimly lit offices of Nightingale Productions are a world of hushed conversations and meticulously planned (but ultimately uninspired) commercial projects.
