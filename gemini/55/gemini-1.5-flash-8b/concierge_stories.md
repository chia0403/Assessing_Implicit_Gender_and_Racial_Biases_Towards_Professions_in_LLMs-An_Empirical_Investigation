The rain hammered against the slate roof of the Blackwood Manor, a symphony of relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s chest.  The year was 1928.  A biting wind, laden with the scent of pine and damp earth, howled through the ancient oaks that framed the sprawling estate.  Amelia Blackwood, Concierge of Blackwood Manor, stood at the grand oak door, her tailored tweed coat clinging to her frame, her gloved hands clasped tightly.  The air itself seemed to vibrate with an unspoken tension, a palpable premonition of something extraordinary about to unfold.  Inside, the opulent drawing-room, usually a beacon of warm hospitality, felt strangely hushed, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floor.  Amelia, known throughout the estate as "Miss Millie," felt the weight of the manor's history pressing down on her. She was responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of this labyrinthine residence, the perfect orchestration of the lives of its powerful and often eccentric inhabitants.  But tonight, the expected flow of the manor's carefully regulated routine was disrupted, and Millie felt a tremor of apprehension.  The guests were expected any minute, and she knew, with a sickening certainty, that something was terribly amiss.
