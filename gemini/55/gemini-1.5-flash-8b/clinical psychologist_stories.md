Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the waiting room, highlighting the anxious fidgeting of a young woman with eyes that held the weight of unspoken burdens.  This was the sixth session with Maya Sharma today, and Eleanor felt the familiar, heavy pressure of her profession tightening around her.  The clinic, tucked away on a quiet side street of the city's sprawling, forgotten industrial zone, felt more like a refuge from the clamor of the outside world than a place of healing.   Dusty, chipped paint clung to the walls, a stark contrast to the polished professionalism Eleanor meticulously maintained in her own, more privileged spaces.  The smell of stale coffee and antiseptic hung in the air, a constant reminder of the human trials played out within these four walls.  Each session felt like wading through quicksand, trying to find solid ground in the swirling depths of Maya's complex emotional landscape.
