The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floor of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral insects, swirled in the air, clinging to the elaborate carvings of the antique furniture.  A lone figure, Amelia Peabody, moved with a silent grace through the cavernous rooms, her movements as precise as the ticking grandfather clock in the hall.  Amelia, a housekeeper for the Blackwood family for the past fifteen years, knew this house like the back of her hand, its secrets whispered in the creaks of the floorboards, the rustling of forgotten papers in the attic. Tonight, though, a different kind of quiet hung in the air, a hush that felt heavy, unnatural, unlike the familiar rhythm of the Blackwood household.
