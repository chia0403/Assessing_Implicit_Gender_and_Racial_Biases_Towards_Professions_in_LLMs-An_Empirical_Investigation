The biting wind whipped Amelia Beatrice Finch's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the abandoned Blackwood Quarry.  The ochre dust, stirred by the relentless gusts, coated everything in a fine film, obscuring the already faded grandeur of the once-celebrated landmark.  Amelia, her voice a comforting warmth against the chill, adjusted the microphone clip on her lapel.

"Welcome, esteemed guests, to the echoes of Blackwood.  A place where history whispers in the cavernous silence and the very stones hold secrets," she announced, her voice carrying surprisingly well over the wind's howl.  "Today, we delve into the twilight of a forgotten era, a time when giants sculpted the earth and whispered legends into the wind."

Amelia’s tour group, a motley collection of tourists huddled closer together for warmth, shifted uncomfortably beneath their thick jackets.  The early November sun, barely visible behind a curtain of clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the quarry’s yawning mouth.  Cobwebs, thick as shrouds, hung like ghostly tapestries from the skeletal remains of the machinery – rusted cranes, fractured conveyors, and crumbling, moss-covered support beams.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else...something metallic and strangely sweet.  It was a smell Amelia recognized, a familiar companion in her years of exploring Blackwood.  This, she knew, was going to be a different kind of tour.
