The biting wind, a relentless, sandpaper whisper, clawed at Amelia Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  She squinted against the swirling snow, the muted grey landscape blurring into a monochrome canvas.  The only colours visible were the vibrant, almost shocking, fluorescent orange of the safety vest she wore and the sickly yellow of the hazard lights blinking intermittently on the abandoned stretch of highway, stretching like a severed artery across the desolate plains.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the state Department of Transportation, knew this stretch of I-95 as well as the lines on her own hands.  It was a graveyard of forgotten dreams, a place where the silence screamed louder than any car horn.  This was her beat, her responsibility, her solitary symphony of winter maintenance.
