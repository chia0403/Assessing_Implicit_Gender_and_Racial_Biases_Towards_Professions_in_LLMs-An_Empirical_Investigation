The crisp autumn air, scented with woodsmoke and fallen leaves, whipped around Elara Nightingale as she wrestled a stubborn maple branch into submission.  Sunlight, fractured by the skeletal branches overhead, painted the overgrown estate garden in shifting patterns of gold and russet.  Ivy, thick as a python, clawed at the stone walls, mirroring the relentless grip of the overgrown hydrangeas that threatened to swallow the remaining flowerbeds whole.  This was Blackwood Manor, a place that whispered tales of faded grandeur and forgotten fortunes.  Elara, her name a whisper of delicate beauty, felt a familiar pang of melancholy as she surveyed the neglected landscape, a landscape that mirrored the quiet turmoil within her.  She was Elara Nightingale, a landscaper with a talent for coaxing life from the dead, a gift that seemed strangely inadequate in the face of this sprawling, dying estate.  Her weathered leather gloves, stained with the earth's rich hues, were a testament to hours spent coaxing beauty from the harsh realities of nature.
