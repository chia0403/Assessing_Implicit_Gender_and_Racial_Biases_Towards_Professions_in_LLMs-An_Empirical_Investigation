Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Crestwood High Guidance Office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Everett's thoughts.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile beige walls, highlighting the mountain of paperwork piled haphazardly on her desk.  Each manila folder felt like a weight, a silent accusation of student struggles, academic anxieties, and the often-unfathomable paths of teenage lives.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of day that sucked the joy from even the most optimistic soul, and Amy, Guidance Counselor extraordinaire (though she doubted the "extraordinaire" part these days), felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful soundtrack to the growing sense of impending doom.

Crestwood High was a sprawling institution, its concrete and steel architecture reflecting the town's own muted ambition.  The campus, once vibrant with the promise of youth, now felt stale, echoing with the hushed whispers of missed opportunities and unspoken fears. The vast expanse of the parking lot, normally filled with the clatter of departing students, was now eerily empty, shrouded in the oppressive grey.  The only sounds were the relentless rain and the rhythmic click-clack of Amy's worn-out heels against the linoleum floor as she moved through the corridors, each step weighted by the weight of the school's unspoken anxieties.
