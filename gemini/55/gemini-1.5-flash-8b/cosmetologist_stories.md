The scent of lavender and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Gilded Curl," a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Old Town Verona.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the ornate stained-glass window depicting a stylized phoenix, its flames mirroring the fiery highlights in the hair of Isabella Rossi, the salon's resident expert cosmetologist.  Isabella, with her signature crimson-red lipstick and eyes perpetually shadowed with a smoky grey, was meticulously applying a streak of shimmering amethyst toner to a section of dark brown hair, her movements precise and practiced.  Outside, the clanging of wrought iron from a nearby blacksmith echoed through the narrow street, punctuated by the melodic trill of a distant street organ.  It was a Tuesday, a day usually quiet enough to allow Isabella to lose herself in the subtle symphony of the salon â€“ the gentle whirring of the hair dryers, the murmured conversations of clients, the distinct *snap* of the scissors.
