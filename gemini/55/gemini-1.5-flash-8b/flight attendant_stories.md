The fluorescent lights of the economy cabin hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Carter's life for the past six months.  She adjusted the frayed hem of her uniform, the crimson of the airline logo a stark contrast to the grey monotony of the cramped aisle.  Outside, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas, a breathtaking vista, were shrouded in a thick, swirling mist, a stark reminder of the vastness of the world and the insignificance of her own daily routine.

The plane, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, was a shimmering behemoth of polished aluminum and technological marvels, yet its interior felt suffocating, especially in the suffocatingly humid climate of the upper plains she was crossing. Amy's tiny cubicle of a workspace, just barely large enough to accommodate her, was her temporary sanctuary from the constant clatter, the hushed whispers, and the general anxiety that always seemed to permeate the air on transcontinental flights.   The relentless drone of the engines, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of her shoes on the polished floor, was her constant companion.  She was a tiny speck in a vast, intricate machine, a cog in a colossal wheel, yet she was remarkably aware of her every single action, and each interaction with the passengers under her care.  This particular flight, from Kathmandu to Delhi, promised to be no different.
