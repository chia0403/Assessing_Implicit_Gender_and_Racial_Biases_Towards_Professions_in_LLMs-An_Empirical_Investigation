The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Metropolis Museum of Natural History hummed a mournful tune, echoing the lonely rustle of dust motes dancing in the late afternoon sunbeams.  Dust, in fact, was Elias Blackwood's domain.  Elias Blackwood, custodian and janitor, was the silent guardian of the museum's forgotten corners, the unseen hand that kept the petrified wonders of the world from succumbing entirely to the creeping embrace of time.  His uniform, a faded navy blue with grease stains the color of burnt umber, felt almost like a second skin.  Today, the air hung heavy with the smell of old paper and beeswax, a scent that Elias knew intimately, a comforting companion in the otherwise cavernous silence of the museum.  The grand hall, usually bustling with families and school groups, was eerily empty, the only sound the faint drip-drip-drip of water somewhere in the labyrinthine bowels of the building.  Elias, with his worn leather-bound logbook clutched in his hand, felt a prickle of something akin to anticipation â€“ a feeling as unusual as a dinosaur bone found in the children's play area.  He'd been at the museum for over two decades, and a change of pace was as welcome as a rare display.
