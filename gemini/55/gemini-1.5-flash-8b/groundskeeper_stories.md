Dust motes, caught in the late afternoon sun, danced in the air around her as she meticulously pruned the hydrangeas.  A symphony of cicadas buzzed in the overgrown laurel bushes bordering the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor, a symphony only Elara seemed to hear above the rhythmic click of her clippers.  Sheâ€™d been groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for fifteen years, a lifetime in the eyes of the world, but a blink in the eyes of time itself.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece perched atop a hill overlooking the misty valley, felt ancient, steeped in history and whispered secrets, a constant, looming presence that seemed to watch her every move.  Elara felt a familiar pang of melancholy, a feeling as inevitable as the setting sun.  The ivy, she noticed, was starting to creep across the stone steps leading to the front door, a subtle but insistent encroachment.  It was a slow, silent war, and Elara, armed only with her clippers and a quiet determination, was its only defender.
