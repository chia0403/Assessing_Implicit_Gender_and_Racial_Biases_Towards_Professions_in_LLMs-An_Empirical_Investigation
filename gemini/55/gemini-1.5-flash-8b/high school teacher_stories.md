The fluorescent lights of Ms. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's classroom hummed, a constant, irritating thrum that seemed to amplify the restless energy of her eleventh-grade English students.  Books lay scattered across desks, papers littered the floor like fallen leaves in autumn.  Amy, perched precariously on the edge of her desk, stared at a crumpled piece of paper, the words "My life is pointless," scrawled across it in shaky, almost desperate, handwriting.  It was a phrase she'd heard whispered around the school hallways, a murmur of despair that resonated in the hollow echo of the high school's cavernous halls.

The setting was a typical, if somewhat dilapidated, American high school in the sleepy town of Oakhaven.  Grey, overcast skies mirrored the mood of the students, clinging heavy to the late October air.  The smell of stale coffee and old textbooks hung thick in the air, mingling with the sharp scent of disinfectant that seemed to cling to everything in the building.  Oakhaven High, nestled amongst the sprawling, slightly dilapidated houses, felt like a relic of a bygone era â€“ a relic of a life Amy had once envisioned for herself, a life very different from the one she was living now.
