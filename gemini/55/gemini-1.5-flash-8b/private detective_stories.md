Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Emerald City" detective agency, blurring the already-faint neon glow of the sign.  Inside, Amelia "Ace" Carmichael, a private investigator with a sharp wit and sharper elbows, hunched over a chipped Formica table, meticulously examining a series of faded photographs.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar companion to Ace in her cramped, but surprisingly comforting, office.  The city of Veridian, nestled in the shadow of the towering, perpetually overcast Mount Zenith, was a crucible of secrets, and Ace was its designated crucible-cleaner.

The setting was Veridian, a sprawling metropolis known more for its sprawling, industrial slums than for its gleaming skyscrapers.  The city's heart, the shimmering but ultimately hollow Veridian Plaza, was a world apart from the alleyways where Ace spent her days.  Tall, skeletal buildings, their facades scarred by time and neglect, housed countless shops and clandestine operations. The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and cheap incense, hung heavy over the cobbled streets, mirroring the tension Ace felt beneath her surface calm. Mount Zenith, a jagged mountain range cloaked in perpetual cloud, loomed over the city like a watchful, disapproving eye.  This was where she'd found herself embroiled in another case, another tangled web of lies and deceit.
