Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Alistair Finch's clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing ache in his own temples.  The small, cluttered office, situated on the edge of the town of Oakhaven, smelled faintly of antiseptic and damp earth.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a chipped porcelain mug filled with lukewarm chamomile tea beside a stack of x-ray films.  Alistair, a chiropractor with a practiced stillness that rarely wavered, hunched over a patient chart, the flickering fluorescent light casting long, dancing shadows across his weary face.  His brow was furrowed, not with pain, but with the familiar frustration of a seemingly intractable problem.  The patient, a wiry woman named Eleanor Vance, had been experiencing inexplicable back pain for weeks, and Alistair, despite his best efforts, couldn't pinpoint the source.  The problem, he suspected, ran deeper than any simple misalignment.  Outside, the storm raged on, a storm both literal and metaphorical, threatening to engulf Oakhaven in an unforgiving downpour.
