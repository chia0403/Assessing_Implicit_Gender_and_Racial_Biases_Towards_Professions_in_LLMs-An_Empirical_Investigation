The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gavel" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Stone's face, highlighting the tired circles beneath her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, ramshackle diner, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the thoughts churning in her head.  Outside, the sprawling, rust-colored expanse of the abandoned Blackwood Mine loomed, a silent, brooding presence against the bruised twilight sky.  Amelia, a reporter for the *Dust Bowl Daily*, hunched over a chipped Formica table, her fingers drumming a frantic tattoo on the sticky surface. The aroma of stale coffee and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this desolate corner of the Colorado prairie.

Thorne had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a lingering sense of dread that clung to the abandoned mine like dust to a forgotten photograph.
