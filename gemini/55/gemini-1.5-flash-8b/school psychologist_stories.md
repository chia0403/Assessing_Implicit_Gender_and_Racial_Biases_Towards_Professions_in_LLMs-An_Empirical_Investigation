Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and stale coffee, hung heavy in the small, windowless office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a scattering of crumpled papers and half-eaten granola bars on her cluttered desk. Eleanor, a school psychologist with five years' experience, stared out at the churning grey landscape.  This wasn't the pristine suburban school district she'd envisioned for her career, a place where sunny classrooms and supportive families flourished.  This was Blackwood High, a volatile microcosm of societal issues, where the weight of poverty and despair seemed to press down on everything.  Her current case, a sixteen-year-old named Leo Rodriguez with a history of trauma and a bleak prognosis, felt like another brick in the growing wall. Blackwood High was a concrete jungle, where hallways echoed with whispered rumours of violence, and the very air seemed to vibrate with unspoken tensions.  The peeling paint on the walls seemed to mirror the fractured hopes and shattered dreams of the students within.
