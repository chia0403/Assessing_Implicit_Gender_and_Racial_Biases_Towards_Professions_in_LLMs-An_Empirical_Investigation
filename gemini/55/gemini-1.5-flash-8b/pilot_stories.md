The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Amelia "Mela" Blackwood's flight suit as she wrestled the controls of the *Azure Comet*.  The cockpit, a small, pressurized cocoon of metal and glass, shivered with the relentless tremors of the high-altitude storm.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Whisper Mountains, shrouded in a swirling, opaque veil of snow and mist, looked like shattered teeth clenched in the jaw of a slumbering titan.  Mela, her knuckles white against the cold metal of the yoke, concentrated on maintaining her altitude, the rhythmic thrum of the engines a constant, reassuring pulse in the deafening silence.  She was on a routine reconnaissance flight, charting the treacherous upper reaches of the mountain range, a necessary task for her role as a lead pilot for the Aeronavigation Corps, but today, the storm felt personal, a mocking adversary.  It was as if the very air itself was determined to keep her from reaching her objective.
