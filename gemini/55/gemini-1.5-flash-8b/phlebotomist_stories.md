The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant, low thrum, was the only sound Amelia "Em" Nightingale heard above the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of her own heart.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the sterile white gowns of her colleagues, seemed to press in around her, a suffocating embrace.  Each vial, each tiny, meticulously labeled test tube, held a whisper of someone else's story, a story she was now entrusted to decipher.  Em, a phlebotomist at the sprawling, city-center Saint Jude's Clinical Lab, was meticulously prepping a patient's arm. Her gloved hand, steady despite the tremor in her knuckles, traced the contour of a pale, freckled wrist.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and honking cars, a constant reminder of the lives – and the blood – flowing just beyond the lab's insulated walls.  Today, as she drew another blood sample, she couldn't help but wonder if this one held the key to unlocking a secret, a mystery that stretched far beyond the sterile confines of the lab.
