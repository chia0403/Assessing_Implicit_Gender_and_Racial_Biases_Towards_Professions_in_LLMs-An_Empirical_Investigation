The biting wind whipped across the exposed peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the chains of his worn leather jacket.  Snow, the consistency of coarse grit, stung his eyes as he hauled another felled pine, its massive trunk groaning under the strain of the winch.  The air, thin and frigid, hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a scent Elias had known since he was a boy, nestled amongst the towering evergreens on this rugged stretch of Montana wilderness.  He was the last logger on the mountain, a solitary figure in a landscape that whispered secrets of ages past.  The cabins were empty, the logging trucks silent, save for the relentless crunch of the snow against the metal beneath his worn boots. This remote section of the Bitterroot, known locally as the 'Dead Man's Gulch', was a place that held a particular, almost malevolent, grip on those who ventured too close.
