The scent of honeysuckle and damp earth clung to Amelia Nightingale’s clothes, a familiar perfume that mingled with the faint tang of overripe figs from the overflowing basket beside her.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass windows of "Blooming Blooms," her tiny flower shop nestled on the cobbled alleyway behind the Grand Cathedral of Saint Seraphina.  The shop itself was a riot of color – vibrant tulips in every shade imaginable, orchids clinging to ornate metal stands, and sprigs of rosemary cascading from antique watering cans.  Amelia, however, was not focused on the displays.  Her brow furrowed as she meticulously arranged a bouquet of lilies and irises, a deep frown etched across her usually serene face.  The lilies were wilting, their once-perfect white now tinged with an unnatural, sickly yellow.  This wasn't just a case of neglect; something was seriously wrong.  And it wasn't the flowers.
