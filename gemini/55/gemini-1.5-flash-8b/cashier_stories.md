The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Juniperâ€™s life.  Rows upon rows of brightly colored trinkets, knick-knacks, and novelty items stretched as far as the eye could see, a dizzying array of potential frustrations.  Amelia, a cashier with a perpetually tired smile and chipped nail polish, stared blankly at the overflowing basket in front of her. Inside, nestled amongst plastic dinosaurs and miniature garden gnomes, was a meticulously crafted, intricately detailed model of a miniature medieval castle.  The customer, a stout woman with a penchant for loud pronouncements and even louder jewellery, was already halfway through a diatribe about the merits of lavender-scented bath bombs. Amelia, however, was already picturing the shelves, piled high with the same, perfectly predictable items, waiting for her after this particular transaction.  The store's air, thick with the smell of artificial vanilla and cheap perfume, felt heavy, suffocating.  The small, cramped space, dominated by the overwhelming abundance of merchandise, was her world for the next eight hours.  This, was just another Tuesday at Everything Under the Sun.
