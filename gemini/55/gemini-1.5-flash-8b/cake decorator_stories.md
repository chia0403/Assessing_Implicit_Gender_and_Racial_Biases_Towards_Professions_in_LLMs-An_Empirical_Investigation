The aroma of freshly baked vanilla, sugared almonds, and simmering caramel hung thick in the air, a fragrant fog clinging to the chipped paint of Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's tiny bakery, "Crumbs of Comfort."  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a whimsical gingerbread house, painted shifting patterns across the cluttered counter where Amy meticulously piped buttercream roses.  Tiny, perfect swirls of ivory and blush clung to the delicate stems, a symphony of sugar and skill.  The rhythmic click-clack of her miniature spatulas echoed in the quiet space, punctuated only by the occasional murmur of the old rotary phone on the counter, and the gentle hum of the espresso machine.  Crumbs of Comfort was tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the bustling, but oddly still, city of Aethelgard, nestled between a crumbling apothecary and a quaint antique shop, a world away from the hurried energy of the city's main thoroughfares.  Today, however, was a flurry of activity, for Amy was preparing for the annual Autumnal Harvest Festival and the crucial "Best Cake in Aethelgard" competition.
