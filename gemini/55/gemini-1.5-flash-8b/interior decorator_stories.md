The scent of aged parchment and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Hawthorne, Interior Designer.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes of her small, cluttered workshop, painted intricate patterns on the swirling dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, a woman whose energy seemed to hum with a quiet intensity, was meticulously measuring a faded watercolour sketch of a sprawling, Victorian manor house.  The estate, known as Blackwood Manor, had been abandoned for over a decade, its grand halls swallowed by the creeping ivy and overgrown gardens.  Rumours, whispered on the wind and traded amongst the town gossips, painted it as a place steeped in tragedy, a haunted residence best left undisturbed.

But Amelia, with her keen eye for hidden beauty and her unwavering belief in the transformative power of space, saw past the whispers and the shadows.  She saw potential, a canvas waiting to be reimagined.  This was no ordinary commission; this was a challenge, a puzzle to be solved in faded ink and faded memories.
