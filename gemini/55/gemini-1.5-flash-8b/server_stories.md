Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart as she navigated the crowded, smoky interior.

Tonight, however, the chaos felt different, heavier.  A low, rumbling growl seemed to emanate from the very foundations of the building, mirroring the churning unease in her stomach.
