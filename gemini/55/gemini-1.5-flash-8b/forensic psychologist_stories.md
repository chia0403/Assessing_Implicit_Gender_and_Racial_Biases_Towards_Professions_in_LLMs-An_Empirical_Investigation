The room, usually a clinical space of measured precision, felt suffocating, charged with a palpable sense of unspoken tragedy.

The unit itself was a stark contrast to the city's frantic pulse; sterile, clinical, and filled with the quiet, relentless hum of machinery, each piece of equipment whispering its own silent observations. The windows, overlooking the city's labyrinthine streets, offered a bleak, yet oddly mesmerizing view.
