The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio repair shop hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia "Maisie" Cartwright's tools.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a tangle of wires, capacitors, and ancient, cracked chassis.  Maisie, her brow furrowed in concentration, traced the path of a corroded copper wire with a delicate pair of needle-nose pliers. The shop, nestled in the shadow of the towering, rusting smokestacks of the Blackwood Iron Works, smelled faintly of ozone and forgotten electronics.  Years of neglected equipment had layered a thick film of history onto the worn wooden floorboards, a silent testament to the countless voices that had once resonated through these very walls.  This was Maisie's kingdom, a sanctuary from the harsh realities of the fading industrial city, and today, it held the fate of a forgotten frequency.
