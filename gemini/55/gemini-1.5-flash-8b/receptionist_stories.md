The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" reception desk hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s keyboard.  Paperclips, like tiny metallic confetti, skittered across the worn Formica surface as she filed another stack of documents.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap printer toner, hung heavy in the sterile waiting room.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy office windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the rows of overflowing in-trays.  Amelia, a petite woman with a perpetually tired expression and hair the color of freshly fallen autumn leaves, stared blankly at the incessant stream of incoming emails on her screen.  Her name, printed on a faded nameplate, was a muted whisper on the metal, almost lost in the clamor of the day. Outside, the city roared.  Inside, the only sounds were the methodical clack of keys and the distant thrum of the server room.  It was a Tuesday, the same as every other Tuesday, or so it felt.
