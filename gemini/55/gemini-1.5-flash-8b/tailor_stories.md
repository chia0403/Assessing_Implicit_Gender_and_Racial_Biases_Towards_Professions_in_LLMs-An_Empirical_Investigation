The scent of beeswax and old parchment hung heavy in the air of "The Measured Stitch," a tiny workshop nestled between a cobbled alley and a bustling marketplace.  Sunlight, fractured by the tall buildings, illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the meticulous work of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a tailor of considerable skill and reputation, meticulously measured a shimmering silk swatch, his fingers, calloused and precise, tracing the intricate pattern.  Today's client, a renowned but notoriously demanding countess, required a gown fit for a queen, or at least, fit for someone who expected one.  The countess’s reputation preceded her, whispered in hushed tones among the merchants and gossips of the city – a reputation both formidable and...fragile. Barty was tasked with not only crafting a masterpiece, but also, perhaps more importantly, calming the storm within her.  The clock above the workshop's single window chimed, marking the precise hour when the countess was expected to arrive, and Barty knew he had much to do before the day was done.
