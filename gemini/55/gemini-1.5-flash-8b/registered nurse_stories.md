Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude’s Hospice, a relentless drumming that mirrored the insistent rhythm of Amelia Blackwood’s thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fading lilies, hung heavy in the dimly lit corridor.  Amelia, a registered nurse with ten years’ experience at St. Jude’s, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Tonight, the night shift, was shaping up to be a particularly challenging one.  

The setting was a quiet, almost ethereal, space. The hospice, tucked away in a leafy suburb on the outskirts of the city, hummed with the low thrum of life support machines, the soft sobs of families, and the hushed whispers of the dying.  Rows of identical beds, each a miniature universe of hope and despair, lined the long corridors.  A single flickering fluorescent light cast elongated shadows that danced with the steam rising from the hot cups of tea Amelia carried in her hands.  The scent of freshly brewed chamomile mingled with the medicinal aroma, a strange and comforting juxtaposition in this place of twilight.
