Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the hospice, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding headache thrumming in Amelia “Em” Cartwright’s temples.  The sterile white walls of the therapy room, usually a beacon of calm, felt oppressive today.  The scent of antiseptic, always subtly present, was amplified by the damp air, thick with the unspoken anxieties of the patients.  Em, a seasoned occupational therapist with a practiced calm, surveyed the room.  Four patients, each trapped in their own world of pain and loss, sat hunched in their wheelchairs, a tableau of silent suffering.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful lament echoing the melancholic atmosphere within.

The hospice, nestled deep in the valley, was a weathered stone structure clinging to the hillside, its aged charm hidden behind a cloak of constant drizzle.  Ivy, thick and emerald green, clawed at the stone walls, battling the dampness with relentless growth.  Inside, the scent of pine and damp earth clung to the air, mixed with the faint aroma of lavender from the small, neglected garden beyond.  Years of neglect had left their mark, but the resilience of the people within, nurses and volunteers alike, held the building together like a sturdy, if weary, ship.
