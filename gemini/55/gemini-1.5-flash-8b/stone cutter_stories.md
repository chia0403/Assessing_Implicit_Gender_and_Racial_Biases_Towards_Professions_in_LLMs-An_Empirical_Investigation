The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper against the towering granite face of Mount Cinder, clawed at Elara Stonehand's exposed skin.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around her like a restless, angry spirit, stinging her eyes and lodging itself in the deep grooves of her weathered face.  She was perched precariously on a narrow ledge, a precarious perch carved from the mountain's unforgiving heart.  The air, thin and sharp, tasted of ancient rock and forgotten glacial fires.  Elara, a stone cutter of the Frostfang clan, felt the familiar ache in her calloused hands, a symphony of years spent coaxing beauty from the very mountain itself.  This particular vein of quartz-veined granite, known as the Dragon's Tears, was notoriously stubborn.  It resisted her tools like a defiant beast, whispering threats in the form of shattered stone and the ever-present threat of a fall.  Her village, nestled in the valley below, was her sanctuary; a haven of warmth and life, a stark contrast to the icy grip of the mountain.
