Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, unassuming clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the turmoil in Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s mind.  The rhythmic drumming echoed the frantic pace of the past few weeks, each drop a tiny, insistent reminder of the anxieties and traumas she was witnessing.  Her office, tucked away on a side street in the heart of a gritty industrial town called Ashbrook, was small, but surprisingly warm.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the rain-streaked window, painted patterns of light and shadow across the worn wooden desk.  A half-eaten bowl of granola and a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat on the surface, testament to a sleepless night filled with the anxieties of her clients.  The scent of lavender from a small diffuser hung heavy in the air, a fragile attempt at calming the oppressive atmosphere.  A stack of case files, each representing a life story fractured and in need of repair, lay scattered across the desktop.  This was Eleanor's sanctuary, her battlefield, and tonight, the storm threatened to consume her.
