The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was a constant, low thrum, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, mirroring the swirling chaos of blueprints piled high on his drafting table.  He was surrounded by the skeletal remains of buildings – future skyscrapers, sleek apartment complexes, and sprawling industrial parks – all rendered in the meticulous lines of technical drawings.  Elias Thorne, 27, a drafting worker at the sprawling architectural firm of Sterling & Stone, felt more like a spectator than a creator.  Each meticulously drawn line, each precise dimension, felt like an exercise in futility, a monument to a world he didn't feel he belonged in.

The room itself was a testament to the relentless march of progress.  Rows of steel-framed drafting tables, each occupied by a figure hunched over the rhythmic scratch of a pencil, filled the cavernous space. The air, thick with the smell of ink and stale coffee, hung heavy with the unspoken pressure of deadlines.  Outside, the city of Zenith thrummed with a life that seemed both exhilarating and overwhelmingly distant.  Elias, trapped within these four walls, felt disconnected from the vibrant energy that flowed through the cityscape beyond his window, a city that he felt somehow responsible for shaping, yet powerless to affect.
