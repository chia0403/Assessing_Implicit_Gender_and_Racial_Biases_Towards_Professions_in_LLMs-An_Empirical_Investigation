The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed, a constant, irritating drone that echoed the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia’s heart.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a surprisingly delicate touch and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted the suction tube.  Her name, a testament to her grandmother's love for flowers, was a stark contrast to the sterile white walls and the metallic tang of antiseptic that permeated the air.  Today, however, the usual scent of mint and clove was muddled by something else – something metallic and faintly sweet.

The setting was Dr. Petrova’s small, but well-maintained, dental practice on the bustling corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the heart of a quiet, suburban town.  Rows of identical beige houses lined the street, their gardens meticulously manicured.  Late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the pristine lawns, a stark contrast to the dim interior of the dental office.  A lone, dusty fern wilted in a corner planter, its vibrant green foliage dulled by the unrelenting fluorescent light. The scent of pine from the air freshener was overwhelmed by the subtle, almost imperceptible, metallic odor clinging to the air.  A single, untouched cup of lukewarm coffee sat on the reception desk, its surface speckled with condensation.  The silence was unnerving, almost palpable. Something was amiss.
