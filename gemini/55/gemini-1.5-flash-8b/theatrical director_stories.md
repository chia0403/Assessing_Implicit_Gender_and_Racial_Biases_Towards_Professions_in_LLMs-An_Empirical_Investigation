The biting November wind whipped at the stained-glass windows of the "Thespian's Torch" theatre, rattling the ancient panes with a mournful symphony.  Inside, amidst the lingering scent of sawdust and old velvet,  Amelia  Seraphina Nightingale, a theatrical director known for her audacious vision and even more audacious temper, paced the dimly lit stage.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight filtering through a crack in the curtain, illuminating the chipped paint of the proscenium arch and the half-erased chalk marks on the floor.  Her tailored coat, a stormy grey that matched the clouds gathering outside, swirled around her as she muttered criticisms of the set design,  a low growl that echoed off the cavernous walls.  Tonight, the rehearsal for "The Raven's Lament" was not going as planned.  The actors, a motley crew of aspiring thespians and seasoned veterans alike, seemed more interested in gossiping about the latest theatre gossip than executing her meticulously crafted choreography.  The stage manager, a nervous young man named Leo,  stood anxiously by the wings, desperately trying to maintain order, and yet Amelia felt utterly disconnected from the productionâ€” a disconnect she couldn't explain.  This play, supposed to be the masterpiece that would catapult her reputation to new heights, was feeling more like a suffocating nightmare.
