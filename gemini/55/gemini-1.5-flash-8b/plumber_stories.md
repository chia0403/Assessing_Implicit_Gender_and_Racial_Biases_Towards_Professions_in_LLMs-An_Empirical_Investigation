The greasy, metallic tang of solder hung heavy in the air, a familiar shroud that clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield like a second skin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle workshop, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Barty's own thoughts.  He was late.  Exceedingly late.  Mrs. Higgins, renowned for her impeccable schedule and even more impeccable temper, was not a woman to be trifled with, especially when her toilet was stubbornly refusing to cooperate.

Barty's workshop, nestled in the shadowed alleyways behind the bustling market square of Oakhaven, was a testament to a lifetime spent wrestling with pipes and plungers.  Tools of all shapes and sizes – wrenches, screwdrivers, a collection of strangely assorted plumbing implements – were strewn across scarred wooden tables.  A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm stew sat forgotten in a chipped ceramic dish, a stark contrast to the potent aroma of copper and grime.   Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through a grimy window, highlighting the intricate network of pipes snaking through the workshop's heart.  Oakhaven, a city built on the banks of the River Ash, was known for its intricate network of underground tunnels, a labyrinthine maze that Barty had grown to navigate as intuitively as he navigated his own cluttered workshop.  This knowledge, coupled with his unwavering determination, was his only defense against the wrath of Mrs. Higgins.
