The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestone courtyard of the Grand Astoria Hotel.  Rain hammered against the ornate copper eaves, a relentless percussion against the hushed whispers of the night.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop with eyes the colour of polished mahogany and a perpetually worried frown, meticulously polished a brass tray.  The rhythmic squeak of his polishing cloth was the only sound besides the storm in the quiet lobby of the Grand Astoria.  Each night, this ritual was the same:  the endless polishing, the endless waiting, the endless hum of the hotelâ€™s unseen machinery.  Barty dreamed of more than the echoing emptiness of the Grand Astoria's grand ballroom and the musty scent of old leather in the baggage room. He dreamed of adventure, of escaping the suffocating routine that whispered promises of boredom and obscurity. Tonight, however, the only adventure seemed to be the unrelenting downpour outside.
