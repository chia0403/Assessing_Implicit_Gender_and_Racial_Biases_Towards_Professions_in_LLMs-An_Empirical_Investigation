Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Chen's studio apartment, blurring the already-muted colours of the cityscape outside.  The grey light, perpetually clinging to the London skyline, seeped into the space, reflecting off the polished steel surfaces of her workstation.  Amelia Chen, a rising star in the architectural firm of Blackwood & Sterling, hunched over her drafting table, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Stacks of blueprints, meticulously drawn and annotated, surrounded her like a miniature city waiting to be built.  The air, thick with the scent of coffee and the sharp tang of ink, hummed with the silent rhythm of her focused thoughts.  Outside, the relentless drumming of the rain echoed the relentless deadlines pressing down on her.  Her project, the ambitious redesign of the aging Eastminster Market, was due in just three days, and Amelia felt the weight of expectation pressing down on her shoulders.  Her reputation, forged in years of hard work and innovative design, was riding on this project, and she knew that a single misstep could shatter it.
