The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey from years of lukewarm water and untold anxieties, reflected Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s tired face.  The fluorescent lights of the small, but surprisingly well-maintained, dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic click-clack of her tools.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the insistent drumming in her temples.  It had been a particularly brutal week, a cascade of cavities and complaints, anxieties whispered and teeth ground to pulp.  Even the usual Friday afternoon lull felt heavy, laden with the unspoken pressure of deadlines and mounting patient bills.

The office, situated on a quiet side street of the sprawling metropolis of Ashworth, was tucked between a secondhand bookstore overflowing with forgotten tales and a bustling bakery whose aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked bread was a constant, comforting presence.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile white walls.  Eleanor, dressed in her familiar navy scrubs, felt a profound sense of isolation, despite the presence of the humming fluorescent lights, the clatter of dental instruments, and the rhythmic breathing of her patient.  Today, though, the patient wasn't just a patient.  Today, it was more than just another set of teeth.
