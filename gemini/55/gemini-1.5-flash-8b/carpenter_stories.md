The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face as she leaned against the weathered timbers of the Crooked Oak, its gnarled branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth clung to the air, a familiar comfort amidst the raw chill of the Alderwood Forest.  Amelia, a carpenter known throughout the valley for her precise hands and unwavering spirit, squinted at the half-finished dovecote perched precariously on the oak's weathered flank.  It was the third dovecote she'd attempted this week, each more ambitious than the last, each haunted by a stubborn flaw that refused to yield to her steady hammer blows.  The forest itself seemed to hold its breath, a silent observer to her struggles.


Setting:  The Alderwood Forest, a dense and ancient woodland nestled in the foothills of the Whisper Mountains.  The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the light is always muted, filtered through a canopy of towering evergreens.  Hidden glades, populated by the whispering secrets of the forest, are interspersed with rocky outcroppings and rushing streams. The crooked and gnarled trees, particularly the ancient Crooked Oak, are both beautiful and ominous, imbued with an air of quiet mystery.
