The fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed, a relentless, monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's existence.  Dust motes danced in the solitary shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the swirling vortex of paperwork on her desk.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a sharp, almost predatory focus, felt the familiar pressure mounting.  This quarter's audit for the prestigious Blackwood & Sons Distillery, her family's business, was nearing its deadline, and the numbers wereâ€¦uncertain.

Setting: A small, cluttered accounting office on the second floor of a slightly dilapidated, but historic, building on a quiet side street in a burgeoning, yet still slightly rough, part of the city. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and stale coffee.  Windows, though offering a sliver of the world outside, felt somehow distant.  Amelia's small office, while functional, was a testament to years of late nights and countless spreadsheets, its walls lined with rows of towering filing cabinets, overflowing with decades of business records.  The faint scent of oak and aged grain, typical of the distillery itself, drifted in from the hall outside.
