The chipped porcelain of Dr. Alistair Finch's waiting room clock ticked with a morbid rhythm, each second a tiny hammer blow against the suffocating silence.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window, danced in the air like restless spirits.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Alistair himself.  His practice, Finch & Associates Family Dentistry, nestled on the bleak, windswept corner of Bleaker Street and Grimshaw Lane in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, was as desolate as its location suggested.  The only sound louder than the rain was the low, persistent hum of the aging dental equipment lurking in the sterile quiet of his surgery beyond the waiting room â€“ a sound Alistair had come to associate with the gnawing emptiness of his life.
