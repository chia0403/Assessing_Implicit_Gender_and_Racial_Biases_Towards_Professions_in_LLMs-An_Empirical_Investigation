The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s weathered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the cockpit windows.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks a jagged, unforgiving panorama.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid air, checked her instruments one last time, the glow of the panel reflecting in her steely blue eyes.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine, a sound as familiar to her as her own heartbeat. This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, threading its way through a landscape both beautiful and brutally indifferent.  She was bound for a remote village nestled deep within the mountains, a place where the only certainty was the unpredictable nature of the weather and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness.
