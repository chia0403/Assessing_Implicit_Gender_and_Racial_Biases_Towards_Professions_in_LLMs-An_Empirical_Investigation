The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorne's cheeks raw.  He tugged his worn, grey cloak tighter around him, the rough wool scratching against the chainmail beneath.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low in the bruised purple sky, offered little warmth.  Before him, stretching as far as the eye could see, lay the endless expanse of the Whispering Wastes, a landscape of cracked earth, skeletal trees, and the occasional, wind-sculpted rock formation that resembled a gnarled, ancient hand reaching out from the dust.  Valerius, his breath misting in the frigid air, shifted the weight of his halberd, its polished steel glinting dully in the failing light.  He was the last guard stationed at Outpost 7, a crumbling structure of grey stone that looked more like a tomb than a bastion of defense against whatever lurked beyond the Wastes.  Tonight, the silence was the most unsettling thing of all.
