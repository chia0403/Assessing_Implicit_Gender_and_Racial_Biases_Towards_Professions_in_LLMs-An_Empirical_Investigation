This wasn't the sterile, clinical scent of a modern abattoir; this was the perfume of generations, clinging to the rough-hewn wooden beams and flagstone floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop.  Barty, a man whose hands were as gnarled and seasoned as the oak chopping block he wielded with such practiced ease, stood amidst the chaos of his shop, a symphony of sizzling sausages, hanging hams, and the rhythmic thud of his cleaver echoing in the damp, cool air.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were slick with a November rain, the muted grey of the sky mirroring the somber mood that often settled upon the town before the winterâ€™s biting grip truly took hold.  But inside Butterfield's, a comforting warmth crackled in the hearth, chased away the chill, and mingled with the pungent smells that were as familiar to Barty as his own heartbeat.
