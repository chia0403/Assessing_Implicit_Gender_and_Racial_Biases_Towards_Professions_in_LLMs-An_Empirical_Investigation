The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Sterling, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the incessant drip-drip-drip from a leaky faucet somewhere deep within the bowels of the building.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, receptionist extraordinaire (or at least, that's what her meticulously organized desk implied), tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the polished mahogany surface.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, expensive leather, and the faint, underlying aroma of desperation – the usual perfume of a law firm on a Monday morning.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the windows and mirroring the internal turmoil brewing in Amelia's carefully composed heart.  This wasn't just any Monday; this was the Monday she'd been dreading for weeks – the Monday of the annual Sterling & Sterling partner's retreat, a legendary three-day event notorious for its ruthlessness and its potential to reshape the firm's future, and Amelia's very own precarious position within it.
