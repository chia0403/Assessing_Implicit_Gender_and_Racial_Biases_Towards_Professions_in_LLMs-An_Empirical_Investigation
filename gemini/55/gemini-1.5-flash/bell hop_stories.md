Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, bell hop extraordinaire (or at least, that's what he told himself on particularly slow nights),  shifted his weight from one polished shoe to the other, his gaze fixed on the revolving door, a silent prayer for a fat tip trembling on his lips.  The Grand Majestic might have boasted gilded cages and plush carpets, but Barty knew its secrets ran far deeper than the threadbare rug beneath his worn-out shoes.
