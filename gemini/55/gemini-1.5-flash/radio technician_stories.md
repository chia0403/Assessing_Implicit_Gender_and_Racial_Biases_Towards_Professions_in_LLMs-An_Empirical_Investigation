Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Thorne Radio Repair, drumming a frantic rhythm against the cracked glass of the single window.  Inside, the small workshop was a chaotic symphony of humming electronics: a tangled web of wires snaked across the workbench, alongside half-dismantled radios, their guts laid bare like exposed mechanical hearts.  Dust motes danced in the weak light of a single bare bulb, illuminating Elias's focused face, etched with the lines of a man perpetually grappling with static and silence.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempestuous inner workings of the old Zenith he was currently trying to revive.  The Zenith, a relic from a bygone era, hummed with a low, threatening growl, its dial flickering erratically like a dying ember.
