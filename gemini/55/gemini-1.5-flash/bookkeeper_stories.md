The chipped paint of Amelia Katherine Finch’s desk was a comforting familiarity, a muted green that mirrored the perpetual twilight of her office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, unshaded bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the stagnant air like tiny, forgotten dreams. Amelia, a woman whose life seemed to consist entirely of ledger entries and the faint scent of aging paper, adjusted her spectacles, the thin wire pinching the bridge of her nose. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge against the grimy windows of Finch & Sons Accounting, a song that echoed the melancholic rhythm of her own heart.  The year was 1947, and the only excitement Amelia expected was the arrival of the afternoon tea biscuits – if they arrived at all, given the current sugar rationing.
