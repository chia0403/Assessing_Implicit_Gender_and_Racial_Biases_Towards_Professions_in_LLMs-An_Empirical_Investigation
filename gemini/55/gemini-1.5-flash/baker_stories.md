The aroma of sourdough, yeasty and sharp, mingled with the sweet perfume of ripening plums in the air, a comforting, familiar blanket draped over the cobblestone streets of Auberon.  It was a scent that clung to everything in the village, from the worn brickwork of the houses to the roughspun clothes of the villagers themselves, a testament to the unwavering dedication of its most beloved resident:  Eleanor Abigail Cartwright, proprietor of "The Golden Crust" bakery.  The bakery itself, a charmingly crooked building nestled between a butcher's shop and a silversmith's, was a haven of warmth and flour-dusted chaos, even at the pre-dawn hour when Eleanor, still wrapped in her faded floral apron, began her day.  The rhythmic thump of her hands kneading dough provided the soundtrack to the quiet awakening of Auberon.
