The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the damp brick walls of "Shear Bliss," a salon so small it felt more like a meticulously crafted birdcage than a business.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window overlooking a perpetually grey alleyway in the heart of Glasgow. Inside, amidst the chaotic symphony of whirring clippers and the gentle hiss of a steam towel warmer, sat Aurelia Blackwood, her fingers, nimble as a spider's, weaving through a client's unruly auburn curls. Aurelia, with her own fiery red hair braided tightly to her scalp, possessed a quiet intensity that belied the seemingly frivolous nature of her profession.  The flickering neon sign outside, half-obscured by the downpour, cast a sickly yellow glow on the polished wooden floor, reflecting in the multifaceted facets of the crystal chandelier hanging precariously above. Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of the salon was disrupted by an unsettling stillness, broken only by the insistent drumming of the rain and the nervous tapping of Aurelia's own foot.  Something felt wrong, a prickle of unease crawling up her spine that even the comforting aroma of lavender shampoo couldn't quite mask.
