The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the stubborn key into the lock of her clinic.  Salt spray, carried on the gale from the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic just beyond the clifftop, stung her cheeks.

Her small, shingle-sided building, perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish coastline near the village of Porthcurno, looked more like a stranded lifeboat than a place of healing.  Inside, the warmth of the waiting room, smelling faintly of lavender and old wood, offered a welcome contrast to the raw, unforgiving elements outside.  But even the comforting aroma couldn't quite dispel the unsettling feeling that had settled over Eleanor since the strange phone call earlier that day. A feeling that something – or someone – was about to disrupt the quiet rhythm of her coastal life.
