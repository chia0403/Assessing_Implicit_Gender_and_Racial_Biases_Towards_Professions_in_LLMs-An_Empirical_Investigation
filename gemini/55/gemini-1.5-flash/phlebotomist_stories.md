The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d become intimately familiar with over the past five years, a steady rhythm that often quickened – sometimes with anticipation, sometimes with dread – depending on the patient waiting in the sterile, pale-green cubicle.  This particular Tuesday morning, the dread was winning.  The waiting area was packed, a silent, anxious throng of sniffling children, harried parents, and the perpetually weary faces of the elderly, all united by the shared experience of needing blood drawn.  Amy adjusted her crisp, white lab coat, the starched fabric a stark contrast to the tremor in her hand as she picked up a fresh needle.  The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and unspoken anxieties; the perfect storm for a phlebotomist’s worst nightmare.
