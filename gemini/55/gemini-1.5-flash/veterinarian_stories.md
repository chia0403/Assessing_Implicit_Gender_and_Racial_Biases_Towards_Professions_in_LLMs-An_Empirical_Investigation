The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the sputtering outboard motor into submission.  The small, battered fishing boat, christened *The Kelpie* after a mischievous water spirit, bucked and groaned beneath her, pitching precariously on the choppy grey waters of the Outer Hebrides.  Rain, a relentless Scottish drizzle that had been falling for what felt like days, plastered her already wind-whipped auburn hair to her forehead.  Ahead, the silhouette of Skye, shrouded in mist, promised little in the way of shelter, but the urgent bleating of a sheep from the small, rain-lashed island of Eilean Donan offered a far more compelling destination.  Her worn leather satchel, containing more than just her stethoscope and syringes, bounced against her thigh, a rhythmic counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. This wasn't the typical house call for Eleanor, not by a long shot, but then again, nothing ever really was on Eilean Donan.
