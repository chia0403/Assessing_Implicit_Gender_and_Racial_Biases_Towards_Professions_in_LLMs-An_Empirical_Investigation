The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tugging at Elias Thorne’s worn tweed jacket. Elias, a man whose life was as meticulously ordered as the grounds he tended, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and brooding shadows, hunched against the stormy sky like a slumbering beast. Its sprawling gardens, usually a tapestry of vibrant color, were now muted shades of brown and russet, their beauty diminished but not destroyed by the encroaching winter.  The air held the damp, earthy scent of decaying leaves and the faint, almost imperceptible, tang of woodsmoke from the distant village. Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather strap of his shears, the familiar weight a small comfort in the growing unease that had settled in his bones.  Tonight, felt different.  Even the usually comforting rhythm of the wind felt…wrong.
