The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she navigated the rickety wooden walkway, the rhythmic creak a counterpoint to the relentless roar of the Atlantic.  The wind, a snarling beast from the north, whipped her dark hair across her eyes, threatening to tear the crisp white lab coat she stubbornly refused to remove.
