The siren's wail was a mournful cry swallowed by the churning, grey belly of the storm. Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the already indistinct streetlights of Oakhaven into shimmering, watery phantoms.  Inside, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the emergency lights mirrored the frantic beat of Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Reed's heart.  She gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather, navigating the flooded streets with a practiced ease born of countless nights battling both human frailty and the capricious fury of nature.  Oakhaven, usually a sleepy coastal town clinging precariously to the cliffs, was tonight a treacherous labyrinth of rushing water and obscured hazards.  The dispatcher's voice, crackling over the radio, was barely audible above the roar of the storm: "10-4, Unit 3, responding to a possible drowning at Mariner's Cove.  Priority one."  Evieâ€™s jaw tightened.  Mariner's Cove, at the mercy of the storm surge, was a death trap tonight.
