The scent of acetone and lilac hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume clinging to the plush, lavender-colored walls of "Nails of Serenity."  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sun-drenched window, danced in the stillness of the early morning.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful symphony, rattling the windowpanes, a stark contrast to the tranquil atmosphere meticulously crafted by Seraphina "Sera"  Delacroix. Sera, a woman whose hands, despite their constant immersion in polish and cuticle remover, possessed a surprising delicacy,  carefully arranged a new display of OPI's latest autumnal collection â€“ shades of burnt orange and deep plum that mirrored the fiery hues bleeding across the Chicago skyline.  The only sound besides the wind was the gentle hum of the electric nail file, a silent promise of the busy day to come.
