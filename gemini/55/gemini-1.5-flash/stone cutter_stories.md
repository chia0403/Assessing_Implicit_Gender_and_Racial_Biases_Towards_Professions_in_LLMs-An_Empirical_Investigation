The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a perpetually leaking roof.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, guttering oil lamp hanging precariously above, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous spirits.  This was Silas Blackwood's world, a world sculpted from grey, unforgiving stone and the sweat of his brow.  Silas, a man whose hands were as rough and calloused as the granite he shaped,  stood hunched over a half-finished angel, its wings only partially freed from the rough-hewn block.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, sharp stone dust, and the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a small cut on his finger, ignored in the concentration of his work, had begun to bleed.  Outside, the relentless Scottish wind howled a mournful dirge, promising a storm of biblical proportions.
