The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s unruly auburn curls across her face as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  The skeletal remains of a half-built Victorian mansion clawed at the bruised purple sky, its empty window sockets like vacant eyes staring out at the churning grey sea beyond.  Gulls cried, a mournful soundtrack to the near-freezing air that stung her cheeks.  This wasn't the picturesque Cornish coastline she’d envisioned when she’d pitched “The Obsidian Tide,” her ambitious gothic horror, to the studio.  This was… bleak.  More bleak than even the screenplay’s darkest moments had prepared her for.  The production was three days behind schedule, the lead actor had a mysterious case of stage fright, and the local legend about the mansion being cursed was, frankly, starting to get under her skin.  The only thing Mia Hernandez, celebrated director of critically acclaimed indie dramas, felt certain of right now was that this was going to be a long, very, very long shoot.
