The fluorescent lights of the Aspen Dental practice hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the polishing machine in Dr. Ramirez's operatory.  Amelia Grace Holloway, RDH,  leaned against the cool stainless steel of the instrument cart, the scent of peppermint fluoride clinging faintly to her scrubs.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking Main Street, blurring the already fading October twilight into a watercolor smudge of grey and orange.  Inside, the air was thick with the cloying sweetness of antiseptic and the faintly metallic tang of blood â€“ a familiar, if not particularly pleasant, aroma for Amelia.  Tonight, however, the usual humdrum routine felt charged, the air crackling with a nervous energy that had nothing to do with the upcoming holiday rush and everything to do with the strange, unsettling appointment scheduled for 8 PM.
