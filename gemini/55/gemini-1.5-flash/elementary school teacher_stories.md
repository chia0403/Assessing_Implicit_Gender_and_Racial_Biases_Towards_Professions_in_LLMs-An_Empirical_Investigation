Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the playground, where the cacophony of shrieking children battled with the insistent chirping of crickets.  Inside, however, the battle raged louder, a symphony of squeals, the clatter of carving knives, and the sporadic, high-pitched wail of a child who'd just discovered the intricate workings of a pumpkin's innards.
