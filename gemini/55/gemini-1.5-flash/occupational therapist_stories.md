The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the "Salty Siren."  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the deck, highlighting the intricate knots of the net – knots nearly as complex as the ones tangled in the mind of her latest patient, young Finnigan O’Malley.

Her task: to assess Finnigan, a fisherman crippled by a mysterious accident, and to coax him back to a life he may never want again.
