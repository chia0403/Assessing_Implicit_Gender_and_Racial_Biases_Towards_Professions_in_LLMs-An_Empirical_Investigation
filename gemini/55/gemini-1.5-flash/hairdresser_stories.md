The scent of burnt sugar and lavender hung heavy in the air, a bizarre but oddly comforting perfume that clung to the plush velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain sink of Serenity's Hair Emporium.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting a rather flamboyant phoenix, its fiery plumage mirroring the chaotic tangle of auburn hair currently draped over the shoulders of Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather.  Sera, with her nimble fingers already working magic on the unruly strands, barely registered the storm.  Years spent coaxing life back into damaged locks had taught her the zen of ignoring external chaos â€“ a skill particularly useful given the somewhat eccentric clientele of her small, tucked-away salon in the cobbled backstreets of Grimsborough.
