The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Blackwood Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the arched gothic windows, danced in the silence broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall.

Outside, a November wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the ancient panes of glass, a stark contrast to the serene, almost hallowed atmosphere within.  Elara, however, felt anything but serene.  A tremor, barely perceptible, ran through the floorboards beneath her feet, a subtle vibration that spoke of something far more unsettling than a gust of wind.
