The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain figurines lining the shelves of Esme Valerius's atelier.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the shafts of light that sliced through the gloom of the otherwise cavernous room.  Esme herself, a woman whose age was etched more in the fine lines around her knowing eyes than in the vibrant auburn of her hair, meticulously pinned a length of silk charmeuse to a dress form.  The silk, a deep, brooding plum, shimmered under her touch, reflecting the flickering candlelight that cast long shadows across her worktable, cluttered with spools of thread, half-finished seams, and snippets of fabric in a riot of colours.  Outside, the cobblestones of the Rue des Fleurs, Paris, were slick with a recent rain, the rhythmic drumming of water against the windowpanes a steady counterpoint to the snip-snip-snip of her shears.
