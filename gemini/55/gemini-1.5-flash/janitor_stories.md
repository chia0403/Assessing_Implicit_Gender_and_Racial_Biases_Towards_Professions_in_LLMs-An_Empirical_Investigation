The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a discordant symphony, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floors.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow, deliberate sweep of Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s mop, danced in the beams like tiny, erratic fireflies.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee, old textbooks, and the faint, lingering perfume of a thousand teenage anxieties.  It was 11:47 PM, the official end of Mia’s shift, but the echoing silence of the deserted halls was a comfort she wouldn't trade for the boisterous chaos of the daytime.  Tonight, however, the silence felt different; charged, expectant. Even the usually imperturbable squeak of Mia's mop seemed to hold its breath.
