The scent of stale crayons and slightly-too-sweet apple juice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 2B, danced in the lazy afternoon light.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground of Sunnyside Elementary, its bare branches scratching against the sky like skeletal fingers.  Inside, a tableau of post-naptime chaos reigned:  a tower of wooden blocks teetered precariously, a lone sock lay abandoned amidst a sea of scattered building bricks, and a small, tear-stained face peered out from beneath a table, clutching a beloved stuffed dinosaur.  Eleanor sighed, a weary but fond sound.  Another day, another adventure in the wild, wonderful world of kindergarten.
