The fluorescent hum of the "Quick Stop & Shop" lights buzzed a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-whirr* of the cash register.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the desolate highway beyond.  Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda.  Twenty-three-year-old Elara Jean Blackwood, her name stitched in faded embroidery on her stained apron, stared blankly at the price scanner, the rhythmic beep a jarring reminder of the endless stream of customers shuffling past her till.  Tonight felt particularly bleak, even by Quick Stop & Shop standards.  The only illumination besides the harsh overhead lights came from the flickering neon sign outside, casting an unsettling, sickly green glow across the aisles stacked with discounted chips and suspiciously-cheap candy.
