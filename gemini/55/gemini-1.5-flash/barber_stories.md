The rusty swing sign, creaking a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, read simply: "Armand's."  Armand Dubois, a man whose life was as meticulously groomed as the heads he tended, sighed, wiping a stray curl of sweat from his brow.  The air hung thick and heavy, scented with bayou mud and the lingering ghost of last night's rain.  Inside Armand's barbershop, a single bare bulb cast a harsh yellow glow on the worn leather chairs and the chipped porcelain sink.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating the faded photographs lining the walls â€“ family portraits, mostly, and a black-and-white shot of a younger Armand, sporting a shockingly slick pompadour.  The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, a steady counterpoint to the simmering heat outside, and the unspoken anxieties of a town holding its breath.
