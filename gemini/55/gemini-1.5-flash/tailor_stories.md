The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes of his workshop, a rhythmic drumming that competed with the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the precise fall of a stitch and the subtle drape of a finished garment, sat hunched over a bolt of deep emerald velvet, the fabric shimmering under the weak light of a single oil lamp.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the loose timbers of his small, ramshackle shop, nestled on the edge of the misty moorland that bordered Oakhaven, a village as ancient and weathered as the stones that formed its crooked streets.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting solitude of his craft was overshadowed by a growing unease.  A shadow, darker than the approaching storm, had fallen over Oakhaven, and Elias felt it settling on his shoulders like a cloak of lead.
