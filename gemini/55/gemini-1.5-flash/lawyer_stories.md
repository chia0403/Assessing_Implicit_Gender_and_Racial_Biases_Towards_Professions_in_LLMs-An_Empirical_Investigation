Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening symphony from the cypress trees that draped their mournful branches over the sluggish bayou.  Amelia Katherine Dubois, Esquire, squinted at the dilapidated shack perched precariously on stilts, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.

She adjusted her crisp, white linen suit – a stark contrast to the surroundings – and took a deep breath, the cloying sweetness of the jasmine doing little to soothe her nerves. This case, the disappearance of Jean-Luc Broussard, was unlike any she'd ever encountered, and the air itself seemed to whisper warnings.
