The salt spray stung Aurelia "Rel" Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  Rel, perched precariously on the jagged rocks of the Cornish coastline, squinted at the churning grey sea.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn hair across her canvas, threatening to smear the vibrant hues of the impending storm she was attempting to capture.  Below her, the village of Portwenn huddled, a collection of whitewashed cottages clinging to the cliffside like barnacles to a whale.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the distant mournful cry of gulls â€“ a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks, a symphony only a painter could truly appreciate.  Her easel, battered and worn like a trusted companion, groaned under the weight of her oils, a testament to countless hours spent wrestling with the untamed beauty of the Cornish coast.
