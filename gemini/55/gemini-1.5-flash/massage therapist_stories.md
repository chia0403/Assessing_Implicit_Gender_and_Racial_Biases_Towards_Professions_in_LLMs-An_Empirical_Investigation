The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a deliberate counterpoint to the damp, salty tang that usually clung to everything in Seabrook.  Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, a rhythmic percussion against the soothing sounds of whale song playing softly from hidden speakers.  Inside, Elara Vance, a massage therapist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird's wings and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, meticulously folded a warm, lavender-scented towel.  Her small, but impeccably clean, workspace was a sanctuary â€“ a haven from the relentless grey skies and the often-turbulent lives of her clients in the quaint, yet surprisingly dramatic, coastal town of Seabrook, Maine.  Tonight, however, the usual calm was shattered by a frantic knock that echoed through the otherwise silent spa, a sharp crack against the serenity.
