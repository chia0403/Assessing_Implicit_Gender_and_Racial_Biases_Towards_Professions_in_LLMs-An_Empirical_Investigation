The greasy spoon diner's neon sign flickered, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, frying bacon, and diesel fumes – a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a man whose life was as worn and weathered as the 1978 Kenworth W900L he affectionately called "Betsy."  Bart, a mountain of a man with hands as rough as bark and eyes the color of a stormy sea, sat nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee, the brim of his faded trucker hat pulled low over his forehead, his gaze fixed on the relentless drumming of rain against the windowpane.  He'd been on the road for three weeks, hauling a load of fertilizer from Kansas to California, and the solitude, usually a welcome companion, was starting to gnaw at him like a persistent cough.  The diner's jukebox wheezed out a mournful country ballad, mirroring the low hum of unease settling in Bart's gut – a feeling that something wasn't quite right.
