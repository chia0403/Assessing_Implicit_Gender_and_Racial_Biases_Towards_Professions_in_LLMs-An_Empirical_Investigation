The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn wool coat pulled high. Rain, sleeting with a vicious determination, plastered her already damp auburn curls to her forehead.  The scent of woodsmoke and brine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to the small, cliffside town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Its picturesque beauty, usually a source of comfort, felt stark and unforgiving tonight, mirroring the turmoil churning in Amelia’s stomach.  The single flickering gas lamp on the corner cast long, skeletal shadows that danced and writhed like restless spirits, highlighting the dilapidated grandeur of the old Victorian houses clinging precariously to the cliff edge.  Ahead, the imposing silhouette of St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital loomed, its windows glowing like watchful eyes in the storm.  Amelia, a registered nurse at St. Jude's for the past five years, pushed open the heavy oak doors, the warmth rushing out to meet her like a tangible embrace – a welcome contrast to the icy teeth of the storm raging outside.
