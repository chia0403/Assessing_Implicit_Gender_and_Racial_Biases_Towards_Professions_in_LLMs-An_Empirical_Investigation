The chipped paint of the "Guidance Counselor" sign on Ms. Eleanor Vance's door seemed to mirror the cracks in the foundation of Northwood High.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the aging building, mimicking the relentless anxieties that poured from her students daily.  The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage desperation – a familiar and unsettling perfume Eleanor had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years at Northwood.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the blinds, illuminating the worn floral pattern of her office carpet, a silent witness to countless tear-stained confessions and hushed pleas for help.  Today, however, the usual hum of teenage turmoil was replaced by an unnerving quiet, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the frantic scratching of Eleanor’s pen across her notepad, where the name "Jason Wilkes" was circled in anxious red.  He hadn't shown up for his appointment, and a knot of unease tightened in Eleanor's stomach. Something felt wrong.
