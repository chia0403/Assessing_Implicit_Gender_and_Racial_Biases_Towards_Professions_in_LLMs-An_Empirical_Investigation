The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Blackwood’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the icy dread clenching her stomach.  Rain lashed against the single-pane window of her cramped attic apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Garlands of faded Christmas lights, strung haphazardly around the room, cast a weak, flickering glow on the cluttered space: a haphazard collection of sheet music, half-finished lyrics scrawled on napkins, and a battered guitar case leaning precariously against a stack of vinyl records.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and damp plaster, a scent that had become as familiar to Mia as her own breath, a constant companion in this forgotten corner of Prague, a city that once promised her the world but now seemed determined to swallow her whole.  Tonight, the promise of her biggest gig yet – a sold-out concert at the legendary Rudolfinum – felt less like a dream and more like a looming execution.
