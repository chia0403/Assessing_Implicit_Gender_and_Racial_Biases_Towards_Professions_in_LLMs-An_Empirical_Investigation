The sky, a bruised purple bruised by the setting sun, mirrored the stormy mood brewing inside her.  Tonight, the desolate beauty of the Cornish coast felt less like a postcard and more like a stage set for a tragedy, a feeling amplified by the urgent call crackling over her radio: missing person, last seen near the abandoned lighthouse at Pendeen.  Mia gripped the steering wheel tighter, the familiar weight offering a small comfort against the gnawing unease that had settled deep in her bones.  This wasn't just another missing person; this was someone she knew.
