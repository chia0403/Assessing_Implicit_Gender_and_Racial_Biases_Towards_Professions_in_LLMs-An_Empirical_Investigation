The scent of burnt sugar and argan oil hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Seraphina “Sera” Dubois’s salon, “Shear Genius.”  Sera, perched precariously on a rolling stool, meticulously sculpted a cascade of fiery red curls onto a mannequin head, the afternoon sun slanting through the large, arched window and illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of New Orleans’ Frenchmen Street pulsed – a syncopated heartbeat of jazz clarinet and echoing laughter that contrasted sharply with the quiet intensity of Sera's work.  Her salon, nestled between a voodoo shop specializing in potent love potions and a crumbling bookstore overflowing with forgotten tales, was a haven of controlled chaos; a sanctuary where the anxieties of life were temporarily erased beneath the soothing glide of shears and the comforting warmth of a curling iron.
