The biting November wind whipped around Alistair Finch's ankles as he wrestled the rusty manhole cover free.  Steam, thick and smelling faintly of sulfur and something vaguely floral, hissed from the gaping maw below.

Alistair, a man whose hands were perpetually stained a mosaic of grime and grease, pulled a pair of thick work gloves further onto his already frostbitten fingers.  This wasn't the picturesque view he'd envisioned when he'd envisioned himself as a plumber, but then again, picturesque rarely described the underbelly of a Victorian city, especially not one as ancient and labyrinthine as Grimsborough.  The job, a blocked drain at the cathedral, had promised a hefty fee, but Alistair suspected that even the Lord himself couldn't have predicted the nightmarish depths he was about to encounter.
