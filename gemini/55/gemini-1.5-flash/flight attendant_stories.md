The recycled air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  The cabin lights of Flight BA249, hurtling across the Atlantic at 35,000 feet, were dimmed to a sickly orange, mimicking the bruised dawn visible through the porthole beside her jump seat.  Below, the swirling clouds resembled a churning sea of grey cotton candy, a far cry from the sun-drenched beaches of Barbados, Sera's intended destination after this grueling overnight flight from London Heathrow.  Her meticulously applied lipstick, a vibrant crimson against her pale skin, felt like a defiant act against the encroaching fatigue.  The rhythmic drone of the engines was a relentless lullaby she’d long since grown immune to, but the unsettling silence emanating from the first-class cabin was a different matter entirely.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
