Her gaze was fixed on the patient draped before her, a young woman whose life hung precariously in the balance, a delicate thread woven with the intricate, fragile architecture of the human heart. The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor, a relentless, almost frantic metronome, filled the otherwise silent theatre, a stark counterpoint to the storm raging outside.
