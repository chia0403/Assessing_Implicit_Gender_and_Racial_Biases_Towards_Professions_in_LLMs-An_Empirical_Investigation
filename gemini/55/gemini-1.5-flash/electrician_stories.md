The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant cable into the cramped confines of the lighthouse lantern room.  Below, the churning Atlantic roared its displeasure at the relentless November gale, a symphony of whitecaps and howling wind that threatened to tear the ancient stone structure from its precarious perch.  Elias, a man whose hands were as familiar with wire strippers as they were with calloused leather work gloves, shivered more from the biting cold than the exertion. The air inside the lantern room, despite the roaring furnace, held the damp chill of the sea, a constant reminder of the elemental power that surrounded him â€“ a power he was, quite literally, trying to tame.  The rhythmic pulse of the lamp, a colossal beast of glass and metal, was the only counterpoint to the storm's fury.  This was no ordinary job; this was Flannan Isle Lighthouse, and tonight, Elias was its sole guardian against the darkness.
