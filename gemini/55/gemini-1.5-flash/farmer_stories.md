The wind, a rasping, gravelly thing, gnawed at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the cracked earth of his farm, Dustbowl Ranch, a name that, sadly, held more truth than poetic license these days.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down mercilessly on the parched land, baking the already brittle soil to a near-impenetrable crust.  Elias, his calloused hands resting on the worn wooden handle of his hoe, felt the familiar ache in his back, a constant companion mirroring the persistent ache in his heart – the ache of a failing harvest and a future as uncertain as the shifting sands surrounding his lonely homestead.  The silence, broken only by the occasional mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead, was a heavy blanket, suffocating and oppressive. This was the beginning of Elias’s third year of drought, and it felt like the end of everything he’d ever known.
