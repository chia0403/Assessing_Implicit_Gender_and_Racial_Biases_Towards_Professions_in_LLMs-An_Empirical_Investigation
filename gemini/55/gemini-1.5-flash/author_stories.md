The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's face, a familiar sting that mirrored the prickle of anxiety twisting in her gut.  The wind, a raw, relentless Atlantic gale, whipped her auburn hair across her face, obscuring the already hazy view of the craggy Cornish coastline.  She hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, the collar scratching against her neck, a minor discomfort compared to the gnawing unease that had settled in her bones since arriving at Trevenna Cove.  The tiny, windswept village, clinging precariously to the cliffs like barnacles to a ship’s hull, was the antithesis of the sun-drenched Tuscan villa that had been the setting for her latest, and most critically acclaimed, novel.  And yet, it was here, in this desolate beauty, that Mia Hawthorne, author of the bestselling "Sun-Kissed Secrets," hoped to find the inspiration she desperately needed for her next book – a project threatening to capsize her career before it even launched.
