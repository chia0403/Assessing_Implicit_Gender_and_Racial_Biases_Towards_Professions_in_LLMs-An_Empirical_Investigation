The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's worn work jacket as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian monstrosity.  Below, the town of Oakhaven huddled beneath a bruised, twilight sky, the last vestiges of sunset painting the snow-dusted rooftops in shades of bruised plum and fading rose.  Elias, a man sculpted by years of hard labor under unforgiving elements, adjusted his grip on the weathered shingles, his knuckles white against the cold.  The air smelled of damp earth, woodsmoke, and the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a scent that, unfortunately, Elias was becoming increasingly accustomed to, given the recent spate of unexplained incidents plaguing Oakhaven. This wasn't just another roofing job; it felt like the precipice of something far more sinister.
