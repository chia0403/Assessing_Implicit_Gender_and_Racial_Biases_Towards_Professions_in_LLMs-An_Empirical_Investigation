The skeletal remains of the goalposts, rusting in the fading light, seemed to mock the empty expanse of muddied grass.  Fallen leaves, the last vestiges of autumn's flamboyant display, swirled around her worn, leather-bound coaching notebook, threatening to scatter the meticulously scribbled formations and player notes within.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, held a distinct chill that seeped into Amyâ€™s bones, a stark contrast to the fiery passion that usually burned within her.
