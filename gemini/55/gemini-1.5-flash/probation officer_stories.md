The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the frayed edges of Elias Thorne’s patience.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow fluorescent lights, danced in the stagnant air, a silent ballet performed for an audience of three: Elias himself, a nervous-looking teenager clutching a crumpled tissue, and a middle-aged woman whose carefully applied lipstick couldn’t quite disguise the tremor in her hand. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and simmering anxieties, a perfume Elias had grown accustomed to over his ten years as a probation officer in the gritty, underfunded city of Havenwood.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the grimy windows of the building, a fitting soundtrack to the grim business conducted within.  Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence, and checked his watch for the tenth time in as many minutes.  His next appointment, a repeat offender named Marcus Riley, was already fifteen minutes late.  And Elias had a feeling this wouldn't be a pleasant encounter.
