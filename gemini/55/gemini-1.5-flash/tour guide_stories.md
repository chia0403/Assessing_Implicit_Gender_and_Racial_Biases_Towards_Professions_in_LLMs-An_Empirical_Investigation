The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders, turning the already-sweltering cobblestones of Seville’s Santa Cruz quarter into shimmering, almost liquid, gold.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the flimsy, floral-print fan she perpetually swished.  The air, thick with the scent of orange blossoms and frying fish, hung heavy and still.  Amelia, however, barely registered the discomfort.  Her bright smile, a practiced mask worn with years of experience, was firmly in place, even as a rogue strand of her dark, unruly hair escaped its braid and tickled her cheek.  Today, she was guiding a tour group through the labyrinthine alleys, a gaggle of tourists, mostly American, trailing behind her like brightly coloured chicks behind a clucking hen.  Their murmurs and excited chatter formed a low, insistent hum against the background cacophony of the city – the blare of a distant car horn, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer, the lilting strains of a flamenco guitar echoing from a hidden patio.
