The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the crystal chandeliers, each facet casting rainbows across the polished marble floor.  A symphony of hushed conversations, the gentle clinking of fine china from the Palm Court, and the rhythmic whoosh of the revolving doors created a constant, soothing hum.  This was Amelia Grace Hawthorne's domain.  As Head Concierge, Amelia, with her impeccably coiffed auburn hair and a perpetual air of calm competence, presided over the mahogany desk, a gatekeeper to the whims and desires of the hotel's elite clientele. Outside, the biting January wind whipped through the Chicago streets, but within the Grand Majestic, a haven of warmth and luxury, spring seemed perpetually in bloom.  Tonight, however, a subtle tension hung in the air, a discordant note in the usual symphony, a premonition that Amelia, with her years of experience, couldn't quite ignore.
