The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Memorial Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the concrete floor.  A damp chill permeated the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's worn coveralls like a second skin.  He pushed his mop bucket, its wheels squeaking a mournful tune, past rows of dusty storage shelves packed with discarded medical equipment and forgotten files.  The clock on the wall, its face smudged with grime, read 2:17 am. Elias, whose name tag read "Thorne, E - Janitorial," sighed. Another night, another empty, echoing hallway in the bowels of St. Jude's.  He hadn't seen another soul since the night shift nurse clocked out two hours ago, and the silence, usually a comfort, was starting to feel oppressive.  Tonight, something feltâ€¦ different.
