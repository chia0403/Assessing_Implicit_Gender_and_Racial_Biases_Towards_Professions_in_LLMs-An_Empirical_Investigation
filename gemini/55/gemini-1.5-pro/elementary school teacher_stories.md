The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot hue, slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom at Maplewood Elementary.  Chalk dust motes danced in the golden rays, illuminating the faded world map above the chalkboard and the slightly crooked construction paper sunflowers adorning the bulletin board.  The air, thick with the remnants of glue stick, crayon wax, and the lingering scent of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hung heavy in the stillness.  Outside, the rhythmic squeak of the swing set and the distant shouts of children provided a counterpoint to the quiet within. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, surveyed the room, a faint smile playing on her lips.  The last of her students had just departed, leaving behind a battlefield of discarded worksheets and half-finished art projects. It was the last Friday of October, and Halloween decorations, cobwebs draped haphazardly over bookcases and grinning jack-o'-lanterns perched on windowsills, added to the whimsical, slightly chaotic charm of the space. This was her sanctuary, her domain, a place where magic, however small, happened every day. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a feeling she couldnâ€™t quite place, as though the air itself held a secret.
