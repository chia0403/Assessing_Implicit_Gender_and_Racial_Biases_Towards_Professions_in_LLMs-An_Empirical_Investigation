The whirring of the stand mixer was Amelia "Millie" Rose Hawthorne's daily sunrise. Before the bakery's fluorescent lights flickered on, chasing away the pre-dawn gloom, she’d already be wrist-deep in buttercream, the sweet, vanilla-tinged air clinging to her apron like a second skin. Millie’s domain was the small, frosted-glass partitioned room at the back of "The Sugarplum," a bakery nestled amongst antique shops and quirky bookstores in the heart of Seabrook, a seaside town perpetually smelling of salt and sugar. Seabrook itself was a kaleidoscope of weathered shingles and brightly painted Victorian houses, a place where time seemed to move a little slower, dictated by the rhythm of the tides and the clanging bell of the trolley that trundled along Main Street. This morning, however, the usual tranquility was replaced by a nervous flutter in Millie's chest. Today was the annual Seabrook Sandcastle Festival, and she was tasked with creating the centerpiece cake: a replica of the town's historic lighthouse, complete with edible sugar glass windows and a beacon that actually lit up.
