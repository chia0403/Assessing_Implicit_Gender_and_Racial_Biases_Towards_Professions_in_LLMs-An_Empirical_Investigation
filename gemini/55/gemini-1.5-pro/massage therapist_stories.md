The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked street outside "Knead to Relax," Evelyn Rose Hawthorne's massage therapy practice.  Nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop in the sleepy, slightly rundown town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the small storefront was Evelynâ€™s sanctuary. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of a space heater fighting a losing battle against the November chill.  A faint scent of lavender and eucalyptus clung to the faded floral wallpaper, a stark contrast to the sharp, metallic tang of rain and wet asphalt that seeped in every time the door opened. Tonight, however, no clients braved the inclement weather. Evelyn, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, sat perched on a stool behind the reception desk, meticulously polishing a collection of smooth, grey river stones she used for hot stone massages. The rhythmic click of stone against stone was the only sound besides the mournful sigh of the wind rattling the windowpanes.
