The biting wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of stale bagels and impending rain.  Amelia “Amy” Reyes-Klein, a woman whose fiery red hair was the only splash of color in the pre-dawn grey, perched precariously on a metal folding chair.  Her thick wool coat, usually a source of comfort, offered little solace against the chill that seemed to seep into her bones.  Around her, the controlled chaos of a film set was slowly whirring to life.  Cables snaked across the cobblestone street of Brooklyn Bridge Park, weaving between hulking grip trucks and chattering crew members. Amy, clutching a thermos of lukewarm coffee in one hand and a dog-eared copy of the shooting script in the other, stared intently at the Manhattan skyline, a brooding backdrop for the scene about to unfold.  This was the first day of principal photography for "The Lazarus Gambit," a psychological thriller three years in the making, and the weight of expectation pressed down on her like the steel cables of the nearby bridge.  Everything rested on this.
