The rusty squeak of the barber pole's gears was the soundtrack to Elias Finch's life. It had been for twenty-seven years, ever since heâ€™d taken over his father's shop, Finch's Fine Cuts, nestled on the corner of Oak and Sycamore in the perpetually drowsy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  Havenwood, a town where the biggest excitement was the annual pie-eating contest at the county fair and where the scent of Mrs. Gable's lilac bushes perpetually hung in the air, thick and sweet.  The shop itself was a time capsule: leather chairs worn smooth with age, faded photographs of local sports teams lining the walls, and the faint, comforting aroma of bay rum aftershave. Elias, with his neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and gentle, knowing eyes, was as much a fixture as the shop itself, a quiet observer of Havenwood's slow, steady rhythm. But on this particular Tuesday morning, a thick fog rolled in, clinging to the streets like a shroud, and Elias had the unsettling feeling that the rhythm was about to be disrupted.
