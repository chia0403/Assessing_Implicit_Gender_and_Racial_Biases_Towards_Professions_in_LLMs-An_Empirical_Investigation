The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her cheek as she hurried along Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts battling with the pervasive aroma of exhaust fumes.  A crumpled brown paper bag containing a perfectly ripe Bosc pear nestled securely in her oversized tote bag, a testament to her unwavering commitment to healthy eating, even in the face of Greenwich Village's tempting pastry shops. Amelia, a registered dietitian with a private practice a few blocks away on Christopher Street, was late.  Not catastrophically late, but late enough that Mrs. Rosenblatt, her 4:00 appointment and a woman with an avowed fondness for punctuality, would likely greet her with a pointed stare and a thin-lipped smile.  The thought made Amelia quicken her pace, the rhythmic click of her sensible heels echoing against the brownstones lining the narrow street.  Her office, nestled between a vintage bookstore and an outrageously expensive pet boutique, was a haven of calm amidst the city's frenetic energy, a space she'd carefully curated with soothing sage green walls,  comfortable armchairs, and the subtle aroma of chamomile tea. Little did she know, the tranquility she so carefully cultivated was about to be shattered.
