The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the frosted panes of Revive Physical Therapy and sending a shiver down Dr. Elias Thorne’s spine. He watched from his office window as a flurry of snow began to dust the already grey streets of Evanston, Illinois. Inside, the clinic was warm and smelled faintly of antiseptic and the peppermint tea Elias perpetually kept steeping. The muted glow of a Himalayan salt lamp cast a calming orange hue across the waiting area, where a lone patient, Mrs. Henderson, sat patiently flipping through a dog-eared copy of "National Geographic."  Elias, his hands still chapped from the previous patient’s ice pack treatment, adjusted his tie and sighed. This was the slow season, a welcome reprieve from the summer rush of marathoners and weekend warriors, but it also meant a quiet hum of anxiety about making rent in this increasingly expensive suburb. He hoped the predicted blizzard wouldn’t deter any further appointments.  He needed a good week.
