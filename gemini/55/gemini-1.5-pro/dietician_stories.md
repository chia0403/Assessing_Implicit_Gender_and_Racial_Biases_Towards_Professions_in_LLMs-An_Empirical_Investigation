The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of Oakhaven Manor. Her breath plumed before her, a ghostly white against the backdrop of the imposing Tudor mansion.  Eleanor clutched her battered briefcase tighter, the leather cold against her gloved hand.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Vermont countryside, was a far cry from her bright, modern office in Burlington.  She'd been summoned here by a cryptic email from the manor's housekeeper, Mrs. Grimshaw, requesting a "consultation of utmost urgency" regarding the dietary habits of the manorâ€™s enigmatic owner, Mr. Silas Blackwood.  Eleanor, a dietician known for her practical approach and evidence-based advice, wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but the hefty consultation fee offered had certainly piqued her interest.  And, if she was honest, the air of mystery surrounding Oakhaven and its reclusive owner had also played a part in her decision to brave the winding mountain roads and the increasingly unsettling feeling that she was stepping into a Gothic novel.
