The frosted glass of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office door rattled gently in its frame, a tremor caused by the rumbling of the elevated train that snaked past every few minutes.  The year was 1957, and outside, the damp chill of a Chicago November clung to the air like a stray cat. Inside, however, Amelia's small office, nestled on the second floor of the Wainwright Building, was a haven of warmth and order.  Ledger books, bound in faded green leather, lined the mahogany shelves that reached to the high, pressed-tin ceiling. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the subtle scent of aging paper, creating a comforting, familiar atmosphere that Amelia cherished.  A single gooseneck lamp cast a warm pool of light onto her meticulously organized desk, illuminating the polished surface and the neat stacks of invoices awaiting her attention.  The rhythmic clicking of her adding machine provided a steady soundtrack to her work, a comforting counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of the city below.  But on this particular morning, a different kind of rhythm was about to disrupt Ameliaâ€™s carefully constructed world.
