The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital. The ancient stone buildings, normally radiating a stoic calm, seemed to hunker down against the onslaught, their ivy-covered walls rustling like whispered warnings.  Nestled in the heart of the windswept, remote Scottish Highlands village of Glencairn, St. Jude's was more than just a hospital; it was the lifeblood of the community, a beacon of warmth and hope in a landscape that could be both breathtakingly beautiful and unforgivingly harsh.  The amber glow from the windows spilled onto the slick stones, reflecting in the puddles left by the afternoon's rain, and Amy tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear, her breath clouding in the frigid air. Tonight, the quiet hum of the generator that powered the small hospital was the only sound louder than the wind, a constant reminder of their precarious existence so far removed from the conveniences of the modern world.
