The wind, sharp and smelling of coming snow, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered coat as he surveyed his fields.  The last pumpkins, fat and orange, clung to their withering vines, a splash of defiant colour against the muted browns and greys of late November in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. Thorne Farm, nestled in a high valley carved out by the Tygart River, had been in Elias's family for five generations.  Generations who had wrestled a living from this unforgiving, beautiful land.  The farmhouse, a sturdy two-story structure of hand-hewn logs, hunched against the rising wind like an old man bracing himself against a blow. Smoke curled lazily from its chimney, a promise of warmth and the stew Elias's wife, Martha, would have simmering on the stove.  But even that comforting thought couldn't entirely dispel the unease that gnawed at Elias. The crows, usually boisterous scavengers at this time of year, were silent.  And there was a stillness in the air, a heavy, expectant silence that spoke of something more than just the approaching winter.
