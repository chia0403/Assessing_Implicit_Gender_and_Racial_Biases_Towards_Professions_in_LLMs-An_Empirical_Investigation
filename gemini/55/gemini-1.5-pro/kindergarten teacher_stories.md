The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped within the brightly colored walls of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom, punctuated the otherwise silent pre-dawn gloom.  Sunlight, still a hesitant blush on the horizon, painted long, skeletal shadows of miniature chairs and tables across the linoleum floor.  Rainbow Daycare, nestled amidst a riot of overgrown bougainvillea and hibiscus in Key West, Florida, was usually a cacophony of tiny voices and the rhythmic thump of tiny feet.  But not at 5:30 am.  At this hour, it belonged solely to Eleanor, and the insistent cricket, a soundtrack to her quiet preparations for the day ahead.  The air, thick with the promise of tropical heat and the faint, salty tang of the nearby ocean, hung heavy and still.
