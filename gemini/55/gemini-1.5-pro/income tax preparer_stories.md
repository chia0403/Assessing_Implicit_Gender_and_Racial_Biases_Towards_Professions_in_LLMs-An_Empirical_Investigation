The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finchley's office buzzed in a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of his keyboard. It was the first week of April, the apex of tax season, and Harold, a Certified Public Accountant with the unfortunate nickname "Harry the Taxman," felt the familiar weight of a thousand deadlines pressing down on him. His office, nestled in the back of a squat, brick building on Elm Street, the main drag of the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Pennsylvania, was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatened to topple over, clinging precariously to every available surface. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of fear – the kind only an impending audit could inspire. Outside, the first fragile blossoms of spring were bravely unfurling, a stark contrast to the paper blizzard raging within Harold’s small domain.  Harmony Glade may have been named for its tranquility, but inside 104 Elm Street, peace was a luxury Harold couldn't afford.
