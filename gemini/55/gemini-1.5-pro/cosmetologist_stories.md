The pungent scent of perm solution hung thick in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, stood in the doorway of "Curl Up & Dye," her salon tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery in the drowsy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon.  Rain hammered against the large plate glass window, blurring the view of the town square across the street, where a lone, drooping Christmas tree stubbornly clung to its tinsel despite January's relentless downpour.  The salon itself was a vibrant burst of color in the grey landscape; turquoise walls adorned with framed vintage beauty ads and mismatched salon chairs in shades of flamingo pink and lime green.  It was a space Amy had meticulously curated, a reflection of her own bright, slightly eccentric personality. This Tuesday morning, however, the usual cheerful buzz was replaced by an unsettling quiet.  Amy was alone, and the only sound besides the drumming rain was the insistent ticking of the kitschy, oversized daisy clock hanging above the reception desk. It was a little past nine, and Mrs. Henderson, Amy's first appointment, was inexplicably late.
