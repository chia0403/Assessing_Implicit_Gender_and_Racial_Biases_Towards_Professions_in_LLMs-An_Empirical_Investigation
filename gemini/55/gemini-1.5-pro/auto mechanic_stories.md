The rusty clang of a dropped wrench echoed through the cavernous garage, punctuated by a muttered curse from Elias Thorne.  Grease smeared his knuckles, a testament to the stubborn bolt he'd been wrestling with for the better part of an hour.  Elias's Garage, a ramshackle affair perched on the edge of Highway 17 just outside the sleepy town of Dustbowl, Nevada, wasn't much to look at.  The corrugated iron roof sagged in places, patched with mismatched sheets of metal like a rusty jigsaw puzzle.  Inside, amidst the tangle of tools, spare parts, and half-disassembled engines, a single bare bulb cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the ghosts of countless broken-down vehicles past.  The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and the faint, metallic tang of desert dust blown in through the perpetually open bay doors.  The only other sound besides Eliasâ€™s frustrated grunts was the mournful whine of the desert wind whistling through the gaps in the walls.  This was his kingdom, his sanctuary, his prison.
