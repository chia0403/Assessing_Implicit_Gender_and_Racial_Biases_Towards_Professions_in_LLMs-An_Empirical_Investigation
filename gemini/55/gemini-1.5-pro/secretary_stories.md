The relentless clack of the typewriter keys was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Holloway's existence.  Her fingers, slender and quick, danced across the ivory-colored keys, transcribing Mr. Henderson's latest memo on the proper brewing of Earl Grey tea (a three-page epic, naturally). The air in the office of Henderson & Sons Import/Export was thick with the scent of dust and old paper, punctuated by the occasional whiff of pipe tobacco that clung to everything, like a persistent, unwelcome guest.  The office itself was a relic of a bygone era, tucked away on the fifth floor of a pre-war building on Lombard Street, San Francisco.  Sunlight, struggling to penetrate the grime on the windows, cast long, hazy shadows across the mahogany desk and the overflowing filing cabinets that lined the walls. Outside, the fog horns mourned the coming night, a low, mournful sound that seemed to echo Amelia's own quiet discontent.
