The salt-laced wind whipped around Elias Thorne, plastering his unruly brown hair against his forehead and tugging at the edges of his worn tweed jacket.  He stood at the precipice of Land’s End, the dramatic cliffs of Cornwall plummeting down to the churning Atlantic far below.  The sky, a bruised canvas of greys and purples, mirrored the turbulent sea.  Elias, a man more accustomed to the hushed stillness of libraries than the raw power of nature, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  He’d come to Land’s End seeking inspiration, a spark to ignite the stalled engine of his next novel, a historical fiction piece about a forgotten Cornish smuggler.  So far, all he'd found was wind, rain, and the unsettling feeling that he was standing at the edge of not just the land, but his own creative abyss.  His last novel, "The Clockwork Heart," had been a critical and commercial flop, a steampunk misfire that had left him questioning his entire career.  This trip was supposed to be his resurrection, but the landscape, as breathtakingly beautiful as it was, felt less like a muse and more like a mocking reminder of his failure.
