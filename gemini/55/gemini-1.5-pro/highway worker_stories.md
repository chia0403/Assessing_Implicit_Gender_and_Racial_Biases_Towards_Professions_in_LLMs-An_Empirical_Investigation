The biting pre-dawn wind whipped across the Kansas plains, carrying the faint scent of cattle and diesel.  Rosalind "Rose" Gutierrez, bundled in layers of fluorescent orange beneath a thick parka, stamped her feet against the frozen asphalt. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, quickly snatched away by the relentless wind.  The I-80 stretched out before her like a black ribbon, disappearing into the hazy, indigo horizon.  Two miles east of Hays, Kansas, a string of blinking red lights marked the section of highway Rose and her crew were responsible for patching that day.  The air throbbed with the low rumble of an approaching eighteen-wheeler, its headlights cutting through the gloom like twin laser beams.  Rose tightened the knit cap pulled low over her ears.  Another day on the job. Another day wrestling with potholes the size of small craters.
