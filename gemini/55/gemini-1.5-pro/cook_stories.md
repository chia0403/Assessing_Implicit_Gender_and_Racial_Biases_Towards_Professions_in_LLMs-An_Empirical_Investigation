The clatter of pots and the sizzle of butter in a cast iron pan were the soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's life. Her kitchen, a small but fiercely loved space tucked at the back of The Wandering Waffle, a brightly painted diner on the Oregon coast, was her sanctuary.

The diner itself was a vibrant splash of turquoise and sunshine yellow, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey-blue of the Pacific.

Amy glanced at the clock: 5:45 am. Time to get cracking.
