The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, Director of the Grand Majestic Theatre, as he stood on the fire escape, a half-smoked cigarette dangling precariously from his lips.

The Grand Majestic, nestled between a pawn shop and a perpetually flickering neon sign advertising "Adult Entertainment," was Elias's kingdom, his sanctuary, and his current prison.  Tonight was the premiere of his daringly modern interpretation of  "Hamlet," and the pre-show jitters, usually a thrilling hum, felt more like a swarm of angry hornets buzzing in his chest.  The glowing tip of his cigarette illuminated the deep lines etched around his eyes, a testament to countless sleepless nights spent wrestling with iambic pentameter and recalcitrant actors.  He took a long drag, the acrid smoke doing little to calm the storm raging within him.  He had staked everything on this production, his reputation, his dwindling savings, and perhaps, most importantly, his sanity.
