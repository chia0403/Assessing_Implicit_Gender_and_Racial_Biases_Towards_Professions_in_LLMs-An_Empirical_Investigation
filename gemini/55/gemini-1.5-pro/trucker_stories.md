The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the faded blue paint until it radiated a shimmering heat. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Cartwright wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of grime across her already dusty skin.  Dust devils danced across the barren landscape outside, swirling red dirt against a backdrop of jagged, ochre mountains. Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," stretched out before her, an endless ribbon of asphalt disappearing into the shimmering horizon.  Amy adjusted her mirrored sunglasses, the reflection showing the endless highway behind her and the worried crease between her brows. She had a deadline to meet in Ely, a load of mining equipment that was already overdue, and the nagging feeling that this particular haul was going to be more trouble than it was worth.  The radio crackled to life with static, then a faint voice singing a mournful country ballad about lost love and bad luck.  Amy sighed, a puff of air stirring the dust motes that danced in the cab's sunbeams.  This trip was already shaping up to be one of those songs.
