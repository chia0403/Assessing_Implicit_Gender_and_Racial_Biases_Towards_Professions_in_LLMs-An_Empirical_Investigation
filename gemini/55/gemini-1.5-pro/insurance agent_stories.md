Rain lashed against the window of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside him.  The flickering neon sign of the "Higgins Haven Insurance Agency" cast a lurid, green glow on the overflowing ashtrays and stacks of precariously balanced claim forms. Barty, a man whose perpetually rumpled suit suggested he’d slept in it more often than he hadn’t, tapped a chewed-down pencil against his teeth.  Higgins Haven, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery in the down-at-heel town of Harmony Ridge, Pennsylvania, wasn’t exactly a goldmine. In fact, most days it felt more like a quicksand pit slowly sucking him into a vortex of unpaid premiums and increasingly elaborate excuses.  This Wednesday, however, was shaping up to be something altogether different.
