The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Seabrook Animal Clinic closed.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon. Seabrook, Maine, a small town nestled between the rugged coastline and the dense whispering pine forests, was settling in for another long winter.  The clinic, a quaint converted clapboard house painted a cheerful, albeit slightly chipped, robinâ€™s egg blue, stood on the edge of town, its only neighbors the sprawling cemetery and the perpetually grumpy Mr. Henderson's antique shop.  Inside, the air was thick with the familiar scent of disinfectant and wet dog fur. Eleanor shivered, pulling her thick cable-knit sweater tighter around her.  This was her sanctuary, a place of healing and comfort for the creatures of Seabrook, a place she'd returned to after years away, hoping to find a little peace of her own.  Tonight, however, the quiet felt less like solace and more like a prelude to something unsettling.
