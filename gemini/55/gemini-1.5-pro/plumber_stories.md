The air in Mrs. Henderson’s basement hung thick and damp, smelling of mildew and something else… something faintly sinister.  Dust motes danced in the single bare bulb hanging precariously from a cracked rafter.  Amelia “Milly” Rodriguez, her wrench gripped tight in her calloused hand, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Pipes, ancient and corroded, snaked across the low ceiling like metallic vines, groaning under the weight of decades of neglect.  This wasn't just a leaky faucet; this was a plumbing Pompeii, frozen in time and waiting for the eruption.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Oakhaven, a picture-perfect suburb of Chicago.  But down here, in the bowels of Mrs. Henderson’s Tudor Revival, a different kind of reality was brewing.
