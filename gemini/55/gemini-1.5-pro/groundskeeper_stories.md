The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick tweed jacket as he surveyed the grounds of Blackwood Manor.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots, a brittle soundtrack to the dawn creeping over the vast, manicured lawns.  Blackwood was a behemoth of a place, all gothic spires and leaded glass, perched on a hill overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every inch of the estate, from the gnarled roots of the ancient oaks in the west wood to the delicate, frost-kissed petals of the late-blooming roses clinging to life in the walled garden.  This morning, however, something felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the sea mist rolling in, colder than the frost clinging to the grass.  It settled in the pit of Elias's stomach, a premonition of something amiss.
