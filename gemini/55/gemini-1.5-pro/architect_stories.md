The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, architect extraordinaire, as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the "Skygarden," his most ambitious project to date.  Steel beams, stark against the bruised twilight sky, clawed upwards from the heart of London's financial district.  Below, the city hummed with the relentless thrum of rush hour traffic, a symphony of honking horns and screeching tires, completely oblivious to the quiet revolution happening hundreds of feet above. Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat and a scarf that snapped in the wind like a rebellious flag, pulled his hardhat lower.  He wasn't just building a skyscraper; he was constructing a sanctuary, a vertical oasis amidst the concrete jungle. The Skygarden, with its planned multi-level botanical gardens and public spaces, was meant to be a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively, in a city increasingly starved for both. But tonight, the only thing Elias felt was a growing knot of unease in his stomach.  Something about the silence on the normally bustling construction site feltâ€¦off.
