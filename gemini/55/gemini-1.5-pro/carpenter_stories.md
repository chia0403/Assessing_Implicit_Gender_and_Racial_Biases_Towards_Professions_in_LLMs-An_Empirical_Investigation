The rasping shriek of metal against wood echoed through the crisp October air, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of Elias Thorne's hammer.  Sawdust, fine as powdered sugar, drifted around him, catching the low-slanting sunlight that filtered through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding his workshop.  Nestled deep in the hollow of Whisper Creek, nestled between the towering Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, the workshop was a small, sturdy structure built by Elias himself, its walls seasoned by years of sun and rain.  A pot-bellied stove grumbled contentedly in the corner, fighting off the encroaching chill, its warmth mingling with the sweet scent of cedar shavings that permeated every inch of the space.  Outside, the creek gurgled its secrets to the wind, a constant, soothing murmur against the backdrop of the rustling leaves.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously carved the intricate details of a Griffin into the headpost of a four-poster bed, his calloused hands moving with a practiced grace that belied the strength they possessed.  This commission, for the wealthy Vandergelt family in Asheville, was his most ambitious yet, and the weight of expectation settled on his shoulders like the first snowfall of the season.
