The aroma of burnt sugar and simmering plums hung heavy in the air, clinging to the brick walls of Buttercup Bakery like a persistent admirer.  Amelia “Millie” Hawthorne, her brow furrowed in concentration, tapped a delicate thermometer against the side of a copper pot, the resulting *clink* echoing through the otherwise silent bakery.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky above the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom was just beginning to blush a soft lavender, the only illumination in the deserted Main Street coming from the warm glow spilling from Millie's window.  Inside, nestled amongst shelves laden with mismatched cake stands and antique rolling pins, the only sound apart from the bubbling preserves was the gentle whir of the vintage stand mixer, diligently churning butter and sugar into a symphony of sweetness for the day’s cinnamon rolls.
