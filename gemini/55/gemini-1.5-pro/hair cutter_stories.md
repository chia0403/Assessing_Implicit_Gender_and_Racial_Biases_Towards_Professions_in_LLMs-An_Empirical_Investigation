The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled a mournful tune as the wind whipped down Main Street, rattling the dusty "Open" sign. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her fingers stained faintly purple from the latest batch of elderflower hair dye, sighed and watched the tumbleweeds of dry leaves skitter across the cracked pavement. Harmony Springs, Arizona, hadn't seen a proper downpour in months, and the desert air, usually crisp and invigorating, now felt like a blast furnace.  The only splash of colour in the muted landscape came from the vibrant, hand-painted murals on the brick walls opposite Amelia's salon, depicting scenes of a long-gone era â€“ cowboys on horseback, saloon girls in flamboyant dresses, and a river that was now little more than a trickle in its sandy bed.  Business, much like the river, had also dried up, leaving Amelia with little more to do than sweep up non-existent hair clippings and rearrange the wilting sunflowers in a chipped porcelain vase.
