The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the attic window of Madame Elodie Beauregard's atelier.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale November sunlight that sliced through the grimy panes, illuminating the chaotic beauty within.  Half-finished gowns in shades of emerald, ruby, and sapphire draped over dress forms, their shimmering fabrics whispering promises of elegant soirées and grand balls.  Pins glittered like scattered jewels across a worn velvet chaise lounge, and the air hummed with the rhythmic whir of Elodie’s treadle sewing machine.  Paris, 1888, was a city of contrasts, and Elodie's small, cluttered workspace reflected that perfectly – a haven of artistry nestled within the gritty heart of Montmartre.
