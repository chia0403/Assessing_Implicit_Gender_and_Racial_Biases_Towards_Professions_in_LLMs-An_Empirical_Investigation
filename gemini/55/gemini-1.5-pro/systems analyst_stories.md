Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings skyscraper, blurring the already fading London skyline into a watercolour wash of grey. Inside, the air thrummed with the low hum of servers, a stark contrast to the near-silent office.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst known for her crisp efficiency and even crisper white blouses, tapped a relentless rhythm against her desk with a chewed-on pen.  The blinking cursor on her monitor mocked her, a digital metronome keeping time with the growing unease in her stomach.  It was 2:17 am, a profoundly ungodly hour for anyone, let alone a systems analyst whoâ€™d already put in a twelve-hour day. Yet, Eleanor remained tethered to her desk, a prisoner of a rogue line of code that was threatening to unravel the meticulously crafted digital tapestry of Zephyr's global network.  The air conditioning, set to a perpetually arctic temperature, nipped at her exposed wrists.  Beyond the glass walls of her office, the sprawling floor lay deserted, a labyrinth of empty workstations and flickering screens, each casting an eerie glow in the pre-dawn gloom.  Something wasn't right.  And Eleanor, with a knot tightening in her chest, knew it wasn't just the code.
