The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Evie" Moreau's parka as she prepped the de Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  Glacier-carved peaks, dusted with fresh snow, ringed the frozen expanse of Lake Clark.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, hinted at the rapidly approaching twilight.  Evie adjusted her fur-lined hood, her breath clouding the crisp air.  This was her office, her kingdom â€“ a vast, unforgiving wilderness where she was as much a lifeline as the very aircraft she commanded. Today's mission was particularly challenging: transporting vital medical supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.  The weather forecast predicted worsening conditions, but the outpost had radioed in a critical shortage, and Evie, as always, was ready to answer the call. The twin Otter's engine sputtered to life, a reassuring rumble against the backdrop of the howling wind, a sound that always felt like coming home.
