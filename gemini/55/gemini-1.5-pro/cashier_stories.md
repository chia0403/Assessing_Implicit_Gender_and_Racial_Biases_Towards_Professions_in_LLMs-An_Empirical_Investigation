The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over Aislinn "Ace" O'Malley and the desolate aisle of discount Halloween candy.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune against the grimy windows of the convenience store, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on the outskirts of bleak little Harmony Creek, Oregon. Ace, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, chewed thoughtfully on the end of a red pen, her gaze fixed on the rain-streaked asphalt beyond. It was a slow Tuesday night, the kind that stretched on like taffy, punctuated only by the occasional rumble of a logging truck or the chime of the automatic doors announcing a solitary, desperate soul in search of stale coffee or a last-minute lottery ticket.  Tonight, even those meager interruptions were absent, leaving Ace alone with the buzzing lights, the rustling candy wrappers, and a growing sense of unease.
