Rain lashed against the thirty-foot windows of Elias Thorne's office, the city lights blurring into a shimmering, impressionistic canvas.  Fifty-three stories above the churning chaos of Wall Street, Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne III, felt a familiar knot tighten in his stomach.  It wasn't the storm; he'd weathered worse, both meteorological and financial.  This was different.  His office, usually a sanctuary of polished mahogany and brushed steel, felt like a gilded cage. The blinking screens displaying stock tickers and news feeds, normally a source of exhilaration, now pulsed with an unsettling energy, reflecting the tremor in his own hand as he reached for the crystal tumbler of amber liquid resting on his desk.  The air hung heavy with the scent of impending disaster, a scent Elias, a veteran stockbroker with a nose for volatility, knew all too well.  This wasn't just another market correction; this felt like the prelude to a full-blown crash.
