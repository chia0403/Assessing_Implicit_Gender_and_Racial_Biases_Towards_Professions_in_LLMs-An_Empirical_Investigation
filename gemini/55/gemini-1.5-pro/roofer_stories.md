The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature volcanic eruption on the pebbled surface.  Elias Thorne, his boots planted wide for balance on the steeply pitched roof, wrestled the mop, pushing the molten black goo into every nook and cranny.  The late afternoon sun beat down on his back, baking the sweat into his faded grey t-shirt, but Elias barely registered the heat. He was focused, his squinting eyes fixed on the seam he was sealing, a thin black line against the variegated grey of the shingles. Below him, the small coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon, sprawled out like a rumpled blanket, its brightly colored houses nestled amongst the wind-stunted pines. The air, thick with the scent of pine resin and the salty tang of the Pacific, carried the distant cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shoreline.  This was Elias's world, a world of precarious heights and breathtaking views, a world he ruled with a sturdy ladder and a bucket of tar.
