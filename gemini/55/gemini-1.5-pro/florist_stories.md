The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina, air hung thick and humid, the kind of heat that made the sweet tea taste sweeter and the Spanish moss droop lower from the live oaks.  Inside, the shop was a cool oasis of vibrant colour and fragrant calm.  Sunlight filtered through the large front window, illuminating buckets overflowing with hydrangeas the colour of a summer sky, roses in shades from blush pink to deep crimson, and exotic orchids with petals like painted silk.  Eliza Jane, her auburn braid falling over one shoulder, hummed along to the jazz music playing softly on the radio, her nimble fingers crafting a cascading bouquet of white lilies and delicate ferns.  It was a Tuesday, typically a slow day, but something in the heavy air hinted that this one might be different.
