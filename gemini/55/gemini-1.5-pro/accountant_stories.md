The flickering fluorescent lights of Gallow & Grant Accounting hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s Tuesday afternoon. Rain lashed against the windows of her seventh-floor office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of grey London buildings into an impressionist painting of gloom.  Amelia, a meticulous woman with a penchant for cardigans and a quiet terror of misplaced decimal points, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against her desk, a small frown creasing her brow.  The scent of stale coffee and printer ink hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards from the other cubicles. The glowing numbers on her computer screen, reflecting in her wire-rimmed glasses, told the story of  Bartholomew Industries' finances - a story that, for the first time in Amelia's five years at the firm, didn't quite add up.
