The fluorescent hum of the hydroponics lab vibrated through Dr. Elias Thorne's bones, a familiar thrum that had become the soundtrack to his life. Outside, the Alaskan wilderness raged â€“ a blizzard howling against the reinforced glass of the Aurora Research Station, a beacon of warmth and artificial sunlight against the encroaching polar night. Elias, bundled in a thick fleece jacket despite the lab's regulated temperature, adjusted his bioluminescent goggles, their green glow reflecting off the dew-kissed leaves of genetically modified kale.  He inhaled deeply, the air thick with the earthy scent of growing things, a stark contrast to the sterile metallic tang that permeated the rest of the station.  It was December 21st, the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, and Elias had a feeling this one would be longer than most.
