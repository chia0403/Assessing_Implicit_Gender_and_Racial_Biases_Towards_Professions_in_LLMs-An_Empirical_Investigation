The relentless Louisiana humidity clung to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz like a second skin, plastering her dark hair to the back of her neck.  Spanish moss draped the cypress trees like tattered funeral shrouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawn of the Dubois mansion.  Built in the antebellum style, its once grand white pillars were now stained with mildew and neglect, a testament to the decay that had seeped into the very foundations of the old sugarcane plantation.  A single, flickering gas lamp on the porch cast an eerie glow, illuminating the yellow crime scene tape that crisscrossed the manicured, yet now disturbed, azalea bushes.  Izzy adjusted her holster and took a deep breath, the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle battling with the coppery tang of blood in the air.  This was her third homicide in as many weeks, and something told her this one, in the heart of Ascension Parish, was going to be different.
