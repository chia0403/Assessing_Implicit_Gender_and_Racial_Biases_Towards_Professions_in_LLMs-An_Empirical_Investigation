The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand crystal chandeliers.  A cacophony of hushed conversations, the clinking of champagne flutes, and the gentle murmur of a string quartet filled the air, thick with the scent of lilies and old money.  Outside, the November wind howled against the grand oak doors, a stark contrast to the gilded cage within.  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, barely five foot four and swallowed whole by his oversized maroon uniform, adjusted his cap and plastered a practiced smile on his face.  He was a seasoned bellhop at the Grand Majestic, a witness to countless dramas – whispered secrets, clandestine meetings, and the occasional smuggled pet – all played out within the hotel’s hallowed halls.  Tonight, however, felt different. A tangible tension hung in the air, a prickling sensation that made the hairs on the back of Barty’s neck stand on end. He couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen.
