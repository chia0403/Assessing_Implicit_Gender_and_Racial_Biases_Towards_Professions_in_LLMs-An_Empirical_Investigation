The biting wind whipped at Captain Evelyn "Ev" Rios's turnout coat, sending icy needles of sleet stinging against her exposed cheeks.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful cry against the backdrop of the churning, grey Atlantic.  The salt spray hung heavy in the air, coating everything with a fine, gritty film, including the rickety wooden fishing shack perched precariously on the edge of the crumbling cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine.  Smoke, thick and black, billowed from the shack's single, boarded-up window, a stark contrast to the steel-grey sky.  Ev, her helmet already secured, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't a drill.  This was going to be a bad one.
