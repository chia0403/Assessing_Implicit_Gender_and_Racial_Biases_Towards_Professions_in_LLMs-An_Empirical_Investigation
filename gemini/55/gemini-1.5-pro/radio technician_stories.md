The biting November wind howled around the eaves of the dilapidated lighthouse, rattling the windows of the small outbuilding where Elias Thorne, his full name rarely uttered by anyone but himself, huddled over a workbench.  Salt spray, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, lashed against the single-pane glass, obscuring the already fading light of the late afternoon.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the delicate tuning capacitor of a vintage Zenith radio receiver, his calloused fingers nimble despite the chill that seeped into the bones of the isolated structure on Seal Rock, a mile off the craggy coast of Maine.  The only source of warmth in the cramped space came from a sputtering kerosene heater, which fought a losing battle against the encroaching dampness and the pervasive smell of salt and ozone.  Outside, the rhythmic pulse of the lighthouse beam cut through the swirling grey, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching darkness and the churning fury of the Atlantic.
