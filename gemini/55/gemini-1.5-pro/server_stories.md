The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, otherworldly glow on the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, frying bacon, and desperation.  It was 3:17 am, the witching hour in a town that felt perpetually bewitched, and Elara Juniper Bellweather, her nametag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky counter for the tenth time in as many minutes. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows of the diner like skeletal fingers tapping for entry.  Dust devils of fallen leaves danced across the deserted highway, illuminated by the headlights of the occasional long-haul trucker rumbling past, their engines a low growl in the otherwise oppressive silence.  Elara sighed, the sound swallowed by the drone of the ancient refrigerator in the corner.  Another slow night in Harmony Creek, another opportunity to contemplate the peculiar nature of her existence in this forgotten pocket of the world.
