The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar welcome as she stepped off the ferry onto the cobblestone streets of Inisherin.  The wind, a constant companion on this remote Irish island, whipped at the edges of her thick, woolen scarf, carrying the scent of peat smoke and the distant cries of gulls. Inisherin was a smear of emerald green against a slate-grey sky, the jagged cliffs rising like ancient fortifications from the churning Atlantic. Amelia, her camera bag slung across her shoulder, inhaled deeply, the raw, untamed beauty of the place settling deep within her. She’d come seeking solitude, inspiration, and the elusive, ephemeral light she’d heard whispered about in photographers' forums – a light that painted the landscape in otherworldly hues.  Her little cottage, rented for the month, perched precariously on the westernmost edge of the island, its windows offering a panoramic view of the endless ocean and the mythical, fog-shrouded Rock of the Banshee.  It was here, amidst the whispering winds and the crashing waves, that Amelia hoped to rediscover her passion, a passion that had felt strangely dormant in the bustling city she'd left behind.
