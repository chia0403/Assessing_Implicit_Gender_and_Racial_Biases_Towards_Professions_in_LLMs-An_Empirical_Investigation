The clatter of aluminum stockpots and the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil were the morning symphony of Colette Dubois's life.  Her restaurant, "Le Papillon Bleu" (The Blue Butterfly), nestled in the heart of the Vieux Carr√©, the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, was already humming with pre-service energy.  Sunlight, filtered through the wrought iron balconies that lined the street outside, dappled the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating dust motes dancing in the steam rising from a pot of simmering gumbo.  Colette, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, tasted the rich, ochre broth with a practiced flick of her wrist.  A satisfied hum vibrated in her chest.  It was a perfect Tuesday, the kind that promised a steady lunch rush and the sweet, slow burn of another day doing what she loved most. Little did Colette know, this Tuesday held a surprise, one that would upend her carefully crafted culinary world and sprinkle a dash of the unexpected into her gumbo of life.
