Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to blush with the first hints of dawn, but inside, it was another day in the hushed, sterile world of blood draws and IV lines.  Amelia glanced at the list of names clipped to her clipboard: six patients before seven a.m., each with their own story etched in the shadows beneath their eyes. The first name on the list, Mrs. Eleanor Vance, resided in room 302, and Amelia, with a small, reassuring smile playing on her lips, steered her cart towards the closed door.  Little did she know, the seemingly ordinary Tuesday morning was about to become anything but.
