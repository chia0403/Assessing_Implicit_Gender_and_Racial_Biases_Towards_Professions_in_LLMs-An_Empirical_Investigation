The wind, sharp as a chisel, whipped across the desolate plateau known as the Whispering Cliffs, its song a mournful keening through the towering basalt columns. Dust, the color of dried blood, swirled around Elias Thorne's worn leather boots as he surveyed his latest project.  He stood perched precariously on a wooden scaffold, the rough-hewn planks groaning beneath his weight. Below him, the partially carved face of a griffon, destined for the grand archway of the Duke's summer palace, emerged slowly from a massive block of obsidian. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the cliff face, making the half-formed creature seem almost alive, its single finished eye gleaming like a captured ember.  Elias, his calloused fingers clinging to a well-worn mallet, squinted at his work, the biting wind pulling tears from the corners of his eyes. Winter was coming to the Whispering Cliffs, and with it, an end to the carving season.
