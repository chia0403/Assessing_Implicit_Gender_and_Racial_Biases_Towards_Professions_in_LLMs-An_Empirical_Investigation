The clatter of trams on cobbled streets echoed through the perpetually dusty window of Elias Thorne's tailor shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun, danced a lazy jig in the air, momentarily distracting Elias from the meticulous task of threading a needle. His shop, nestled between a boisterous pub and a perpetually shuttered apothecary in the less fashionable end of Hollow Creek, London, wasn't much to look at.  Faded crimson velvet curtains framed the window displaying a single, impeccably tailored suit, a testament to Eliasâ€™s skill despite his lack of affluent clientele. The air within was thick with the scent of aged wool, beeswax, and the faintest hint of lavender from the sachets Elias tucked amongst the bolts of fabric.  A cast-iron stove, its belly glowing a dull cherry red, fought a losing battle against the encroaching damp.  Outside, a ragged newsboy hawked headlines about unrest in the Balkans, but inside, the only sound was the rhythmic snip-snip of Elias's shears, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.
