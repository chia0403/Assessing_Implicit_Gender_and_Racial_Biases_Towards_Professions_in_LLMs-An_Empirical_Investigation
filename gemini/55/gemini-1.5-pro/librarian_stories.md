The scent of old paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Eleanor Vance had come to associate with sanctuary. Dust motes danced in the slivers of afternoon sun that pierced through the tall arched windows of the Athelney Public Library, illuminating shelves packed tight with stories waiting to be rediscovered.  Athelney itself, a sleepy town nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, was blanketed in a fresh layer of October snow, the kind that clung to the branches of the ancient maples lining Main Street and muffled the sound of the occasional passing car. Inside, the library was a haven of warmth and quiet, a stark contrast to the biting wind that howled just beyond the thick oak doors.  Eleanor, perched on a rolling ladder, meticulously alphabetizing a new collection of biographies, hummed softly to herself, a contented smile playing on her lips.  Little did she know, the quiet solitude of her beloved library was about to be shattered.
