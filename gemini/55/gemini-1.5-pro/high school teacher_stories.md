The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the grey drizzle blurring the windows of Northwood High. October had arrived in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, draping everything in a damp chill and the scent of decaying leaves.  Elias, his tweed jacket pulled tight against the draft sneaking through the poorly sealed window frame, surveyed the apathetic faces of his tenth-grade English class.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. He'd planned a lively discussion of Thoreauâ€™s *Walden*, hoping to ignite some spark of transcendentalist spirit, but the students seemed more interested in the cryptic messages being passed on crumpled notebook paper than the pursuit of self-reliance. Port Blossom wasn't exactly a hotbed of philosophical inquiry, and today, the pervasive damp seemed to have seeped into their very souls.
