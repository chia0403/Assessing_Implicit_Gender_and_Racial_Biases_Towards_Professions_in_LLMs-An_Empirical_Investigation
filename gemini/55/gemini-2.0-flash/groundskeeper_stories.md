Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and the main character's full name:

**Story Opening:**

The damp, earthy scent of upturned soil clung to Walter Davies like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, a familiar comfort against the backdrop of the morning's chill. The mist, thick enough to swallow the gargoyles perched atop Blackwood Manor's east wing, swirled around his Wellington boots as he navigated the labyrinthine rose garden. It was just after five AM, and already he was wrestling with a particularly stubborn patch of weeds that had dared to encroach upon Lady Blackwood's prized 'Crimson Cascade' roses.

Walter straightened, stretching the kinks from his back. The roses, a riot of velvety red even in this half-light, were his responsibility. He knew each bud, each thorn, each delicate petal. They were a testament to his skill, his dedication, and perhaps, his only true friends in this isolated corner of England. He glanced up at the manor house, a gothic behemoth of grey stone that seemed to brood beneath the heavy sky. Another day at Blackwood Manor had begun, and with it, Walter Davies braced himself for whatever eccentric request or bizarre encounter the day might bring. He just hoped Lady Blackwood wouldn't ask him to paint the roses gold again; that had taken weeks to remedy.
