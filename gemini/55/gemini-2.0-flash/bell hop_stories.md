The thick velvet rope felt strangely cold against Elijah Theodore Hawthorne’s sweating palm. He adjusted his already-perfectly-placed bellhop cap, its gold braid gleaming under the art deco chandelier, and took a deep, calming breath. This was it. The start of the Grand Reopening Gala for the Paragon Hotel, and he was the first line of defense against… well, he wasn’t entirely sure what. Just *something* going wrong.

The Paragon Hotel, even in its pre-party hush, hummed with a quiet, opulent energy. Located on the aptly named “Aristocrat’s Row” in Newport, Rhode Island, it had been shuttered for nearly a decade following a series of unfortunate (and, Elijah secretly suspected, somewhat scandalous) events involving its former owner. Now, resurrected by a flamboyant tech billionaire named Victor Sinclair, it promised to be bigger, bolder, and even more extravagant than before.

Every detail, from the newly gilded elevator doors to the hand-painted murals in the lobby depicting mythical sea creatures, screamed money. Even the air seemed to smell of money, a potent cocktail of expensive perfume, polished mahogany, and the faint salt tang carried on the breeze from the Atlantic just a block away.

Elijah, despite the sweat beading on his brow, felt a thrill. He’d only been working at the Paragon for a month, but already the place had burrowed under his skin. It was a living, breathing anachronism, a gilded cage clinging to the rocky coast of a modern world. And tonight, the cage was about to be opened. He straightened his back, adjusted his white gloves, and prepared for the onslaught. He hoped he was ready. He hoped the Paragon was too.
