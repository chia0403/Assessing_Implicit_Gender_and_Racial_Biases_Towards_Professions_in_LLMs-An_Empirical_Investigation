The antique Underwood clattered like a disgruntled woodpecker, each strike echoing in the cavernous silence of the abandoned lighthouse. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, a woman more comfortable wrestling with fictional demons than actual social engagements, paused, her brow furrowed. The salt-laced air, heavy with the tang of seaweed and the mournful cries of gulls, did little to soothe the writerâ€™s block that had descended upon her like a particularly persistent fog.

**Setting:** The story takes place in the crumbling remains of the "Beacon's Hope" lighthouse, perched precariously on the jagged cliffs of Port Lament, a remote, perpetually overcast fishing village on the coast of Maine. The lighthouse itself is a cylindrical tower of grey granite, battered by decades of storms and neglect. The interior is sparsely furnished with remnants of its former life: a rusty bunk bed in the keeper's quarters, a dusty logbook filled with cryptic weather observations, and the gargantuan, now-broken Fresnel lens that dominates the upper chamber like a deceased titan's eye. Electricity is non-existent, so Eleanor relies on oil lamps, their flickering light casting long, dancing shadows that seem to whisper secrets of forgotten mariners and shipwrecks. The constant, rhythmic crashing of waves against the rocks provides a relentless soundtrack to her solitude. The only other sign of life is the occasional fishing trawler chugging past on the horizon and the raucous squawking of the gulls that nest in the crevices of the cliffs.
