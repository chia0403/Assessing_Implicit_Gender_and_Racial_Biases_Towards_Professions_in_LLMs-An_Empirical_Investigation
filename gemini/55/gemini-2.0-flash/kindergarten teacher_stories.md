The buzzing of the fluorescent lights in Room 4B seemed to mock Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth as she surveyed the scene before her. Rainbow-colored alphabet letters clung precariously to the chipped paint of the far wall, threatening to peel off like sunburnt skin. Construction paper cutouts of plump, slightly lopsided turkeys, remnants of a bygone Thanksgiving celebration, were taped to the windows, casting a dim, orange glow across the room. The air hung thick with the scent of Elmer's glue, stale goldfish crackers, and the faint, lingering perfume of twenty-two five-year-olds.

It was Friday, and the relief that should have been washing over Eleanor was instead replaced with a knot of anxiety in her stomach. She loved her job, truly, adored the boundless energy and unbridled creativity of her kindergarteners. But today, something felt…off. The unusually quiet hum of the classroom, devoid of the usual chaotic symphony of children at play, was unsettling. Even the brightly colored rug, usually the epicenter of imagination and games, seemed to be holding its breath. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that the long weekend ahead wouldn't be a break, but a prelude to something…different.
