The acrid smell of burning rubber and something metallic, something sharp and sickly sweet, clung to the air like a shroud. Rain, a relentless, hammering rain that had been falling for three days straight, did little to dissipate it. Evelyn Mae Harding pulled her trench coat tighter around her, the damp fabric clinging to her like a second skin. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, illuminated by the flashing blue and red of police cruisers that painted the scene in macabre strokes.

The setting was the docks of Old Portsmouth, a forgotten corner of a city that had once thrived on shipbuilding and now relied on tourism and whispers of a grittier, more dangerous past. Rusty cranes stood sentinel against the grey sky, their skeletal arms reaching out over the water like accusing fingers. Abandoned warehouses, their brick faces scarred with graffiti and time, lined the waterfront, whispering stories of forgotten deals and broken promises. Tonight, though, the stories being whispered were of something far more immediate and terrifying. Evelyn knew it, she could feel it in the gut-clenching dread that had gripped her since the call came.

A body had been found. And not just any body.
