Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist named Evelyn Rose Callahan:

**Setting:** A bustling, sun-drenched storefront in the heart of Miami’s Little Havana. "La Rosa Nails," a riot of flamingo pink and turquoise, pulsed with the rhythmic clack of keyboards and the low hum of ventilation systems. Old salsa music spilled from a hidden speaker, competing with the rapid-fire Spanish conversations that zipped between Evelyn and her coworkers. Outside, the Calle Ocho sidewalk throbbed with life: tourists snapping photos of the pastel-colored buildings, old men playing dominoes in Maximo Gomez Park, and the ever-present aroma of Cuban coffee hanging heavy in the humid air.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Rose Callahan felt the familiar tremor in her hands, a buzzing energy that started in her toes and fizzed its way up to the tips of her perfectly sculpted, almond-shaped nails. Today, it was less a tremor, and more a full-blown earthquake rattling her bones. Not in a bad way, not yet, but she knew the precipice was near. She’d woken up at 4 AM, fueled by an unshakeable conviction that she *needed* to reorganize her entire collection of glitter polishes – a task that had taken three hours and resulted in a shimmering, rainbow-hued explosion across her small kitchen table. Now, staring down at the plump, manicured fingers of Mrs. Rodriguez, who was yammering on about the latest telenovela drama, Evelyn felt an almost unbearable urge to paint each nail a different, outrageously vibrant shade of neon. Instead, she gripped her cuticle pusher a little tighter, took a deep breath of the sickly sweet scent of artificial almond, and forced a smile. "And then what happened, Señora?" she asked, her voice a little too bright, a little too eager. "Did Diego finally admit to his sins?"
