## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind of late October whipped through the narrow alleyway behind "Golden Years Assisted Living" in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Gnarled, leafless branches scraped against the brick walls, mimicking the skeletal fingers of the elderly residents inside. The smell of damp earth and decaying leaves mingled with the faint, cloying aroma of institutional cleaning solution escaping from a cracked window.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Rose Thorne huddled deeper into her worn, olive-green parka, the collar scratching against her cheek. She pulled her knit hat further down, trying to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into her very bones. Across the alley, light flickered from a window on the second floor of Golden Years. That would be Mrs. Higgins' room, likely the television buzzing with some game show Eleanor knew she'd never understand. Eleanor sighed, the puff of condensation hanging in the frigid air. She shouldn't be skulking in the back alley like a stray cat. She should be inside, checking on Mr. Abernathy's grip strength and encouraging Mrs. Higgins to try those darned resistance bands, again. But right now, with the weight of unpaid bills and the gnawing anxiety about her ailing mother pressing down on her, she just needed a moment of quiet, even if it meant braving the relentless wind.

Eleanor closed her eyes, inhaling the earthy scent, a stark contrast to the sterile environment she inhabited all day. This job, this town, this life...it was all starting to feel like the damp, decaying leaves under her feet. Beautiful once, but now just brittle and waiting to be swept away.
