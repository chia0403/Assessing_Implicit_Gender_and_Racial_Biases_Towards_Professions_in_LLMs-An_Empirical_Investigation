## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Westward Corporation, humming a relentless, monotonous tune, were the first sounds to greet Elias Theodore Finch each morning. Not that he could hear them anymore, not really. Twenty-seven years of mopping floors, buffing linoleum, and emptying overflowing bins had filtered the sound into a background white noise, as familiar and unnoticeable as the air he breathed. Today, however, there was a different kind of hum in the air, a low-frequency vibration that tickled the base of Elias's spine. He paused, pushing his worn-out mop bucket, a loyal companion nicknamed "Bessie" for its reliable leaking, to a standstill.

Elias, a man sculpted by the relentless gravity of his job - hunched shoulders, calloused hands, perpetually surprised eyebrows peeking above his glasses - usually thrived on the solitude of the pre-dawn hours. It was a quiet sanctuary before the suits and starched collars arrived, transforming his blank canvas of gleaming floors into a chaotic Jackson Pollock painting of spilled coffee and hurried footprints. But today, something felt… off.

The building itself seemed to hold its breath. The normally boisterous ventilation system whispered instead of roared. Even Bessie, usually a cheerful participant in Elias’s cleaning routine with her rhythmic sloshing, remained unnaturally still. Elias squinted at the polished chrome doors of the Executive Suite, usually locked tight at this hour. They were ajar, just a crack. And from that crack, the unsettling hum pulsed, growing louder, resonating deep within Elias's bones.
## Setting:

**The Westward Corporation, Downtown Metropolis:**

A gleaming skyscraper dominating the downtown skyline of Metropolis, the Westward Corporation is a multi-national conglomerate with interests spanning technology, energy, and pharmaceuticals. The building itself is a monument to modern architecture: steel and glass, minimalist design, and a pervasive sense of clinical efficiency. Inside, the lower floors house open-plan offices filled with cubicles and collaborative workspaces. Higher floors are reserved for executives, featuring luxurious offices with panoramic city views. Secret research labs and data centers are hidden deep within the building's foundations, their existence known only to a select few. The air is always climate-controlled, and the scent of expensive coffee and ambition hangs heavy in the air. Despite its outward appearance of sterile perfection, Westward Corporation harbors secrets, cutthroat rivalries, and whispers of clandestine projects. The hum Elias hears seems to originate from the highest floors, where the executive suites are located and no one is supposed to be before the executives are in the office.
