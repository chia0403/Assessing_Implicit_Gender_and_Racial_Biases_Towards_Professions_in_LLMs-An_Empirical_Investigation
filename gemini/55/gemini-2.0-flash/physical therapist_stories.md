## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of disinfectant and exertion hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor Maeve Riley. She adjusted the straps of her face mask, the elastic biting slightly behind her ears, and inhaled deeply. Today was the day she had to break the news to Mrs. Dubois. Sixty years a dancer, now facing the reality of a fused ankle thanks to a careless driver and a poorly timed crosswalk.

Eleanor smoothed down the lapel of her crisp white coat, the embroidered “Dr. Eleanor Maeve Riley, DPT” a silent testament to years of dedication and a deep, abiding love for helping people reclaim their bodies. She dreaded these conversations, these moments where optimism faltered against the hard, unforgiving brick wall of reality.

She glanced at the schedule taped to the wall, a grid of names and ailments that represented a tapestry of human resilience, and sometimes, just sometimes, defeat. Today, she was a weaver, thread by thread trying to help piece together the fragments of Mrs. Dubois' shattered life.

## Setting:

Eleanor works at the **"Resurgence Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Center"** located in the bustling, revitalized downtown of **Asheville, North Carolina.** The center is a modern, two-story building with large windows that allow for plenty of natural light. Inside, the décor is a calming blend of muted greens and blues, intended to soothe anxious patients.

The main rehabilitation area is a spacious room filled with state-of-the-art equipment: treadmills, elliptical trainers, resistance bands, balance boards, and various machines designed to target specific muscle groups. A smaller, quieter room is reserved for manual therapy, massage, and private consultations.

Outside, the vibrant energy of Asheville is palpable. The sounds of street musicians drift in through open windows, a constant reminder of the city's artistic spirit. The scent of artisan coffee and wood-fired pizza wafts in from nearby cafes, a sensory paradox to the antiseptic atmosphere of the clinic. It's a place of healing, juxtaposed against the backdrop of a city brimming with life.
