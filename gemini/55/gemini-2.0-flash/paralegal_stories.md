## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the law office hummed a monotonous song that mirrored Amelia Beatrice Hayes' current mood. It was a melody composed of deadlines, depositions, and the distinct, acrid scent of stale coffee. Another Friday evening, another pile of documents threatening to spill over her meticulously organized desk. Amelia sighed, running a hand through her perpetually frizzy brown hair, a stray strand catching on the rim of her oversized glasses. At least the weekend was on the horizon. She just needed to finalize this summary judgment motion for the Miller case, then she could escape the oppressive gravity of Krieger & Stein and sink into a well-deserved Netflix binge. But even as she scrolled through the transcript, a nagging feeling gnawed at her. Something in the plaintiff's deposition… it felt off.

**Setting:**

Krieger & Stein, a mid-sized law firm specializing in personal injury and commercial litigation, occupied the 17th and 18th floors of a glass and steel skyscraper overlooking the bustling financial district of downtown Chicago. The firm was a testament to modern corporate aesthetics: sleek, minimalist furniture, abstract art that screamed "expensive," and an abundance of chrome and glass. The paralegal department, where Amelia resided, was a hive of quiet activity, punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of keyboards, the whirring of the printer, and the occasional hushed phone call. Amelia's own cubicle, squeezed between the perpetually disgruntled Marcus and the incessantly gossiping Brenda, was a testament to her organized chaos. Files were neatly stacked, color-coded tabs protruding like tiny flags, and a small framed photo of her rescue cat, Winston, perched precariously on the edge of her monitor. The view from her desk, while technically impressive – sprawling cityscape stretching to the shores of Lake Michigan – often felt more like a constant reminder of the concrete jungle she was trapped in.
