Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring an interior decorator:

**Setting:** A sprawling, half-finished modern farmhouse nestled amidst the rolling hills of Sonoma County, California. Sunlight streams through enormous picture windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The aroma of freshly cut lumber mingles with the faintest hint of manure from a nearby vineyard. The sounds of construction – hammering, sawing, and the rumble of a Bobcat – are a constant background drone.

**Opening:**

Cordelia Ainsworth adjusted the silk scarf around her neck, a futile attempt to ward off the pervasive chill of the unfinished great room. The scarf, a vibrant explosion of teal and gold, clashed spectacularly with the work boots she wore to navigate the uneven floor. "Well, this is certainly...ambitious," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the insistent whirring of a power drill. Ambitious was putting it mildly. Borderline insane was closer to the truth. Her client, self-made tech mogul Ethan Sterling, had envisioned a rustic-chic retreat where he could escape the digital grind. What he had was a skeleton of a dream, a half-built behemoth of reclaimed wood and exposed ductwork that seemed to mock her every attempt to inject some semblance of warmth and elegance. Cordelia suppressed a sigh. She'd faced tougher challenges than taming a testosterone-fueled construction site. But as she surveyed the vast, empty space, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this particular project was going to test her skills – and her sanity – to their absolute limit.
