## The Setting:

The sun dripped honey gold across the vast, undulating fields of Oakhaven, a valley nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth, ripening corn, and the sweet tang of wild blackberries clinging to the overgrown fencerows. The farmhouses, scattered like weathered knuckles across the landscape, stood as steadfast sentinels against the encroaching wilderness. Each bore the unique stamp of its inhabitants, patched roofs, ramshackle barns, and gardens bursting with vibrant color, testaments to the enduring spirit of those who clung to this hardscrabble land. Oakhaven was a place where time moved slower, where secrets burrowed deep within the ancient hills, and where the rhythms of life were dictated by the turning of the seasons.

## The Opening:

Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling around the calloused boots of Elijah Silas Blackwood as he surveyed his struggling tomato crop. The once-vibrant green leaves were now tinged with yellow, and the fruit hung heavy, stunted and pale. A low groan rumbled from his chest, a sound born of frustration and bone-deep weariness. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his sun-weathered face. Another dry spell, another threat to his livelihood. Elijah Blackwood had seen his share of hardship in his fifty years tending the land his grandpappy had settled, but this felt different, heavier, a gnawing unease that settled in the pit of his stomach like a stone. He straightened his back, the joints protesting with a symphony of creaks and pops, and took a deep breath of the humid air. He wouldn’t let Oakhaven, wouldn’t let his family’s legacy, be swallowed by the drought. He would fight, like he always had, until the very last drop of rain fell.
