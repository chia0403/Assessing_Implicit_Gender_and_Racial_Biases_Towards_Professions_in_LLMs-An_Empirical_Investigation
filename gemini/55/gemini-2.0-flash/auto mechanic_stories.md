## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive summer heat clung to Harmony, Kansas, like a second skin. Dust devils danced lazily across the cracked asphalt of Main Street, occasionally obscuring the fading paint of "Miller's Grocery" or the chipped wooden sign outside "The Rusty Wrench Garage." Inside The Rusty Wrench, the air hung thick with the smell of oil, grease, and burnt rubber. The only relief came from the perpetually wheezing window unit air conditioner, which hummed a discordant tune against the clatter of wrenches and the hiss of the pneumatic impact gun.

**Story Opening:**

"Dammit!" a voice boomed, echoing around the crammed space. **Jonathan "Jonny" Theodore Harding**, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead, slammed his wrench down on the grimy engine block of a 1967 Ford Mustang. The wrench bounced, narrowly missing his calloused hand. This wasn't just any Mustang, either. This was Mrs. Gable's prize-winning 'Stang, a cherry-red beauty that spent more time being polished than actually driven. And now, thanks to a faulty distributor cap and Jonny's notoriously clumsy fingers, it was refusing to even sputter. He wiped his brow with a rag, leaving a streak of black across his forehead, making him look like a coal miner who'd stumbled onto a car show. He hated working on classic cars. They were temperamental, unpredictable, and always, *always* something went wrong. Especially when he touched them. "Just my luck," he muttered, running a hand through his greasy hair. "Guess Mrs. Gable will be walking to Bingo night after all."
