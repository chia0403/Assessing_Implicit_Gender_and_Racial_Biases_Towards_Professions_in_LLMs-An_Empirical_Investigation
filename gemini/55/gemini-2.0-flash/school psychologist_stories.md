## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant lullaby above Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's head as she slumped back in her worn-out office chair. The walls, once a cheerful robin's egg blue, were now faded and peeling around the edges, adorned with a haphazard collection of student artwork - a misshapen clay pot, a crayon drawing of a stick-figure family, and a particularly unsettling finger-painting of what Ellie suspected was supposed to be a unicorn. Outside, the November wind rattled the drafty windows of Northwood Elementary, a brick-and-mortar fortress built in the 1950s, serving a community struggling to reconcile its nostalgic past with a rapidly changing present.

**Opening:**

The stale scent of instant coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint odor of desperation and dried glue. Dr. Eleanor Vance ran a hand through her perpetually messy brown bun, the action doing little to tame the stray strands that persistently tickled her cheek. Her eyes, usually bright and empathetic, were clouded with fatigue, the product of a week spent navigating IEP meetings, mediating playground squabbles, and trying to decipher the cryptic notes slipped under her door by concerned teachers. She was supposed to be preparing for a presentation on mindfulness techniques for elementary school children, but the image of ten-year-old Billy Henderson’s tear-streaked face kept intruding, a haunting echo of a boy overwhelmed by something far beyond his years. A frantic knock on her door shattered the fragile silence, and Ellie braced herself. “Come in,” she sighed, already knowing it wouldn't be good news.
