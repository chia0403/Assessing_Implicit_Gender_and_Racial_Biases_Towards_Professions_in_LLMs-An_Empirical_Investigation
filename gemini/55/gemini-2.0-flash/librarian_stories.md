## Story Opening:

The silence in the Reading Room of the Hawthorne Library was less a peaceful hush and more a suffocating blanket. For Penelope Ainsworth, it was a familiar, almost comforting pressure. She preferred it, truthfully, to the raucous chatter of the outside world. Penelope, Head Librarian of this venerable institution for the past fifteen years, felt more at home amongst the scent of aged paper and leather-bound spines than she ever had in her own, rather sparsely decorated apartment.

Today, however, the usual solace eluded her. A low, almost imperceptible thrum vibrated beneath the floorboards, a feeling that resonated more with her teeth than her ears. It had started subtle, easily dismissed as the rumble of a distant truck. Now, though, it was persistent, growing, and oddlyâ€¦ melodic? Penelope straightened, her meticulously arranged salt-and-pepper bun bobbing against the back of her neck. It was a Tuesday morning, prime reading time for the elderly book club, and the sound was already drawing bewildered glances from Mrs. Gable and her fellow tea-sipping enthusiasts.

She glanced at the large, gothic clock hanging above the entrance. 9:17 AM. Precisely when the thrum had begun. And right about now, she was pretty sure, it was starting to hum a tune.

## Setting:

**The Hawthorne Library:** A Victorian-era building in the small, seemingly unremarkable town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. The exterior is imposing, constructed of dark grey stone and featuring intricate gargoyles perched on its gabled roof. Inside, the library boasts high, arched ceilings, stained-glass windows depicting literary figures, and creaking wooden floors. Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves stretch as far as the eye can see, filled with everything from classic literature to obscure local histories.

The heart of the library is the **Reading Room,** a vast space dominated by a large, circular oak table. Natural light streams in through the stained-glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the worn Persian rugs. The air is thick with the scent of old books, beeswax polish, and a hint of dust. A grand, gothic clock hangs above the entrance, its pendulum swinging with a slow, rhythmic tick-tock that normally provides a soothing backdrop to the quiet atmosphere. Today, however, its familiar sound is drowned out by something far more unusual.
