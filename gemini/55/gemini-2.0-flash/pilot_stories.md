## Story Opening:

The biting wind, smelling of salt and engine grease, whipped across Amelia Grace Trevelyan's face as she pre-flighted the Skyhawk. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern horizon in hues of bruised purple and defiant gold, but here on the airfield, tucked into a hidden cove of the Isle of Skye, the world was still shrouded in a pre-natal gray.

Amelia ran a calloused hand along the wing, checking for ice build-up. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the faint outline of the mountains looming in the distance. She'd flown in worse conditions, plenty worse. But the gnawing anxiety in her gut had nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with the passenger waiting back in the rickety shack they called a terminal. A passenger with a tightly gripped briefcase and eyes that darted around like a trapped rabbit. This wasn't a milk run to Inverness, this was something...else. And Amelia Grace Trevelyan, seasoned bush pilot and accidental confidante to the desperate, had a bad feeling about it.

## Setting:

**Location:** A small, privately owned airfield tucked into a hidden cove on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.

**Time:** Just before dawn, late Autumn.

**Atmosphere:** Remote, windswept, and rugged. The landscape is dominated by dramatic mountains, a choppy sea, and sparse vegetation. The airfield itself is basic and utilitarian, consisting of a single, uneven runway, a small hangar that looks like it might collapse under its own weight, and a dilapidated shack serving as a terminal and office. The overall feeling is one of isolation and exposure to the elements. There's a sense of hidden secrets and illicit activities that cling to the air like the ever-present sea mist.
