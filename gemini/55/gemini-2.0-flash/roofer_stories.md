The biting wind whipped across the slate shingles of the abandoned St. Jude's Orphanage, a mournful howl that echoed the building's tragic history. Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight that pierced through a boarded-up window, illuminating the skeletal remains of a rusting crib. A chill, deeper than the November air, settled in Elara Maeve O’Connell’s bones as she surveyed the ravaged roof.

Elara, a woman built like a sturdy oak with hands calloused from years of wrestling with asphalt and flashing, chewed on her bottom lip. St. Jude’s was her biggest contract yet, a testament to her reputation as the best roofer in Havenwood County. But even for a price that would keep her afloat for the next year, something about this place made the hair on the back of her neck stand on end. It wasn't just the decay, the crumbling brick and shattered glass. It was the lingering sadness, a whisper of children's laughter and tears trapped within the silent walls. She swallowed, grabbed her hammer, and told herself it was just a job. A damn good, and deeply unsettling, job.
