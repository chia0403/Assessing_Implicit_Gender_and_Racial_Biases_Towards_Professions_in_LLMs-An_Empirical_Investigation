The perpetually flickering fluorescent lights of "Bulk Buy Barn" hummed a discordant symphony with the clatter of oversized shopping carts and the cries of restless toddlers. It was, in short, a battlefield of processed temptations. This was where Dr. Eleanor Rose Caldwell, PhD in Nutritional Science and champion of balanced eating, often found herself, usually on a rescue mission to save her sister, Brenda, from the siren song of discount bulk granola bars.

Eleanor gripped the handle of her own much smaller, considerably lighter, basket, her knuckles white. Her usual grocery haunt was the quaint, organic "Green Grocer" on Elm Street, a place where kale was king and high-fructose corn syrup a four-letter word. Here, however, she felt like a secret agent infiltrating enemy territory, her canvas tote bag full of reusable produce bags and her mental Rolodex of healthy substitutions the only weapons in her arsenal. She scanned the aisle, a forest of towering cereal boxes boasting cartoon characters and impossible sugar counts, hoping to intercept Brenda before she reached the 'Mega-Value Pack of Chocolate-Coated Sugar Bombs' she was undoubtedly craving.
