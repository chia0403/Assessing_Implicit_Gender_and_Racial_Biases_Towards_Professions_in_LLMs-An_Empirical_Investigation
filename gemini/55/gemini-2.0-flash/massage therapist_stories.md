The cloying scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung thick in the air of "Tranquility Now," a small, independently owned massage studio tucked away on a quiet side street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. Rain pattered softly against the wide, plantation-style windows, blurring the gas-lit street outside into a watercolor wash of golds and reds. Inside, the lighting was dim and warm, cast by salt lamps and flickering battery-operated candles. Enya whispered softly from hidden speakers. It was exactly the kind of atmosphere required to lull the tension from a stressed-out tourist or, as was the case this particular Tuesday afternoon, a socialite recovering from a disastrous charity gala.

Eleanor Grace Beaumont, her long, dark hair pulled back in a loose braid, hummed quietly as she finished adjusting the headrest on the massage table. Ellie, as she preferred to be called, ran a final check: perfectly placed towel, warmed massage oil ready, ambient temperature just right. It was important to get every detail correct. Her clients weren't just paying for a massage; they were paying for an escape. Ellie took pride in her work, in the almost mystical ability she had to find the knots and aches buried deep within muscle and bone, to knead away the stress and worry that clung to her clients like Spanish moss. And lately, stress and worry seemed to be in high demand.
