Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guard named Alistair Blackwood:

**Setting:**

The year is 1488. The setting is the sprawling, gothic-inspired city of Eldoria, nestled at the foot of the jagged Spine Mountains. Eldoria is a city of stark contrasts: opulent merchant houses with stained-glass windows cast long shadows over the crowded, cobbled streets of the lower wards. The air is thick with the smells of woodsmoke, spices, and the ever-present undercurrent of sewage. Dominating the skyline is the Obsidian Citadel, a fortress of black stone that has stood for centuries, home to the enigmatic and increasingly paranoid Lord Regent Theron. A perpetual mist clings to the upper reaches of the Citadel, obscuring its highest towers. Outside the city walls stretches the Whisperwood, a vast and ancient forest rumored to be haunted by restless spirits and creatures of myth.

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind, sharp as shards of glass, whipped through the gap between Alistair Blackwood’s helmet and his thick woolen scarf. Another night on the east wall, another night staring out into the inky blackness of the Whisperwood. He shifted his weight, the cold seeping through the soles of his worn leather boots. He’d been a guard in Eldoria for ten long years, and every winter was the same: a bone-chilling test of endurance, punctuated by the occasional drunkard trying to scale the walls or, rarer still, a pack of desperate wolves driven into the city by starvation. He preferred the wolves. They were predictable.

Tonight, however, felt different. The usual comforting rhythm of the city – the distant rumble of carts, the faint singing from a late-night tavern – seemed muted, replaced by a heavy, unsettling silence. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath. Alistair ran a gloved hand over the cold stone of the battlements, his senses on high alert. Something was coming. He could feel it in the marrow of his bones.
