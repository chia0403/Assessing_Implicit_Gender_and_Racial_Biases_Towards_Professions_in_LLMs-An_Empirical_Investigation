The stench hit Reginald "Reggie" Bartholomew Plumbingworth like a physical blow the moment he opened the crawl space door. It was a sickly sweet, acrid perfume, a cocktail of mildew, rodent droppings, and something…else. Something vaguely floral, like potpourri left to rot in a swamp. Reggie wrinkled his nose, adjusted the headlamp strapped to his forehead, and descended, the low wooden door groaning shut behind him, plunging the tiny space into a claustrophobic darkness punctuated only by the beam of his light.

The setting was the crawl space beneath Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle’s Victorian-era gingerbread house on Primrose Lane in the quaint, perpetually-sunshiny town of Meadowbrook, Connecticut. Meadowbrook was the kind of place where the only news was whose petunias bloomed first, and where a leaky faucet was considered a community crisis. Mrs. Periwinkle herself was a fixture of the town, known for her prize-winning zucchini and her uncanny ability to predict the weather using only her arthritis. She had called Reggie earlier that morning, her voice trembling with distress, claiming a "peculiar dampness" was plaguing her pantry and suspecting a burst pipe. Reggie, a man who preferred the challenge of a gnarly drain clog to the tedium of small-town gossip, had reluctantly agreed to take a look. Now, wading through dust bunnies the size of small kittens and dodging cobwebs thick as cotton candy, he was starting to regret his good deed.
