The setting was a dimly lit, dive bar called "The Rusty Mug," nestled on a forgotten corner of Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The air hung thick and heavy with the ghosts of spilled beer, stale cigarettes, and the faint, persistent scent of desperation. Outside, the city throbbed with a relentless energy – the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the mournful wail of a trumpet from a nearby jazz club, the drunken shouts echoing in the humid night. But inside The Rusty Mug, time seemed to slow to a molasses drip, each minute clinging stubbornly to the last.

Behind the mahogany bar, polishing a glass with a practiced hand, stood Bartholomew "Bart" Montgomery. He was a man etched with the map of a life well-worn. A constellation of freckles dusted his nose and cheeks, framed by a close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard. His eyes, the color of aged whiskey, held a quiet intensity that belied the weariness clinging to his shoulders. He'd seen it all within these four walls – the elation of victory, the bitter taste of defeat, the clumsy fumbling of first love, and the raw, primal grief of loss. And tonight, as the neon sign flickered erratically above the door, casting dancing shadows across the empty stools, he had the unsettling feeling that something new, something…significant, was about to walk in.
