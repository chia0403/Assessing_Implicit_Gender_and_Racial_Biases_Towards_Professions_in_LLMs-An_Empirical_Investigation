## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The lobby of "Synergy Solutions," a gleaming, modern office building in the heart of Silicon Valley. The air smells faintly of lemon-scented cleaner and expensive coffee. Glass and steel dominate the architecture, reflecting the harsh California sun. Everything is impeccably clean and designed to project an image of forward-thinking innovation.

**Opening:**

The digital clock embedded in the polished chrome reception desk blinked 8:59 AM, and Imogen Aurora Blackwood mentally braced herself. 9:00 AM sharp was when the caffeine-fueled chaos typically began. Just as the clock ticked over, the glass doors hissed open, admitting a harried-looking man in a rumpled, ill-fitting suit. He clutched a tablet precariously and his tie was askew. Before Imogen could even offer a polite "Good morning," he was sputtering.

"Is this Synergy Solutions? I have a nine o'clock with... with... uh... Dr. Anya Sharma? About, uh, the... the Neuralink Optimization Project?" He frantically scrolled through his tablet, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Imogen, ever the picture of calm professionalism, offered a serene smile. "Good morning, sir. Yes, you're in the right place. And Dr. Sharma is expecting you. May I have your name, please?" She already knew the answer. She'd confirmed his appointment three times yesterday alone. But protocol was protocol, and Imogen Aurora Blackwood believed in adhering to protocol. Especially when it involved dealing with sleep-deprived engineers.
