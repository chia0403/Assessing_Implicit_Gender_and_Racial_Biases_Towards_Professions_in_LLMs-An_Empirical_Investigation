Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dental hygienist named Evelyn Rose Thorne:

**Setting:** The setting is a small, older house in the historic district of Salem, Massachusetts. It's mid-October, and the crisp autumn air carries the scent of woodsmoke and fallen leaves. The house is painted a faded seafoam green, with shutters that have seen better days. A gnarled, ancient oak tree dominates the small front yard, its branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards the sky. String lights, shaped like miniature ghosts, twinkle on the porch, a festive, if slightly unsettling, touch. Inside, the house is cluttered but cozy, filled with antique furniture, overflowing bookshelves, and the comforting aroma of cinnamon and brewing tea.

**Story Opening:**

Evelyn Rose Thorne swore under her breath as she wrestled with the stubborn latch on her antique toolbox. The old thing was a family heirloom, passed down from her great-grandmother, a traveling apothecary, but its current purpose was far less glamorous. It was filled with her dental hygiene tools – scalers, mirrors, probes – rather than vials of tinctures and mysterious herbs. Tonight, instead of coaxing stubborn stains from pearly whites at Dr. Albright's office, she was dealing with something far more…resistant.

A sharp rap at the door nearly made her drop the toolbox. "Just a minute!" she called out, her voice tight with frustration. Tonight was supposed to be relaxing, a quiet evening with a cup of herbal tea and a new Agatha Christie novel. Instead, she was hunched over a dusty, half-decayed skull in her living room, trying to determine the cause of death. And now, someone was at her door. Salem, she thought with a sigh, even when it wasn't Halloween, never let you have a dull moment.
