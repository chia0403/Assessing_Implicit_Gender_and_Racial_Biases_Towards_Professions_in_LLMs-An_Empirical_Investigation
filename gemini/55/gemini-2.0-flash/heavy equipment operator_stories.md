The air hung thick and heavy, a damp blanket woven with the scent of diesel, turned earth, and the faint, metallic tang of river water. A low, persistent hum vibrated through the soles of Bethany "Beth" Anne Kowalski's work boots as she climbed into the cab of her Caterpillar 349E excavator. The sun, a bruised plum colour, was just starting to peek over the jagged silhouette of the Appalachian foothills, painting the already churning waters of the Elk River a sickly pink.

This was her domain: the sprawling, muddy wasteland that was once a scenic riverside park in Clay County, West Virginia. The floods of '22 had ravaged the community, leaving behind a trail of destruction that made even a seasoned operator like Beth swallow hard. Now, it was her job, and the job of the crew of Kowalski & Sons Construction, to tame the beast.

Beth, sweat already beading on her forehead despite the pre-dawn chill, ran a calloused hand over the worn leather of her favourite work gloves. The excavator, nicknamed "Behemoth" for its sheer size and power, was her partner in this gargantuan task. She knew every groan, every rumble, every precise twitch of the hydraulic lines. Today's mission: clearing a mountain of debris – twisted metal, splintered wood, and enough silt to bury a small town – from the riverbank, prepping it for the new levee construction. The weight of the community, and the legacy of her father's company, rested heavy on her shoulders. It was time to get to work.
