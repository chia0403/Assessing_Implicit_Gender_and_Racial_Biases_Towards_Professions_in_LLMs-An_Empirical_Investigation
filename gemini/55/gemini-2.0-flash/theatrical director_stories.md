The chipped enamel of the tea kettle shrieked, a discordant overture to Arthur Reginald Finch’s already chaotic morning. Arthur, perpetually dressed as if perpetually late for opening night (today's ensemble featured a velvet cravat, stained with yesterday’s marinara, and a tweed jacket two sizes too large), snatched the kettle off the burner with a practiced, albeit slightly singed, hand. The tiny kitchen, a cramped afterthought in his even tinier flat above the Odeon Theatre, was a testament to his priorities: a towering stack of dog-eared scripts threatened to topple a precarious shelf laden with half-empty paint pots and costume sketches. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated window, painted the room in a depressing sepia tone, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air like disapproving spirits.

This was Arthur Reginald Finch’s rehearsal space, his sanctuary, and, judging by the smell of damp plaster and stale cigarettes, a location intimately familiar with neglect. Outside, the bustling city of Brighton hummed with the promise of a seaside summer; inside, Arthur was trapped in the claustrophobic gloom, wrestling with the ghost of Noel Coward and the decidedly un-ghostly incompetence of his leading man.
