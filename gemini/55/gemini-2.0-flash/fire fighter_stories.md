The alarm shrieked through the slumbering firehouse, a piercing, insistent cry that ripped Michael James O’Connell from a dream about chasing a rogue Dalmatian through a field of sunflowers. He shot upright in bed, the thin cotton sheet clinging to his sweat-slicked skin. The digital clock on his nightstand glared 3:17 AM. Groaning, he swung his legs over the side, the cold linoleum a rude awakening against his bare feet.

The setting was the aging Station 12, nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a town steeped in lumberjack history and nestled at the foot of the towering, emerald-green Cascade Mountains. The station itself was a relic, a two-story brick building with a faded red door and a bell tower that hadn’t chimed in decades. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, boot polish, and the faintest metallic tang of soot. Photographs of past fire crews lined the walls, their faces grim and determined, a silent testament to the dangers faced within Havenwood’s tightly packed, dry-wood houses. The worn leather sofas sagged under the weight of countless drowsy firefighters, and the ping-pong table in the rec room bore the scars of a thousand hard-fought games. Station 12 was a home, a haven, and tonight, a launchpad into the unknown darkness.
