**Opening:**

The air in the smoky club hung thick with desperation and the faint scent of stale beer. It was the kind of place dreams went to die, or, if you were lucky, resurrect on borrowed time. The stage, a pathetic scrap of stained wood, seemed to sag under the weight of its own misery. But tonight, under the dim, flickering spotlight, hope flickered brighter than usual. Or, at least, that's what Arabella Marguerite Rossi desperately needed to believe.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. The location: "The Velvet Curtain," a dimly lit, jazz club nestled in the grimy underbelly of Chicago's Near North Side. The club is a melting pot of late-night revelers, washed-up musicians, and those looking for a fleeting escape from the harsh realities of post-war America. Red velvet drapes, once luxurious, are now faded and threadbare, barely concealing the peeling wallpaper and water stains that tell a silent tale of neglect. Tiny, round tables, each adorned with a flickering candle in a cheap glass holder, are crammed haphazardly together. The room is constantly abuzz with the low murmur of conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the nervous energy that precedes every performance.
