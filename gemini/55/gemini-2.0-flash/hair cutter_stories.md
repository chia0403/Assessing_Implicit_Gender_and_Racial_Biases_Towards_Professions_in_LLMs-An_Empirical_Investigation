## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Scissors & Sin" jingled a weary tune, a sound as familiar to Juniper Anastasia Blackwood as her own heartbeat. A gust of wind, carrying the scent of brine and impending rain, whipped into the small shop, scattering a few stray strands of auburn hair that had escaped the broom’s attention. Juniper sighed, pushing a stray curl from her own forehead, her fingers stained a faint, persistent purple from last week's disastrous attempt at balayage. Another Tuesday, another day of trying to make ends meet in a town that seemed determined to fray at the edges, just like her nerves. She glanced at the appointment book lying open on the chipped countertop, a lonely island of white amongst the clutter of combs, bottles, and half-empty coffee cups. Today’s only client was Mrs. Gable, due in at eleven for her usual "trim and a touch-up on the roots, dear, you know, keep the grey at bay." 

## Setting:

"Scissors & Sin" was a small, unassuming storefront tucked away on a quiet side street in Port Blossom, Maine. The town, once a bustling fishing village, was now mostly populated by retirees, artists, and tourists who came to admire the rugged coastline and quaint, if slightly crumbling, charm. The shop itself reflected the town's dual nature: vintage charm fighting a losing battle against the relentless wear and tear of time. The walls, painted a cheerful seafoam green decades ago, were now peeling in places, revealing glimpses of a faded floral wallpaper underneath. A mismatched collection of antique mirrors lined one wall, reflecting the rows of barber chairs, each with its own quirky personality. One was a classic leather model, worn smooth with age, while another boasted a garish leopard-print seat cover. The air hung thick with the familiar scents of hairspray, disinfectant, and the faint, lingering aroma of the sea. Sunlight, when it bothered to peek through the perpetually overcast sky, filtered through the dusty windows, illuminating floating motes of hair and giving the whole place a dreamlike, slightly melancholic quality.
