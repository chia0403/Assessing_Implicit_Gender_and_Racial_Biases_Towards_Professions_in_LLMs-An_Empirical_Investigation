## Story Opening:

The stench hit Amelia Hayes like a physical blow. It wasn’t just the decaying organic matter, a smell she’d become sickeningly familiar with over the past few weeks, but something else... something metallic and vaguely sweet. Blood, maybe, or something akin. Amelia pulled her scarf tighter around her face, uselessly trying to filter the oppressive odor that hung heavy in the air of the abandoned textile mill. The morning mist clung to the rusted corrugated iron of the building’s skeletal frame, adding a layer of gothic drama that Amelia could appreciate, if she weren't wading knee-deep in muck and dread.

She gripped her notepad tighter, the cheap paper already damp from the humidity and the sheer clamminess of her palms. Her breath hitched, a small white puff against the gray. This was it. This was the source.

The door creaked open before her, swallowed by the cavernous darkness within, a maw promising secrets best left buried. But Amelia Hayes, journalist for the struggling "Ashton Chronicle", wasn't one for leaving secrets buried. Not anymore. This story, this grim, festering story, could be her ticket out of obituary writing and local dog shows. This story, if she lived to tell it, could make her.

## Setting:

The abandoned Hawthorne Textile Mill, located on the outskirts of Ashton, a dying mill town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Once the economic heart of the region, the mill now stood as a rotting monument to broken promises and forgotten dreams. The building was a sprawling complex of interconnected brick and corrugated iron structures, riddled with broken windows, collapsed roofs, and overgrown with creeping vines. The surrounding grounds were a wasteland of discarded machinery, rusted metal, and stagnant pools of rainwater. The air was perpetually damp and heavy, thick with the smell of decay and neglect. Ashton, itself, was a ghost of its former self, clinging to life with the tenacity of a weed growing through cracked concrete. Unemployment was rampant, hope was scarce, and the once vibrant community was slowly suffocating under the weight of economic hardship and social decay.
