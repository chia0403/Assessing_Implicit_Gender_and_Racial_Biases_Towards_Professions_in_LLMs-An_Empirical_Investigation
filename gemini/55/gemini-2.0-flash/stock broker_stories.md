It was 6:17 PM, precisely three minutes later than he'd promised Eleanor he'd be home, and he could already feel the familiar tightening in his stomach – a knot of guilt and weary resentment he’d come to associate with Fridays. The sky was a bruised plum color, the last vestiges of daylight bleeding out over the concrete canyons of the Financial District. Hordes of tired, well-dressed professionals, their faces illuminated by the ghostly glow of their smartphones, surged around him, a river of ambition and exhaustion flowing towards the subway and the hope of a weekend reprieve.
