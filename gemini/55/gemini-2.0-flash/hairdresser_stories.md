The oppressive humidity clung to the air inside "Curl Up & Dye," making the already potent mix of hairspray, peroxide, and lingering regret even thicker. Outside, the sleepy coastal town of Seabreeze buzzed with the languid energy of a mid-July afternoon, tourists ambling past, ice cream dripping down their hands. But inside, the world belonged to Bernadette "Bernie" Mallory, her domain a chaotic symphony of clippers, combs, and half-finished transformations. She stood hunched over her station, a battlefield of bobby pins and stray strands of auburn hair, her brow furrowed in concentration. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, had decided on a drastic change - from a mousy brown bob to a fiery red pixie cut - and Bernie was trying her damndest to deliver, all while internally battling the urge to suggest a nice, sensible perm. Seabreeze might be picturesque, but its clientele were... a unique breed. And Bernie, despite harboring dreams of a Vidal Sassoon scholarship and a sleek salon in the city, was stuck, for now, wielding her scissors in the sticky, small-town haven she'd sworn she'd escape years ago.
