The crisp autumn air, smelling sharply of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, did little to soothe Dr. Evelyn Grace Montgomery’s nerves. The old Victorian house, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, was undeniably charming. But charm didn’t fix the creaking porch swing that threatened to decapitate anyone who dared to sit on it, nor did it explain the distinct chill that clung to the air inside, even with the fireplace roaring. This was, she thought, the perfect setting for a horror movie, not a thriving chiropractic practice.

Havenwood, Pennsylvania, was supposed to be her fresh start. Escape the hustle and bustle of the city, reconnect with nature, and maybe, just maybe, find a slower, more peaceful rhythm. But the locals, with their guarded smiles and whispers, made her feel like a stranger in a land where everyone knew something she didn't. And this house, a steal on the market, was giving her a serious case of the willies.

Evelyn ran a hand through her short, dark hair, the flickering candlelight reflecting in her worried brown eyes. She'd spent the last three days scrubbing, painting, and attempting to coax the antique plumbing back into working order. The scent of lemon cleaner and pine needles was a stark contrast to the underlying aroma of dust and something indefinably *old*. Tonight, she was finally unpacking the last of her equipment - the intricately crafted adjusting table, the anatomical charts, and the skeletal model, affectionately nicknamed "Bonesly" - hoping to transform the dusty parlor into a welcoming and healing space. But with every creak of the floorboards and howl of the wind, she couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't alone, and that Havenwood, and this house in particular, held secrets it wasn't quite ready to share.
