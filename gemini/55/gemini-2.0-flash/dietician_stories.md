Okay, here’s a story opening and setting for a story with a dietician as the main character:

**Opening:**

The smell of burnt almond extract, a scent Beatrice Lillian Cartwright associated more with disaster than deliciousness, clung to the air like a stubborn houseguest. She wrinkled her nose, the fine lines around her bright blue eyes deepening. Today’s group cooking class at the community center was clearly off to a stellar start. "Right," she said, clapping her hands together with forced cheerfulness, "Who wants to tell me what they *think* went wrong?" The silence that followed was thick enough to spread on toast.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the cramped, somewhat dingy, kitchen of the **Willow Creek Community Center** in the small, rural town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  The kitchen is a testament to good intentions and limited funding.  Mismatched, slightly wobbly tables are pushed together to form makeshift workstations.  The linoleum floor, a faded checkered pattern, is sticky in places.  An ancient, industrial-sized oven dominates one wall, its surface scarred and speckled with years of spilled food.  The walls, painted a cheerful but peeling shade of yellow, are adorned with posters featuring healthy eating tips and hand-drawn illustrations of the food pyramid.  A chalkboard hangs near the entrance, currently displaying a smudged list of ingredients for "Almond Butter Energy Bites" – the source of the olfactory offense.  The overall impression is one of well-meaning practicality battling against the inevitable creep of age and neglect.
