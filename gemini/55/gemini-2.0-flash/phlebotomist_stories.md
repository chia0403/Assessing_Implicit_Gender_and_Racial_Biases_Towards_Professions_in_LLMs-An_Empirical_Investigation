Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a phlebotomist main character:

**Story Opening:**

The sickly sweet smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Seraphina "Sera" Riley, even after ten years of drawing blood. The sterile scent barely masked the other, more unsettling smells that permeated St. Jude's Hospital – the acrid tang of fear, the faint mustiness of old age, and the metallic tang of blood, real and imagined. Today, however, there was something else, a subtle floral perfume, that didn't belong. It drifted from behind curtain number three in the early morning lab, a space usually reserved for urgent stat draws. Sera frowned, pushing her wire-rimmed glasses higher on her nose. She hadn’t seen that patient file come across her screen.

"Morning, Janet," she called out to the admissions nurse, her voice barely audible above the hum of the centrifuge. "Everything running on time this morning?"

Janet, whose smile lines seemed permanently etched into her face, glanced up from her computer. "More or less, Sera. Mrs. Ainsworth in three is a bit of a late add-on, but Dr. Beaumont wants her labs done ASAP. Said it was…unusual circumstances." Janet's eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of curiosity behind them. "Said she's got a visitor bringing flowers. That must be it."

Sera hesitated. Unusual circumstances at St. Jude's usually meant trouble. Taking a deep breath, she tightened the strap of her phlebotomy belt and headed towards curtain number three.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the early morning (around 7:00 AM) at St. Jude's Hospital, a large, somewhat older hospital located in a bustling, working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia. The specific location within the hospital is the main blood-draw lab, a brightly lit, somewhat cramped space with rows of phlebotomy chairs separated by curtains. The walls are a pale, institutional green and covered with posters about blood donation and infection control. Shelves are stocked with vacutainers, needles, tourniquets, and other medical supplies. The air is filled with the hum of medical equipment and the murmur of conversations between staff and patients. The atmosphere is generally tense, a mix of anxiety and urgency, but there are small touches of humanity, like the colorful, hand-drawn pictures from children patients taped to the walls. The overall feeling of the lab is that of a well-worn but functional space where life and death decisions are made daily.
