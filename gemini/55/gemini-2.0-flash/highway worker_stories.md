Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Dale Earnhardt Johnson:

**Setting:**

The setting is a desolate stretch of Interstate 80 in western Wyoming, about thirty miles east of Evanston. It's early October, and the high desert air is crisp and biting, even in the midday sun. The landscape is a stark palette of browns and grays: sagebrush clinging stubbornly to the hard-packed earth, jagged rock formations jutting skyward, and the endless ribbon of asphalt dissecting it all. A fierce wind perpetually whips across the plains, carrying fine grit that stings the skin and settles into every crack and crevice. The only signs of civilization are the occasional lonely ranch house miles off the highway, the infrequent rumble of a semi-truck barreling eastward, and the scattered orange cones and reflective signs of the Wyoming Department of Transportation road crew.

**Story Opening:**

Dale Earnhardt Johnson leaned heavily on the handle of his shovel, the muscles in his back screaming a protest that he ignored. The wind was relentless, a constant physical assault that threatened to rip the hat off his head and send his breath swirling away into the vast, indifferent sky. He squinted, the sun glinting off the tiny shards of asphalt that peppered the roadside. He’d been patching potholes on this godforsaken stretch of I-80 for the last three weeks, and he felt like he was slowly becoming one with the cracked and crumbling pavement.

Another eighteen-wheeler roared past, the force of its passage rocking him on his feet and sending a fresh wave of dust into his face. Dale spat, a reflex he'd honed over years of breathing exhaust fumes and pulverized rock. He hated this section of highway. Hated the endless monotony, the relentless wind, and the feeling that he was utterly alone in the vast, uncaring expanse of Wyoming. But a job was a job, and Dale Earnhardt Johnson had a family to feed.

He straightened up, ignoring the sharp twinge in his lower back, and surveyed his work. Another pothole filled, another small victory against the relentless decay of the asphalt. He tamped down the patch with the shovel, smoothing it until it was almost seamless. Almost. He knew it wouldn’t last. Nothing ever lasted out here. He was just delaying the inevitable, fighting a losing battle against the forces of nature and the relentless pounding of the road.

He was about to grab another scoop of asphalt when he saw it. Not on the road, not in the sagebrush. But something glinting strangely in the ditch beside the westbound lane, something out of place, something…wrong. Dale sighed. Another day, another detour from the back-breaking work. He hoisted himself down the embankment, the wind tugging at his jacket, a sense of foreboding settling in his stomach. Whatever it was, he knew, it wasn't going to be good.
