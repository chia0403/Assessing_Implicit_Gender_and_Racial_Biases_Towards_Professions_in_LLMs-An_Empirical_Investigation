The desert wind, hot and relentless, clawed at the chrome of Delilah Mae Johnson's Peterbilt, the "Dust Devil." It was late afternoon, the sun a molten disc sinking towards the horizon, painting the scrubland in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple. Delilah gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel, her knuckles white, as she navigated the endless stretch of Nevada State Route 375, the Extraterrestrial Highway. She'd been hauling a load of frozen burritos from Salt Lake City to Rachel, Nevada, the town closest to Area 51, for the past twelve hours, and the monotonous hum of the engine was starting to grate on her nerves. The only other sound was the crackle of her CB radio, silent for the last hour, a stark contrast to the usual chatter of fellow truckers.

This part of Nevada felt like the edge of the world, a place where reality frayed and the bizarre became commonplace. Delilah, a woman with eyes as blue and unforgiving as the desert sky and a heart as tough as the metal she drove, wasn't easily spooked, but even she had to admit, this stretch of road gave her the creeps. Especially tonight.
