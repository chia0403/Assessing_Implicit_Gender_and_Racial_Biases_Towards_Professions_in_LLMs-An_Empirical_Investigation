The stale, recirculated air of the Suffolk County Courthouse clung to Eleanor Vance like a damp shroud. It was a humid late July morning, the kind that promised thunderstorms but only delivered a thick, oppressive heat that seeped into everything. Eleanor smoothed down the skirt of her navy blue suit, the only concession she'd made to the weather being opting for linen rather than wool. It wouldn't matter soon anyway. Once the jury returned, the temperature in this room would be the least of her worries.

The courtroom itself was old, built in the grand, if slightly impractical, style of a bygone era. High ceilings were adorned with chipped plaster rosettes, and the heavy wooden benches, polished smooth by generations of restless fidgeting, creaked ominously whenever someone shifted their weight. Sunlight, filtered through grime-streaked windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, impatient spirits. It was a place steeped in history, in both justice and injustice, and Eleanor felt its weight settling heavily on her shoulders. The air hummed with a nervous energy, a silent anticipation that only intensified the oppressive silence. The court reporter, Mrs. Henderson, sat perched behind her machine, her fingers poised, ready to immortalize the verdict, whatever it may be. And across the room, at the prosecution table, sat Assistant District Attorney Marcus Bellweather, his youthful face tight with determination, his eyes, never leaving Eleanor, cold and unwavering. He wanted this win, she knew, and she desperately needed to deny it to him. Her client's life hung in the balance.
