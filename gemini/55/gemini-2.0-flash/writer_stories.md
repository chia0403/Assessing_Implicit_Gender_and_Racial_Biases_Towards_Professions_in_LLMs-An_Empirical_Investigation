The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a small comfort against the pre-dawn chill seeping through the drafty windows of her writing shed. Outside, the Northumberland coast stretched out like a rumpled velvet cloth, a muted grey under the watchful eye of a still-dark sky. Seabirds wheeled and cried, their mournful calls a familiar soundtrack to her solitary existence.

This wasn't the romantic writer's retreat one might imagine. The shed, affectionately nicknamed "The Crow's Nest" by Amelia (though she'd never seen a crow land on it), was a converted potting shed, hastily insulated and furnished with a battered desk salvaged from her grandmother's attic and a chair that protested every movement with a mournful groan. The walls were lined with towering stacks of books, a chaotic library that threatened to topple at any given moment.

Amelia, a thirty-two-year-old novelist struggling to escape the shadow of her one successful debut, was staring blankly at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen. Six months. Six months she'd been wrestling with the opening chapter of her second book, a sprawling historical epic set during the Jacobite uprisings. And all she had to show for it was a rapidly growing collection of crumpled coffee-stained pages and a burgeoning sense of despair.
