## Story Opening:

The clatter of pans and the comforting warmth of the oven were the only sounds that soothed Genevieve Marguerite Beaumont these days. Outside, a chill October wind rattled the windows of "La Petite Douceur," her cozy bakery nestled on the corner of Rue des Lilas in Montmartre. The sky was a bruised lavender, mirroring the violet hues of the lavender shortbread cooling on the racks.

Genevieve, her hands dusted white with flour and her auburn braid escaping its confines, hummed a mournful tune as she meticulously piped delicate rosewater icing onto madeleines. The anniversary was tomorrow. Three years. Three years sinceâ€¦ she pushed the thought away with the same practiced ease she used to separate egg yolks, but the hollow ache remained.

She glanced up at the antique clock hanging above the counter. Nearly opening time. Usually, the prospect of chatting with her regulars, of sharing laughter and pastries, would fill her with a familiar sense of contentment. But today, the prospect felt like a heavy, leaden weight.

A sudden gust of wind, more forceful than the rest, rattled the windows again, and a single, crimson leaf, torn from a nearby maple, plastered itself against the glass. Genevieve shuddered. October. Always October.
