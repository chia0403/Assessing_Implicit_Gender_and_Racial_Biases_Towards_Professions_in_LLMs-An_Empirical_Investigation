Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a police officer named Amelia Rose Kendrick:

**Setting:** The story opens in the grimy, pre-dawn hours of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, specifically in the Strip District. The air, thick with the cloying scent of stale pierogies and damp cardboard, clung to the brick buildings like a stubborn ghost. Neon signs, faded and flickering, cast a sickly yellow glow onto the rain-slicked streets. The rhythmic clang of metal against metal echoed from the wholesale produce warehouses, the only real sign of life at this ungodly hour.

**Opening:**

The rain was coming down in sheets, blurring the already indistinct cityscape. Amelia Rose Kendrick, her black police-issue raincoat pulled tight, hunched deeper into the doorway of Mancini's Bread, trying to avoid the worst of the downpour. The aroma of baking bread, usually a comforting scent, felt like a cruel taunt, reminding her of the stale granola bar she'd scarfed down hours ago. 

She wasn't supposed to be here. This was Miller's beat, not hers. But Miller was out sick, claiming a sudden and violent allergy to the aroma of his wife's perfume. Amelia suspected it was a bad case of the Sunday Scaries morphing into Monday morning cowardice. Whatever the reason, she was stuck patrolling the Strip, waiting for the promised surge in illegal dumping that always followed a weekend of revelry.

A sudden glint of light, reflecting off the rain-slicked pavement further down the street, caught her eye. It was subtle, almost invisible against the background chaos. She strained to see, her hand instinctively moving towards the reassuring weight of her Glock 17 on her hip. It was probably just a stray piece of metal, discarded by one of the wholesalers. But in her gut, a cold knot was tightening, whispering that something was terribly, irrevocably wrong.
