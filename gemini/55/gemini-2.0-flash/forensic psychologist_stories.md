## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive humidity of a late August evening clung to New Orleans like a shroud. The Vieux Carr√©, usually teeming with tourists and jazz music spilling from open doorways, felt muted, almost mournful. Gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows on the wrought-iron balconies overlooking cobblestone streets slick with a recent downpour. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of jasmine and decay, a peculiar perfume unique to this city of secrets.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Grace Dubois swore softly under her breath, the sound lost in the distant rumble of a streetcar. Sweat beaded on her forehead, plastering strands of her dark hair to her skin. The stain seeping through her crisp linen blouse was growing larger, a grim reminder of the grim scene she'd just left behind. The humidity was the least of her worries. The photograph she clutched in her hand, a Polaroid that captured the vacant stare of a doll perched precariously on the chest of a brutally murdered woman, burned into her memory. She shuddered, the image a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant, chaotic energy that normally pulsed through this historic square. This was no ordinary homicide. This was something colder, more calculated, and Evelyn knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that she was staring into the face of something truly evil.
