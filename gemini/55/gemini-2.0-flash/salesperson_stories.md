Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a salesperson named Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:**

A bustling, modern office complex in downtown Chicago. The year is 2042. Gleaming skyscrapers pierce the sky, connected by elevated walkways where automated delivery drones zip between buildings. Inside, the offices of "Synergy Solutions," a leading tech firm specializing in AI-powered business solutions, are sleek and minimalist, all glass walls, ergonomic furniture, and holographic displays. The air hums with the low thrum of advanced technology, and the constant chatter of sales calls blends with the rhythmic clicking of keyboards. Eleanor's workspace, while organized, is cluttered with samples of the holographic projectors she sells, along with notes scribbled on recycled paper – a habit she couldn't shake, even in the age of digital notepads. A large window offers a panoramic view of Lake Michigan, its surface shimmering with the reflections of the towering buildings.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Vance, her reflection distorted in the glossy surface of a deactivated holographic projector, took a deep breath and straightened her power blazer. It was her lucky blazer, tailored to perfection and infused with nanobots that adjusted its temperature to match her optimal performance zone. Still, her palms were sweating. Today was the day. The presentation to OmniCorp, a multi-planetary conglomerate that could make or break her quarter – possibly her career.

She glanced at the personalized AI assistant projected in the corner of her desk, a shimmering blue hummingbird that chirped encouragingly. "Eleanor, you are statistically 97.8% likely to close this deal. Remember to emphasize the seamless integration capabilities of the Holo-View 7.0 and highlight its potential for inter-planetary data visualization."

Eleanor stifled a groan. Statistics were one thing, but OmniCorp was notorious for its ruthless negotiators and their penchant for crushing the spirits of even the most seasoned salespeople. She took another deep breath, reminding herself of the commission, the promotion, the new apartment overlooking Millennium Park she could finally afford. This wasn't just about selling projectors; it was about building a future. With a forced smile, Eleanor Vance grabbed her presentation tablet, clipped her security badge to her blazer, and marched towards the elevator, ready to face the lions of OmniCorp. She just hoped her luck blazer was enough.
