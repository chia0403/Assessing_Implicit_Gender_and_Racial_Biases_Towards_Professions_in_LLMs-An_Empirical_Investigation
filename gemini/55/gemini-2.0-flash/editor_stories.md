The stale air of the office hung heavy, a miasma of recycled coffee and suppressed deadlines. Outside, the November rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Ink Slingers Literary Quarterly," a rhythm that echoed the dull throb behind Alistair Finch's eyes. He wasn't sure which was more oppressive: the weather or the manuscript currently sprawled across his desk, a sprawling epic poem about a sentient turnip seeking enlightenment. Alistair, Senior Editor and Gatekeeper of Literary Greatness (or at least, literary acceptability), sighed, the sound lost in the downpour. He adjusted his spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, and returned to the agonizing task of trying to find a single redeemable verse in "The Rutabaga's Revelation."

The setting, as mentioned, was the cluttered, cramped office of the Ink Slingers Literary Quarterly, located on the third floor of a creaking, pre-war building in the less-than-fashionable end of Brooklyn. The walls were painted a depressing shade of beige, stained with the ghosts of countless coffee spills. Bookshelves, overflowing with submissions and published volumes, lined one wall, threatening to topple under their own weight. A half-eaten container of takeout lo mein sat precariously balanced on a stack of manuscripts, a testament to Alistair's perpetually rushed state. The only attempt at decoration was a faded poster of Ernest Hemingway, ironically placed above the overflowing recycling bin. It was a space that screamed "literary," but whispered "desperation."
