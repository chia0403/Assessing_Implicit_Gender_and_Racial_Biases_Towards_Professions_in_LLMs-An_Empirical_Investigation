The smell of lavender and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar miasma that clung to Amelia Beatrice Harding like a second skin. Dawn was just barely beginning to crack through the grime-caked windows of her Brooklyn studio apartment, painting the exposed brick wall a bruised purple. Amelia, however, hadn't slept. Again. Empty Red Bull cans littered her desk, casualties of a self-inflicted deadline.

She slumped further in her ergonomically-approved, yet still unforgiving, chair, her gaze fixed on the glowing screen. A mosaic of vibrant colours swam before her, the design for a new summer campaign for "Sunshine Smoothie Co." â€“ a campaign that, according to the relentlessly cheerful client, had to scream "PARADISE!" and "REJUVENATION!" at the same time. Amelia, fueled by caffeine and mounting desperation, could barely scream "SANITY!"

The studio itself was a testament to her chaotic creativity. Bookshelves overflowing with design annuals and graphic novels lined one wall. A floor-to-ceiling whiteboard covered in sketches, mood boards, and frantic notes dominated another. The remaining space was a minefield of art supplies: tubes of paint, stacks of paper, half-finished projects, and the occasional rogue sock. In short, it was a creative sanctuary, albeit one desperately in need of a Marie Kondo intervention. From this haven, Amelia Beatrice Harding wrestled with fonts, fought with color palettes, and ultimately, brought visions to life.
