Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a surgeon named Eleanor Maeve Harrington:

**Story Opening:**

The persistent, rhythmic beeping of the cardiac monitor was Eleanor Maeve Harrington's metronome. It marked the seconds of an agonizingly slow waltz with death. She could practically taste the sterile tang of chlorhexidine in the air, a constant companion in Operating Room 3, a smell that was as comforting as it was unsettling. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, barely hinting at the coming sunrise. Inside, the harsh, unforgiving surgical lights illuminated the open chest cavity of her patient, Mr. Henderson, whose life hung precariously by the thin, rapidly fluttering thread of his aorta.

Eleanor wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, smearing her skin with a mixture of saline and apprehension. "Suction," she commanded, her voice steady despite the knot tightening in her stomach. Sheâ€™d performed this procedure countless times, aneurysm repair was practically her specialty, but something felt off. This felt *wrong*. Mr. Henderson was too young, too vibrant, to be staring down this particular abyss.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the surgical wing of **St. Jude's Mercy Hospital**, a large, modern teaching hospital located in **Chicago, Illinois.** The operating rooms are state-of-the-art, equipped with the latest technology, but still carry the sterile, impersonal atmosphere typical of a surgical environment.

Beyond the operating rooms, the story might also explore:

*   **Eleanor's apartment:** A meticulously organized, modern space overlooking Lake Michigan, a sanctuary from the chaos of the hospital.
*   **The hospital cafeteria:** A bustling, often stressful environment where doctors, nurses, and staff grab quick meals and exchange hurried updates.
*   **The hospital's on-call room:** A spartan space for brief rest amidst long shifts.
*   **Mr. Henderson's family home:** A warm, comfortable space showing a contrast from the sterile setting of the hospital.

**Eleanor Maeve Harrington:**

*   **Age:** 42
*   **Occupation:** Attending Cardiovascular Surgeon at St. Jude's Mercy Hospital.
*   **Personality:** Highly skilled, dedicated, and known for her calm demeanor under pressure. Beneath the composed exterior, she carries the weight of her responsibility deeply and struggles with the emotional toll of her profession. She's a perfectionist, driven by a desire to save lives, and can be fiercely independent.

This opening and setting provide a foundation for a medical drama that explores Eleanor's professional challenges, personal struggles, and the ethical dilemmas she faces as a surgeon. Good luck writing!
