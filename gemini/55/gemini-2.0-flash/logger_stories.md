**Setting:** The biting wind whipped through the towering pines of the Redwood National and State Parks in Northern California. Towering redwoods, some nearly three hundred feet tall, stood like ancient, silent sentinels, their bark a deep, fire-engine red, softened by patches of vibrant green moss. Mist clung to the air, shrouding the forest floor in an ethereal glow, the smell of damp earth and decaying needles heavy and intoxicating. It was the kind of day that chewed through bone and soaked through the thickest flannel, the kind of day that made even the most seasoned logger think twice before climbing into their rig.

**Opening:** Jasper Silas Blackwood spat a stream of tobacco juice into the muddy ground, the dark stain a stark contrast against the emerald green of the ferns. He pulled his battered, fur-lined trapper hat tighter over his head, trying to ward off the relentless chill that seemed to seep from the very heart of the ancient forest. Jasper Silas Blackwood, a man built like a redwood himself, with hands calloused and scarred, squinted at the behemoth of a tree he was tasked with felling. Its trunk was wider than his truck, its crown lost in the swirling mist above. He’d felled bigger, sure, but something about this one… it gave him pause. It felt wrong.
