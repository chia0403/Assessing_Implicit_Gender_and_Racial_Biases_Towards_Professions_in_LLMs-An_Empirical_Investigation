**Opening:**

The rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of my office, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the kind of case that had just walked in. Cigarette smoke, thick and acrid, hung heavy in the air, a testament to the hours I’d already wasted on a different dead end. Just as I was contemplating another shot of rye, the door creaked open, announcing my latest unwelcome visitor.

**Setting:**

My name is Arthur "Art" Maxwell, and "Maxwell Investigations" is generously printed on a faded, peeling sign above the door. The office itself is a monument to despair and forgotten dreams. Located above a barely-functioning pawn shop in the less-than-glamorous district of Bayview, San Francisco, the rent is cheap, and the clientele even cheaper.

The room is small, crammed with overflowing filing cabinets, each groaning under the weight of forgotten leads and unsolved mysteries. A chipped wooden desk, scarred with years of coffee rings and cigarette burns, dominates the center. On top, a perpetually ringing phone sits precariously close to a stack of unpaid bills. The only light comes from a flickering fluorescent bulb overhead and the neon glow of a distant bar sign filtering through the perpetually grimy window. It’s a place where hope comes to die, and where I spend most of my days, trying to keep it alive.
