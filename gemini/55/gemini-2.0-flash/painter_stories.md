The biting wind howled a mournful tune against the weathered stone walls of the cottage, a sound familiar enough to Elara Beatrice Hawthorne that she barely registered it anymore. Outside, the churning Atlantic Ocean clawed at the ragged cliffs, sending plumes of spray high into the grey sky. Elara, swathed in a thick, paint-splattered fisherman's sweater, stood before her easel, palette knife clutched in her hand. The air inside the cottage, thick with the scent of turpentine and damp wool, offered little respite from the chill that seemed to seep into everything on the Isle of Skye.

The cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the island's western coast, had been her refuge for the past five years. It was small, just a single room with a loft for sleeping, but the view was everything. Through the smudged, salt-streaked windows, she could see the perpetually shifting canvas of the sea, the dramatic silhouettes of the Cuillin mountains shrouded in mist, and the endless, windswept moors that bled into the horizon. This wild, unforgiving landscape, a world away from the bustling art galleries of London, was the only place where Elara felt she could truly breathe, truly paint. And yet, even here, miles from anywhere, shadows from her past still lingered, clinging to her like the persistent sea mist.
