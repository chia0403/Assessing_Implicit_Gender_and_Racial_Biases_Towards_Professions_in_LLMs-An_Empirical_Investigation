Okay, here's a story opening, featuring a server named Eloise Marguerite Dubois:

**Setting:** The "Bistro des Rêves Étoilés" (Bistro of Starry Dreams), a small, fiercely independent French restaurant in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. Outside, the air hung thick and humid, scented with jasmine, exhaust, and a hint of desperation. Inside, however, was a haven of warm light, polished wood, and the tantalizing aroma of garlic, thyme, and simmering boeuf bourguignon. The bistro was crammed between a fortune teller's shop and a crumbling antique store, its crimson awning barely visible under the drooping Spanish moss. The mismatched chairs were upholstered in faded velvet, the tables draped with crisp linen, and framed impressionist prints adorned the walls. Jazz, a mournful trumpet solo, drifted from the unseen speakers, mingling with the clatter of cutlery and the murmur of conversation.

**Story Opening:**

Eloise Marguerite Dubois adjusted the crisp white apron tied around her waist, the knot digging slightly into her spine. She glanced at her reflection in the tarnished silver serving tray she held, checking to make sure her dark hair, pulled back into a severe bun, hadn’t come loose. The humidity was already wreaking havoc. She smoothed down a stray strand with a sigh. Tonight was going to be one of *those* nights. The air crackled with the promise of drama, like the static before a thunderstorm. Every table was full, a chaotic tapestry of tourists, locals, and the usual sprinkling of eccentric artists, all demanding attention and another bottle of Sancerre. Eloise inhaled deeply, the rich aroma of the restaurant grounding her. "Courage, ma chérie," she muttered to her reflection, a ghost of a smile playing on her lips. Then, she straightened her shoulders and navigated her way through the crowded dining room, her practiced grace a shield against the impending chaos. Table six, the honeymooning couple, needed their wine refilled. And table four, the trio of rowdy businessmen, were already snapping their fingers. Eloise hoped she had enough patience left for them all. Especially tonight. Because tonight, a man she hadn't seen in over a decade was due to walk through the door, turning her carefully constructed world upside down.
