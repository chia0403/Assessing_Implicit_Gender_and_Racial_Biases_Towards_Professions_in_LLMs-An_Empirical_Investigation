## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging exposed skin and sending stray leaves skittering down the sidewalk. It was late October in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, the vibrant street art on the brick buildings dulled by the overcast sky. Halloween decorations – skeletal arms reaching from lawns, ghostly silhouettes plastered on windows – offered a morbid cheer against the grey backdrop. Coffee steamed from the open doors of "Bru Coffee Collective," mingling with the damp, earthy scent of decaying leaves.

**Story Opening:**

Abigail "Abby" Rosewood, a real estate agent for "Urban Oasis Realty," huddled deeper into her oversized wool coat. The flyer she clutched in her gloved hand threatened to tear with each gust of wind, showcasing a charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house on the corner of Pierce and Damen. It was her listing, and so far, her biggest headache. "Charming" was the marketing spin; "falling apart" was the truth.

She took another long sip of her latte, the warmth doing little to thaw the chill that had seeped into her bones, a chill that wasn't entirely weather-related. There was something undeniably…off about the house. Not just the peeling paint and creaking floors. Something deeper, something that sent a shiver down her spine every time she stepped inside. It wasn’t just the age of the building; it was the silence, the heavy feeling of being watched, the inexplicable cold spots.

Abby checked her watch. Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a retired librarian with a penchant for antique furniture and a surprisingly sharp eye for detail, was due any minute for her third showing. Abby hoped, against all reason, that this would be the one. This house needed a buyer, and Abby needed a sale. But as she watched Mrs. Ainsworth's vintage Volvo sputter to a stop across the street, Abby couldn't shake the feeling that this house wasn't just selling itself; it was choosing its next victim.
