Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun, thick and hazy with summer humidity, slanted through the grime-streaked windows of Holbrook Drafting & Design, casting long, distorted shadows across the meticulously organized chaos of the room. It was a small, two-story brick building nestled between a bustling auto repair shop and a perpetually-closed bakery in the industrial outskirts of a forgettable Midwestern city. The air inside was a cloying mix of stale coffee, the faint tang of ammonia from blueprint developers, and the ever-present, low-grade buzz of fluorescent lights. Drafting tables, each a fortress of pencils, scales, erasers, and half-finished plans, were arranged in neat rows, a grid mirroring the precision sought on the drawings themselves.

**Opening:**

"Damn it all to the fiery pits of Hades!" Arthur Leopold Finch slammed his fist on the drafting table, the force rattling his meticulously arranged pencils. A fine dusting of graphite rose and settled, like tiny, defeated soldiers surrendering to the day's exhaustion. He stared, bleary-eyed, at the sprawling blueprint before him â€“ the proposed plans for a new wastewater treatment facility that was, Arthur swore, single-handedly aging him a decade. He'd been hunched over it for the last ten hours, battling a maddeningly stubborn series of pipe connections, and his usually meticulous lines had devolved into something resembling a seismograph reading. He scrubbed a hand across his face, pushing his wire-rimmed glasses further up his nose. He could practically feel the collective sigh of relief emanating from the empty desks around him. Everyone else had long since fled the suffocating embrace of Holbrook Drafting & Design. Everyone, that is, except for Arthur Leopold Finch, the last man standing in the battle against the blueprints of mediocrity.

"One more push, Arthur," he muttered to himself, his voice a low growl that barely disturbed the silence. "One more push, and then freedom. Freedom and a lukewarm can of beer."
