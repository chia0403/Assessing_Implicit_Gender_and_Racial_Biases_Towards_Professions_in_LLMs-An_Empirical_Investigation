## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The static hissed like a thousand angry cats, a familiar and comforting sound to Eleanor "Ellie" Vance. She tapped the casing of the aging Marconi transmitter with the back of a screwdriver, muttering under her breath. "Come on, Bessie, don't fail me now." The voltmeter flickered erratically, its needle dancing a jig that mirrored the nervous energy churning in her stomach. Tonight was the night. The night she finally broadcast her signal, a desperate message whispered into the ether, a beacon of hope she wasn't even sure anyone was still out there to receive.

**Setting:**

Ellie Vance's radio station wasn't much to look at. "The Haven," as she ironically called it, was a salvaged collection of scrap metal and reclaimed technology, crammed into the root cellar of what was once a farmhouse just outside the ruins of Topeka, Kansas. The root cellar was damp and musty, the air thick with the smell of earth and ozone. A single, flickering lantern cast long, dancing shadows across the rough-hewn stone walls, illuminating a chaotic workspace filled with wires, tubes, and half-disassembled radios. Maps, meticulously drawn and cross-referenced, covered one wall, marking known settlements and areas of high radiation. Outside, the world was a wasteland of dust and echoes, haunted by the ghosts of a society long gone. A silent testament to the disaster that had swallowed the world whole, leaving only scattered pockets of survivors clinging to life and flickering hope.
