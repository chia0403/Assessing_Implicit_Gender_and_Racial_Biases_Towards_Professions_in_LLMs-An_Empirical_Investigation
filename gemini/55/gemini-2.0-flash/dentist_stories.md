The relentless hum of the autoclave was a familiar, almost comforting counterpoint to the silent anxiety chewing at Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne's gut. Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of her practice window, painted pale, blurry squares on the checkered linoleum floor. It was Tuesday morning in Havenwood, a town as quaint and predictable as its name implied. Birds chirped incessantly outside, completely oblivious to the internal turmoil of the dentist bracing herself for her first patient.

Eleanor glanced at the clock above the sterilization station. 8:57 AM. Three minutes to go. Three minutes to rehearse her most convincing smile, her most empathetic tone, and her most unwavering professional demeanor. Because Mrs. Higgins was first on the schedule, and Mrs. Higgins, bless her soul, had the gums of a rabid badger and the constitution of a hummingbird. This, combined with a long-standing phobia of even the *thought* of dental work, made her Eleanor's most challenging patient.
