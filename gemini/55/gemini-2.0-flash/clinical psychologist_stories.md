## Opening:

The scent of jasmine and antiseptic warred for dominance in Dr. Evelyn Reed’s office, a battlefield as familiar to her as the back of her own hand. She sighed, adjusting the perfectly positioned throw pillow on the vintage leather couch. It was always a futile gesture, a last-ditch attempt to soothe the anxiety she could practically taste hanging in the air before her next patient arrived. The ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner felt amplified this afternoon, each second a hammer blow against her resolve. Usually, she found a sense of peace in this space, a carefully curated haven designed to foster vulnerability and trust. Today, however, the weight of the world, particularly the world swirling inside her next patient's head, felt particularly heavy.

## Setting:

Dr. Evelyn Reed’s practice occupied the second floor of a renovated Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the upscale suburb of Willow Creek. Sunlight, filtered through sheer cream curtains, cast long, inviting shadows across the room. The walls were painted a soothing shade of sage green, adorned with abstract art and framed diplomas from prestigious universities. Bookcases overflowing with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and literature lined one wall, creating a visual barrier that hinted at intellectual depth and a safe harbor for complex thoughts.

Evelyn’s desk, a large oak affair cluttered with neatly organized stacks of files and a small, framed photograph of her golden retriever, Winston, sat angled towards the couch. A soft, Persian rug covered the hardwood floor, muffling footsteps and lending an air of quiet elegance. A small table held a delicate china tea set, intended more as a symbolic gesture of hospitality than for actual use. The overall effect was one of understated luxury and serene professionalism, a space designed to encourage self-reflection and healing. But behind the carefully constructed façade, Evelyn knew, lurked the potential for raw emotion, painful truths, and the often overwhelming complexities of the human psyche.
