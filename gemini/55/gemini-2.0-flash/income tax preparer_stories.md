Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focused on an income tax preparer:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Today," a cramped office in a strip mall off Route 1 in Saugus, Massachusetts, hummed a monotonous drone. Outside, the January wind howled, rattling the flimsy aluminum siding. The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee, anxiety, and the faint tang of copier toner. Files overflowing with W-2s, 1099s, and hastily scribbled receipts threatened to spill onto the already cluttered desk. A cheap plastic sign, perpetually askew, read "We Speak IRS, So You Don't Have To!"

**Opening:**

Eliza Maeve Flanagan sighed, running a hand through her already messy auburn hair. The digital clock on her computer screen glared 4:57 PM back at her, a mocking reminder that the day was almost done, yet she was still buried beneath a mountain of tax documents belonging to Mrs. Mildred Crabtree, a woman who seemed convinced that every lottery ticket she'd ever purchased, even the ones that yielded nothing but dashed dreams, were deductible business expenses. Eliza squinted at the sea of forms, her eyes glazing over the numbers. She’d been doing this for twelve years, ever since graduating from Bentley University. Twelve years of deciphering the arcane language of the IRS, of calming panicked clients, of explaining, for the millionth time, that no, you can't deduct the cost of your cat’s therapy sessions, even if Mittens *does* suffer from separation anxiety when you're at work.

She longed for the quiet solitude of her apartment, for a cup of Earl Grey tea and a mindless binge-watching session of "Great British Bake-Off." But Mrs. Crabtree's case was a ticking time bomb. Missing deadlines meant penalties, and penalties meant angry clients, and Eliza Maeve Flanagan had enough of those already.

A sharp rap on the glass window of her tiny office made her jump.
