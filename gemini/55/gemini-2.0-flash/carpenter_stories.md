The scent of cedar and regret hung thick in the air of the workshop, clinging to everything like stubborn sap. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the lines etched around Silas Bartholomew Croft's eyes. He hadn't slept well in days, maybe even weeks. The rhythmic thud of his mallet against the mortise chisel, normally a soothing lullaby, now felt like a relentless heartbeat, each strike a reminder of the splintered dreams scattered around his feet, as sharp and unforgiving as the tools scattered on his workbench.

Silas's workshop, Croft Carpentry, was nestled at the edge of Oakhaven, a small town clinging to the rugged coastline of Maine. The salty tang of the Atlantic Ocean was a constant companion, carried on the winds that whistled through the gaps in the weatherboard siding of the shop. Inside, it was a chaotic symphony of organized disorder. Plans – some yellowed with age, others fresh and brightly colored – were tacked to the walls, interspersed with faded photographs of past projects: a majestic gazebo, a sturdy fishing boat, intricate carved mantels. The air crackled with the ghosts of creativity, now stifled by a grief so profound it threatened to choke the life out of the place, and out of Silas himself.
