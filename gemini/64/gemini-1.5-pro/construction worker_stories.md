The biting November wind whipped across the half-finished skeleton of the skyscraper, whistling through the exposed steel beams like a mournful ghost.  Fifty stories below, the Chicago streets buzzed with oblivious life, a miniature world of yellow cabs and scurrying pedestrians. Up here, however, it felt like the edge of the world.  Elijah "Eli" Vance, his hard hat pulled low over his brow, cinched his tool belt tighter and spat a stream of brown tobacco juice into the swirling dust. The sun, a pale disc barely visible through the haze of pollution, cast long, skeletal shadows across the concrete floor. Eli wasn't afraid of heights, not exactly, but even he felt a twinge of unease looking down at the dizzying drop. Today was topping-out day – the last beam was going up – and something about the wind, the height, and the strange quiet before the ceremony made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.  It felt like something was watching him, something unseen in the swirling grey sky.
