The velvet curtains of the Blue Moon Cabaret shivered, disturbed by the rattling L train that thundered past just outside.  A single spotlight, hazy with cigarette smoke, illuminated the center of the small, circular stage.  Here, amidst the scattered ashtrays and half-empty glasses on tiny round tables, stood Seraphina Jane Moreau.  Her crimson gown, a hand-me-down from her grandmother, shimmered under the dim light, its sequins catching the smoke like trapped fireflies.  Seraphina clutched a worn microphone, its cord snaking across the worn wooden floorboards like a metallic vine.  The air hung thick with the smell of cheap whiskey, stale perfume, and anticipation.  In the dimly lit corners of the room, the usual crowd – a motley collection of lonely hearts, dreamers, and down-on-their-luck gamblers – nursed their drinks, their faces etched with a weary hope, waiting for Seraphina's voice to transport them, at least for a little while, to somewhere else.  The year was 1948, and in the heart of Chicago's smoky underbelly, Seraphina was about to sing.
