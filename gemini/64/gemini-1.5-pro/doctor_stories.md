The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance’s ankles, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes against the backdrop of the dilapidated Grimshaw Manor.  Built in 1788, the manor house loomed over the small, isolated town of Hollow Creek, Virginia, a gothic monstrosity of peeling paint and boarded-up windows.  A single, flickering gas lamp illuminated the wrought iron gates, casting long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown drive. Eleanor pulled her worn leather satchel closer, the cold seeping through her thick wool coat. This was her first house call in Hollow Creek, and a shiver of unease ran down her spine, a feeling that went beyond the chill October air. The summons had been cryptic – a hastily scribbled note delivered by a wide-eyed boy who refused to meet her gaze, speaking only of a “grave illness” and the urgent need for her services.  Now, standing at the threshold of the manor, Eleanor wondered if she’d made a terrible mistake answering it.
