Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Judge Elias Thorne’s chambers, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  The opulent mahogany furnishings, usually a source of quiet satisfaction for Elias, felt oppressive tonight.

It was late, well past midnight, and the only illumination in Elias’s chambers came from a single flickering gas lamp on his desk, casting long, dancing shadows that distorted the stern portraits of former magistrates lining the walls.  He sat hunched over a thick file, the stark white pages reflecting in the deep lines etched around his weary eyes.  The case of The Butcher of Bleak Street had been haunting him for weeks, a tangled web of cryptic clues and horrifying details that refused to yield a clear path to justice.
