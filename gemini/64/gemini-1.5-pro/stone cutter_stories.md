The wind, sharp and cold as a chisel, whipped down from the Drakenspine Mountains, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks. Grey granite dust, fine as powdered sugar, swirled around him, clinging to his thick wool tunic and the sweat-dampened hair plastered to his forehead.  He squinted, the midday sun a pale disc barely visible through the perpetual overcast that shrouded the quarrying village of Cinderhollow.  Perched precariously on a wooden scaffold lashed to the sheer face of the Shadowstone Quarry, Elias surveyed his work. Below him, the village nestled in the valley floor, a cluster of slate-roofed houses clinging to the earth like lichen on a boulder, seemingly dwarfed by the towering, jagged peaks that surrounded it.  For generations, the men and women of Cinderhollow had drawn their livelihood from the mountain’s dark heart, carving out lives as hard and unforgiving as the stone itself. And Elias, at the young age of twenty-four, was already considered one of the most skilled amongst them. Today, he was working on a commission unlike any he’d undertaken before - a winged griffin, destined to adorn the mausoleum of Lord Aerion, the recently deceased ruler of the neighboring province.
