The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, architect extraordinaire, plastering his meticulously tailored charcoal coat against his lean frame.  He stood on the precipice of the half-finished Grimshaw Building, a twenty-story glass and steel behemoth rising from the heart of Manchester's newly revitalized docklands. Below him, the city sprawled, a tapestry of Victorian brick and modern glass, punctuated by the skeletal cranes of ongoing construction projects. The air, thick with the scent of concrete dust and the tang of the nearby Irwell River, buzzed with the relentless energy of urban renewal.  A sliver of setting sun, bleeding crimson through the smoky grey clouds, cast long, dramatic shadows across the construction site, illuminating the steel girders like the bones of some colossal, metallic beast. Elias, oblivious to the chill and captivated by the view, traced the lines of the cityscape with his gloved finger, already envisioning the Grimshaw Buildingâ€™s sleek silhouette piercing the Manchester skyline.  His latest masterpiece, a testament to both form and function, was almost ready to breathe.
