The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the "Open" sign hanging precariously from the frosted glass door of Lakeshore Physical Therapy. Inside, Eleanor Vance, PT, DPT, rubbed her hands together, trying to coax some warmth back into her fingers. The small clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed Polish bakery, was quiet on this Tuesday morning.  The only sounds were the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner and the faint hum of the ultrasound machine warming up in the treatment room. Snow swirled outside, creating an ethereal white curtain that obscured the usually vibrant view of the Chicago skyline.  Eleanor glanced at the schedule pinned to the corkboard – just two patients today, both regulars.  She hoped the weather wouldn't deter them. The clinic’s finances were precarious, and every appointment counted.  A shiver ran down her spine, and it wasn't entirely from the cold.  Something felt different this morning, a subtle shift in the atmosphere, an almost imperceptible tension hanging in the air.
