The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, tearing at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's trench coat and stinging her cheeks.  The sodium-vapor lamps cast a sickly yellow glow across the deserted Navy Pier, painting the Ferris wheel and carousel horses in an unsettling, almost ghostly light. It was 3:17 am, a time when even the city that never sleeps seemed to hold its breath. Izzy exhaled, a plume of condensation disappearing into the frigid air, and pulled her collar tighter. The call had come in just minutes ago: a body found near the carousel, no further details.  The only sounds were the mournful creak of the Ferris wheel and the distant lapping of waves against the pier's pilings. Izzyâ€™s breath caught in her throat.  Something about this stillness, this unsettling quiet, told her this wasn't going to be a routine call.
