The rain hammered against the arched windows of the Hotel Magnifique, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the Parisian night.  Neon signs reflected in the slick cobblestones of the Rue de la Paix, painting distorted streaks of colour across the lobby's polished marble floor.

Behind the gleaming mahogany of the concierge desk, Genevieve, with her impeccably coiffed auburn hair and a smile that could disarm a diplomat, surveyed her kingdom.  Tonight, like every night, the Hotel Magnifique pulsed with a secret life, a tapestry of whispered desires and untold stories, and Genevieve, the keeper of its keys, both literal and metaphorical, held it all in her capable hands.
