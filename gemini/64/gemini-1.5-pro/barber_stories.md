The year was 1957, and the air, even indoors, hummed with a nervous energy â€“ the Cold War chill seeping into even the most mundane corners of life.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked window, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air above a checkered linoleum floor.  The shop smelled of bay rum, talcum powder, and the faint, sweet aroma of Mrs. Rosenblatt's cinnamon rolls drifting in from next door.
