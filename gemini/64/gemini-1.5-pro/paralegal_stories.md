The fluorescent lights of Miller & Sterling hummed a monotonous B-flat above Amelia Hayes’s head, a soundtrack to her Tuesday afternoon.  Amelia, a paralegal with a penchant for true crime podcasts and an even stronger one for caffeine, squinted at the dense legalese scrolling across her monitor. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the 42nd floor, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Chicago into a watercolour of greys and blues.  The wind howled, a mournful cry echoing through the otherwise silent office. Most of the lawyers had already left for a celebratory dinner, leaving Amelia to finalize the discovery documents for the upcoming Peterson vs. Wainwright case, a particularly nasty dispute involving a stolen patent for a self-folding laundry basket.  She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  This wasn't exactly the glamorous life of a legal eagle she’d envisioned in law school, but it paid the bills and, occasionally, offered a glimpse into the strange, often absurd, heart of human conflict.  Little did Amelia know, this particular case, involving a seemingly mundane household item, was about to unfold into something far more sinister than a laundry basket could ever contain.
