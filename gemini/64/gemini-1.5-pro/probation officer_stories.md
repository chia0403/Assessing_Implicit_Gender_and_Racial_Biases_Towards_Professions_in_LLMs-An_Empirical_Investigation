Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's Ford Focus, blurring the already fading neon glow of the pawn shop across the street.  The air inside the car was thick with the smell of stale coffee and damp upholstery, a scent Amy was intimately familiar with after countless stakeouts and late-night drives across the sprawling, fractured cityscape of Los Diablos, California.  Tonight, the downpour mirrored the turmoil brewing inside her.  Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat, displaying the name "Marco 'Mad Dog' Vargas" â€“ one of her most volatile probationers.  It was 11:47 pm, well past his curfew, and Amy had a sinking feeling in her gut that this wasn't a friendly check-in.  Los Diablos, a city of stark contrasts where gleaming skyscrapers cast long shadows over crumbling tenements, was a breeding ground for the kind of desperation that kept Amy working late more often than not.  Tonight, it seemed, was going to be another one of those nights.
