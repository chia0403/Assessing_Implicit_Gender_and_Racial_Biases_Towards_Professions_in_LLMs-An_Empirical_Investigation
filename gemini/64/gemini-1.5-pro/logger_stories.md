The biting pre-dawn air, sharp and clean as a freshly-stropped axe, nipped at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots as he crossed the clearing towards the warm glow spilling from the cookhouse window.  The scent of woodsmoke and frying bacon wrestled with the evergreen tang of the surrounding Douglas firs, a familiar battle fought every morning in the logging camp nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains of Washington State.  The year was 1928, and winter had settled over the Blackwood Logging Company's territory like a thick woolen blanket, silencing all but the whisper of wind through the towering pines and the occasional creak of the frozen earth.  This was Jed's world, a world of towering trees, biting cold, and the rhythmic clang of steel on wood â€“ a world he both loved and feared in equal measure.
