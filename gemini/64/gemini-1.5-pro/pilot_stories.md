The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Milly" Reyes's parka as she pre-flighted her Cessna 206.  The pre-dawn sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant orange, reflected in the icy sheen of the wings.  Denali, a hulking shadow in the distance, watched impassively over the frozen landscape of Lake Minchumina.  This remote outpost, a scattering of log cabins and a gravel airstrip nestled between the Kuskokwim Mountains and the vast wilderness of Denali National Park, was Milly's temporary home, her office, her prison, depending on the day.  Today, it felt a little bit of all three.  She traced the outline of a small, worn photograph tucked inside her glove – a laughing child with Milly's own dark eyes – and sighed, the puff of her breath crystallizing in the frigid air.  This delivery, a vital shipment of medical supplies to a remote village further north, had to be flawless.  Not just for the people who needed the medicine, but for the little girl in the photo.
