The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, PA-C, as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Gargoyles perched atop the aging brick building, their stony faces seemingly grimacing at the onslaught of icy rain.  Built in 1888, the hospital clung to a sliver of the Hudson River shoreline just north of Tarrytown, New York. Its Gothic architecture, while imposing and historically significant, did little to stave off the damp chill that permeated even the recently renovated emergency room where Elias worked. Inside, fluorescent lights hummed, a stark contrast to the gloomy twilight gathering outside. The ER buzzed with the usual controlled chaos: the rhythmic beeping of monitors, the hurried whispers of nurses, and the occasional pained groan echoing from behind a curtained cubicle. Elias, his breath fogging in the cool air, braced himself for another long shift, the kind that blurred the lines between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, the kind that tested the limits of both his medical knowledge and his emotional resilience.
