The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, whistling through the rusted guy-wires of the KWKH-AM radio tower.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her breath clouding the frosty air, tightened the last bolt on the transmitter housing. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the scrubland, painting the distant mountains in hues of bruised purple and blood orange. Amy’s red work-light, dangling precariously from a hook on the tower’s scaffolding, illuminated the small, prefab shed that served as the station's headquarters.  KWKH, broadcasting out of Harmony Springs, population 384 (not counting the coyotes), was the only voice for hundreds of miles, its signal a lifeline in this vast, empty expanse.  Tonight, however, that lifeline was stubbornly silent, and Amy, perched precariously eighty feet in the air, was determined to change that.
