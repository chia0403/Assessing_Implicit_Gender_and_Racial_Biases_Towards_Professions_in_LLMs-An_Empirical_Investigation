The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the persistent ache in his own chest.  His practice, nestled above a bustling bakery on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, usually offered a comforting view of the vibrant street life below. Today, however, the downpour blurred the neon signs and bustling crowds into a hazy, melancholic tableau.  Elias, a man whose neatly trimmed brown beard and warm, brown eyes usually radiated empathy, felt the damp chill seep into his own bones.  He glanced at the ornate, antique clock on his mahogany desk â€“ 7:52 PM.  Two minutes until his final appointment of the day, and already he felt the weight of unspoken words hanging heavy in the air.
