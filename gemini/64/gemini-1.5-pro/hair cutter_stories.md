The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the large front window, and the rhythmic thump of the rain against the glass created a strangely comforting soundtrack to the otherwise quiet evening.  Amelia ran a hand through her own choppy pixie cut, a vibrant shade of amethyst, and plastered a welcoming smile on her face.
