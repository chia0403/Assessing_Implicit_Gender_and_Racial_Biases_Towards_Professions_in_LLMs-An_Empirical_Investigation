The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the vast expanse of the Chisholm Ranch, tugging at the brim of Caleb Jedediah Chisholm’s weathered Stetson.  The sky, a bruised purple edged with the faintest blush of sunset, mirrored the jagged peaks of the Absaroka Mountains looming to the west.  Caleb, his calloused hands tucked deep into the pockets of his worn sheepskin coat, surveyed his land.  Thousands of acres of rolling Montana prairie stretched before him, dotted with the dark, moving shapes of his Hereford cattle.  It was a hard life, ranching in this unforgiving country, but it was Caleb’s life, and he wouldn’t trade it for all the gold in Fort Knox.  This evening, however, a sense of unease prickled beneath his skin, a feeling deeper than the usual worry about blizzards or wolves.  Something felt…different.  The silence, usually punctuated by the lowing of cattle and the mournful cry of the wind, seemed thicker, heavier, pregnant with a secret the land itself was reluctant to reveal.
