The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys echoed through the otherwise silent office, punctuated only by the occasional *ding* of the trolley as it trundled past on Sycamore Street below. Rain streaked the windowpanes of the fifth-floor office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in 1947 Chicago.  Eleanor Grace Holloway, her fingers flying across the keys, barely registered the chill that crept through the gaps in the aging window frame. Her focus was entirely on the letter she was typing â€“ a strongly worded missive from Mr. Henderson, the notoriously prickly owner of Henderson & Sons Importers, to a supplier who had the audacity to deliver a shipment of Brazilian coffee beans a week late.  The office, a cramped space dominated by a heavy oak desk and two filing cabinets overflowing with invoices and correspondence, belonged entirely to Mr. Henderson, though Eleanor often felt more like its resident than he did.  He was a whirlwind of activity and travel, leaving Eleanor to hold the fort and maintain the illusion of order amidst the perpetual chaos of his import-export business.  A faint scent of cinnamon and cloves lingered in the air, a constant reminder of the exotic goods that passed through these very rooms, though Eleanor rarely saw them herself.
