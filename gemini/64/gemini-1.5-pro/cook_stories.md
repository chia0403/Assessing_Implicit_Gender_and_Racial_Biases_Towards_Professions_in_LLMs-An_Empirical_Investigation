The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar morning symphony to Elias Thorne.  His cramped kitchen, tucked away at the back of The Salty Spoon diner, smelled of frying bacon and brewing coffee – a scent that usually brought him comfort.  This morning, however, the aroma was tinged with the metallic tang of anxiety.  The Salty Spoon, a faded turquoise beacon on the desolate stretch of Highway 17 just outside Dust Devil, Nevada, was Elias's life. He'd inherited it from his grandmother, along with her collection of chipped porcelain salt shakers and a cast-iron skillet seasoned over decades of use. Dust Devil itself wasn't much – a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kind of town, populated by weathered ranchers, truckers stopping for a hot meal, and the occasional lost soul searching for something they couldn't name.  But to Elias, it was home, and The Salty Spoon was its beating heart, a heart he feared was about to stop beating.  A foreclosure notice, crisp and white as a bone, was pinned to the corkboard above his prep station, its message stark against the faded photographs of his grandmother and her legendary apple pie.
