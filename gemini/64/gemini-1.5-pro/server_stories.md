The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow over Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez as she balanced a tray laden with coffee refills, a slice of pecan pie wobbling precariously on the edge.  Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the view of the deserted highway stretching out beyond the diner’s parking lot. It was 2:17 AM, the graveyard shift, and the Starlight, usually bustling with truckers and late-night wanderers, was eerily quiet.  Only two other souls occupied the worn red vinyl booths: a grizzled old man nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee, his gaze fixed on some unseen point in the distance, and a young woman hunched over a notebook, the dim light illuminating strands of her vibrant pink hair. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying onions, and a faint undercurrent of something… unsettling. Amy couldn't quite place it, but it prickled the hairs on the back of her neck, a feeling she'd learned to trust after five years of working the late shift.  Tonight, something felt different.  The silence was too heavy, the emptiness too vast.  It was the kind of night that brewed secrets in the shadows.
