The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes’s Tuesday afternoon. Rain lashed against the single window of the tiny convenience store, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating endlessly on the metal rollers. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, chewed on the end of a pen, her gaze fixed on the digital clock above the lottery tickets. 5:47 PM.  Seventeen more minutes until Elias, the evening shift cashier, would show up and release her from the beige and linoleum purgatory of the Quick Stop, a place she affectionately, and sometimes not so affectionately, referred to as “the beige box.” Situated on a lonely stretch of Highway 12, just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the Quick Stop was rarely bustling, but today, even by its usual standards, it was eerily quiet.
