The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn canvas hat and sending fallen oak leaves swirling around his sturdy work boots.  He squinted at the sprawling Greystone Manor, a Victorian behemoth perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  The salt spray kissed his weathered face, a familiar sensation after twenty years spent landscaping the gardens and grounds of this grand, if somewhat melancholic, estate.  The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and damp earth, punctuated by the distant, mournful cry of a foghorn.  Elias shifted his weight, the handles of his well-worn pruning shears digging into his thick gloves.  This was his final job at Greystone. Mrs. Ainsworth, the manor's enigmatic owner, had finally decided to sell, leaving Elias with a profound sense of unease he couldn't quite explain.  He’d always sensed something… different… about this place, something beyond the usual creaks and groans of an old house. And now, with his departure imminent, that feeling intensified, prickling at the back of his neck like a cold draft.
