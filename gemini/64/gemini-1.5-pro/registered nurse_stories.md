The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from the windows of the ER, casting an eerie, sickly yellow glow onto the freshly fallen snow.  Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was not known for picturesque winters, and tonight was no exception.

She tugged her scarf higher, the wool scratching against her chin, and pushed through the heavy revolving doors, the warmth of the hospital lobby a welcome reprieve.  The quiet hum of the ventilation system and the faint smell of antiseptic were familiar comforts after the raw, chaotic energy of the outside world. Tonight, however, even the familiar felt tinged with an unsettling premonition.  The ER waiting room, usually bustling with activity at this hour, was eerily empty.
