Eliza, an occupational therapist with a decade of experience under her belt, had encountered her fair share of challenging patients, but Blackwood Manor and its rumored resident, the reclusive artist Lucian Thorne, presented a unique and unsettling prospect.  She clutched the referral slip in her gloved hand, the crisp paper a stark contrast to the creeping damp that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the estate. This wasn't just a case of helping someone regain lost motor skills; this felt like stepping into a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, and Eliza wasn't entirely sure she was ready for the story to begin.
