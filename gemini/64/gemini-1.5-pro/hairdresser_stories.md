The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia “Amy” Rousseau like a second skin.  Her salon, "Curl Up and Dye," nestled between Mrs. Higgins’ perpetually dusty antique shop and Mr. Kim’s bustling laundromat on Sycamore Street, was a vibrant splash of teal and sunshine yellow in the otherwise muted palette of downtown Havenwood, Oregon. Rain hammered against the large front window, blurring the view of the grey, choppy Pacific just a few blocks away. Inside, the rhythmic snip-snip of Amy's shears orchestrated a symphony against the backdrop of eighties power ballads and the gentle whir of the hooded hair dryers.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically slow, but today, a strange tension crackled in the air, thicker than hairspray.
