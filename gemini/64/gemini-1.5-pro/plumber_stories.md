The biting November wind howled down Sycamore Street, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied spirals around Elias Finch’s ankles. Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the worn leather strap of his toolbox. The brass nameplate, proclaiming “Finch’s Plumbing - No Drip Too Small”, gleamed dully in the fading afternoon light.  He stood before Number 13 Sycamore Street, a looming Victorian mansion shrouded in shadows, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  A single, flickering gas lamp illuminated a stained-glass window depicting a rather menacing-looking raven.  Mrs. Albright’s call had been cryptic -  a "gurgling unlike any she'd ever heard," emanating from somewhere deep within the house's bowels. Elias, a man who'd faced down burst pipes and overflowing septic tanks without flinching, felt a prickle of unease.  This house had a reputation. A reputation for strange noises, vanishing pets, and a perpetual air of melancholy.  He took a deep breath, the scent of decaying leaves and something faintly metallic tingling his nostrils.  "Just a plumbing job, Finch," he muttered to himself, and hefted his toolbox, the weight strangely comforting in the gathering gloom.
