Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of St. Jude's Parish Hall, the sound a frantic percussion against the backdrop of Amelia Thorne’s mounting frustration.  The air, thick with the scent of damp wool and forgotten hymnals, crackled with the nervous energy of a dozen amateur actors.  Amelia, her full name Amelia Constance Thorne, renowned for her avant-garde interpretations of classic plays in London's West End, found herself inexplicably directing a nativity play in the quaint, and decidedly un-avant-garde, village of Little Puddleton.  She’d envisioned a rustic retreat, a chance to escape the pressures of the city after a particularly brutal production of Macbeth.  Instead, she was facing a cast who seemed more interested in gossiping about the vicar's new hat than embodying the spirit of the holy family.  A plastic baby Jesus lay forlornly in a wicker basket, its painted eyes staring blankly at the flickering fluorescent lights overhead.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful sound that echoed Amelia’s own internal lament. This was not how she’d pictured her sabbatical.
