The stale, recycled air of the 747 hummed around Amelia "Amy" Reyes as she secured the cabin door for take-off.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Hong Kongâ€™s Kai Tak Airport was a bruised purple, the jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains just visible through the clinging mist.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already chaotic dance of ground crew and flashing lights. Amy smoothed down her navy blue uniform, the golden wing pin glinting on her lapel.  This was her fifth red-eye in a week, and the exhaustion was starting to sink in, a dull ache behind her eyes.  But the familiar rumble of the engines vibrating beneath her feet, the anticipation of another journey unfolding, always managed to inject a jolt of adrenaline.  This flight, bound for Johannesburg, promised to be particularly interesting.  The passenger manifest included a renowned wildlife photographer, a retired diplomat, and, rumour had it, a minor European royal travelling incognito.  Amy tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear and smiled, a professional, welcoming smile that hid the gnawing feeling that something, somehow, was about to go very wrong.
