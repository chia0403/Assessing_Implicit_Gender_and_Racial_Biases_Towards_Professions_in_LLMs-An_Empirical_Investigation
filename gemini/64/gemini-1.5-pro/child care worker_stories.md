The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the erratic buzz of a faulty ballast. Rain lashed against the large window overlooking the playground, turning the brightly coloured plastic slides and climbing frames into blurry, impressionistic shapes. Inside, the air thrummed with the chaotic energy of twenty-five pre-schoolers, their shrieks and giggles a constant soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's day.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, knelt amongst a group of four-year-olds, patiently guiding them through a particularly messy finger-painting session.  The aroma of cheap tempera paint mingled with the faint, lingering scent of naptime disinfectant and the ever-present, slightly sour odour of spilled apple juice. Outside, the grey November sky pressed down on the small brick building, mirroring the exhaustion beginning to creep into Amelia's bones. This was her fourth year at Little Wonders, and while she genuinely loved the children, some days, like this one, felt like an endless, sticky, brightly coloured battle against the forces of entropy.
