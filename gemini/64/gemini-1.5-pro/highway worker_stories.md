The sun beat down on Elias Vance's neck, baking the asphalt beneath his steel-toed boots until it shimmered like water. Heat radiated up, blurring the already wavering horizon of the Nevada desert. Elias, sweat stinging his eyes, squinted at the flashing arrow board directing traffic around their work zone on Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America."  It wasn't lonely today. A steady stream of RVs and dusty pickups crawled past, their drivers casting curious glances at the orange cones and the crew patching a particularly nasty pothole. Elias wiped his brow with the back of his glove, the gritty dust clinging to the dampness. He could smell the hot tar, the diesel fumes from the idling roller, and the faint, metallic tang of desert rain from the storm that had passed through the previous night.  The air crackled with the static of approaching thunder, promising another downpour, and Elias hoped they could finish this section before the heavens opened again.  He adjusted the brim of his hard hat, the faded orange plastic hot against his forehead, and signaled to his partner, ready to get back to work.
