Five weeks into the season, her team hadn't managed a single win, and tonight's crushing defeat against their cross-town rivals, the Hawks, hung heavy in the air like the lingering smell of stale popcorn. The empty field, normally a source of invigorating energy for Amy, tonight felt like a testament to her failures.  Each gust of wind seemed to whisper taunts of "loser," "give up," and "you're not good enough."  Amy shoved her hands deeper into her pockets, the crumpled game statistics digging into her palms, a physical reminder of the uphill battle she faced.
