The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's lab coat around him as he surveyed the desolate landscape. Jagged peaks clawed at the bruised, pre-dawn sky, their snow-capped summits gleaming faintly under the hesitant light.  He stood on a precariously perched platform constructed of reinforced steel and Plexiglas, bolted to the side of Mount Thor, Baffin Island, Nunavut.  Below him, a sheer drop of 1,250 meters plunged into the frozen valley, the Asgard Mountains looming like silent giants in the distance.  Elias adjusted the thermal imaging goggles perched on his nose, the faint whirring of the device the only sound besides the wind's relentless howl. His breath plumed out in ghostly white clouds, freezing almost instantly in the -30Â° Celsius air.  Inside his thickly insulated gloves, his fingers itched with a nervous energy that had nothing to do with the cold.  Today, after seven years of obsessive research and perilous expeditions, Elias was finally ready to activate Project Chimera.
