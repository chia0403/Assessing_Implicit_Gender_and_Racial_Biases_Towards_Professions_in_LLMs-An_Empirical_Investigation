The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air as they ushered Elias Finch onto the bustling sidewalk.  Rain slicked the asphalt of Peachtree Street, reflecting the neon glow of Atlanta's awakening nightlife.  1957 hung heavy in the air, a blend of cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes, and the sweet perfume of magnolia blossoms clinging to the humid Georgia air. Elias, in his crisp, burgundy uniform complete with a pillbox hat perched jauntily on his head, adjusted the leather strap of his luggage cart. It was Friday night, and the Grand Majestic, with its opulent marble lobby and hushed elegance, was buzzing with a weekend influx of guests.  For Elias, this meant tips, and tips meant survival â€“ or at least, a little extra jingle in his pocket for a late-night plate of barbecue ribs at Big Moe's down the street.
