The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic and sending a shiver down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold.  The clinic, perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey sea in the remote fishing village of Port Blossom, Newfoundland, was usually a haven of warm fur and the comforting scent of hay.  But tonight, the air hung heavy with an unnatural stillness, broken only by the rhythmic clang of the buoy bell a mile offshore, a sound Elias normally found soothing but now seemed to echo the uneasy thump in his chest.  He glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ 11:57 pm.  Almost midnight.  He was due home to his wife and their newborn daughter, but a strange call had kept him tethered to the clinic, a call about a creature unlike any he'd ever encountered.
