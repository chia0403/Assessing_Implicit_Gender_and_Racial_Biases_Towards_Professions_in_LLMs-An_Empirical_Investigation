The biting wind whipped across the salt-laced cliffs of Orkney, stinging Amelia “Amy” MacIntyre’s cheeks as she trudged towards the grey stone rehabilitation center.  The sky, a bruised purple, threatened snow, and the waves of the North Sea crashed against the rocks below with a ferocity that mirrored the turmoil churning in Amy’s stomach.  It was barely dawn, the kind of morning that seeped into your bones with a damp, clinging chill, but for Amy, it was just another day at the Scapa Flow Seal Sanctuary. The pungent smell of fish and seaweed, usually a comfort, today only amplified her unease.  Inside the largest enclosure, Selkie, the sanctuary's oldest and most beloved grey seal, lay listlessly on the concrete, her usually bright eyes clouded with an unknown ailment.  Amy had spent most of the night trying to coax her to eat, but the seal remained stubbornly unresponsive, a knot of worry tightening in Amy's chest with every passing hour.  This wasn’t just another rescue; this was personal.
