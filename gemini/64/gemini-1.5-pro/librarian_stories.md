The scent of old paper and leather, a comforting aroma Amelia Persephone Hawthorne had grown up with, clung to the air of the Whispering Pines Public Library like a beloved, threadbare shawl.  Nestled between a perpetually-closed antique shop and a bustling bakery that filled the street with the tantalizing scent of cinnamon rolls each morning, the library stood as a silent sanctuary.  Its brick façade, weathered by the relentless Oregon rain and warmed by the fleeting summer sun, held within it stories untold and knowledge yet to be discovered.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, perched behind the heavy oak circulation desk, the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her fingers on the keyboard a quiet counterpoint to the hushed whispers of patrons browsing the shelves. The late afternoon light, filtered through the large arched windows, cast long shadows across the polished wooden floor, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere. This was Amelia’s domain, a place where the real world faded into the background, replaced by the rustling of pages and the boundless expanse of the imagination.  But on this particular Tuesday, the quiet hum of the library was about to be shattered.
