The biting November wind whipped off the slate-grey waters of Lake Superior, clawing at the exposed skin of Elias Thorne as he wrestled a sheet of plywood against the frame of the half-built boathouse.  Snow dusted the skeletal pines that ringed the northern edge of Apostle Island, clinging to their boughs like powdered sugar.  The air smelled of pine needles and the sharp, metallic tang of the approaching winter.  Elias, his breath clouding before him in ragged puffs, hammered the final nail home with a satisfying *thwack*, the sound echoing across the otherwise silent bay.  His calloused fingers, numb despite the thick wool gloves, ached with the cold and the day's labour.  This boathouse, commissioned by the reclusive owner of the island's only permanent dwelling, was Elias's last job before the lake froze over, sealing him in his small cabin on the mainland for the long, harsh Wisconsin winter.
