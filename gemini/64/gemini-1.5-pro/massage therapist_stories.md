The rain hammered against the large bay window of Kneaded Relief, blurring the neon "Open" sign hanging in the misted glass.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the petrichor-laced wind whipping through the streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Elara Rose Hawthorne, her hands still slightly slick with aromatherapy oil, watched the downpour intensify, a sigh escaping her lips.  The last appointment of the day had just cancelled, leaving Elara alone in her small, but meticulously decorated, massage therapy studio. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner was the only sound besides the drumming rain, creating a strangely peaceful, if somewhat melancholy, atmosphere.
