The radio crackled with a frantic voice, "...multiple victims...possible explosion...corner of Royal and St. Peter..." Amy’s stomach tightened.  The French Quarter, always a vibrant tapestry of music and laughter, was now a canvas smeared with potential tragedy.  The flashing lights painted the wrought-iron balconies and crumbling brick facades in strobing hues of red and blue, transforming the historic streets into something surreal and ominous.
