The persistent aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of "Paradise Found Travel," a small agency tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery on Bleecker Street. Rain lashed against the window, mirroring the dismal state of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's business.  Amelia, whose vibrant auburn hair was currently pulled back in a messy bun, stared out at the grey New York City street, a half-eaten bagel forgotten on her desk.  November had arrived with a vengeance, bringing with it a biting wind and a distinct lack of clients eager to escape to warmer climates.  The travel posters showcasing turquoise waters and white sand beaches seemed to mock her with their unattainable serenity.  A lone, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered office, where brochures promising exotic adventures lay scattered like fallen autumn leaves.
