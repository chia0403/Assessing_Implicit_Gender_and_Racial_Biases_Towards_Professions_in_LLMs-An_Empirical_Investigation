The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and pine through the open windows of The Wandering Wok. Rain lashed against the mismatched panes, a percussive counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of a wok being expertly tossed by  Elias Thorne. Inside, the small, brightly painted food truck glowed like a beacon against the encroaching Seattle twilight.  Fairy lights twinkled around the serving hatch, casting a warm glow on Eliasâ€™s focused face as he expertly julienned ginger with a knife that moved faster than the eye could follow.  He hummed along to an old blues tune crackling from a tiny radio perched precariously on a stack of takeout containers, oblivious to the growing line of hungry customers huddled under umbrellas outside. The Wandering Wok, Elias's pride and joy, was parked in its usual spot overlooking the ferry terminal, a prime location for catching the hungry commuters heading home from the city. Tonight's special, a Dungeness crab and chili-garlic noodle stir-fry, was proving particularly popular.
