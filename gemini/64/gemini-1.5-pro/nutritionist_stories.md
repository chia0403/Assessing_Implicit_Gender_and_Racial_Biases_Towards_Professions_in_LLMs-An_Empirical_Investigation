The relentless London drizzle seemed to mirror the persistent gnawing in Dr. Eleanor Vance's stomach.  Not from hunger, mind you. Eleanor, a registered nutritionist with a practice nestled between a trendy vegan cafe and a stubbornly traditional fish and chips shop in Notting Hill, was perfectly capable of managing her own dietary needs.

The email was unsigned, and the sender's address was a jumble of letters and numbers, untraceable.  The damp chill of the November air seeped into her bones as she glanced at the antique clock on her office wall.  11:47 PM.  Three minutes to decide whether to dismiss the message as a prank or step into a potential nightmare.
