The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised-purple sky, beat down on Elias Thorne’s back.  Sweat plastered his faded grey t-shirt to his skin, clinging like a second, less welcome, hide.  He shifted his weight on the steeply pitched roof of Mrs. Hemlock’s Victorian, the slate tiles hot enough to fry an egg.  Far below, the manicured lawns and flowering gardens of Ashworth, Connecticut, shimmered in the heat haze, a picture of idyllic suburban bliss.  Up here, however, amidst the dizzying heights and baking sun, Elias felt a world away from that serenity.  A rogue gust of wind tugged at his tool belt, reminding him of the precariousness of his position.  He adjusted his grip on the chipped hammer, the familiar weight grounding him.  This was his life – balanced precariously between heaven and earth, mending the roofs that sheltered the unsuspecting world below.  Today, however, something felt different. A flicker of unease, like a loose shingle in the wind, tickled at the back of his mind.
