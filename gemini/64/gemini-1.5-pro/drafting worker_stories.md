The flickering fluorescent lights of Henderson & Finch Architects hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head. It was a tune she'd grown accustomed to over the past five years, a soundtrack to the precise clicks and whirs of her drafting pencil and the rustle of vellum paper.  The air in the office, perpetually stale with the scent of blueprint ink and lukewarm coffee, hung heavy on a humid July afternoon. Outside, the Chicago skyline shimmered through the grime-streaked windows, a dizzying tapestry of steel and glass that seemed a world away from the hushed concentration of the drafting room.  Amelia, perched on her stool, meticulously rendered the cross-section of a proposed high-rise condominium, each line drawn with the unwavering focus of a surgeon.  The only other sound in the cavernous room was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Mr. Henderson's manicured fingernails on his mahogany desk in the adjoining office, a percussive reminder of deadlines and deliverables.
