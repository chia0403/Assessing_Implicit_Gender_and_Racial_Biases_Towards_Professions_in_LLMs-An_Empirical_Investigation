The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a rhythm that mirrored the throbbing headache brewing behind Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's eyes.  Neon signs flickered erratically through the grime-streaked window, casting a sickly green glow over the empty bar.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light filtering down from a bare bulb hanging precariously above the cracked linoleum floor. Nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, just outside the forgotten town of Dustbowl, West Virginia, the Rusty Mug was less a beacon of warmth and more a last resort against the biting mountain winds.  Amy, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun and a weariness etched onto her normally freckled face, polished the same chipped shot glass for the third time, the silence only broken by the relentless rain and the occasional groan of the ancient building settling into the damp earth.  She knew it was a slow Tuesday, especially this close to winter, but even the regulars seemed to be avoiding the Mug tonight. It feltâ€¦omenous.
