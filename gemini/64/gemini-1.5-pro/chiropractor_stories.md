The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled street, her breath misting in the frigid air.  Above her, the wrought-iron sign of "Vance Chiropractic & Wellness" creaked rhythmically, a familiar counterpoint to the clang of church bells echoing from St. Michael's down the road.  Ashworth, nestled in the heart of the Derbyshire Peak District, was picturesque, a postcard village of stone cottages and cascading wisteria, but today its charm was lost on Eleanor. The biting wind seemed to seep into her bones, a chilling reminder of the news she'd just received: the physiotherapy clinic next door, her only real competition and surprisingly, her closest ally in Ashworth, was closing.  This meant more patients, yes, but also the loss of a friendly face, a shared cup of tea on slow afternoons, and a sense of community she was only just beginning to build in this small, insular town.
