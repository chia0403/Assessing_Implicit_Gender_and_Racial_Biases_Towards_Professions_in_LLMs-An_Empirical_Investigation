The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes.  A battered, sky-blue tuk-tuk, affectionately nicknamed "The Blue Lagoon" by its owner, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, sputtered to a stop outside the ornate gates of Wat Arun, the Temple of Dawn. Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid to combat the Bangkok heat, hopped out, a welcoming smile plastered on her face despite the pre-dawn hour.  The sky was just beginning to lighten, a bruised purple giving way to streaks of orange and pink, painting the intricate porcelain mosaics of the temple in an ethereal glow.  Seven bleary-eyed tourists, clutching water bottles and cameras, emerged from a nearby minivan, blinking against the growing light. Amy clapped her hands together, the jingle of her silver bracelets echoing in the relative quiet.  “Welcome, everyone, to the most beautiful temple in Bangkok! I'm Amy, your guide for today, and I promise you, this sunrise is going to be worth the early wake-up call.”
