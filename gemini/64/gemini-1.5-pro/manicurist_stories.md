The bell above the door to "Nailed It!" tinkled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the thrum of anxiety vibrating in Evangeline Rose Dupres’s chest.  The salon, squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery on Bleecker Street in the West Village, was usually her sanctuary, a haven of acetone and acrylic.  But today, the air hung thick with something more than top coat fumes – anticipation.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty front window, painted skewed rectangles of warmth across the faded floral wallpaper and the worn, avocado-green vinyl of the pedicure chairs.  Evangeline, perched on a stool behind the manicure station nearest the door, nervously buffed her already immaculate nails, the rhythmic rasp a futile attempt to smooth the jagged edges of her nerves.  This wasn’t just any Tuesday.  This was the day *he* was supposed to come back.
