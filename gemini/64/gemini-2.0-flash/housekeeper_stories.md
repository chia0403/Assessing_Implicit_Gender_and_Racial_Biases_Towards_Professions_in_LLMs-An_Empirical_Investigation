## Story Opening:

The scent of lemon and old money clung to Mrs. Worthington's drawing-room like a stubborn ghost. Imogene "Immy" Davies, head housekeeper at Worthington Manor, sighed and ran a gloved hand over the mahogany side table, ensuring not a single speck of dust remained. The antique clock, a monstrous thing with cherubic figures chasing each other around its gilded face, chimed a mournful two o'clock. Right on schedule. Mrs. Worthington would be down for her tea in precisely fifteen minutes, and woe betide Immy if even the slightest imperfection marred the ritual.

Immy straightened, her reflection a fleeting glimpse in the polished surface. Forty-seven, with eyes the color of a winter sky and hands that knew the language of every antique in the house, she was a fixture, as indispensable and unseen as the plumbing. But today, a tremor of unease ran beneath her usual calm. A delicate porcelain shepherdess, one she swore she’d dusted only yesterday, lay shattered at the foot of the table.

## Setting:

**Worthington Manor, Oxfordshire, England:**

A sprawling estate, a monument to faded grandeur. Worthington Manor had stood for centuries, weathering wars, fortunes made and lost, and the relentless creep of time. The grounds were impeccably manicured – rolling green lawns dotted with ancient oaks, a formal rose garden bursting with color (even in late autumn), and a serpentine lake reflecting the perpetually overcast sky.

The interior was a labyrinth of high-ceilinged rooms, echoing hallways, and secret passages rumored to date back to the Tudor era. Each room was a carefully curated tableau of antique furniture, priceless artwork, and family heirlooms, reflecting the Worthington family’s long and often turbulent history. The overall atmosphere was one of hushed reverence, a museum more than a home, with Immy acting as its silent custodian. The modern world seemed to stop at the wrought-iron gates, leaving within a bubble of tradition and unspoken secrets.
