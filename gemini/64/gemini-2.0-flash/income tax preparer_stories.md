The fluorescent lights of "Liberty Tax & Accounting" hummed with a relentless, almost angry buzz, mirroring the low-grade anxiety that perpetually simmered in Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's chest. Outside, a pre-spring rain lashed against the plate glass window, blurring the neon-green Statue of Liberty costume worn by a bored teenager named Tiffany. Bart knew the costume well; he’d helped Tiffany’s mother, Delores Johnson, navigate the earned income tax credit for the past five years.

Bart's corner office, barely large enough to swing a cat without hitting a stapler, was crammed with overflowing file cabinets and stacks of receipts threatening to avalanche onto his head. He was, by all accounts, a tax professional of middling success and questionable social grace. His tie, perpetually askew, was patterned with tiny calculators, a gift from his Aunt Mildred that he wore out of obligation more than affection. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, the scent of a thousand deadlines met and a thousand more looming large.

Bart lived and breathed the intricacies of the tax code, a bizarre passion that stemmed from a childhood fascination with numbers and a deep-seated desire to bring order to chaos. Unfortunately, chaos seemed to follow him, both in his personal life and in the endless stream of frantic clients who stumbled through his door, clutching crumpled W-2s and pleading for Bart to work his magic and deliver them from the IRS's unforgiving grip.
