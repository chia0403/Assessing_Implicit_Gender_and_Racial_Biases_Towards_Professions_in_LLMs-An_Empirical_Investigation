## Story Opening:

The rain tasted like stale pennies and desperation, a fitting flavor for the story Eleanor Vance was about to chase. She adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, its buckle digging uncomfortably into her shoulder, and pulled her trench coat tighter. The yellow glow spilling from the open doorway of "The Salty Siren" barely cut through the perpetual gloom that clung to this part of Oakhaven's docks, but it was enough. Enough to be a starting point, enough to be a breadcrumb in the labyrinth of secrets she knew lay hidden within this decaying city.

She took a deep breath, the briny air laced with the sharp tang of something rotten, and stepped inside.

## Setting:

**Location:** The docks of Oakhaven, specifically in front of a dilapidated bar called "The Salty Siren."

**Time:** A late, rainy evening in late October.

**Description:** Oakhaven is a coastal city steeped in history, but choked by neglect. The once-thriving docks are now a patchwork of crumbling warehouses, rusting cranes, and shadowy alleyways. The Salty Siren is a dive bar, its paint peeling and windows grimy. The neon sign flickers sporadically, casting a sickly yellow light on the wet cobblestones. The air is thick with the smell of saltwater, diesel, and something indescribably foul. A low, mournful foghorn moans in the distance, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.
