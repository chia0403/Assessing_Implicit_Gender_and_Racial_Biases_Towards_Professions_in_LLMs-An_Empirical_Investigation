## Opening:

The smell of aged paper and stale coffee clung to Eleanor Abigail Finch like a second skin. Another Friday, another mountain of receipts threatening to topple and bury her alive. The fluorescent lights of Finch & Finch, Bookkeeping, hummed overhead, a discordant symphony to the gentle tapping of her keyboard. Eleanor sighed, adjusting her glasses. She loved the quiet hum of predictability in her work, the way numbers, properly aligned and categorized, could bring order to the chaos of the world. But today, even the satisfying click of her adding machine felt hollow. She glanced at the framed photo on her desk - a younger Eleanor, beaming beside her late father, Arthur, the founder of Finch & Finch. Heâ€™d always said, "Numbers never lie, El. People do." She was beginning to wonder if even that were true.
## Setting:

Finch & Finch, Bookkeeping, occupied a small, unassuming office on the second floor of a brick building in the heart of Oakhaven, a quiet, almost stubbornly provincial town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The office itself was a testament to the enduring power of beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige filing cabinets stretching towards the low, acoustical tile ceiling. The only splashes of color came from Eleanor's own, rather haphazard collection of succulents arranged on the windowsill, fighting a losing battle for sunlight against the perpetually drawn blinds. The blinds were a legacy of Arthur Finch, who believed natural light was a distraction from the sacred task of balancing a ledger. Outside, Oakhaven went about its slow, deliberate life: the occasional rumble of a pickup truck, the distant clang of the town hall clock, the murmur of conversations drifting from the bakery downstairs. Inside, Eleanor navigated the labyrinthine world of debits and credits, a quiet guardian of Oakhaven's financial secrets.
