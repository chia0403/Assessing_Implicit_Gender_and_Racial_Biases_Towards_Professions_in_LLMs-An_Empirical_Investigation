## Story Opening & Setting:

The first hint that something was amiss was the marmalade. Not the orange marmalade, mind you, of which Agnes Plumkett made a particularly tangy and award-winning variety. No, it was the lemon. Bright, sunshine yellow lemon marmalade, smeared haphazardly across the cobblestones right outside the door of "The Sweetest Things," Agnes' bakery.

Agnes, apron dusted with flour and hands smelling faintly of vanilla and cardamom, knelt cautiously, her brow furrowed like a meticulously scored sourdough. The street, usually bustling with early morning shoppers eager for her freshly baked croissants and honey cakes, was eerily deserted. A silent tableau of overturned baskets and scattered newspapers lay scattered around the deserted square, bathed in the ethereal glow of the predawn light filtering through the ancient, crooked buildings.

Agnes Plumkett had lived in the village of Evenbrook all her life, a place nestled deep within the Whispering Woods. Evenbrook was a place where time seemed to move slower, where gossip travelled faster than the wind, and where the most exciting event of the week was usually the annual scarecrow festival. But thisâ€¦ this was something entirely different. This was unnerving.

She dabbed a finger into the lemon marmalade, the tart scent doing little to dispel the growing knot of unease in her stomach. Lemon marmalade was old Widow Hawthorne's specialty. And Widow Hawthorne, Agnes knew with chilling certainty, wouldn't spill a drop, let alone an entire jar. Something was very, very wrong in Evenbrook.
