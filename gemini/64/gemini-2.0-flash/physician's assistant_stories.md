Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a physician's assistant named Eleanor Grace Davies:

**Setting:**

The air hung thick and humid in the examination room of the Mercy Creek Rural Health Clinic. Sunlight, filtered through dust-laden blinds, painted stripes across the faded linoleum floor. The smell of antiseptic cleaner mingled uncomfortably with the faint, lingering scent of Mrs. Henderson's rose-scented hand lotion from earlier. Outside, the drone of cicadas was a relentless summer soundtrack to life in Harmony County, Arkansas. This was Eleanor's domain, a small, tidy space crammed with an examination table, a towering metal cabinet overflowing with supplies, and a well-worn desk piled high with charts. A colorful anatomy poster featuring the skeletal system hung slightly askew on the wall, a testament to its countless repositionings.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Grace Davies, PA, stifled a yawn behind her hand and rubbed the bridge of her nose. It was 2:30 PM, prime drowsy-after-lunch territory, and the air conditioning in the clinic was struggling to keep pace with the Arkansas heat. The patient in the waiting room was an older gentleman named Dale Perkins, complaining of persistent back pain. Eleanor had seen him before, a few times, for various aches and ailments. Dale was a nice man, a retired farmer with a kind face and a deep, abiding love for his grandchildren. But Eleanor suspected his back pain was more about loneliness than slipped discs. Before calling him in, Eleanor flipped open his chart, already knowing the familiar narrative: years of physical labor, the sting of losing his wife two years ago, and a general sense of feeling "old before his time." As she scanned the notes, something caught her eye. A lab result, flagged in red by the automated system. Something she definitely hadn't seen before. Adrenaline, sharp and unwelcome, jolted her awake. This wasn't about loneliness. This was something else entirely.
