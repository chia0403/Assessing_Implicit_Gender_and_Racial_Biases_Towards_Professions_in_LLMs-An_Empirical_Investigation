The rusty swing set groaned a mournful song in the crisp October air. Miss Eleanor Ainsworth shivered, pulling her knitted cardigan tighter. It was after four, the sun was already dipping low behind the skeletal branches of the oak trees bordering the schoolyard, and a damp chill had settled over the grounds of Maplewood Elementary. The last straggler, little Timmy Henderson, had finally been scooped up by his mother fifteen minutes ago, leaving Eleanor to finally lock up her classroom and head home.

Maplewood Elementary, a squat, brick building in the heart of the sleepy town of Havenwood, Ohio, wasn’t exactly bursting with architectural charm. Built in the 1950s, it was a monument to practicality over aesthetics. Long, fluorescent-lit hallways echoed with the ghosts of generations of children, their triumphs and tribulations etched into the scuffed linoleum floors. Inside, Eleanor's third-grade classroom, Room 203, was a riot of color and organized chaos: alphabet letters snaked across the whiteboard, student artwork adorned the walls (a particularly gruesome rendition of a pumpkin stood out), and a faint scent of Elmer's glue lingered in the air.

But despite its uninspiring facade, Maplewood was home. It was where Eleanor had poured her heart and soul for the past five years. It was where she fostered a love of reading in shy little Lily Thompson and patiently untangled the mysteries of fractions for the ever-energetic, if slightly messy, Michael Rodriguez. And tonight, as the last rays of sunlight painted long shadows across the empty playground, Eleanor felt a prickle of unease. Something felt…off. Maybe it was just the pre-Halloween jitters, or perhaps it was something more tangible, something lurking just beyond the edge of her perception.
