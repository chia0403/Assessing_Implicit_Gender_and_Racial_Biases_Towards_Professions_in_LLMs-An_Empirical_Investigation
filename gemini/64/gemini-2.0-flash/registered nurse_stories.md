**Story Opening:**

The smell of bleach and old coffee clung to the air in St. Jude's West emergency room, a familiar scent that usually comforted Eleanor Mae Davies. Tonight, however, it did little to soothe the knot of dread tightening in her stomach. The constant beep of the heart monitor in Bay 7 pulsed like a frantic drummer, a frantic rhythm mirroring the anxiety drumming in her own chest. She tightened the velcro cuff on her patient's arm, the numbers on the blood pressure gauge flashing a grim warning: 90/60. Lower than before.

**Setting:**

The story opens within the chaotic, brightly lit Emergency Room of St. Jude's West Hospital, located in the working-class district of West Oakland, California. The ER is a sprawling maze of curtained-off bays, each containing a patient tethered to a web of wires and monitors. The air is thick with a cacophony of beeps, alarms, strained conversations, and the occasional shouted order. The walls are painted a sterile, institutional pale green, attempting to offer some measure of calm amidst the pandemonium. Nurses and doctors, their faces etched with exhaustion, move with a practiced urgency, navigating the crowded space with a blend of efficiency and compassion. Outside, the glow of Oakland city lights casts long shadows through the large windows, a stark contrast to the harsh fluorescent glare within.
