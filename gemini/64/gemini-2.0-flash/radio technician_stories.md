## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent drone of static clawed at Clara Beatrix Finch's ears, a familiar torment she usually welcomed like an old, grumpy friend. Tonight, however, it was a malevolent hum, a buzzing hive of interference threatening to overwhelm the faint, plaintive signal she was desperately trying to pull from the ether. Sweat beaded on her brow, illuminated by the dim green glow of the oscilloscope. Her fingers, stained with grease and soldering flux, danced across the dials of her ancient receiver, coaxing, pleading, even threatening the recalcitrant machine. "Come on, you relic," she muttered, her breath fogging the cold windowpane. "Just a little bit furtherâ€¦ just a whisper..."

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the winter of 1958, in a small, isolated lighthouse perched on the jagged coastline of the Outer Hebrides, a chain of islands off the coast of Scotland. The lighthouse, aptly named "North Point Beacon," is a stark, imposing structure built of grey granite, its tower reaching towards the perpetually overcast sky. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of salt, ozone, and the ever-present reek of hot vacuum tubes. Clara's workspace, carved out of a disused storage room on the second floor, is a chaotic testament to her profession and her personality. Wires snake across the floor like unruly vines, connecting a dizzying array of antique radios, amplifiers, and test equipment. Old schematics, torn from dusty manuals, are taped to the walls, alongside faded photographs of her late father, also a radio technician, beaming proudly beside his own cobbled-together contraptions. Outside, the unforgiving Atlantic crashes against the rocks, a constant, roaring reminder of the isolation that both captivated and challenged Clara. The wind howls relentlessly, a mournful song that blends with the rhythmic pulse of the lighthouse beam, a solitary sentinel cutting through the darkness.
