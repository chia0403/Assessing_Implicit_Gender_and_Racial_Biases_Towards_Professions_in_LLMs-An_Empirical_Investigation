**Story Opening:**

The scent of dust, ancient velvet, and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail that usually invigorated Montgomery Archibald Finch. Tonight, though, it only amplified the dull ache behind his eyes. He rubbed them fiercely, the grime from the crumbling proscenium smudging across his forehead like war paint. He hadn't slept properly in three days, fueled solely by lukewarm coffee and the unwavering belief that he was on the cusp of something extraordinary. Or a catastrophic flop. The line, Montgomery knew, was often thinner than a thread of costume stitching. He glanced at the empty stage, its warped floorboards gleaming faintly under the single bare bulb dangling precariously from the flies. It was here, in this crumbling, forgotten theatre, that he would either make his name or break it.

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Theatre of Oakhaven, nestled in the forgotten industrial district of the once-booming city of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, was a relic of a bygone era. Built in 1928, it had once been a vibrant hub for vaudeville, opera, and traveling theatre troupes. But time, neglect, and the advent of cinema had taken their toll. The ornate plasterwork was cracked and peeling, revealing the brick beneath. Water stains bloomed like grotesque flowers on the ceiling. The velvet seats in the orchestra were ripped and faded, stained with years of spilled soda and forgotten dreams. The dressing rooms backstage were cramped and damp, smelling faintly of mildew and mothballs. Yet, amidst the decay, the Grand Majestic possessed a certain faded grandeur, a whisper of its former glory that Montgomery found utterly captivating. It was a wounded beast, waiting to be awakened.
