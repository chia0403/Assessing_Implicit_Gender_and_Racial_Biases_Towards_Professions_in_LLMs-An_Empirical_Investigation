## Story Opening and Setting:

The bell above the antique oak door of "Dust & Draperies" tinkled a delicate, almost mournful, melody as Genevieve Eloise Carter stepped inside. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, painted the room in shades of sepia and amber, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering fairies.

Genevieve, a whirlwind of perfectly curated chaos even in her downtime, ran a gloved hand along a chipped porcelain doll head displayed on a velvet-covered plinth. The air smelled of aged paper, dried lavender, and something vaguely…reptilian.

This wasn’t her usual haunt. Genevieve normally frequented the pristine showrooms of established textile houses, or the curated showrooms of high-end furniture designers. "Dust & Draperies," on the other hand, felt like the attic of a particularly eccentric deceased relative. Stacks of moth-eaten tapestries leaned precariously against teetering piles of chipped china. Wingback chairs, their velvet upholstery threadbare and faded, huddled in corners like forgotten dowagers.

She’d come to the forgotten little shop on a tip from her Aunt Millie, a woman whose taste was as questionable as her love of polyester pantsuits. Millie had insisted “Dust & Draperies” held a treasure trove of "hidden gems" perfect for Genevieve's latest, and most daunting, commission: the complete redecoration of the notoriously tasteless Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle’s manor, "Periwinkle Pines," on the outskirts of the eerily named Blackwood Forest.

Genevieve wrinkled her nose. Even Mrs. Periwinkle's atrocious collection of taxidermied squirrels couldn't be as bad as the atmosphere in this place. Still, a job was a job, especially one that paid as handsomely as this. Perhaps, buried beneath the dust and decay, lay the inspiration she desperately needed to transform Periwinkle Pines from a gaudy eyesore into something… well, less offensively awful.

A gruff voice startled her. "Something catch your eye, doll?"
