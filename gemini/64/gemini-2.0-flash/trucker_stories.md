The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy, tasting of diesel and damp earth. Rain lashed against the chrome of the Kenworth T680, blurring the already indistinct outline of the Wyoming mountains. Inside, beneath the low hum of the engine, Elara Maeve O'Connell stretched, her joints protesting after another night spent wrestling with the narrow confines of the sleeper cab.

Elara flicked on the CB radio, the static crackling like a disgruntled cat. "Breaker, breaker, anybody out there on this lonely stretch of I-80?"

Only silence answered.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The digital clock on the dash glowed a malevolent red: 4:37 AM. Just about time to fire up the coffee pot and face another hundred miles of rain-slicked highway.

The setting was a desolate truck stop just outside of Laramie, Wyoming. It wasn't much to look at â€“ a battered gas station, a greasy spoon diner with peeling paint, and a scattering of eighteen-wheelers like Elara's parked haphazardly around the muddy lot. It was the kind of place where the coffee tasted like tar and the stories were as long and winding as the interstate itself, a temporary haven for weary travelers chasing horizons and deadlines. This particular morning, however, the usual collection of grizzled truckers seemed to be huddled inside, sheltering from the relentless storm. Elara Maeve O'Connell was alone, a lone woman in a man's world, and the vast, unforgiving landscape seemed to mirror the ache in her own heart.
