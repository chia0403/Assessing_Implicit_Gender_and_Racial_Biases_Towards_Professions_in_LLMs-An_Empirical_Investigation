Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Barnaby Quilling:

**Setting:**

The Majestic Grand Hotel, Palm Springs, California. It was a monument to mid-century modern extravagance. Think soaring glass walls reflecting the harsh desert sun, kidney-shaped pools shimmering like mirages, and a cacophony of turquoise, pink, and gold decorating everything from the oversized ashtrays to the cantilevered balconies. The lobby, a vast expanse of polished terrazzo, buzzed with the low hum of air conditioning and the chatter of tourists arriving for weekend getaways. Date palms, in enormous concrete planters, cast geometric shadows across the plush velvet furniture, adding to the hotel's air of perpetual twilight.

**Story Opening:**

Barnaby Quilling, dressed in the Majestic Grand Hotel's signature (and deeply unflattering) bellhop uniform of powder blue and gold braid, adjusted his cap for what felt like the hundredth time that morning. The July heat, even inside the air-conditioned lobby, seemed to leach the starch out of his spine. He watched, with practiced disinterest, as a family struggled to wrangle a gaggle of over-excited children and an overflowing luggage cart towards the registration desk. Barnaby had seen it all before: the harried parents, the sugar-fueled meltdowns, the mountain of suitcases containing everything but common sense. He smoothed down the crisp white gloves that seemed perpetually too tight, and waited. He was, after all, a bellhop, and bellhops were meant to wait. Mostly, he waited for the chance to be something more.
