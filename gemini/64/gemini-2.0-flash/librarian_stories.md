Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a librarian named Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Setting:**

The year is 1928. The setting is the "Dustbloom Library," a somewhat dilapidated but charming two-story building in the small, isolated desert town of Dustbloom, Arizona. The library's exterior is painted a faded ochre, and the wooden sign creaks ominously in the ever-present wind. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of aging paper, dust motes dance in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, and a hushed silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the occasional shuffle of a patron or the whisper of turning pages. The shelves, reaching to the high ceilings, are crammed with books of every imaginable subject, their spines faded and worn.  A large, ornate grandfather clock ticks rhythmically in the corner, a constant reminder of the passage of time in this forgotten corner of the world.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, the sound barely audible above the tick-tock of the grandfather clock. Another Tuesday, another handful of tumbleweeds blown against the front door. The Dustbloom Library was not exactly a hub of activity. Beatrice adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose, and surveyed her domain. It was a battlefield of silence, fought with the weapons of Dewey Decimal and the quiet strength of words. But it was her battlefield, and she loved it with a fierce, possessive love.  The only other occupant, old Mr. Peabody, was snoring softly in the armchair in the corner, a well-worn copy of "Moby Dick" resting on his chest like a paperweight. Beatrice glanced at the overdue book ledger, a heavy, leather-bound volume filled with names she barely recognized. She was about to resign herself to another uneventful afternoon when a figure darkened the doorway, silhouetted against the blinding desert sun. He was tall, lean, and his face was hidden by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  And, Beatrice noted with a frisson of something that might have been excitement, he was undoubtedly a stranger.
