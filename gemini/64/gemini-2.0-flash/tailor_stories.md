The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach in the grimy London sky, slanted through the dusty window of "Needle & Thread," casting long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered workbench. The scent of beeswax, pressed wool, and lingering pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar miasma that had permeated the small shop for decades. Bartholomew Archibald Finch, tailor extraordinaire, sighed, pushing his spectacles further up his nose. Another button gone rogue, another seam sprung on a gentleman's tweeds. The daily grind of mending and alterations, while steady, rarely offered the kind of challenging artistry that truly stirred his soul. He yearned to create, to sculpt fabric into something breathtaking, but the demands of keeping a roof over his head, and enough stew in his belly, usually took precedence. He snipped a loose thread with unnecessary force, the sharp click echoing in the otherwise quiet room. The year was 1888, and while London buzzed with innovation and intrigue, Bartholomew Finch felt himself increasingly sewn into the fabric of the mundane. He just didn't know how soon, and how dramatically, that fabric would be ripped apart.
