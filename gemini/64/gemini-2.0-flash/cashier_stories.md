Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a cashier named Eleanor Willowbrook:

**Setting:** The "Crimson Cup" Coffee Shop, nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Willow Avenue in the small, perpetually-overcast town of Meadowbrook, Oregon. Crimson Cup wasn't fancy. It was the kind of place where the mismatched mugs were charming, the pastries were day-old but heavily discounted, and the air always smelled faintly of burnt sugar and a quiet desperation for spring. The walls were painted a cheerful, if faded, scarlet, adorned with local art that never seemed to sell. Outside, a lone, perpetually-damp bench sat under the skeletal branches of an ancient willow tree.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the Crimson Cup's door jingled, a sound Eleanor Willowbrook knew intimately – it was the soundtrack to her existence. She didn’t even look up at first, automatically reaching for a disposable cup and marking it with the next order number. Number thirty-seven. Probably Mrs. Gable with her usual lukewarm decaf, she thought, the woman’s face already forming in her mind’s eye. But it wasn't Mrs. Gable. Standing in the doorway, rain glistening on his dark hair, was a man Eleanor had never seen before. He was tall, impossibly so, and his eyes held a kind of weary intelligence that made her own suddenly feel a little vacant. He was wearing a long, dark coat that looked vaguely out of place in Meadowbrook, like a raven landing in a field of robins. He didn't immediately step forward, but paused, his gaze sweeping over the mismatched tables, the dusty art, and finally, settling on Eleanor herself. He didn't smile. He just stood there, absorbing the Crimson Cup, and Eleanor Willowbrook, into his silent assessment. Number thirty-seven would have to wait.
