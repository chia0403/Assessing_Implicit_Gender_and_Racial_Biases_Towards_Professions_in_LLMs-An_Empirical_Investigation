## Story Opening:

The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Penelope Ainsworth's fingers on the mahogany desk was the only sound that dared break the morning stillness. Not even the insistent hum of the fluorescent lights could compete with the nervous energy radiating from her. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged windows of Crawford & Sterling, Attorneys at Law. Penelope shivered, pulling her sensible cardigan tighter around her. It wasn't cold, not physically, but the air in this office always felt perpetually chilled, heavy with the weight of legal pronouncements and unspoken secrets. 

Today, though, the chill wasn't just atmospheric. Today, the usual miasma of anxiety that clung to Penelope like cheap perfume was laced with a sharper, more potent fear. Today, Mr. Sterling, the senior partner himself, had requested her presence in his office at precisely 9:00 AM. And Mr. Sterling didn't request; he commanded. Her watch showed 8:57. Penelope swallowed, the dry lump in her throat feeling the size of a gavel. This was it. The day she finally learned if her diligent work, her meticulous filing, her endless cups of lukewarm coffee, had been enough to earn her a reprieve. Or if she was about to be swallowed whole by the cold, uncaring machine that was Crawford & Sterling.

## Setting:

The story is set in the creaking, Victorian-era offices of Crawford & Sterling, Attorneys at Law, located in the historic downtown district of a nameless, bustling metropolis. The building, a five-story brownstone with ornate gargoyles leering from the eaves, stands as a stark contrast to the sleek, modern skyscrapers that surround it. Inside, the offices are a time capsule of old-world legal practice. Dark wood paneling lines the walls, punctuated by portraits of stern-faced former partners. Heavy velvet drapes block out most of the natural light, lending the space a perpetually dim and somber atmosphere. The furniture is antique and imposing, designed to intimidate as much as it is to serve its function. Each office is cluttered with stacks of legal documents, overflowing ashtrays (a relic from a bygone era, now mostly used for holding paperclips), and overflowing inboxes. The air smells faintly of dust, old paper, and the lingering scent of Mr. Sterling's expensive pipe tobacco. The only modern concessions are the humming computers perched on the desks and the buzzing intercom system that delivers pronouncements from the higher echelons of the firm. In short, it is a place where tradition reigns supreme, and where progress is viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion.
