Okay, here's a story opening with a logger main character:

**Setting:** The dense, rain-soaked forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington State, late October. Mist clings to the towering Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, making the already-difficult terrain even more treacherous. The air smells of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the sharp, metallic tang of freshly cut timber. The constant drip-drip-drip of moisture echoes through the woods, occasionally punctuated by the roar of a chainsaw in the distance.

**Opening:**

The chill had sunk deep into Silas McKinnon's bones, a familiar ache that no amount of flannel or whiskey seemed to fully banish. He spat a stream of brown tobacco juice into the mossy undergrowth, the sound barely audible above the drone of his own Stihl chainsaw. The ancient fir he was working on, a behemoth easily ten feet across at its base, was proving to be a stubborn adversary. Silas had already put in six hours, bucking and limbing, wrestling the massive logs into manageable sections. His hands, gnarled and calloused from a lifetime of gripping axes and chainsaws, throbbed with a dull pain. He paused, wiping sweat from his brow with a forearm that was permanently stained with sap and grease. He hadn't seen this kind of stubborn wood since old man Hemlock's place back in '98. This forest held a memory and a will all its own.
