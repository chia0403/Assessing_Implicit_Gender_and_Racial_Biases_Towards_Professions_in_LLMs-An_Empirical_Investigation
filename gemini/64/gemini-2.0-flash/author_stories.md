The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a small comfort against the biting November wind that rattled the windows of her isolated cottage. Outside, the Scottish Highlands were a study in grey: grey sky, grey loch, grey stone. Perfect writing weather, she thought, although the romance novel she was *supposed* to be working on had been stubbornly refusing to coalesce.

Amelia Blackwood, bestselling author of the "Crimson Hearts" series, had retreated here, to Glen Coe, seeking inspiration. Or, more accurately, seeking escape from the suffocating pressure of expectation. Her agent, bless her greedy heart, kept calling, chirping about deadlines and marketing strategies. Amelia just wanted to lose herself in the wild beauty around her and, hopefully, find the spark that had ignited her previous books.

The cottage, nicknamed "The Raven's Roost" by the locals, was small and rustic, crammed with mismatched furniture and shelves overflowing with books â€“ a fitting haven for a woman whose life revolved around the written word. A peat fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the worn wooden floorboards. It was cozy, but the loneliness was a tangible presence, pressing in on her, a constant reminder that she was alone, facing down the blank page and her own dwindling inspiration.

Amelia took a sip of her tea, the smoky flavor doing little to dispel the creative fog that clung to her brain. She glanced out the window again, her eyes scanning the misty landscape. Perhaps a walk would help. Fresh air, even Scottish November air, was better than staring at a cursor blinking mockingly on her laptop screen. But as she reached for her thick wool coat, a sharp rap on the door made her jump. Visitors were rare out here. Who could possibly be calling at this hour?
