The insistent chirp of the robin outside the window, usually a welcome sound, felt like a pointed accusation this morning. Eleanor Rose Fairchild groaned, burying her face deeper into the pillow. Five-thirty AM. Her body argued for more sleep, but her mind was already buzzing with the day's appointments, the anxieties of her patients, and the ever-present pressure to make a meaningful difference in their lives.

Eleanor was an occupational therapist at the **Riverbend Rehabilitation Center**, a sprawling, brick building that nestled beside the tranquil (though deceptively strong) Cedar River, just outside of the small, close-knit town of Havenwood, Oregon. The Center served a diverse population, from stroke survivors relearning to tie their shoes, to children with developmental delays struggling to hold a crayon, to elderly individuals recovering from hip replacements. Eleanor had always been drawn to the tangible, practical nature of her work – the satisfaction of helping someone regain a sense of independence and control after a life-altering event.

The Riverbend Rehabilitation Center itself felt like a world apart. Inside, the sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the staff lounge. Brightly colored posters displayed exercises and motivational quotes on the walls, a desperate attempt to inject cheerfulness into a space often filled with pain and frustration. Today, the early morning sunlight slanted through the large windows of the occupational therapy gym, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The familiar array of equipment – parallel bars, adapted utensils, colorful therapy balls – waited patiently for the day to begin, each a silent testament to the struggles and triumphs that unfolded within those walls. Eleanor dreaded Tuesdays; Mr. Henderson, the retired lumberjack with a paralyzed left arm, was particularly resistant to therapy on Tuesdays. She knew she'd have to muster all her patience and creativity today.
