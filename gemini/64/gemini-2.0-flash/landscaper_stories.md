The dawn was a bruised plum color bleeding across the horizon as Elias Thorne wrestled his reluctant pickup, affectionately nicknamed "The Burro," to life. The engine coughed, sputtered, and finally roared to a grumpy existence, shaking the dew from the overgrown rose bushes clinging to the fence of his modest, rented bungalow. The scent of damp earth and petrol hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias, who considered it more invigorating than any fancy cologne.

Elias Thorne, all six-foot-four of him, emerged from the cab, his broad shoulders stooped slightly against the chill. He was a man built for labor, with hands calloused and strong, and eyes that, despite their weariness this early in the morning, held a surprising twinkle. He scratched the stubble on his jaw and looked out at the pre-dawn gloom that cloaked the small town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of the Willamette Valley, Oregon.

Oakhaven prided itself on its charm, on its meticulously manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds. It was the kind of place where neighborhood associations held annual "Best Yard" competitions, and the local nursery did a booming trade in petunias and hydrangeas. For Elias, it was both a blessing and a curse. He made a decent living keeping Oakhaven beautiful, but sometimes, he felt like he was just painting over the natural beauty that was already there, the wildness he felt simmering in his own soul.
