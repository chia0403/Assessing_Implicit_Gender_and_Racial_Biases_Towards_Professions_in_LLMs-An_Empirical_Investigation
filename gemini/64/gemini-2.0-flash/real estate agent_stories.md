The midday sun, a cruel and unforgiving mistress in Palm Springs, beat down on Penelope "Penny" Cartwright’s perfectly sculpted blonde waves. She squinted at the shimmering mirage that looked suspiciously like a swimming pool in the distance – probably just heat haze rising off the desert floor again. Penny Cartwright, real estate agent extraordinaire (at least that's what she told herself), dabbed at the perspiration gathering at her hairline with a silk scarf, the vibrant fuchsia a stark contrast to the beige landscape surrounding her.

The setting was the exclusive, yet perpetually unfinished, development of "The Oasis Estates." Nestled (or rather, precariously perched) on the edge of the San Jacinto Mountains, The Oasis was supposed to be the ultimate luxury living experience: sprawling mid-century modern homes, each with its own infinity pool, zen garden, and panoramic views. The reality, however, was slightly less glamorous. Construction had stalled three years ago after the developer, a notoriously flamboyant Italian with more ambition than money, mysteriously vanished. Now, only a handful of the houses were habitable, the rest skeletons of steel and concrete baking under the desert sun. Penny, ever the optimist (or perhaps just desperate), saw potential where others saw ruin. She was determined to make The Oasis Estates the hottest property in the Coachella Valley, even if it meant selling paradise one leaky pipe and unfinished foundation at a time.
