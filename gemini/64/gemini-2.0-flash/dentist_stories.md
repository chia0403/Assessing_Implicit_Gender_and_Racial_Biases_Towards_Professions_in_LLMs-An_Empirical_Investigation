Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a dentist named Dr. Alistair Finch:

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of clove oil and the hushed, almost reverent hum of the ultrasonic cleaner. Dr. Alistair Finch stared out the window of his practice, his reflection a ghost superimposed over the slate grey rooftops of Porthaven. Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the gnawing disquiet in his gut. He’d been seeing a lot of teeth lately – cracked molars, receding gums, the tell-tale signs of a population grinding its way through a silent, collective anxiety. But it wasn’t the state of his patients’ oral hygiene that was bothering him. No, today’s unease stemmed from the lingering whiff of saltwater clinging to the tweed jacket that hung on the coat rack, and the unnerving silence that had settled over the town after last night’s… event.

**Setting:**

Dr. Alistair Finch's dental practice, "The Porthaven Dental Suite," is located on the second floor of a somewhat dilapidated, but charming, Victorian building on the main street of Porthaven, Cornwall. Porthaven itself is a small, windswept fishing village nestled on a rugged stretch of the Cornish coast. It’s a place where the salt-laced air bites at your cheeks, where the rhythm of life is dictated by the tides, and where the locals cling to ancient traditions and whispers of the sea. The practice reflects Alistair's somewhat eccentric personality:

*   **The Waiting Room:** A cluttered yet comforting space, with worn leather armchairs, a bookshelf overflowing with nautical novels and antique dental texts, and a tank full of tropical fish that seems perpetually out of place. The walls are adorned with framed prints of old ship maps and unsettlingly realistic diagrams of teeth.
*   **The Operatory:** While modern equipment sits gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights, Alistair has consciously tried to soften the sterile atmosphere with potted ferns, a framed watercolor of a local cove, and the aforementioned scent of clove oil. A small, antique cabinet holds his instruments, alongside a dusty collection of shells he picked up during his own beachcombing walks. The window offers a partial view of the harbor, often obscured by mist or rain.

This combination of the familiar and the subtly unsettling aims to create a unique atmosphere, and allows for the juxtaposition of traditional and modern themes within the story.
