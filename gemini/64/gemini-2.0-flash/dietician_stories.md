The fluorescent lights of the clinic hummed, a sterile soundtrack to the quiet anxiety that always simmered in Eleanor Vance's stomach on a Monday morning. Outside, the November wind rattled against the frosted windows, promising a long, gray day in Portland, Oregon. Inside, Eleanor straightened the stack of pamphlets on the counter, each one featuring smiling, impossibly healthy people holding plates overflowing with kale. She sighed. Real life rarely mirrored the glossy sheen of marketing materials.

Eleanor, a Registered Dietitian, had always believed in the power of food, the way it could heal and nourish. But after five years at 'Wellness Within,' a private practice catering to a clientele that ranged from vaguely concerned to outright obsessed with their BMI, she was beginning to feel less like a healer and more like a salesperson peddling restrictions.

The scent of lavender hand sanitizer, a recent addition thanks to Mrs. Abernathy's particularly virulent strain of hypochondria, hung heavy in the air. Eleanor smoothed down her navy blue pencil skirt, a uniform chosen for its professional neutrality, and glanced at the waiting room. Empty. For now. The calm before the kale-storm. It wouldn't be long before the parade of anxieties began: carbophobia, sugar demonization, and the ever-present, gnawing guilt over the last slice of birthday cake.

Today, Eleanor Vance decided, she was going to try something different. No more sugar-coating the truth. No more acquiescing to fad diets and unrealistic expectations. Today, she was going to remind people that food was meant to be enjoyed, not feared. A small, rebellious smile crept onto her face, a flickering flame against the oppressive gray of the day. Let the kale-storm rage; Eleanor was armed with common sense, a little bit of science, and a whole lot of empathy. And, maybe, just maybe, she could help someone find their way back to a healthy relationship with food.
