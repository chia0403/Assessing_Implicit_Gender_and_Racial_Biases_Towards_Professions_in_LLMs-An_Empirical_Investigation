The flickering fluorescent lights of the lobby buzzed like a trapped wasp, a fitting soundtrack to Imelda Penelope Finch's Monday morning malaise. Outside, a deluge of rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Finch & Hawthorne Legal Associates, blurring the cityscape into a grey, impressionistic smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap air freshener (attempting to mask the stale coffee), and the low-grade anxiety that permeated a high-stakes law firm.

Imelda, perched precariously on the edge of her ergonomically-challenged chair, plastered a professional smile on her face. Her desk, a battlefield of sticky notes, client folders, and a rogue collection of novelty paperclips shaped like miniature flamingos, was her domain. She adjusted her oversized glasses, the lenses reflecting the blue light of her monitor as she scrolled through the endless stream of emails, each one a potential crisis waiting to erupt. 

The grand mahogany doors of the elevator chimed, and Imelda instinctively straightened up. Another player was about to enter the arena of Finch & Hawthorne, and it was her job to greet them with the appropriate level of deference, efficiency, and forced cheer. She was the gatekeeper, the first line of defense, the unflappable face of a firm where egos ran rampant and the only thing louder than the ambition was the sound of lawyers screaming into their phones. And today, just like every other day, Imelda Penelope Finch was ready. Or at least, she was going to pretend to be.
