The stale, recycled air of gate B23 clung to Amelia Claire Harrison like a forgotten perfume. She sighed, adjusting the crisp white collar of her Skybound Airlines uniform, a uniform that suddenly felt as heavy and constricting as a lead blanket. Outside the expansive window, the pre-dawn sky was bleeding shades of violet and bruised orange over the tarmac. Another day, another flight, another temporary existence lived somewhere between 30,000 feet and whatever city lay beneath.

Amelia’s stomach grumbled, a familiar complaint she’d learned to ignore during early morning layovers in dreary airport terminals. She ran a hand through her perpetually neat, dark brown hair, catching a glimpse of her reflection in the window. The red lipstick, meticulously applied just an hour ago, already seemed to be losing the battle against fatigue.

She was standing in the bustling, yet strangely sterile, terminal of Denver International Airport, or DIA as everyone lazily called it. The high-pitched whir of luggage carts and the muffled announcements echoing through the cavernous space filled her with a strange, almost unsettling calmness. It was a calmness born of routine, of knowing every beep, whir, and robotic voice that would punctuate the next several hours of her life. It was a calmness that allowed her to function on autopilot while her thoughts, unlike the flight she was about to board, wandered aimlessly. Today, however, they seemed particularly determined to dwell on everything *but* safety demonstrations and beverage service.
