Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named:

**Character:** Franklin Theodore "Frank" Davies

**Setting:** The story opens on a particularly bleak stretch of Interstate 80 in western Wyoming, about 20 miles east of Rock Springs. The time is late October, nearing dusk.

**Story Opening:**

The wind howled like a banshee, clawing at Franklin Theodore "Frank" Davies’ orange safety vest. He hunched deeper into the collar of his worn Carhartt jacket, the biting wind already seeping through the thick canvas. Damn Wyoming wind. It’d chew through bone if given the chance. Frank shivered, though it wasn't just the cold. There was something unsettling about this stretch of I-80, even for a man who’d spent the last twenty years patching its cracked asphalt arteries.

He leaned against the back of his battered Ford F-250, its amber lights flashing a lonely rhythm against the darkening sky. The setting sun, a pale smear of orange and grey on the horizon, did little to combat the encroaching gloom. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, picking up tumbleweeds and sending them rattling across the highway like skeletal refugees.

Frank took a long swig from his thermos, the lukewarm coffee offering a meager comfort. They’d been out here all day, filling potholes, a tedious dance of shovels, hot mix, and the constant roar of passing semis. But today, the usual numbness of repetitive labor hadn’t set in. Today, a prickling unease had clung to him like the dust coating his work boots. Maybe it was the sheer emptiness of the landscape, the endless sagebrush stretching out to meet the bruised sky. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something else entirely. Something about the way the wind whispered secrets only the dead could understand. He just couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn’t alone out here.
