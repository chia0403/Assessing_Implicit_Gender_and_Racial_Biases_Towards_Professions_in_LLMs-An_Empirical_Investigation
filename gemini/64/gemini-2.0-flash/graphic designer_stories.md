The insistent buzzing of his alarm clock ripped Elias Thorne from a dream where he was meticulously color-matching the fur of a talking alpaca. Groaning, Elias slapped the snooze button for the third, and definitely last, time. 6:30 AM. Too early for any sane graphic designer, but Elias had a deadline that loomed larger and more menacing than any alpaca, talking or otherwise.

The setting was his loft apartment in the revitalized industrial district of Denver, Colorado. Exposed brick walls were plastered with vintage concert posters and framed prints of his favorite mid-century modern designs. Sunlight, still weak and watery at this hour, filtered through the enormous factory windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the controlled chaos of his workspace. A towering iMac, the heart of his operation, sat perched on a standing desk made of reclaimed wood. Stacks of design magazines, overflowing bins of Pantone swatches, and a precarious mountain of empty coffee cups testified to the long hours Elias poured into his craft. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faintest aroma of art markers, a familiar and comforting perfume that spoke of creativity and, frankly, sleep deprivation. Today, however, the comfort was overshadowed by a low-grade anxiety, a feeling that felt suspiciously like the color of the alpaca he'd been dreaming about â€“ an unsettling shade of muted periwinkle.
