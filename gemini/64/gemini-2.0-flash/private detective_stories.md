Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our private detective:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering neon sign of "Dimitri's Delights," a diner notorious for its questionable health code violations and even more questionable clientele, cast a greasy sheen across the rain-slicked street.  Detective Beatrice "Bea" Bellweather tugged the collar of her trench coat higher, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into her bones along with the general air of desperation that clung to Oakhaven like a persistent cough. Sheâ€™d been staking out this place for three nights, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the stubborn conviction that something rotten was brewing inside, something even more noxious than Dimitri's "mystery meat" special. Tonight, she felt it in her gut. Tonight, the rot was about to surface.

A figure, shrouded in shadow, emerged from the diner. Bea squinted, the rain distorting the already poor visibility.  He moved with a furtive haste, a tell-tale sign of guilt or panic, clutching a battered briefcase to his chest as if it contained the secrets to the universe. Bea started the engine of her beat-up Ford Taurus, the engine coughing to life with the reluctance of an aging baritone hitting a high note.  "Time to play follow the leader," she muttered to herself, a grim smile playing on her lips. This was her element: the murky underbelly of Oakhaven, where the truth hid in the shadows and the whispers were louder than the screams.

**Setting:**

Oakhaven, Massachusetts: A faded industrial town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic. Once a bustling center for textile mills, Oakhaven has fallen on hard times.  Empty factories loom like skeletal giants on the outskirts, their darkened windows reflecting the town's general malaise. The downtown area is a patchwork of boarded-up storefronts, dive bars, and the occasional brightly-colored new business trying, and often failing, to inject some life into the decaying infrastructure.

The town is perpetually shrouded in a damp fog, a meteorological manifestation of the secrets and lies that fester beneath the surface.  A sense of isolation pervades the atmosphere; Oakhaven feels cut off from the rest of the world, a place where people come to disappear, or where secrets go to die. The wealthier families reside in the older, colonial-era homes on the outskirts, their lives largely untouched by the town's struggles, while the working class scrapes by in the tightly-packed tenements closer to the forgotten factories.
