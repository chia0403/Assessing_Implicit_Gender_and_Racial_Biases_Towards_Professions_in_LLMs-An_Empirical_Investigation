The humid air hung thick and heavy, scented with frangipani and a hint of the exhaust fumes that perpetually clung to the arteries of Ubud, Bali. Inside "Serenity Oasis," however, the air was cool, filtered, and fragrant with the earthy scent of sandalwood. Sunlight, carefully diffused through bamboo blinds, painted stripes of gold across the smooth, cool concrete floor. The soft plink of a gamelan melody drifted from unseen speakers, weaving its way into the rhythmic swishing of the ceiling fan. This was **Eleanor Grace Ainsworth's** sanctuary, the place she built to escape the anxieties of the world, and, she hoped, a place to help others do the same.

Eleanor smoothed down the crisp white sheet on her massage table, her hands moving with the practiced ease of a seasoned professional. Outside, the chaotic energy of Ubud thrummed; inside, she cultivated stillness. She inhaled deeply, letting the sandalwood calm her own nervous system. Her first client of the day, a frazzled businessman from Singapore, was due in five minutes, and Eleanor needed to be perfectly present, a conduit for healing hands.
