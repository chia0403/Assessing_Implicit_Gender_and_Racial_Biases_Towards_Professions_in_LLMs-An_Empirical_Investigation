The setting was Oakhaven Valley, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a perpetual fragrance that clung to everything like a second skin. The valley floor, a patchwork quilt of fields and forests, climbed steadily up towards the craggy, blue-tinged peaks that ringed it in. Oakhaven was a place where time moved a little slower, measured by the changing of the seasons and the turning of the soil. Life was hard, but honest, and deeply intertwined with the land.

Dust motes danced in the slivers of morning sunlight piercing the gloom of the barn. Outside, the rooster's crow was already fading, swallowed by the rustling leaves of the ancient oak that gave the valley, and its largest farm, its name. Inside, Jedediah Elijah Hawthorne was milking Bess, his most placid and dependable cow. The rhythmic squelch of the milk hitting the bottom of the pail was a comforting sound, a familiar punctuation mark in the silent symphony of the awakening farm. Jedediah was a man built of the same sturdy stock as the mountains themselves. His hands, calloused and weathered, moved with practiced ease, his brow furrowed even in his sleep. He was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes about his dedication to the land and the legacy he was trying to uphold. Today, that legacy felt heavier than usual.
