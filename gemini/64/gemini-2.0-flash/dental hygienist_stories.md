## Story Opening:

The shrill whir of the Cavitron scaler was a persistent, unwelcome guest in Abigail Mae Hawthorne's ears. It always was, even after ten years of wrangling tartar and polishing pearly whites. But today, the metallic shriek felt more like a personal affront, a soundtrack to the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in her chest. 

Abigail leaned closer, her focus laser-sharp on the stubborn stain clinging to Mrs. Gable's lower incisors. Mrs. Gable, bless her heart, was busy attempting to whistle along to the Muzak version of "Dancing Queen," the sound muffled by the saliva ejector in her mouth. Abigail suppressed a sigh, forcing a professional smile to play on her lips. "Almost there, Mrs. Gable. Just a little bit more sparkle and shine."

This morning had started like any other: oatmeal with blueberries, a brisk walk with her miniature poodle, Winston, and a mental pep talk about staying positive. But then, nestled amongst the usual junk mail, had been the creamy, off-white envelope with the stark black return address: "Hawthorne & Son, Attorneys at Law." An envelope that whispered promises of family secrets and the unraveling of a life she thought she knew. And now, the Cavitron sounded positively malevolent.

## Setting:

Abigail works at "The Gentle Smile Dental Clinic," a small, well-established practice in the quaint, coastal town of Havenwood, Maine. The clinic is located in a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful shade of robin's egg blue with white trim. Inside, the waiting room is cozy and welcoming, filled with plush armchairs, stacks of magazines, and the comforting aroma of cinnamon air freshener (a detail Abigail insisted on to combat the sterile smell of dental products). 

The treatment rooms are meticulously clean and organized, each equipped with state-of-the-art dental equipment. Abigail's personal space is a sanctuary of calm amidst the clinical environment. She has a small collection of succulents on the windowsill, overlooking the harbor, and a framed watercolor painting of a lighthouse, a constant reminder of the peace and stability she craves. Despite its comforting facade, the Gentle Smile Dental Clinic can sometimes feel like a gilded cage, a place where Abigail meticulously polishes the surfaces of other people's lives while her own feels increasingly dull and unexamined.
