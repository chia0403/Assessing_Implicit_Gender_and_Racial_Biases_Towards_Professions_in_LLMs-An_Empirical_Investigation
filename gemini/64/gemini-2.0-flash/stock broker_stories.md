## Opening:

The seventh dial of the phone hadn't even begun to ring when Abigail Eleanor Sterling snatched it up, the movement a practiced ballet of anxiety and purpose. "Sterling," she barked into the receiver, the single word sharp and clipped like a dropped gavel. Outside, the Manhattan sunrise was attempting a half-hearted performance, choked by the smog and the relentless march of skyscrapers. But Abigail wasn't looking at the view. Her gaze was glued to the flickering green and red numbers dancing across her six computer screens, each a silent scream of potential profit or impending doom.

## Setting:

Abigail's office was a monument to controlled chaos. Located on the 48th floor of the Sterling & Hayes building – a building her great-grandfather had helped finance – it was a glass-walled box overlooking the financial district. Sunlight, when it bothered to visit, reflected off the polished steel desk and the framed photographs lining the back wall: Abigail shaking hands with a former Fed Chair, Abigail accepting an award for "Top Performing Broker," Abigail, younger and less burdened, laughing on a sailboat in the Hamptons.

The desk itself was buried beneath a blizzard of quarterly reports, analyst summaries, and sticky notes covered in cryptic abbreviations. A half-eaten bagel sat in a paper bag next to a lukewarm cup of coffee, both victims of the market's insatiable appetite for her attention. Despite the mess, everything was strategically placed, an intricate system only Abigail understood, allowing her to navigate the labyrinthine information with the speed and precision of a surgeon. The air crackled with a nervous energy, fueled by caffeine and the constant hum of servers processing billions of dollars in transactions. This was her arena, her battleground, and Abigail Eleanor Sterling was ready to fight.
