Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The story opens on a crisp autumn morning at Oakhaven Cemetery, nestled on the outskirts of the quaint, historical town of Havenwood. The cemetery wasn't your typical, neglected graveyard; Oakhaven was meticulously maintained, a haven of serenity and remembrance. Ancient oak trees, their leaves ablaze in hues of crimson and gold, towered over meticulously manicured lawns dotted with weathered, yet elegant, tombstones. Winding gravel paths snaked between the graves, leading to hidden benches and tranquil water features. The air, though tinged with the coming winter, carried the comforting scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. A faint mist clung to the lower ground, giving the entire scene a slightly ethereal quality. Oakhaven wasn't just a place for the dead; it was a sanctuary for the living, a place for reflection and quiet contemplation.

**Opening:**

The rumble of a small, well-worn John Deere lawnmower broke the morning silence. Behind the wheel, bundled in a thick, olive-green work jacket and a faded baseball cap, sat **Elias Theodore Hawthorne**, groundskeeper of Oakhaven for the past twenty-seven years. The chill in the air nipped at his cheeks, turning them a healthy red, but Elias barely noticed. He was in his element. The rhythm of the mower, the crisp scent of freshly cut grass, the peaceful quiet broken only by the chirping of unseen birds - it was a symphony that soothed his soul. As he guided the mower around the aged, granite monument of the Haverford family, his eyes scanned the grounds, a constant assessment of its needs. A rogue leaf here, a slightly uneven patch of grass there. Elias knew every inch of Oakhaven, every root and every stone, as intimately as he knew the lines on his own hands. He treated the cemetery not as a place of death, but as a garden needing constant tending, a sacred space deserving of the utmost respect. This morning, however, something felt… different. A subtle unease, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck, told him that the usual peace of Oakhaven had been somehow disturbed. He just couldn’t place his finger on what it was. Yet.
