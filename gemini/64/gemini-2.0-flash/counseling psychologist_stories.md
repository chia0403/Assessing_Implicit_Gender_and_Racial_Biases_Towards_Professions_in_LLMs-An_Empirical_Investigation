## Story Opening:

The faint scent of Earl Grey clung to the air, a comforting aroma meant to soothe frazzled nerves. Dr. Eleanor Vance, counseling psychologist extraordinaire, straightened the already impeccably aligned succulents on her desk, a nervous tic she was acutely aware of and endlessly frustrated by. Rain lashed against the panoramic window of her office, turning the vibrant cityscape into a blurry watercolor of grey and muted golds. Today, the weather seemed a perfect mirror of the turmoil brewing in the pit of her stomach. Her ten o'clock was about to arrive: Mr. Silas Blackwood, a name that had sent a chill down her spine the moment she’d seen it on the referral form. Blackwood, of Blackwood Industries, a titan of tech, a man rumored to crush competitors with a smile. He wasn't her typical patient, not by a long shot. Eleanor usually worked with students grappling with anxiety and depression, not CEOs battling... whatever demons drove a man like Silas Blackwood to seek a counseling psychologist's help.

## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Vance's Private Practice:** Located on the 37th floor of a sleek, modern skyscraper in downtown Seattle. The office is designed to be a calming sanctuary amidst the urban hustle. The color palette is muted – soft greys, creams, and the occasional pop of muted green from the carefully curated plants. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a breathtaking view of the city, the Puget Sound, and on a clear day, the Olympic Mountains. The furniture is comfortable yet professional: a plush, light grey sofa, two armchairs upholstered in a textured beige fabric, and a solid oak desk that Eleanor inherited from her grandfather, a renowned therapist in his own right. The walls are adorned with abstract art in calming blues and greens, and strategically placed lamps provide soft, indirect lighting. The overall effect is one of quiet sophistication and understated reassurance. Even the insistent drumming of the rain against the glass couldn't entirely dispel the atmosphere of serene tranquility Eleanor strived to cultivate.
