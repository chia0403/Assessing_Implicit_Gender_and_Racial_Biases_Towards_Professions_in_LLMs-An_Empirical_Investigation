## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance adjusted her glasses, the late afternoon sun glinting off the gold frames. She inhaled deeply, the scent of eucalyptus and desperation hanging thick in the air, a familiar aroma in her clinic on Tuesdays. The source of both lay groaning face down on her meticulously cleaned examination table: Mr. Henderson, the retired accountant with a penchant for overly ambitious gardening projects and a back that screamed louder than his prize-winning petunias. "Just breathe, Mr. Henderson," Ellie said, her voice calm and reassuring, "and try to relax your shoulders for me. This won't take long." She felt the knots in his back, tight and stubborn as weeds, and mentally prepared herself for a marathon session. Some days, she felt more like a miracle worker than a chiropractor.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance's practice, "Vance Chiropractic & Wellness," occupied a cozy storefront on Elm Street in the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Elm Street was the heart of Havenwood, a quaint stretch of brick buildings housing everything from Mrs. Higgins' legendary bakery to the perpetually cluttered antique shop owned by a man who claimed to have known Hemingway. Ellie's clinic reflected her own personality: a blend of professionalism and warmth. The waiting room, painted a calming shade of sage green, featured comfortable armchairs, a stack of well-worn magazines (mostly health and wellness related, though Ellie secretly kept a copy of "US Weekly" hidden beneath the couch for her own amusement), and a bubbling water fountain that emitted a soothing melody. The examination rooms were pristine, filled with the latest chiropractic equipment and a surprising amount of natural light that streamed in through large windows overlooking a small, meticulously maintained herb garden Ellie tended herself. It was a place of healing, both physical and mental, a haven within Havenwood where people came to find relief from their aches, pains, and the everyday stresses of life.
