The hum of the salon was a familiar lullaby to Seraphina Marie Dubois. It was a comforting blend of the whirring of hairdryers, the chatter of stylists, and the gentle spray of hairspray, all underscored by the rhythmic click of Seraphina's scissors. Her salon, "The Gilded Lily," was her haven, a sun-drenched space in the heart of Charleston's French Quarter, all exposed brick and wrought-iron accents. Lavender walls were adorned with framed vintage beauty advertisements, and the air perpetually smelled of jasmine and sweet almond oil.

Today, however, the usual calm was tinged with a palpable tension. Hurricane Helena was barreling towards the coast, promising a deluge and winds that would make the palmetto trees bend double. Seraphina, a woman with honey-colored skin, long, raven braids usually styled with artful nonchalance, and the steady hands of a sculptor, usually thrived on the pressure of a Saturday appointment book overflowing with socialites prepping for galas. But today, her mind was racing with more than just the perfect balayage or updo. She had promised her grandmother, Nana Celeste, that they would evacuate to Atlanta. Yet, looking out at the darkening sky and feeling the first gusts of wind rattle the windows, Seraphina couldn't shake the feeling that leaving Charleston, leaving her beloved salon, felt like abandoning a part of herself.
