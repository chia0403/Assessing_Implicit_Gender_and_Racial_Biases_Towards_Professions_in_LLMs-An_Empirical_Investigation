The insistent buzz of the alarm yanked Harold Fitzwilliam Pemberton from a dream about competitive pickle jar opening. He slapped the snooze button, a practiced maneuver honed over years of mornings he didn't want to face, and groaned. 6:15 AM. Just enough time to shower, choke down a stale bagel, and arrive at Pemberton & Sons Insurance Agency, a business his grandfather had started and a legacy Harold was, to put it mildly, ambivalent about upholding.

The setting was Milbridge, Maine, a small town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic. Salt-laced air perpetually kissed the clapboard houses and the scent of lobster hung heavy in the air. Milbridge was picturesque, undeniably charming, and about as exciting as watching paint dry. Harold often joked (though only to himself) that the town’s biggest excitement was Mrs. Higgins' annual pumpkin growing competition, a spectacle that, ironically, required very little insurance coverage. Pemberton & Sons, a squat, two-story brick building wedged between the hardware store and the bakery, was a monument to quiet, dependable service. Inside, oak desks sat beneath flickering fluorescent lights, and the air was thick with the scent of old paper and the faint, lingering aroma of Harold’s grandfather’s pipe tobacco. Framed black and white photos lined the walls: Harold’s grandfather, a stern-faced man with a handlebar mustache; his father, perpetually smiling in a slightly unnerving way; and a much younger, thinner Harold, looking profoundly uncomfortable in a suit that was at least two sizes too big. Today, like every other day, Harold Fitzwilliam Pemberton would arrive at 8:00 AM sharp, ready to protect the good people of Milbridge from the unexpected – hurricanes (rare), fender benders (common), and the occasional lobster pot mishap (surprisingly frequent). And secretly, Harold would dream of a life far, far away from insurance policies and competitive pickle jar opening.
