Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist:

**Opening:**

The sickly sweet scent of acetone and artificial cherry, usually a comforting balm to Clementine "Clem" Magnolia Bloom, today felt like a cloying shroud. She stared at the meticulously arranged bottles of OPI and Essie, the rainbow of polishes mocking her with their cheerful hues. Outside, a Seattle drizzle painted the world in shades of grey, mirroring the swirling storm inside her head. Mrs. Henderson, bless her heart, was currently regaling her with the virtues of prune juice for regularity, but Clem barely registered the words. All she knew was that the urge to throw the entire contents of her workstation across the room was becoming overwhelminglyâ€¦ *irresistible*. And Clem knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that if she didn't find a way to channel this chaotic energy, things were about to get very, *very* interesting.

**Setting:**

The story is set in "The Gilded Lily Nail Spa," a small but meticulously maintained nail salon located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The salon reflects Clementine's personality: it's vibrant and slightly eccentric, with walls painted a warm, inviting lavender. Mismatched antique furniture, reupholstered in plush velvet fabrics, serves as waiting area seating. Tiny succulents in vintage teacups are scattered throughout the space, adding a touch of bohemian charm. Sunlight, when it dares to peek through the Seattle clouds, streams through the large, street-facing windows, illuminating the glittering displays of nail art and the rows upon rows of colorful polishes. While the Gilded Lily caters to a discerning clientele who appreciate quality and creativity, Clem has also fostered a sense of community and belonging. Regulars come not only for the perfect manicure but also for a listening ear and a dose of Clem's unique brand of quirky optimism. The sounds of jazz music, softly playing in the background, and the gentle hum of the ventilation system create a surprisingly relaxing atmosphere, a stark contrast to the inner turmoil that sometimes brews beneath the surface.
