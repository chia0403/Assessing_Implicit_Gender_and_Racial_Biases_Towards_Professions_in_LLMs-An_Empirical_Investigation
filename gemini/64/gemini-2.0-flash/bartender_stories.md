The thick scent of stale beer and desperation clung to The Rusty Mug like a second skin. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside the bar and, truth be told, inside the man polishing glasses behind the counter. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch knew every ripple of discontent that washed through this place, every unspoken regret that lingered in the smoke-filled air. He'd heard it all, served it all, and probably forgotten more than most people remembered in a lifetime.

The Rusty Mug was a dive, pure and simple. Located on the wrong side of the tracks in Port Seraphina, a city perpetually draped in a melancholic grey, it catered to the working class, the heartbroken, and the generally down-on-their-luck. Neon signs flickered erratically outside, promising cold beer and companionship, though Bart knew the latter was often delivered with a generous helping of cynicism. Inside, the vinyl booths were ripped and patched, the pool table perpetually tilted, and the jukebox stubbornly refused to play anything recorded after 1987. But it was home. At least, it was Bart's home, for now.

Port Seraphina itself was a city clinging to its industrial past, a past that was quickly fading like a cheap photograph left in the sun. The docks, once bustling with activity, were now mostly empty, haunted by the ghosts of sailors and longshoremen who had sought their fortunes here. The air smelled of salt, rust, and a general sense of decay, a fitting backdrop for Bart's own quiet disillusionment. Tonight, however, there was a different kind of tension in the air, a low hum beneath the usual cacophony of drunken chatter and clinking glasses, and Bart Finch had a feeling it wasn't just the weather. Something was brewing. Something darker than the black coffee he brewed every morning to try and stave off the inevitable hangover. And he, unfortunately, had a feeling he was about to be right in the thick of it.
