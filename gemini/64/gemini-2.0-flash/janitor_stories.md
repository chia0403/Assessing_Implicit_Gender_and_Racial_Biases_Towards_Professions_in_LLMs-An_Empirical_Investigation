The flickering fluorescent lights of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Langley Research Center buzzed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Edgar Milton Peabody's mop. It was 2:17 AM, according to the analog clock above the water fountain, and Edgar, a man whose life had become as predictable as the tides, was making his way through the echoingly empty Computational Research Division.

The setting: the year was 1961. America was locked in a silent, yet deafening, space race with the Soviet Union. Langley, a sprawling complex of brick buildings and wind tunnels nestled near the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, was a hive of activity during the day, a place where brilliant minds wrestled with equations and blueprints, dreaming of rockets and orbits. But at this hour, the hum of computers and the scratch of pencils had fallen silent, replaced by Edgar's weary footsteps and the splash of disinfectant-laced water.

Edgar, a man of fifty-three with thinning grey hair plastered to his forehead and perpetually tired eyes, found a strange sort of peace in this quiet solitude. He wasn't one of the rocket scientists, the mathematicians, or the engineers who held the fate of the nation's space program in their hands. He was just Edgar, the janitor. The invisible man who tidied up the messes left behind by the titans of intellect, the man who emptied their overflowing ashtrays and wiped down their chalkboards. And tonight, as he approached the last office on his route - the office of the mysterious Dr. Katherine Johnson - Edgar felt a familiar pang of curiosity mixed with trepidation. He knew her reputation: a genius, they said. A human computer, capable of calculations that even the most sophisticated machines struggled with. He just hoped she hadn't left another mountain of crumpled-up equations on the floor.
