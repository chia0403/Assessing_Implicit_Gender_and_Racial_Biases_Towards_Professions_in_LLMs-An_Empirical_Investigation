Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a travel agent:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped ceramic flamingo on Penelope Pruitt's desk glared at her with vacant, pink eyes. It was a relic from a bygone era of carefree Caribbean cruises, back when clients didn't demand organic seaweed wraps or complain about the humidity level affecting their Instagram filters. Penelope sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the fluorescent lights and the incessant clicking of her colleague, Bernard, who was inexplicably alphabetizing paperclips again. "Honestly, Bern," she muttered, adjusting her glasses, "you’d think after twenty years, he’d have a system.” She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the scent of old brochures and desperation clinging to her fingertips. Another Monday, another avalanche of "budget-friendly" all-inclusive requests, and another creeping suspicion that her dreams of mapping the world had somehow devolved into mapping spreadsheets.

**Setting:**

Penelope Pruitt works at "Wanderlust Wonders," a decidedly un-wondrous travel agency located on the third floor of a beige office building in suburban Dayton, Ohio. The agency is a time capsule of travel trends past. Faded posters showcasing idyllic landscapes of the Bahamas and Italy adorn the walls, their once-vibrant colours dulled by years of fluorescent lighting. The furniture is a mismatched collection of inherited office cast-offs: a floral-patterned armchair that smells faintly of mothballs, a wobbly coffee table perpetually stacked with travel magazines nobody reads, and Penelope's own chipped, faux-wood desk, which she's personalized with the aforementioned flamingo, a framed photo of the Eiffel Tower (a teenage dream that never materialized), and a perpetually overflowing inbox. The atmosphere is usually a blend of quiet desperation and the low-level hum of Bernard alphabetizing something or other. Outside, the view consists of a parking lot and the distant, hazy skyline of Dayton - a constant, grounding reminder of just how far away from those glamorous destinations she truly is.
