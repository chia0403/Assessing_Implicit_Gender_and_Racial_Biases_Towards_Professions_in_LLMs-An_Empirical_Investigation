The scent of pine and sawdust hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything in Elias Thorne's small workshop. He preferred it to the smell of honeysuckle that drifted from Mrs. Gable's overflowing garden next door. Honeysuckle was sweet and delicate; sawdust was honest, a testament to the hard work done within these four walls. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, each a tiny star in Elias's personal galaxy.

Elias Thorne, a man whose hands knew the language of wood better than his tongue knew polite conversation, ran a calloused thumb along the smooth edge of a walnut plank. The wood was destined to become a rocking horse for young Timothy Higgins, a commission that paid barely enough to cover materials but that Elias had accepted with a quiet satisfaction. Money wasn't everything. He found a certain peace in transforming raw materials into something beautiful, something lasting. His workshop, nestled behind his modest brick house on the quiet end of Willow Creek's Main Street, was his sanctuary, a haven from the world and its demands. Inside, the rhythmic rasp of the saw and the satisfying thud of the mallet were the only sounds that truly mattered.
