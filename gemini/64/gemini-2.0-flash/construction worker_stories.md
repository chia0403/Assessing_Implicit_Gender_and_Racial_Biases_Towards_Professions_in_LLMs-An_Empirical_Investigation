The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal framework of the forty-story skyscraper, whistling through the exposed steel beams like a mournful harmonica. Dust devils danced across the concrete pour on the unfinished thirty-fifth floor, stinging the eyes and chapping the skin. This was the kind of day that made a man question his life choices, the kind of day that reminded even the most seasoned ironworker of just how high they were.

Dominic "Dom" Anthony Rizzo, burly and built like a Roman statue carved from granite, squinted against the wind, pulling his worn-out Carhartt jacket tighter around him. He ran a calloused hand over his stubbled chin, feeling the roughness of the day mirrored on his face. He was perched precariously on a beam no wider than his two feet, welding a joint that was crucial to the building's structural integrity. Sweat mingled with the grit on his brow, and the acrid smell of molten metal filled the air, momentarily overpowering the stench of exhaust fumes rising from the chaotic city below.

Dom loved the skyline, he loved the feeling of building something that would stand for generations, but some days, like today, the city felt less like a canvas of ambition and more like a cold, hard reminder of how small he was against its sprawling immensity. Today, Dominic Anthony Rizzo was just a man, high above the world, battling the wind, the cold, and the nagging doubt that he should've just stayed in bed.
