The biting wind howled a mournful tune against the aluminum skin of the hangar, a sound that mirrored the hollow ache in Amelia Esperanza Rodriguez's chest. The stark Alaskan landscape, a monotonous tapestry of snow-laden spruce and frozen tundra stretching to the horizon, offered little comfort. Sunlight, a rare and precious commodity in this corner of the world, painted the scene in a weak, pastel blue, doing little to chase away the encroaching shadows.

Amelia stood hunched over a steaming mug of weak, instant coffee, the chipped ceramic warming her gloved hands. The scent of kerosene and old leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar and usually comforting aroma that felt stale and suffocating today. She was waiting. Waiting for the call that might never come, the call that would drag her back into the sky, back into the biting cold, back into the precarious dance with gravity she both loved and feared.

Her plane, a beat-up de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver affectionately (or perhaps sarcastically) nicknamed 'The Flying Burrito', sat outside, its pontoons glinting dully under the pallid light. It was as dependable as it was ugly, and Amelia knew every inch of its worn frame. She was responsible for delivering supplies, and sometimes, people, to the remote villages scattered across the vast wilderness. It was a life of isolation, of inherent risk, and lately, of a gnawing sense of unease she couldn't quite shake. Today, the silence felt heavier than usual, a pregnant stillness that hinted at something brewing beyond the next mountain range. And Amelia, usually so adept at reading the skies, couldn't quite decipher what it was.
