The morning dew clung to the steel hides of the bulldozers, making them look like sleeping beasts. Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew Johnson, Jr., wiped the moisture from his brow, the chill seeping deep into his bones despite the thick flannel shirt he wore under his Carhartt jacket. The sun, a bleary eye peering over the distant peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains, painted the sky in shades of bruised purple and hesitant pink.

Teddy was on the crest of a hill overlooking what would one day be "The Estates at Shadow Creek," a sprawling development of McMansions that promised "luxury living" and "breathtaking views." Right now, though, it was just a scarred landscape of raw earth, churned up by months of relentless digging and grading. The air hung thick with the scent of diesel and damp soil.

His domain, a behemoth Komatsu D375A-8 bulldozer affectionately (and ironically) nicknamed "Buttercup," sat idling patiently. Its massive blade, capable of moving tons of earth in a single push, gleamed dully in the nascent light. This was Teddy's canvas, his instrument, and he, Theodore Bartholomew Johnson, Jr., was the artist, sculpting the land to fit someone else's vision. He sighed, the steam from his breath momentarily clouding the air. Today was going to be another long one. He could already feel the ache in his lower back starting to whisper its complaints.
