## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the outpatient clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Beatrice "Bea" Bellwether's day. It wasn't an unpleasant hum, not exactly, more like a low-grade annoyance that faded into the background after the first hour. At least, that's what she told herself. Today, though, the hum seemed amplified, resonating within her temples like a miniature jackhammer.

Bea sighed, tightening the tourniquet around Mrs. Higgins’ arm, a small, pale limb crisscrossed with blue veins like a topographical map. “Alright, Mrs. Higgins, deep breaths. This will just pinch a little.”

Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, gripped the armrest of the phlebotomy chair with the strength of a woman half her age. “Just get it over with, dear. I can't stand the sight of needles. Makes my stomach churn.”

Bea gave her a reassuring smile, her internal monologue a contradictory mess. *I hate needles too, Mrs. Higgins. I just hide it better.* She prepped the site with alcohol, the familiar scent momentarily eclipsing the scent of antiseptic cleaner that perpetually hung in the air. Years of practice made her movements precise and efficient, but the thought of puncturing skin, of drawing blood, still sent a shiver of unease down her spine. She’d chosen this career to help people, to contribute to their well-being. But some days, especially days like today, it felt like she was just a glorified vampire, siphoning life from unsuspecting mortals.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the **Hilltop Medical Center**, a relatively small, but well-maintained outpatient clinic on the outskirts of **Asheville, North Carolina**. The clinic is nestled amongst rolling hills, offering glimpses of the Blue Ridge Mountains from its large, picture windows, a scenic distraction that's often lost on the patients who are more focused on their aches, pains, and impending medical bills.

Bea works primarily in the phlebotomy lab, a small, sterile room dominated by three comfortable-looking phlebotomy chairs. A large, stainless steel cart holds her supplies: needles of varying sizes, tubes color-coded for different tests, alcohol swabs, bandages, and tourniquets. The walls are painted a calming shade of light green, adorned with anatomical charts and posters reminding patients of proper hand-washing techniques.

Beyond the phlebotomy lab lies the reception area, bustling with activity as patients check in and out. The air is thick with the murmur of conversations, the beeping of medical equipment, and the ever-present aroma of coffee from the breakroom down the hall. Hilltop Medical Center isn't glamorous, but it's a vital part of the community, a place where people come seeking answers and, hopefully, healing. And Bea Bellwether, phlebotomist extraordinaire, is a small but crucial cog in that machine.
