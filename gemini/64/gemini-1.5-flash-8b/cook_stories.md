The aroma of thyme, rosemary, and something faintly sweet, like burnt sugar, hung heavy in the air of the "Whispering Pines" inn, clinging to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun.  Amelia Josephine "Amy"  Ashworth, a cook with hands that moved like water sculpted by wind, stirred a bubbling pot of pheasant stew.  Tiny, spattering droplets of the savory broth kissed the rim of the copper pot, leaving a glistening sheen.  The inn, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Blackwood Forest, was a haven for weary travelers and local villagers alike.  Its warmth emanated not just from the crackling hearth fire, but from the comforting, inviting smells that Amy's kitchen exuded. Today, however, a different kind of scent, sharp and acrid, mingled with the familiar herbs.  A distinct smell of pine needles, smouldering and unfamiliar.  Something wasn't right.  The rhythmic chirp of the crickets was muted, their song replaced by an unsettling silence.  The only sound in the kitchen came from the steady, almost hypnotic, rhythm of Amy's spoon stirring the stew. But something else was stirring within her too, a growing unease that tightened its grip with each passing moment.
