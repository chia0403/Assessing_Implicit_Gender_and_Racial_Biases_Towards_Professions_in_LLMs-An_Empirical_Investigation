The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper against the steel-plated ramparts of the Citadel, clawed at Seraphina Blackwood's exposed skin.  The year was 1472 of the Sunstone Cycle.  A perpetual twilight, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, clung to the jagged, volcanic coastline that formed the Citadel's perimeter.  Towering obsidian cliffs, sculpted by eons of volcanic fury, dominated the horizon, their summits disappearing into the swirling, leaden clouds.  The Citadel itself, a fortress of polished, grey obsidian, pierced the gloom like a skeletal hand clawing at the sky.  Seraphina, a Third-Rank Guard, stood sentinel at the western gate, her breath misting in the frigid air. Her weathered leather jerkin, patched and reinforced, offered little protection against the raw power of the wind.  A single, flickering torch, mounted high on the gate, cast long, dancing shadows across the desolate landscape, highlighting the intricate carvings that adorned the obsidian walls.  Within, the echoes of the Citadel’s intricate mechanisms – whispering gears and groaning hinges – filled the night.  The silence outside was a constant, ominous presence.  Her duty was simple: maintain the gate.
