The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Carpathian Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the chipped stones in his worn leather satchel.  Below, the village of Valea nestled like a cluster of sleeping sheep in the valley, its low stone houses barely visible in the swirling grey mist.  Elias, a stone cutter with hands hardened to the texture of ancient granite and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand sunsets, hunched deeper into his thick wool cloak.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the distant, mournful cry of a lone raven.

The village, Valea, was a place of ancient traditions and unyielding stone.  Its streets, narrow and winding, were paved with flagstones worn smooth by centuries of footfalls.  The villagers, with their faces etched with the stories of the mountains, lived a life of quiet resilience, their existence intertwined with the very rock that surrounded them. Elias, however, felt a disconnect. He was a craftsman of stone, yes, but he yearned for something more, something beyond the repetitive cycle of carving and shaping. A longing that echoed in the hollow spaces within the mountains themselves.
