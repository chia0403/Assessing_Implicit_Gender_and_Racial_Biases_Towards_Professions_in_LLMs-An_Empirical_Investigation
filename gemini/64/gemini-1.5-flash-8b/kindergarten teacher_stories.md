The chipped paint of the Miss Emily's Kindergarten classroom, a faded shade of periwinkle, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves of the ancient oak outside, dappled the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating a constellation of colourful drawings: a sun with too many eyes, a house with a crooked chimney, and a majestic giraffe with a suspiciously short neck.  Inside, amidst the gentle hum of children's chatter and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of a bouncy ball, stood  Miss  Amelia  Juniper, a kindergarten teacher whose auburn hair, usually pulled back in a neat bun, was now escaping in wild tendrils around her face.  The aroma of cinnamon and something vaguely sweet, almost floral, hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent, a comforting reminder of the day's activities:  apple-cinnamon bread for snacktime, and the impending bedtime story of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar."  But today, the familiar hum of the classroom feltâ€¦off.  Something was stirring beneath the surface, a feeling as elusive as the flitting butterfly that had just landed on a stack of colourful blocks, its wings a flash of emerald and sapphire.
