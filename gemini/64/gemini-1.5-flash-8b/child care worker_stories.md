The chipped paint of the "Little Lambs Daycare" sign creaked in the biting October wind, a mournful sound mirroring the low hum of activity within.  Inside, Amelia Rose Butterfield, a young woman with eyes the colour of melted chocolate and a perpetually tired smile, meticulously wiped down the high chairs.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the brightly coloured playroom.  The scent of crayons and stale milk hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony of a busy morning.  Amelia, though, felt a prickle of unease, a tiny tremor in the quiet hum that usually accompanied her days at Little Lambs.  Today, something feltâ€¦off.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, anticipating.  Outside, the wind howled a dirge against the windows, a sound that seemed to seep into the very soul of the room.
