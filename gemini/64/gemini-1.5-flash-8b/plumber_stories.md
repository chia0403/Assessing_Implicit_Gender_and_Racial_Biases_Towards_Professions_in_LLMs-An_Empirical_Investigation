The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of neglected lemon peels and forgotten spills, gurgled a mournful symphony.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle tenement building, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's chest.  Barty, a plumber with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand leaky pipes, stared at the overflowing sink.  He knew this one.  This was the apartment of Mrs. Periwinkle, the cantankerous old spinster who had a peculiar habit of hoarding vintage teacups and, more recently, a disconcerting number of questionable-looking potted ferns.  Each leak, each repair, felt like a personal assault on her meticulously organized, yet undeniably chaotic, world.

The setting was the dilapidated, rain-slicked streets of  Oldport, a city clinging precariously to the edge of a forgotten industrial past.  Cobblestone streets, riddled with potholes that swallowed fallen leaves and stray refuse, snaked through the heart of the city.  The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth and the acrid tang of nearby factories.  Gas lamps, flickering precariously, cast long, dancing shadows across the grimy alleyways.  The whole city seemed to be held captive under a perpetual twilight, a mood mirrored in the gloominess that permeated Mrs. Periwinkle's apartment.
