The fluorescent hum of the showroom buzzed, a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Rows of gleaming, polished appliances lined the walls, their sleek surfaces reflecting the harsh, overhead lights and Amelia's own anxious sweat.  Today was the "Mega-Sale," the culmination of weeks of pressure-cooker training sessions and meticulously crafted sales pitches.  The air hung thick with the scent of freshly baked cookies, a marketing ploy designed to lull customers into a false sense of comfort while Amelia felt like she was on a tightrope stretched precariously over a chasm of unpaid bills and unmet expectations.  This was the "Kitchen of Dreams" showroom, a monument to culinary aspirations and, in Amelia's case, a potential crucible of financial salvation.  Amelia, twenty-seven, with a cascade of dark, shoulder-length hair and eyes the colour of melted chocolate, adjusted her crisp, navy blazer. She'd promised herself she wouldn't crack under the pressure, but the quiet, expectant murmurs of potential clients felt like the first tremors of an approaching earthquake.
