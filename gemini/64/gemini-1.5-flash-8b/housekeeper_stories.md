The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey from years of neglected cleaning, reflected the flickering gaslight illuminating the cramped kitchen.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating a cobweb draped precariously over a chipped teacup, almost as if mocking Amelia Peabody, the housekeeper.  Amelia, a woman etched with the quiet strength of a weathered oak, sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous silence of the sprawling Blackwood Manor.  The scent of aged mahogany and something faintly, almost unpleasantly, sweet hung heavy in the air, a scent that clung to everything in this house, even her own breath.

The manor, a gothic behemoth perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the town of Ashbury, was a monument to a bygone era.  Towering turrets pierced the bruised twilight sky, their pointed roofs catching the last rays of the setting sun, casting long, skeletal shadows across the sprawling gardens.  Ivy, thick and tenacious, clawed its way up the stone walls, its emerald green leaves a stark contrast to the looming darkness of the aged brick.  Each creak of the ancient timbers, each rustle of the wind whispering through the branches, seemed to echo Amelia's own quiet, unease.  This was her domain, and tonight, it felt more claustrophobic than comforting.
