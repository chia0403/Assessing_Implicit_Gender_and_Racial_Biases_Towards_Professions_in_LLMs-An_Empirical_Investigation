The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual blush pink from decades of spilled dyes and the occasional rogue hairball, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of the "Shear Genius" salon.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.  This was Amelia "Amy"  Featherstone's domain, a space that, while undeniably cluttered and slightly melancholic, held a secret magic all its own.  Amy, a woman whose hands, though calloused from years of wielding scissors and combs, still held a surprising grace, meticulously trimmed the unruly ends of a client's thick, raven black hair.  The client, a nervous young woman named Elara, fidgeted in her chair, her gaze darting between the swirling strands of her own hair and the frantic rhythms of the city that echoed through the thin walls of the salon.  Outside, the relentless pulse of a nearby subway thrummed.  The year was 1989.
