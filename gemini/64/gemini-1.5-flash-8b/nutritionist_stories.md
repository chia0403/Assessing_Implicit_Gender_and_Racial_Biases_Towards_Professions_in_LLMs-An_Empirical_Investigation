The biting wind whipped Amelia Josephine Thorne's hair across her face as she adjusted the strap of her worn leather messenger bag.  The aroma of pine needles and damp earth, usually invigorating, felt heavy, almost oppressive, in the crisp November air.  She shivered, not just from the cold, but from a growing unease that clung to her like the clinging mist swirling around the ancient oaks bordering the secluded Blackwood Valley.  This wasn't the vibrant, sun-drenched Tuscan countryside she’d envisioned for her nutrition consultancy retreat.  This was… different.  The valley, nestled deep within the shadow of the Whispering Peaks, felt oddly watchful, as if the very trees themselves held their breath, waiting.

Amelia, a nutritionist with a gentle demeanor and a passion for holistic well-being, had chosen this secluded valley for a much-needed retreat.  The intention was to reconnect with nature, to curate a space for innovative culinary experiments, and to guide a small group of clients toward sustainable, plant-forward dietary habits.  But something felt profoundly amiss. The air vibrated with an unspoken tension, a palpable sense of something...lost.  Local whispers spoke of a forgotten legend, a curse tied to the valley's very soil, and an ancient prophecy about a healer who would restore balance.  Amelia, however, was more concerned with the unsettling change in her clients' appetites.  They were eating less, much less, and their energy levels were dropping precipitously. This was certainly not part of her plan.
