The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's threadbare jacket around her, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the overgrown expanse of the Blackwood Estate.  Twisted branches of ancient oaks, gnarled and skeletal against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the bruised grey of the overcast heavens.  Fallen leaves, thick as a carpet, crunched under her worn boots, a symphony of muted rustles accompanying the mournful cry of a lone crow circling high above.  Amelia, a groundskeeper for the Blackwood family for twenty-two years, adjusted her spectacles, the lenses fogging with her breath. This wasn't the meticulously manicured paradise she'd been accustomed to.  This was neglect.  A chilling, deliberate neglect, and a silence that felt heavy as the impending winter.  The once proud Blackwood Estate, a testament to generations of wealth and power, now whispered secrets of decay. She pulled her thick wool gloves tighter, the air growing colder with each passing moment.  This was the beginning of her investigation.  A journey that would lead her not only through the overgrown gardens, but potentially into the darkest corners of the Blackwood family's past.
