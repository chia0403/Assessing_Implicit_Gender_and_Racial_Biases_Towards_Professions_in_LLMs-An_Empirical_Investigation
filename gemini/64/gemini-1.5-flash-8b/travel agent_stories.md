The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Sunshine"  Stone's hands, a faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, fractured into a thousand prisms on the dust motes dancing in the air, streamed through the dusty window of "Wanderlust Wonders," a travel agency tucked away on a side street of bustling Oakhaven.  Posters of exotic landscapes—untamed jungles, snow-capped peaks, sun-drenched beaches— adorned the walls, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the faded wallpaper and the general air of quiet anticipation.  Amelia, her long auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, meticulously examined a tattered map of the Himalayas, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Today was the day.  A day that could either cement her reputation as a reliable travel agent or consign her to the ranks of the forgotten.  Beyond the meticulously organised rows of brochures and the faded grandeur of the old agency, a sense of something momentous hung heavy in the air.  A sense of possibility.  Or perhaps, dread.  This wasn't just another trip; this was the expedition of a lifetime.  And Amelia was about to embark on it with her client, a renowned, but notoriously demanding, historian named Professor Alistair Finch.
