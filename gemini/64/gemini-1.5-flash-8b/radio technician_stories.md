The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Microphone" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Newhaven.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder and stale coffee.  Amelia Petrova, radio technician extraordinaire, meticulously adjusted the dials of a vintage shortwave receiver.  Tiny beads of sweat, clinging to her brow, mirrored the anxious glint in her eyes.  Outside, the storm raged – a furious symphony of wind and rain – a perfect backdrop for the silent, agonizing hum of the receiver's coils.  Amelia,  a wisp of a woman with a tangle of dark hair escaping her worn cap, traced the intricate circuitry with a calloused finger. This was not just a job for her; it was a mission.  Tonight, the fate of a vanished signal, and perhaps, a vanished ship, rested on her fingertips.  The city, a sprawling tapestry of cobbled alleys and towering Victorian buildings, held its breath, its only soundtrack the relentless drumbeat of the storm.  Her workbench, cluttered with tools and half-finished projects, represented a lifetime spent wrestling with the mysteries of the ether, a lifetime spent deciphering the whispers of the world beyond the horizon. The year is 1938.
