The fluorescent lights of the tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Amelia Hernandez's keyboard.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless tax forms, meticulously entered the deductions for a retired school teacher named Mr. Henderson.  Outside, the spring air crackled with the promise of warmer days, but inside the small office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of downtown, the air remained thick with the scent of stale coffee and the hushed whispers of financial anxieties.

The office itself was a testament to practicality over aesthetics.  Beige walls, worn linoleum floors, and chipped Formica tables were the norm.  Rows of filing cabinets, each one bursting with manila folders, stood sentinel against the muted light.  A single, slightly oversized potted fern, struggling to survive in the corner, was the only concession to a hint of life amidst the spreadsheet-filled chaos.   A stack of discarded coffee cups and crumpled receipts sat precariously on Amelia's desk, a visual representation of the day's already overwhelming workload.  The faint scent of cinnamon, a comforting remnant from the previous afternoon's visit from an elderly client, clung stubbornly to the air.
