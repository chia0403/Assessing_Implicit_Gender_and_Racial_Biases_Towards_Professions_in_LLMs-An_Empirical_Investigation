The rhythmic clang of wrenches against metal, the acrid smell of burnt oil and gasoline, filled the air in "Rusty's Repair," a greasy, cluttered garage tucked away on a side street of the forgotten industrial district.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic pace of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a seasoned auto mechanic with calloused hands and a perpetually worried frown.  Barty, 42 years old and with a prematurely grey streak in his otherwise dark brown hair, squinted at the engine block before him.  He traced the faint lines of a crack, a tiny fissure that looked innocuous yet harbored the potential for a catastrophic failure.  This wasn't just any car; it belonged to Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a reclusive, eccentric antique collector known for her peculiar tastes and even more peculiar cars.  The vintage, cherry-red roadster before him hummed with a strange, unsettling vibration.  Barty knew this wasn't a simple fix. This wasn't just an engine; it was a mystery.
