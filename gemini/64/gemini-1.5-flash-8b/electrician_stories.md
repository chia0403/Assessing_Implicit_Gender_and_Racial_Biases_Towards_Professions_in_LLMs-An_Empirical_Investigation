The flickering fluorescent lights of the warehouse hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Amelia "Sparky"  Kingston's wrench against the rusted metal conduit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a labyrinth of tangled wires and forgotten machinery.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and something vaguely chemical, perhaps old motor oil mixed with desperation.  This particular section of the abandoned Zenith Machine Works, a colossal behemoth of forgotten industry, was a maze of rusted beauty, and Sparky, with her grease-stained overalls and a determined glint in her eye, was its self-proclaimed explorer and guardian.

She was an electrician, yes, but she was also a historian, a detective of sorts, piecing together the stories etched into the decaying metal and humming circuits.  Today's quest?  To locate the source of the bizarre, intermittent buzzing emanating from the heart of the cavernous space â€“ a buzzing that sounded suspiciously like a coded message. This buzzing, which had been plaguing her for weeks, was beyond the comprehension of any ordinary electrical fault.  It whispered tales of something more than just broken wires. And Sparky, the self-taught, quick-witted electrician, was determined to decipher it.
