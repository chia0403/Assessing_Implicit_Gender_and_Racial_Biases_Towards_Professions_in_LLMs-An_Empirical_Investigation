The chill seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, a familiar companion in the shadowed depths of "The Cleaver's Cut."  The flickering gaslight, barely containing the creeping gloom, cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening crimson smears on the polished butcher block.  A faint, metallic tang, a blend of blood and rosemary, hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the day's trade. Barty, a man sculpted from years of handling raw meat and hardened by the relentless rhythm of the market, adjusted the strap of his apron, a familiar weight settling over his shoulders.  The shop, tucked away on a narrow alley off the bustling cobblestones of Spitalfields, London, 1888, held a particular melancholy this evening.  The usually boisterous clatter of the nearby brewery had fallen silent, replaced by a disconcerting stillness. The only sound was the rhythmic thump of Barty's own heart against his ribs, a counterpoint to the hushed whispers of the city outside, a city that, tonight, seemed to hold its breath.
