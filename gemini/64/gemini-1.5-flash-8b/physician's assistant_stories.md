The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Rodriguez, PA-C's, very bones.  The sterile white walls, usually a comforting backdrop, felt oppressive tonight, choked with the smell of antiseptic and fear.  Outside, the city thrummed with a frantic energy, oblivious to the chaos unfolding within the four walls of the ER at Mercy General.  Amelia, her nametag practically vibrating with the frantic pace of the room, hunched over a gurney, the cool metal a stark contrast to the feverish skin of the patient lying beneath her.  The man, mid-thirties, eyes wide and glazed over, coughed up a horrifying torrent of blood, staining the white sheets a crimson that seemed to defy the sterile environment. This wasn't just another routine night.  This was something else entirely.
