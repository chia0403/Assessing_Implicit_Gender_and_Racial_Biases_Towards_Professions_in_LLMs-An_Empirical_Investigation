The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at Amelia Blackwood's canvas.  Rain, the colour of bruised plums, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the derelict barn, a symphony of sorrowful percussion.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and linseed oil.  Amelia, a woman whose hands, despite their delicate bone structure, held the strength of a seasoned woodcutter, hunched over her easel, her breath fogging in the chill air.  Her paint palette, a chaotic symphony of blues, greys, and burnt umber, lay scattered across the rough-hewn table.  The barn, a silent testament to forgotten farming lives, held a history as thick as the paint on her canvases.  Sunlight, a fragile, fleeting visitor, fought its way through the gaps in the roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long, skeletal shadows across the floor.  This was her studio, her sanctuary, her prison.  And tonight, the subject of her next masterpiece – the storm itself – raged outside.  Amelia Blackwood, forever seeking solace and truth in the turbulent colours of the world, was about to paint her greatest battle yet.
