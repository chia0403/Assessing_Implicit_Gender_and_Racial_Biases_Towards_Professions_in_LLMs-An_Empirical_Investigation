The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hayes's threadbare scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the park.  Autumn had long since surrendered to winter's icy grip, and the once vibrant hues of crimson and gold were now muted shades of grey and brown, mirroring the bruised landscape of her own spirit.  Shattered branches, like fractured bones, clawed at the leaden sky.  This was her sanctuary, the neglected corner of Willow Creek Park, her refuge from the relentless demands of her day job and the ghosts of her past.  Amelia, Physical Therapist, found solace in the quiet, the solitude, the raw, unadorned beauty of desolation.

The park, once a bustling hub of activity, was now a forgotten relic.  Leaf-strewn paths wound through the bare trees, leading to weathered benches and overgrown flowerbeds.  A lone swing set, its chains rusted and frayed, hung precariously from a rusted metal frame, a silent testament to time and neglect.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, was punctuated by the distant cry of a scavenging crow.  Amelia shivered, not just from the cold, but from the weight of the unspoken anxieties that clung to her like frost.  The park held its breath, waiting. And so did Amelia.
