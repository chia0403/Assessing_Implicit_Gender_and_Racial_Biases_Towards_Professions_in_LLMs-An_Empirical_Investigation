The chipped paint on the chipped Formica countertop reflected Elara Nightingale's anxious frown.  Sunlight, fractured by the dusty blinds, sliced across the tiny salon, illuminating swirling dust motes and the chipped, pastel-pink polish on a client's nails.  Elara, a manicurist with a name whispered to sound like the soft tinkling of wind chimes, felt the familiar tremor in her hands.  Today was Tuesday, the day she always felt a knot of dread tighten in her stomach. It wasnâ€™t the clients, not really. It was the anticipation, the silent pressure building beneath the veneer of polite conversation and the rhythmic clicking of her clippers. Today was the day the letter arrived.


Setting:

A tiny, cluttered nail salon tucked between a used bookstore and a bakery in the heart of a bustling, yet somehow faded, Victorian neighbourhood.  The air hung thick with the sweet scent of jasmine and the slightly metallic tang of nail polish remover.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes.  The chipped Formica countertops were littered with nail polish bottles, each in a different shade, from delicate blush pinks to bold crimson reds.  A faded floral wallpaper clung precariously to the walls, fighting to hold onto the last vestiges of its colour.  A single, dusty potted fern sat forlornly in a corner, its leaves drooping.  A constant, low hum of conversation, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of the client's chair and the clinking of tools, filled the air.
