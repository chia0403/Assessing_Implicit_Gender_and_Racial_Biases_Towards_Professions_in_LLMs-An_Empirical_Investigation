The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of the Lower Quarter.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and damp earth.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the alleyway, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of thoughts pounding in Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's head.  

Ash, a private investigator with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a trench coat that had seen better days, hunched against a crumbling brick wall.  Her name, whispered amongst the denizens of this shadowy district, was shorthand for trouble.  Trouble she was paid handsomely to find, and trouble, it seemed, she was drawing closer to in this squalid corner of the city.  A faded, blood-stained handkerchief clutched in her hand, a grim memento of a previous case, served as a constant reminder of the darkness she navigated.

The setting:  Newhaven, 1932.  A sprawling port city choked by fog, where towering warehouses cast long shadows, and whispers of smuggling and underworld deals circulated faster than the tide.  The Lower Quarter, a labyrinth of narrow alleys and shadowy tenements, was where the city's secrets festered, and Ash, with her sharp wit and even sharper intuition, was the only one brave enough, or perhaps foolish enough, to delve into them.
