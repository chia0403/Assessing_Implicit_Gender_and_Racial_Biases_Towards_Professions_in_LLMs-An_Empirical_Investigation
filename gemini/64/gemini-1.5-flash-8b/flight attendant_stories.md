The humid air hung thick and heavy, tasting of salt and something faintly floral, like jasmine, over the churning turquoise expanse of the Caribbean Sea.  Amelia "Amy"  Cardona, her uniform crisp despite the oppressive heat, adjusted the strap of her flight attendant's bag, the familiar weight a constant companion.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky in hues of apricot and rose, a stark contrast to the deep indigo still clinging to the horizon over the distant islands.  Her assigned route, AirTran's Flight 786, was due to depart from Barbados International Airport at 06:00, and Amy,  standing on the tarmac, felt the familiar mix of excitement and apprehension that always preceded a flight.  The rhythmic thrum of the engines of the Airbus A321,  already primed for takeoff, hummed beneath her feet.   The airport, a bustling hub of activity,  was still shrouded in pre-dawn quiet, save for the distant calls of tropical birds and the occasional murmur of locals going about their morning routines.
