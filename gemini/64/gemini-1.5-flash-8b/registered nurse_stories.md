The sterile white of the hospital hallway seemed to swallow Amelia Hayes whole.  A perpetual, low hum, a soundtrack to the city's relentless heartbeat, echoed through the corridors, punctuated by the rhythmic beep-beep of heart monitors and the hushed whispers of unseen anxieties.  Rain hammered against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia's chest.  It had been a particularly brutal shift at St. Jude's Memorial Hospital, a marathon of broken bones, failing organs, and the quiet desperation clinging to the faces of her patients.

Eleanorâ€™s case, a complicated tangle of medical history and personal tragedy, had haunted Amelia all day.  A feeling of profound responsibility, heavier than the stethoscope draped around her neck, pressed down on her. This wasn't just another patient; this was Eleanor, and Eleanor was now in Amelia's hands.
