The fluorescent hum of the drafting room, a low, persistent drone that vibrated through Amelia Petrovaâ€™s bones, was almost comforting.  It was a rhythm she knew intimately, a soundtrack to the countless blueprints that had flowed from her drafting table over the past decade.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows overlooking the sprawling industrial park, their silhouettes mirroring the meticulous lines she painstakingly etched onto the tracing paper.  Amelia, a drafting worker for Zenith Industries, felt the familiar weight of the 2H pencil in her hand, a tool more familiar than her own reflection.  This particular Tuesday, however, the humming felt different, laced with an unfamiliar tension, a low thrumming that vibrated not just in the air, but in the very fabric of the sprawling, grey factory complex.  The air smelled of machinery and something else, something faintly metallic, something...new.
