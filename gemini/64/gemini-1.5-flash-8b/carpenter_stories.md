The biting wind whipped across the cobbled streets of Old Oakhaven, rattling the faded, terracotta tiles of the rooftops and stinging Elara Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust devils, stirred up by the furious gusts, danced across the uneven flagstones, swirling around the ancient, oak-framed workshop at the heart of the city.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of sawdust and linseed oil, a comforting aroma amidst the tempest outside. Elara Blackwood, her fingers stained a rich, mahogany brown, meticulously measured a length of seasoned oak with a finely-honed steel rule.  The workshop, tucked between a bustling bakery and a crumbling apothecary, was a sanctuary, a haven of quiet precision in a world of ceaseless chaos.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window above, painted shifting patterns on the polished wooden floor, illuminating the intricate carvings on a half-finished chest that dominated one corner.  This was her world, the rhythm of her hands shaping wood, creating beauty from raw materials, a world where the wind howled a symphony of her own distinct melody.
