The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Hayes's fire-resistant coat around her, stinging her cheeks with icy shards of rain.  Below, the sprawling metropolis of New Zenith, a city sculpted from steel and glass, glittered like a fractured diamond under the angry grey sky.  A plume of black smoke, thick and acrid, snaked skyward, a horrifying ballet against the backdrop of the looming, ominous storm clouds.  Ash, her breath misting in the frigid air, gripped the metal railing of the fire escape, her boots already soaked through.  She wasn't just another firefighter; she was a veteran, a woman forged in the crucible of countless blazes, each one leaving a scar on her soul and a badge of honour on her uniform.  From the top of the multi-storied skyscraper, she surveyed the scene, a silent, grim assessment painting itself across her face.  The fire, raging through the derelict, abandoned sections of the Zenith Tower, a once-prized symbol of the city's ambition, now a monument to its carelessness and decay, was proving more tenacious than anyone had anticipated.  The wind intensified, threatening to rip her from her precarious perch.  This call wouldn't be easy.
