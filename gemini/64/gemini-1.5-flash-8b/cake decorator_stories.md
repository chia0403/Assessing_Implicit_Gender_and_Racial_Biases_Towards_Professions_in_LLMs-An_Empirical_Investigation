The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded robin's egg blue from years of sugar-glazed mishaps, reflected Amelia Nightingale's anxious face.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grime-streaked windowpanes of her tiny bakery, "Crumbs & Dreams."  Outside, the bustling marketplace of Oakhaven echoed with the cacophony of vendors hawking their wares: fresh fruit, fragrant herbs, and the insistent clang of a blacksmith's hammer.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of melted chocolate and a perpetually flour-dusted apron, clutched a half-finished buttercream rose.

Amelia's masterpiece, a towering sculpted cake representing the legendary Oakhaven Dragon, was supposed to be a breathtaking showstopper, a testament to her skill and years of painstaking practice.  Yet, a rogue drop of icing had marred the dragon's fiery mane, a catastrophic flaw threatening to unravel her meticulously crafted design.  The pressure mounted, each passing moment ticking louder against the soft thrum of the old bakery's chipped enamel clock.  Amelia knew her reputation, built on years of painstaking artistry, hung in the balance.
