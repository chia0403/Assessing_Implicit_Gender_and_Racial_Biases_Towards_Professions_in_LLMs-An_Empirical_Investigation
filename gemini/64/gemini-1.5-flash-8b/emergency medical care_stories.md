Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ambulance bay, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Elara Vance's heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cramped space, highlighting the stark white of the pristine ambulance interior â€“ a stark contrast to the increasingly muddy, blood-splattered chaos unfolding outside.

Elara, her uniform stained with a faint smudge of dirt and a tell-tale smear of crimson, gripped the steering wheel tighter as she listened to the frantic beeps and buzzes emanating from the back.  She needed to get to the patient.  She needed to get to him, before the forest claimed him too.
