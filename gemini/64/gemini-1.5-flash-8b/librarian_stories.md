The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air like a forgotten poem.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting a phoenix rising from flames, painted the shelves of the Carnegie Library in warm hues.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, illuminating the spines of leather-bound volumes and the worn, comforting leather of Amelia's armchair.  It was a Tuesday morning, the kind where the city outside hummed with a pre-dawn quiet, a symphony of unseen things stirring.  Amelia, a librarian at the sprawling, century-old library in the heart of Oakhaven, felt the familiar pull of routine, a comforting weight in the otherwise unpredictable currents of life.  The library was her sanctuary, a place where whispers of forgotten tales echoed in the hushed stillness, a place where she felt truly at home.
