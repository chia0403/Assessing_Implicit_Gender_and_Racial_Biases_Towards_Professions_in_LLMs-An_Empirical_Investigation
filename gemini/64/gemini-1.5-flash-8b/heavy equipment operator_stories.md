Elias, a man carved from sun-baked granite and seasoned by a decade of relentless work in the unforgiving landscapes of eastern Oregon, felt the familiar tremor of the massive engine beneath him.  The sun, a molten orb sinking towards the jagged horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched like grasping fingers across the parched earth.  This was his domain, this was his life, a symphony of metal and earth, a ballet of power and dust.  He was a creature of the landscape, as much a part of the Painted Hills as the petrified forests and the ancient petroglyphs that dotted the region.  Today, however, something felt different.  A persistent, low hum of unease vibrated beneath the raw power of the machine, a hum that resonated not just in the engine, but deep within Eliasâ€™s bones.
