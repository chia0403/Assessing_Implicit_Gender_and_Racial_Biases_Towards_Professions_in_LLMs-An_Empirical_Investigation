The chipped porcelain sink of the "Grand Astor" hummed faintly, a counterpoint to the hushed whispers that seemed to coil around Amelia "Amy" Cavendish.  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate stained-glass window above, cast long, dancing shadows across the marble floor, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the air.  The air itself, thick with the scent of lilies and something indefinably old money, clung to her like a second skin.  Amy, a concierge of the Grand Astor for the past seven years, expertly polished a silver teacup, the reflection of the brass doorknob shimmering in its polished surface.  The grand hotel, a monument to a bygone era of opulence, echoed with an almost palpable sense of history, a soundtrack of whispered secrets and forgotten fortunes.  Outside, the city of New York, a vibrant tapestry of noise and ambition, thrummed with an unseen energy that seemed to push and pull at the very walls of the hotel.  It was a Tuesday in late September, and the usual pre-autumnal chill was already settling in, bringing with it a sense of anticipation that hung heavy in the air.
