The biting wind whipped at Amelia Petrova's flight suit, a relentless, icy caress that seemed to mock the fragile warmth of her breath.  Above, the swirling clouds, bruised purple and charcoal grey, stretched like a monstrous, indifferent blanket across the vast expanse of the Arctic Circle.  Below, the desolate landscape of snow-dusted tundra, a pale and featureless expanse punctuated only by the occasional jagged peak, seemed to swallow the small, single-engine aircraft whole.  Amelia, co-pilot of the *Aurora Borealis*, squinted into the gloom, her breath clouding the already misty windscreen.  The radio crackled, a faint whisper of static punctuated by a distant, echoing transmission:  "Aurora Borealis, this is Alpha-One.  We've lost visual contact with the research team.  Repeat, lost visual contact with the research team."


Setting: The Arctic Circle, a frigid and unforgiving region of remote, untouched wilderness.  The precise location is a matter for later, as the harsh landscape, clouded skies, and dangerous conditions are of primary concern.  The *Aurora Borealis*, a small, customized single-engine aircraft, represents a critical element of the story.  The tone is one of isolation, danger, and suspense.
