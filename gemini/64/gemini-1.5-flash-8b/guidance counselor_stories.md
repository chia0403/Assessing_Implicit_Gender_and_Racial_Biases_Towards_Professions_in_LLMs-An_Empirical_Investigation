Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Northwood Community High School guidance office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety simmering in Amelia Grace Sterling’s chest.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sterile glow on the cluttered desk, overflowing with student files, progress reports, and half-eaten bags of stale pretzels.  Outside, the familiar symphony of teenage angst – shouts, muffled laughter, the rhythmic thump of sneakers on the asphalt – was muted only by the torrential downpour. Amelia, a guidance counselor with five years under her belt, stared at the crumpled letter clutched in her hand.  It was from Ethan Miller, a quiet, withdrawn student in her eleventh-grade pre-calculus class. The letter, scrawled in desperate, uneven handwriting, detailed a struggle Amelia had never suspected.  And the words within were like a seed of fear, capable of blooming into something far more catastrophic than she could comprehend.  The rain intensified, threatening to flood the office with cold, gray water.  Amelia felt a chill creep down her spine.  This wasn't just another student needing guidance; this was something far more urgent.
