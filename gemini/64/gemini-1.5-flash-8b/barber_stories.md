The scent of freshly cut hair, a potent mix of pine-scented pomade and something faintly sweet, clung to the air in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Cut."  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a chipped porcelain sink and a mirror that reflected more chipped than gleaming.  Barty, a man of forty-odd years with a mop of unruly brown hair that seemed to defy even his own practiced shears, was meticulously shaving the jawline of a portly gentleman, Mr. Grimshaw, a regular who'd been coming to The Clipper's Cut for as long as Barty could remember.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of the shears, punctuated by the occasional groan from Mr. Grimshaw, filled the small, almost claustrophobic space.  Outside, the bustling city thrummed with a symphony of honking taxis and chattering crowds, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost melancholic hum within the barbershop.
