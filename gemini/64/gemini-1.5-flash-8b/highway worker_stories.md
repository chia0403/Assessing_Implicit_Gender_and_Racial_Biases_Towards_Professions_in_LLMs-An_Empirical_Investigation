The biting wind, a relentless terrier, whipped Amelia "Ace" Hernandez's hard hat across the cracked asphalt.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around her worn boots, clinging to the frayed edges of her faded orange jumpsuit.  The sun, a pale disc battling the encroaching twilight, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate stretch of Interstate 85.  It was a Tuesday in early October, the kind of day that sucked the colour from the world, leaving only the stark, unending grey expanse of the highway.  Ace, a highway maintenance worker for the Department of Transportation, was alone, miles from anywhere.  This stretch of road, a ribbon of concrete snaking through the flat, unforgiving plains of Kansas, felt like the edge of the world.  She was responsible for a ten-mile section, a daunting task in itself, but tonight, something felt different.  An eerie silence hung heavy in the air, a silence that felt unnatural against the ceaseless drone of the highway's usual traffic.
