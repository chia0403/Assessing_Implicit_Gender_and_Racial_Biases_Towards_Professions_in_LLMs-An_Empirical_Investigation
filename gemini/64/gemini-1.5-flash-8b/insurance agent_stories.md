Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Integrity Insurance" office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the pounding of her heart.  Amy, a seasoned insurance agent with a sharp wit and even sharper tongue, stared at the meticulously organized, yet still chaotic, stack of claim forms on her desk.  Each one represented a shattered dream, a ruined life, a pile of paperwork demanding her attention.  Today, the deluge of misfortune was particularly torrential.  A flood had ravaged the town, a fire had gutted a historic bakery, and a freak windstorm had ripped through the outskirts, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.  The scent of damp earth and ozone hung heavy in the air, a stark reminder of the city's vulnerability.

The office, tucked away on a side street in the heart of Oakhaven, was a typical small-town insurance agency.  Beige walls, worn carpet, and chipped Formica countertops reflected the quiet desperation of a community clinging to the remnants of normalcy.  A chipped porcelain coffee pot, perpetually full of lukewarm coffee, sat on the corner of the reception desk, a testament to the tireless hours Amy and her colleagues often put in.  Outside, the storm raged, blurring the already indistinct line between the building and the darkening sky.  A sense of unease permeated the air, a tangible weight pressing down on everyone, as if the storm wasn't just outside, but inside the office as well.
