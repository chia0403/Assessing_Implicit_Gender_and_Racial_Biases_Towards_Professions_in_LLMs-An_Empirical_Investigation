The wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered leather jacket, tugging at the frayed edges and threatening to rip the already-compromised fabric.  He hunched lower, the familiar, gritty scent of asphalt and rain filling his lungs.  Below, the sprawling metropolis of New Avalon stretched out in a chaotic tapestry of steel and glass, a glittering, almost mocking display of wealth and indifference.  Elias, perched precariously on the rooftop of the opulent "Skyspire" apartment complex, felt a profound disconnect from the lives unfolding far below. He was a tiny ant on a giant, indifferent anthill, a roofer in a city that seemed to swallow its inhabitants whole.


The setting: New Avalon, a sprawling, futuristic metropolis built on the ruins of a forgotten past.  High-rise buildings, sculpted from gleaming alloys and shimmering glass, pierce a perpetually overcast sky.  Narrow, winding alleys and towering bridges crisscross the city, connecting pockets of opulent luxury with desolate, rain-slicked streets.  The air crackles with an unseen energy, a residual hum from the city's advanced technology.  Elias worked on the upper levels of these towering structures, a world apart from the bustling streets below, a realm of precarious ladders and dizzying heights, a stark contrast to the comfort and security that the Skyspire residents enjoyed.
