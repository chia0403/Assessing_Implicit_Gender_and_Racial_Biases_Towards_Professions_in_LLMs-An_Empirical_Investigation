The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air of the little bakery, a comforting blanket against the chill November wind whistling through the gaps in the dilapidated storefront.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already faded lettering that proclaimed "Le Petit Four."  Inside, bathed in the warm, yellow glow of the single gas lamp,  Elodie Dubois, a baker with flour-dusted cheeks and eyes the colour of burnt caramel, meticulously shaped a croissant.  Each fold, each turn, was performed with a practiced grace that belied the years of dedication and tireless toil etched into her face.  The clatter of pans, the rhythmic thud of her flour-dusted apron against the countertop, the gentle hiss of steam from the oven, formed a symphony of her solitary work.
