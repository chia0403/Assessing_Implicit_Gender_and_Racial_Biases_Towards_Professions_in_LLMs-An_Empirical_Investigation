Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the "Crimson Curtain" Theatre, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Nightingale, Artistic Director.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool and desperation.  It was the eve of the opening night of "A Midsummer's Madness," a play she'd poured her heart and soul into, a production she believed would finally catapult her small, struggling theatre onto the national stage.  But tonight, the stage felt like a battlefield.  A chorus of whispers, louder than the drumming rain, echoed through the backstage corridors, whispering of budget overruns, a disgruntled lead actor, and a mounting sense of impending disaster.  Amelia's meticulously crafted vision, a vibrant celebration of love, loss, and the absurdity of human existence, seemed perilously close to being drowned by the rising tide of doubt and despair.  The grand, cavernous theatre, usually a sanctuary of light and theatrical magic, now felt like a pressure cooker about to explode.
