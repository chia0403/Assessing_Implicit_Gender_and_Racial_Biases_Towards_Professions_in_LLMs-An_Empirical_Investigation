The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Alistair Finch's office hummed a low, monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the rhythmic, nearly imperceptible vibrations of the massage table.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a layer of forgotten pamphlets on the reception desk: "Boost Your Immunity Naturally," "The Benefits of Laughter Yoga," and a particularly colourful one promising "Relief from Back Pain in 15 Minutes."

Dr. Alistair Finch, a chiropractor with a perpetually weary gaze and a mop of unruly brown hair, adjusted the headrest.  The patient, a petite woman named Amelia, lay prone on the table, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Alistair, meticulously tracing the outline of her spine with his fingers, felt a familiar tremor of frustration. Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for elaborate, overly-structured fashion, had arrived complaining of a “knot” in her lower back, a recurring problem that seemed stubbornly immune to his standard adjustments.  It had been a particularly trying week, filled with missed deadlines and looming design critiques.  The air in the small, cluttered office, crammed with tools of his trade and mismatched furniture, thrummed with the silent anxieties of both of them.

The setting was the quiet, slightly neglected corner of a bustling suburb of a mid-sized city in the Midwest.  The neighborhood, once a proud collection of modest bungalows and neatly manicured lawns, now showcased a mix of faded paint, overgrown hedges, and cars parked haphazardly on both sides of the street.  A faint, sweet smell of honeysuckle and stale coffee hung in the air, a testament to the time of day.  This was the world of Dr. Alistair Finch, a world where whispered anxieties and the creaks of old bones often seemed more prominent than the distant hum of the city.
