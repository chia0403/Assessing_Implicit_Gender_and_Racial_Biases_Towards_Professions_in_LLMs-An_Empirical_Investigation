The fluorescent hum of the Zenith Corporation building vibrated through Elias Thorne's worn sneakers, a dull counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of his mop.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sickly light, mirroring the swirling chaos in his head.  It was Tuesday, the day the building seemed to breathe a little heavier, its towering glass facade reflecting a bruised twilight sky that forecast a thunderstorm.  Elias, custodian of the Zenith Corporation's research wing, number 4B, meticulously scrubbed the polished floor, a silent ballet of cleaning against the rhythmic clatter of unseen machinery in the adjoining labs.  He knew the exact location of every spill, every smudge, every forgotten lunch container â€“ a map of chaos he navigated with the practiced ease of a seasoned cartographer. Tonight, however, the familiar contours of his routine felt strangely out of place.  A persistent, unsettling hum accompanied the usual whirring of ventilation systems, a sound that pressed against his ears like a suffocating blanket.  The hum seemed to emanate from the very heart of the building, from a forgotten corner of the research wing.  And Elias, a man accustomed to the whispers of dust and the echoes of empty corridors, felt a prickle of unease, a sense of something amiss.

**Setting:** The Zenith Corporation's research wing, number 4B, a towering glass-and-steel structure that reflected a bruised twilight sky.  The corridors were vast, sterile, and lined with closed doors, each bearing a cryptic series of numbers and letters.  A faint, unsettling hum emanated from the deepest recesses of the building, and the air smelled faintly of ozone.
