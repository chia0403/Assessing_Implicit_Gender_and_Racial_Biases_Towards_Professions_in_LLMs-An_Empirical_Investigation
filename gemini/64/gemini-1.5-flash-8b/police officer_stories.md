The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's face, highlighting the weariness etched into her features.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated diner, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the thoughts swirling in her head.  She slumped into a booth, the worn vinyl protesting under her weight.  Outside, the grimy streets of Havenwood, a town clinging to the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis, reflected the gloom.  The town was a patchwork of faded storefronts, decaying houses, and a palpable sense of resignation. It was a place where secrets festered like mildew on forgotten walls.  Izzy's patrol car, a battered Ford Crown Victoria, sat parked outside, a silent sentinel guarding the quiet desperation of the night.  The air hung heavy with the smells of frying grease, stale coffee, and something akin to fear, a persistent undercurrent that resonated in the very bones of the town.  She took a sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the hollow ache in her stomach.  Havenwood held a particular kind of darkness, a darkness Izzy felt personally responsible for illuminating.
