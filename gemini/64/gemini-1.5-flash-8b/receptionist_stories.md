The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Research Institute" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the relentless glare, reflecting off the polished mahogany desk, a stark contrast to the chaotic jumble of papers and half-eaten takeout containers scattered across its surface.  Amelia, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that was more practiced than genuine, tapped a pen against her teeth.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and ozone, hung heavy in the small, sterile reception area.  Rows of identical, grey metal filing cabinets lined the walls, their silent promise of secrets a constant presence.  A single, unblinking security camera stared down from the ceiling, watching her every move. Today, the only sound louder than the hum of the lights was the incessant pinging of her antiquated computer system.
