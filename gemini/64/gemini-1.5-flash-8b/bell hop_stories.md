The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestone streets of Victorian-era New London, illuminating the opulent façade of the Grand Astor Hotel.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the enormous, ornately carved windows.  Inside, amidst the hushed whispers and clinking silverware, Bartholomew "Barty" Featherstone, bell hop extraordinaire of the Grand Astor, meticulously polished a brass bell, its polished surface reflecting the swirling patterns of the lamplight.  The rhythmic squeak of the polishing cloth, punctuated by the occasional sigh of a weary traveler, was the soundtrack to his solitary evening.  He knew this was the perfect time for reflection – the silent hours before the city truly woke, before the bustle of carriages and the clatter of hurried footsteps filled the corridors.
