The scent of lavender and pine hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the encroaching chill of the autumn evening.  Rain hammered against the slate roof of Willowbrook Manor, a hushed symphony that seemed to amplify the quiet hum of the massage table beneath Amelia Josephine Blackwood.  Amelia, with her fingers tracing the intricate patterns of a knotted shoulder, felt the rhythmic drumming of the storm mirrored in the tense muscles of her client, Mr. Alistair Finch.  He was a man of meticulous habits, a banker known for his precise suits and even more precise investments.  This evening, however, the precise order of his life felt askew, as if the very fabric of his world had been caught in the tempest outside.

Willowbrook Manor, a sprawling Victorian house nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Hollow, had been a haven for weary souls for generations.  The house itself seemed to absorb the world's anxieties, its aged walls steeped in the hushed stories of countless visitors.  The dimly lit parlor, where Mr. Finch now lay, smelled faintly of aged leather and old wood polish.  A crackling fire in the hearth cast dancing shadows on the walls, illuminating dust motes dancing in the pale moonlight filtering through the stained-glass windows.  Outside, the wind howled like a hungry wolf, whipping the branches of the ancient oaks into a frenzy.  This was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary, her haven, and tonight, she was tasked with restoring the equilibrium not just of Mr. Finch's body, but perhaps of his spirit as well.
