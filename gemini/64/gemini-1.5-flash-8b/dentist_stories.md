A gentle, almost hypnotic, hum emanated from the dental chair, a rhythmic counterpoint to the incessant ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from a bygone era seemingly immune to the relentless march of modern dentistry.  Eleanor, a woman of thirty-five with a patient smile and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of someone who had seen far more than most, adjusted her mask and gloves, her fingers deftly working with the sterile instruments.  Today's patient, a nervous teenager named Leo, was a newcomer to her practice, and a particularly challenging one.  Eleanor had a suspicion that this wasn't just a routine checkup.
