The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym cast an eerie glow on Amelia "Amy"  Everhart's sweat-slicked brow.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating a lone dumbbell still precariously balanced on a wobbly metal rack.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of chlorine and the faint, sickly sweet scent of cheap protein powder.  Empty benches, coated in a layer of forgotten sweat and the grime of a thousand failed push-ups, lined the walls.  It was a Tuesday, and the usual cacophony of grunts, groans, and the rhythmic thump of cardio equipment was absent, replaced by a profound silence that felt almost oppressive. Amy, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs, knew this feeling all too well.  This was the dead zone, the time of day when the gym, usually brimming with determined souls, fell silent, and the ghosts of workouts past lingered in the stale air.
