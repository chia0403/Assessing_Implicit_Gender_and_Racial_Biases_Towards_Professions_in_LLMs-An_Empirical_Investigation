The crisp morning air, scented with pine and damp earth, whipped Amelia Nightingale's hair across her face as she surveyed her latest project.  The sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth, nestled amongst the ancient oaks of Blackwood Forest, was a testament to the meticulous planning she so cherished.  Sunlight, filtering through the emerald canopy, dappled the meticulously arranged boxwoods, their perfectly clipped forms resembling tiny, sculpted forests.  Amelia, however, wasn't lost in aesthetic contemplation.  Something about the stillness, the undisturbed beauty, feltâ€¦off.  A nagging unease, like a whisper in the wind, tugged at her.  Her hands, usually deft and sure with shears and trowel, trembled slightly as she repositioned a single, perfect rose, its crimson bloom a stark contrast to the oppressive silence.


The setting:  The Blackwood Estate, a sprawling, centuries-old manor nestled deep within the Blackwood Forest, a region of the British Isles renowned for its ancient woodlands and brooding atmosphere.  The estate itself, with its vast lawns, manicured gardens, and towering trees, was a testament to wealth and meticulous attention to detail.  Hidden pathways and overgrown corners hinted at secrets buried beneath layers of time and meticulously maintained appearances.  Amelia Nightingale, the lead landscaper, was not just tending to plants; she was tracing hidden lines in the very fabric of the estate.
