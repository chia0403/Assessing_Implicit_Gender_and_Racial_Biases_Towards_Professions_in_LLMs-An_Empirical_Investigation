The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of splashed dye and forgotten shampoo, reflected Amelia "Milly"  Montgomery's worried face.  A single, defiant strand of crimson hair, stubbornly resisting the calming lavender balm she was applying, framed her brow.  Her meticulously organized salon, "The Gilded Curl," usually a haven of swirling scents and whispered compliments, felt suffocatingly still.  The scent of lavender, her signature scent, was almost lost in the heavy, expectant silence.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the slowest time of the week.  Usually buzzing with the rhythmic click-clack of scissors and the soft chatter of clients, the salon was eerily quiet.  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate Tiffany glass pendant lamps, painted shifting patterns on the polished floors and the pristine, mirrored walls.  A faint hum of anticipation, like a swarm of bees trapped in the small space, thrummed just beneath the silence.  Milly had been a cosmetologist for fifteen years.  Fifteen years of sculpting beauty, of coaxing confidence from her clients. But today, she feared she had created a masterpiece that was destined to break.  The clock on the wall ticked slowly, each second a hammer blow against the mounting anxiety in her chest.
