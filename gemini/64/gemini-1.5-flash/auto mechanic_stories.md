The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume she'd worn since she was old enough to crawl under her father's beat-up Chevy.

Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy windows, barely penetrated the shadowed interior, illuminating dust motes dancing in the beams like tiny, metallic fireflies.  Amelia, her hands already stained with the dark residue of a stubborn oil leak, wiped a smear of grease across her already smudged forehead, her brow furrowed in concentration as she wrestled with a recalcitrant spark plug.  The rhythmic clang of her wrench against metal provided a counterpoint to the distant rumble of traffic on Alameda Street â€“ a constant, comforting soundtrack to her life.
