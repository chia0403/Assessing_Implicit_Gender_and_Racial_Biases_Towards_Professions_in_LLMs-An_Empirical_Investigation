The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Tower hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne's mop bucket wheels on the polished marble floor.  Elias, a man whose life was measured not in hours but in the relentless cycle of emptying overflowing trash cans and scrubbing away the grime left behind by the city's elite, surveyed his kingdom – the cavernous, echoing lobby of Zenith Tower, a glass and steel monument to ambition that stood as a stark contrast to his own modest existence.  Midnight had come and gone, the last stragglers of the day’s high-powered workforce long departed, leaving behind only the lingering scent of expensive perfume and the faint echo of their hurried footsteps.  The only company Elias had was the soft whir of the ventilation system and the faint, persistent drip from a leaky faucet somewhere deep within the building's labyrinthine bowels. Tonight, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by an unsettling silence, a stillness heavier than the usual post-workday hush.
