The chipped ceramic mug warmed Ms. Aurelia "Relia" Cartwright's hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the tremor in her fingers.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her tiny cottage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of her heart.  The cottage, nestled precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, felt particularly isolated tonight, the usual comforting glow of the nearby lighthouse swallowed by the storm's fury.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and impending doom â€“ or at least, impending parent-teacher conferences, which, for Relia, felt much the same.  The miniature plastic dinosaur clinging precariously to the edge of her mug seemed to share her anxiety, its painted eyes staring blankly out into the tempest.  Tomorrow was the day she had to tell Mrs. Gable that her son, little Timmy, had, for the third time this week, glued a plastic frog to the classroom ceiling fan.
