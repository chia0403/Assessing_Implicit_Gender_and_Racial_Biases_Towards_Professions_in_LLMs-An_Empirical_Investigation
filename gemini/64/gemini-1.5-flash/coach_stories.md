The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandezâ€™s hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate soccer field.  Frozen clumps of grass crunched under her worn cleats, a stark contrast to the vibrant green she craved.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke from the distant houses clinging to the edge of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, a place where time seemed to move at a slower, almost melancholic pace.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the bare trees lining the perimeter, making the already forlorn landscape appear even more desolate.  Amy, head coach of the Oakhaven High School Lady Hawks soccer team,  pulled her threadbare scarf tighter around her neck, a shiver running down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.  This wasn't just another practice; this was a fight for survival, both for the team and perhaps, for herself.
