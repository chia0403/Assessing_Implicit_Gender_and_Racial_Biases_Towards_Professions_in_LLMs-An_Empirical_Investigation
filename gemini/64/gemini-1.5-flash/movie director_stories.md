The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she surveyed the desolate, windswept beach.  Grey skies mirrored the churning grey sea, a symphony of monochrome punctuated only by the jagged, black silhouettes of the craggy cliffs looming in the distance.  The air smelled of brine and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling, clinging to the back of her throat like the lingering taste of cheap whiskey.  This was it.  The location for her ambitious new film, *The Obsidian Shore*, a gothic horror promising to be her masterpiece, or her career’s spectacular implosion –  a fate Mia, with her reputation for uncompromising vision and even more uncompromising temperament, found equally appealing.  The abandoned fishing village, its skeletal remains clawing at the unforgiving landscape, was as bleak and brooding as the script itself, a perfect canvas for the chilling story she was about to paint.
