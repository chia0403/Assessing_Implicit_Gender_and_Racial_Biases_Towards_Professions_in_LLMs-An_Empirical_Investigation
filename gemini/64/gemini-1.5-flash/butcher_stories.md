The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of iron and rendered fat that clung to Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew like a second skin.  It was a scent he’d grown accustomed to over his forty-odd years behind the counter of Bartholomew's Butchery, a family business nestled on the cobbled, slightly-sloping street of Butcher's Row in the quaint, if somewhat decaying, port town of Oakhaven.  The morning mist, still clinging to the slate roofs of the surrounding buildings, did little to disperse the aroma, instead creating a damp, almost ethereal shroud that seemed to amplify the rich, gamy smell.  Archie, his apron stained a mosaic of blood and gravy, sharpened his cleaver with a practiced hand, the rhythmic scrape a counterpoint to the distant cries of gulls and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a distant ship's engine.  Today, however, the usual comforting routine felt laced with a prickle of unease.  Something felt…off.
