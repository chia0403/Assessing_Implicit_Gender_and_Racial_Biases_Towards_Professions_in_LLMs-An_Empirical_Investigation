The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  She tugged her worn wool scarf tighter, the dampness seeping through to the thin fabric.  Above her, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the stormy backdrop.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something feral and faintly sweet, that prickled at the edges of her senses.  She was halfway across the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, its imposing gothic facade barely visible through the driving rain, making her way to the far reaches of the estate where the wolf enclosure nestled â€“ a sanctuary of sorts, tucked away from the manor's ostentatious grandeur and the eccentric, often unsettling, whims of its owner.
