The salt spray stung Elara Vance’s face as she wrestled with her tripod, the wind threatening to snatch her expensive camera equipment and fling it into the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  The sky, a bruised purple bruised by a departing storm, mirrored the turmoil in her gut.  She was perched precariously on a jagged outcrop of rock on the remote island of Inishmore, the wind-whipped grass a scant few inches from the cliff edge.  Below, the waves crashed against the basalt columns, a furious symphony of white and grey, a testament to the raw, untamed beauty of the Aran Islands.  Elara, however, was less concerned with the aesthetic grandeur and more focused on capturing it – capturing the very essence of this untamed landscape before the fleeting light faded completely.  Her assignment – a photo essay for *National Geographic* on the dwindling population of puffins – depended on it.
