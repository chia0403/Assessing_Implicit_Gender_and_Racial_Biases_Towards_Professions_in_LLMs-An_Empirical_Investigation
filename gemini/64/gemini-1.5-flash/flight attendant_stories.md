The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of duty-free perfume and stale coffee, a fragrance Amelia Hernandez, flight attendant extraordinaire (or so she liked to think), had come to intimately know as the smell of freedom.  Freedom from the suffocating predictability of her tiny apartment in Queens, freedom from the endless loop of her mother's anxieties about her "unsuitable" career choice, freedom, even, from the crushing weight of her own unrequited affection for Captain Javier Rodriguez. Tonight, however, the freedom felt less like a boundless expanse and more like a claustrophobic metal tube hurtling through the night sky above the Atlantic.  Outside, the inky blackness was punctuated only by the occasional, fleeting glimpse of a star, dwarfed by the immensity of the storm raging below.  Flight BA249, London to New York, was proving to be anything but routine.
