Professor Armitage "Armi" Finch adjusted his tweed jacket, the worn fabric clinging faintly to the damp chill of the November air.  Mist, thick as pea soup, clung to the ancient stone walls of Blackwood University, blurring the already gothic spires into shadowy, indistinct shapes.  The only sound, apart from the rhythmic drip-drip-drip from a gargoyle perched high above, was the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the crumbling archway leading to the forgotten west wing â€“ a wing whispered to be haunted, a wing Armi was about to explore.  His breath plumed out before him, a ghostly white against the gloom, mirroring the ghostly rumours that had drawn him here, to the dusty, cobweb-draped archives of Blackwood's most neglected section.
