The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the staccato tap-tap-tap of Penelope "Penny" Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails on the polished mahogany desk.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the shafts of light slicing through the cavernous reception area.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the oversized plate-glass windows.  Penny, however, remained unmoved, a picture of serene efficiency in her crisp, dove-grey suit.  Her gaze, sharp and observant, scanned the nearly empty waiting area, its plush leather chairs gleaming under the harsh light, each one a silent testament to the day's lackluster appointments.  This was a Tuesday, after all, and Tuesdays at Zenith were usually as exciting as watching paint dry â€“ a fact Penny had come to accept with the weary resignation of a seasoned veteran.
