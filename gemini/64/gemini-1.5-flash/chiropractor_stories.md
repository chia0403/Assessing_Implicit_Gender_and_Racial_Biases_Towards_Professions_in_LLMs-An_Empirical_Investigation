The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the weathered wooden dock.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the ramshackle fishing village of Port Blossom, Newfoundland.

Eleanor, her crisp white chiropractor's coat incongruous against the rugged backdrop, shivered, more from the damp chill than the physical exertion.  This wasn't exactly the bustling suburban clinic she'd envisioned when she'd graduated, but then again, Port Blossom wasn't exactly what she'd envisioned either.  It had found *her*, in a way, as much as she'd found it.  And tonight, she had a feeling it had something rather… unusual… in store.
