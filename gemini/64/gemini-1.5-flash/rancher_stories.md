The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the Wyoming plains.  It howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the cottonwoods, a sound familiar and unwelcome to Jedediah "Jed" Stone, as he surveyed his ranch from the porch of his weathered farmhouse.  The vast expanse of the Double S Ranch, usually a panorama of rolling hills and grazing cattle, was now a monochrome canvas of white, stretching to the hazy purple mountains in the distance.  The air, biting and sharp, stung his cheeks as he sipped his lukewarm coffee, the warmth doing little to thaw the icy grip of the blizzard that had been raging for three days.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic creak of the old porch swing, a lonely counterpoint to the isolation of the winter landscape.
