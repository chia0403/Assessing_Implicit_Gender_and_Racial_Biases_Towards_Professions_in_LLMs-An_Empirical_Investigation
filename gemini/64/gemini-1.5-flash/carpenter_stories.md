His small, weather-beaten workshop, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning sea, was a testament to both his skill and his stubborn refusal to leave the island he loved, despite the constant threat of the unforgiving ocean.  The half-finished boat, its hull gleaming with a fresh coat of tar, was a promise of escape â€“ for others, not himself. He was rooted here, as firmly as the ancient stones of the nearby Dunvegan Castle.
