The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as cane syrup, clinging to Amelia Jean Dupree like a second skin.  The cicadas, a relentless, buzzing orchestra, competed with the rhythmic thwack of Amelia Jean's own heels against the cracked asphalt of Bayou Teche Road.

Amelia Jean, however, harbored considerably less optimism.  Her battered briefcase, stuffed with brochures showcasing the miracle-working properties of "Swamp Shine" – a mosquito repellent that smelled suspiciously of turpentine – felt heavier with every step. The relentless sun beat down on her, turning the already stifling heat into a physical assault.  This wasn't just selling mosquito repellent; this was a battle for survival, one lukewarm, swampy sale at a time.
