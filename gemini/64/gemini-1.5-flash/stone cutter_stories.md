The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the desolate moor, carrying the scent of brine and heather.  It tugged at the thick wool shawl of Elias Thorne, its icy fingers finding purchase in the gaps between the rough-spun fabric.  Elias, his face weathered like the granite he shaped for a living, barely registered the chill.  His gaze remained fixed on the colossal monolith before him, a raw, unyielding behemoth of grey stone that promised both challenge and reward.  This was Cairngorm Moor, a land of ancient secrets and unforgiving beauty, where the only sounds louder than the wind were the rhythmic clang of Eliasâ€™s hammer and the occasional cry of a curlew.  He was alone, save for the silent sentinels of standing stones that dotted the landscape like petrified giants, witnesses to centuries of wind, weather, and the quiet, patient work of men like Elias Thorne.
