The scent of Bay Rum and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, barber of thirty years.  Elias, with his hands as steady as the oak countertop he leaned on, surveyed his shop – Thorne's Trim & Tonic – a haven of faded mahogany and chipped porcelain tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom. Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window, mirroring the relentless drizzle that had settled over the town for what felt like a lifetime.  The only sounds louder than the drumming rain were the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elias's shears and the low hum of the ancient electric clippers, a comforting, almost hypnotic soundtrack to his solitary existence.  Today, however, the usual quiet was broken by a nervous tapping at the door, a sound that promised to unravel the peaceful monotony.
