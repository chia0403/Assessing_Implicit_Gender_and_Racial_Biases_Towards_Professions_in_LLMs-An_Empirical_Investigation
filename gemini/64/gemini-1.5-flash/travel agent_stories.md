The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, a meager comfort against the November chill seeping through the drafty window of her travel agency.  Rain lashed against the panes of “Wanderlust & Co.,” blurring the already faded “Open” sign hanging askew above the door. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old paper, slightly burnt coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of exotic spices – a testament to the countless journeys Amelia had vicariously experienced through her clients' adventures. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the overflowing shelves crammed with brochures promising sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins.  The only sound, besides the relentless drumming of rain, was the gentle hum of Amelia's ancient computer, a machine as well-travelled as its owner, judging by the stickers adorning its casing: a faded Eiffel Tower, a grinning Inca mask, and a slightly askew kangaroo.
