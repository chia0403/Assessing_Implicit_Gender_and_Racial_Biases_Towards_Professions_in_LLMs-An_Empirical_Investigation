The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  Salt spray, thick as sea-foam, stung her cheeks, a familiar welcome in this isolated coastal town nestled between the churning grey Atlantic and the brooding silhouette of Mount Agamenticus.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the comforting scent of antiseptic and something indefinably animal – a mix of wet fur, woodsmoke, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  The clinic itself was a rambling Victorian, its once-grand façade now weathered and worn, mirroring the quiet desperation clinging to the edges of Alder Creek itself.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting hum of the clinic was absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the old sign above the door groaning in the wind.
