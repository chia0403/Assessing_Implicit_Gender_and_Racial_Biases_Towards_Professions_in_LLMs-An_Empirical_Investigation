The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  Mildred, a woman whose sensible cardigan seemed to absorb the anxieties of a thousand clients, squinted at the screen, a half-eaten tuna salad sandwich precariously balanced on a stack of tax forms.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer ink, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation â€“ a familiar perfume in the cramped, windowless office nestled above a laundromat on the bustling, yet somehow forgotten, corner of Elm and Sycamore Streets in the heart of Millbridge, Ohio.  The year was 2024, and April 15th loomed like a fiscal guillotine.
