The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind that howled outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of "Finch & Stitch," a tiny tailor's shop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the old quarter of Prague.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a man whose nimble fingers were as familiar with the intricacies of a French seam as they were with the subtle nuances of human emotion, meticulously pressed a velvet cuff.  The shop itself was a testament to Elias's meticulous nature: every tool, every spool of thread, every scrap of fabric was arranged with a precision that bordered on obsessive.  The only hint of chaos was a half-finished commission draped over a worn wooden chair â€“ a flamboyant crimson coat, its velvet shimmering like a captured sunset, awaiting its final embellishments.  Outside, the city thrummed with its usual chaotic energy, but within these four walls, a quiet, almost reverent calm reigned.
