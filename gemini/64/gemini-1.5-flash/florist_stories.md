The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the biting November wind rattling the windowpanes of "Petals & Promises."  Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, owner and sole proprietor of the quaint little flower shop nestled on the cobbled side street of Oakhaven, shivered, pulling her thick wool cardigan tighter around her.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading autumn light into a hazy watercolour of greys and browns.  Inside, however, a riot of colour exploded: deep crimson roses jostled with sunshine-yellow sunflowers, their vibrant hues a defiant stand against the melancholic weather outside.  Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate purple from handling hyacinths, carefully arranged a spray of winter berries into a festive wreath, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The annual Oakhaven Christmas market was just days away, and Amelia, despite the looming deadline, felt a familiar pang of anxious excitement. This year, more than ever, she needed it to be a success.
