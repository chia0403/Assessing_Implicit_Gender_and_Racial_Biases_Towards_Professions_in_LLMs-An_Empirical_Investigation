The diesel engine coughed, a low, guttural sound that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' worn leather boots.  He gripped the worn steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the Big Rig affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," her chrome gleaming dully under the sodium glare of a Nevada highway rest stop.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering sweetness of cheap motel room air freshener.  Bart, his face etched with the lines of countless sunrises and sunsets witnessed from behind the wheel, squinted at the swirling dust devils dancing across the cracked asphalt.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of the Mojave Desert stretched before him, a shimmering, heat-hazed canvas under the bruised purple of the approaching twilight.  His next delivery – a load of microchips destined for a data center in Los Angeles – felt a million miles away, a distant promise in the heart of this desolate landscape.
