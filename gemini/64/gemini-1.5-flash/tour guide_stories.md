The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony from the emerald canopy that draped over the ancient Mayan ruins of Xunantunich.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Hernandez’s brow, clinging to the collar of her crisp, white linen shirt.  The midday sun beat down relentlessly, turning the weathered limestone of the El Castillo pyramid into a shimmering mirage.  Amelia adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, its contents – a battered copy of "The Mayan Civilization," a water bottle half-full of tepid water, and a handful of slightly sticky pamphlets – a familiar weight against her side. Another tour group was due any minute, and the whispers of history, barely audible above the cicadas, urged her to be ready.  Today, Amelia was determined to make this their most unforgettable journey yet into the heart of the Belizean jungle.
