The chipped paint of the "Nutritious Nibblers" sign flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sensible, navy blue cardigan as a gust of wind whipped down Bleecker Street.  October in New York City had a particular bite this year, a cold that seeped into your bones and clung to the damp cobblestones like a stubborn stain.  Eleanor, however, felt a different kind of chill – the kind that settled in your stomach, a knot of professional unease.  Her tiny, almost comically cramped office, sandwiched between a laundromat perpetually smelling of fabric softener and a bodega overflowing with suspiciously bright-orange cheese puffs, offered little warmth.  The only real comfort was the overflowing window box bursting with late-blooming chrysanthemums, a vibrant splash of colour against the grey brick backdrop.  But even the chrysanthemums seemed to droop under the weight of the looming problem:  her most challenging client yet, a celebrity chef with a penchant for deep-fried everything and an even deeper distrust of kale.
