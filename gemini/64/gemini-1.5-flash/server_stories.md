The clatter of ceramic mugs against saucers formed a frantic percussion against the low hum of conversation, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hathaway’s life for the past five years.  Amelia, or Amy as most of the regulars at "The Rusty Mug" called her, navigated the crowded diner with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer, a tray laden with steaming plates of greasy spoon goodness balanced precariously on one arm.  The air hung thick with the smells of frying bacon, burnt coffee, and desperation – a familiar and somewhat comforting aroma that permeated every inch of the twenty-four-hour establishment. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the diner, blurring the neon glow of the "All-Night Eats" sign into a hazy, orange smear. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow light on the chipped Formica tables and worn vinyl booths.  The Rusty Mug, nestled on the edge of a perpetually rain-soaked town called Havenwood, was a haven of sorts – a place where secrets were whispered alongside orders for bottomless coffee.
