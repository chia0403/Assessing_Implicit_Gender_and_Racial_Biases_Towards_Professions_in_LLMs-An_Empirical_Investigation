She was meticulously crafting a miniature replica of the Empire State Building out of toothpicks and Elmer's glue, a tiny beacon of intricate detail in the sterile expanse of the almost-empty office. The scent of coffee, stale and bitter, mingled with the sharp tang of the glue, a strangely appropriate aroma for the clandestine activity unfolding before her.  Outside, the storm raged, a perfect metaphor for the tempest brewing in Agnesâ€™s meticulously ordered life.
