The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails flaked like old skin under the relentless Florida sun.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of Esmeralda "Esme" Hernandez as she wrestled a particularly stubborn cuticle, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air inside the tiny salon hung thick and humid, a cloying blend of acetone, lavender polish remover, and the faint, lingering scent of fried plantains from the Cuban bakery next door.  Esme’s tiny shop, wedged between a struggling laundromat and a pawnbroker’s, was usually bustling with the chatter of gossiping housewives and the rhythmic whir of the electric file.  But today, a stifling Monday afternoon in late August, a heavy silence pressed down, punctuated only by the insistent drone of cicadas and the occasional frustrated sigh escaping Esme’s lips.  The only customer was a half-finished manicure on table three, abandoned mid-process hours ago.
