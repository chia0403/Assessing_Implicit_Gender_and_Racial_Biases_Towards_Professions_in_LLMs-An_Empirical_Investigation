The wind howled a mournful dirge across the slate tiles, a sound Elias Thorne, Jr. was intimately familiar with.  He perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the Victorian monstrosity, his boots crunching on the damp, moss-covered surface.  Below him, the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor sprawled like a slumbering beast, its gothic gables and shadowed eaves swallowed by the encroaching twilight.  Novemberâ€™s breath, raw and biting, whipped around him, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas smeared with streaks of angry orange, promised nothing but a night of relentless rain.  Elias, however, felt no fear, only the familiar, comforting ache in his muscles and the rhythmic thud of his hammer against the stubborn slate.  He'd been climbing roofs since he was a boy, and Blackwood Manor, despite its intimidating grandeur, was just another job, albeit a particularly challenging one.
