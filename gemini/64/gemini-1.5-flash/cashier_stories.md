The fluorescent lights of the QuickStop hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the incessant whir of the ice cream machine.  Amelia Hernandez, her name tag slightly askew, stared blankly at the rotating display of lottery tickets.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and microwaved hot dogs, hung heavy and still, broken only by the occasional squeak of the automatic doors and the muffled sounds of traffic roaring past on Highway 17.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour of the QuickStop, when the only customers were insomniacs, desperate night-shift workers, and the occasional, vaguely unsettling character who seemed to materialize from the shadows.  Tonight, so far, it was just Amelia, the endless stream of lottery tickets, and the quiet dread that only a graveyard shift could inspire.
