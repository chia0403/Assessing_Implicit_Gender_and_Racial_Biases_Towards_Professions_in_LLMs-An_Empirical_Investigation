The chipped mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Holloway’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to dispel the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her attic office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the weak light.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the gables of the ancient Victorian house that served as both her home and the headquarters of "Holloway House Publishing," a small, independent press clinging precariously to life in the shadow of its much larger, more commercially successful rivals.  The air smelled faintly of old paper, damp wood, and the lingering ghost of pipe tobacco – a testament to the generations of writers and editors who had occupied this space before her.  Mia, however, preferred the scent of impending deadlines, a fragrance all her own, sharp and invigorating, a smell that currently hung heavy in the air.
