The pre-dawn chill seeped through the cracks in the windowpanes of the “Flour Power” bakery, painting frost on the already-powdered countertops.  A lone streetlamp cast long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestones of Rue de la Croissant, the aroma of warm brioche and simmering apricot jam battling the biting November air.  Inside, amidst the comforting chaos of rising dough and clattering pans, Amelia “Amy” Genevieve Dubois hummed a slightly off-key tune, her nimble fingers expertly shaping a delicate pain au chocolat.  Her flour-dusted apron, a testament to a night already half-spent, hid a worn but sturdy pair of boots, hinting at the miles she’d walked that morning, sourcing the finest ingredients from the local farmers' market before the first blush of sunrise.  Amy, with her fiery red hair escaping its messy bun and eyes the colour of melted dark chocolate, was already lost in the rhythm of her craft, a symphony of flour, sugar, and butter, oblivious to the storm brewing outside, both literally and metaphorically.
