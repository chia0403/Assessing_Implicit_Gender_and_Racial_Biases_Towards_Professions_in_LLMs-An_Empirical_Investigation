The humid air hung thick and heavy in the kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," clinging to Amelia Josephine Cartwright like a damp shroud.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with the flour dusting her already smudged apron. The scent of rosemary and garlic, normally comforting, was tonight a suffocating perfume, a testament to the frantic energy humming beneath the polished copper pots and gleaming stainless steel surfaces.  Outside, the Parisian night thrummed with the sounds of a million conversations and the distant, melancholic strains of an accordion, a stark contrast to the tense silence Amelia maintained as she wrestled a recalcitrant soufflé into submission.  Tonight's dinner service was proving to be… challenging, to say the least.
