The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to "Shear Perfection," Amelia Katherine Finch's quaint little salon nestled on the cobbled side street of  Lavender Lane.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow spilling from the nearby pub, "The Crooked Tankard."  Inside, Amelia, her fingers nimble and precise as she snipped a stray wisp of auburn hair, hummed a discordant tune only partially drowned out by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her shears against the ceramic basin.  The flickering candlelight danced across her sharp cheekbones and the scattering of freckles that peppered her nose, illuminating the intensity in her emerald eyes as she meticulously shaped her clientâ€™s bob.  Outside, the storm raged; inside, Amelia Katherine Finch crafted beauty, one perfect cut at a time.
