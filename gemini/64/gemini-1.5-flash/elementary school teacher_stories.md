The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s classroom desk flaked onto her worn copy of *Charlotte's Web*, a tiny, ironic snowfall mirroring the one blanketing the playground outside.  Oakwood Elementary School, nestled in the sleepy hollow of Willow Creek, usually hummed with the chaotic energy of a hundred and fifty third graders.  But today, a thick, pre-dawn silence blanketed the building, broken only by the occasional sigh of the wind whistling through the gaps in the aging window frames.  The scent of woodsmoke, unusually strong, clung to the air, a sharp, unsettling contrast to the usual aroma of crayons and slightly-burnt popcorn from the lunchroom.  Eleanor, however, wasn't bothered by the quiet; it was the eerie stillness, the absence of even the faintest childish chatter, that pricked at the edges of her usually unflappable composure.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong.
