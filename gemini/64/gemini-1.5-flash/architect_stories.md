The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she perched precariously on the scaffolding, the city of Prague sprawling beneath her like a meticulously crafted diorama.  Gargoyles leered from the rooftops of centuries-old buildings, their stone faces etched with the stoic wisdom of ages, while the Vltava River snaked through the heart of it all, a ribbon of steel-grey reflecting the bruised twilight sky.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the raw chill that seeped into her bones.  Below, the construction site hummed with a controlled chaos – the rhythmic clang of hammers, the rasp of saws, the shouts of workers in their thick winter jackets – a symphony of creation orchestrated by Mia herself.  This wasn't just another project; this was the restoration of the decaying Baroque masterpiece, the Church of St. Nicholas, a task both daunting and exhilarating.
