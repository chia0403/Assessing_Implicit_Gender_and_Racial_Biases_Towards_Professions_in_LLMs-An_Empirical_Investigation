The chipped porcelain mortar and pestle sat, dusty and forgotten, on the cluttered counter of Ainsworth Apothecary.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the shop, each drop a tiny hammer against the already melancholic atmosphere.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of dried herbs and something else, something indefinablyâ€¦metallic.  A flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the shelves laden with amber jars and curious tinctures.  Pharmacist Elias Thorne, a man whose weariness etched itself as deeply into his face as the lines on his well-worn leather-bound pharmacopoeia, sighed, the sound barely audible above the storm's relentless drumming.  He rubbed his tired eyes, the faint glow of the lamp highlighting the silver threads weaving through his dark hair, a stark contrast to the shadows clinging to the corners of his normally sharp, intelligent eyes.  This wasn't just rain outside; it was a storm brewing in more than just the sky.
