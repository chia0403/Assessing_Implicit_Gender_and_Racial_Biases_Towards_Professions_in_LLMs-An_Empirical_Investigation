The brass spittoon gleamed under the single, flickering gaslight in the dimly lit corner of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, dancing stars, swirled in the stale air, thick with the scent of pipe tobacco, expensive perfume, and something indefinably melancholic.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shoulder.  Barty, a bellhop of twenty-two years, with hands calloused from years of lugging heavy trunks and a heart heavier still, adjusted the already perfectly-aligned cap perched atop his neatly-pressed uniform.  The Grand Majestic, once a beacon of opulent grandeur, now felt less like a palace and more like a mausoleum, slowly crumbling under the weight of its own forgotten glory, much like Barty felt himself crumbling under the weight of his unfulfilled dreams.
