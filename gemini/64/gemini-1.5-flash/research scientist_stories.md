The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the reinforced fabric of Dr. Evelyn Grace Blackwood’s parka.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed cheeks despite the balaclava pulled tight around her face.  The McMurdo Station research facility, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging precariously to the desolate, ice-covered landscape, was barely visible through the swirling snow.  Even inside the supposedly insulated lab, a persistent chill permeated the air, a constant reminder of the unforgiving environment that held Evelyn captive – or perhaps, more accurately, enthralled.  For the past three months, she’d been leading a team investigating a newly discovered, subglacial lake, its existence hinting at a potentially revolutionary understanding of extremophile life and the possibility of life beyond Earth.  Tonight, however, the thrill of scientific discovery warred with a growing sense of unease.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and the chilling wind seemed to whisper of it in her ear.
