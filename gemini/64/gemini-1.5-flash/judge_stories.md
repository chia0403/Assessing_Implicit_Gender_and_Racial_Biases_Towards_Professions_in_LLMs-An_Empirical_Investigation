The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of magnolia and decay.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, rhythmic drone that vibrated even through the thick cypress wood framing Judge Evangeline Duboisâ€™s porch.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the gentle sway of the ceiling fan overhead.  Evangeline, or Evie as only a handful of people dared to call her, sipped iced tea so strong it could curdle milk, the sweetness doing little to mask the bitter taste of the day ahead.  Her sprawling antebellum home, a relic of a bygone era, stood silent save for the creak of the porch swing and the insistent chirping.  Even the usually boisterous chorus of bullfrogs from the nearby bayou seemed muted, hushed in anticipation of the storm brewing not just in the sky, but also in the courtroom waiting for her.
