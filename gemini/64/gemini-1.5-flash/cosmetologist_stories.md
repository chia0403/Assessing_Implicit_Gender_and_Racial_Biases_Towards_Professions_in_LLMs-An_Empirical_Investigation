The aroma of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  Sera, her fingers stained a delicate lavender from a recent dye job, meticulously swirled a fine-toothed comb through a cascade of auburn curls. The curls belonged to Madame Evangeline Dubois, a regular client and the owner of the most exclusive boutique in the picturesque village of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.  Sunlight, filtered through the ancient olive trees shading the salon’s window, dappled the pale terracotta walls of "L'Atelier de Beauté," painting shifting mosaics across the antique furniture. The salon itself was a haven of understated elegance, a comforting contrast to the chaotic energy that Sera knew simmered just beneath the surface of the seemingly idyllic village.
