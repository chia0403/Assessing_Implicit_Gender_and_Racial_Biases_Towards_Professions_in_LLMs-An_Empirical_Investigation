The flickering gaslights of the Moulin Rouge cast an eerie green glow upon the cobbled alleyway.  Rain, a cold Parisian mist, slicked the stones and dripped from the overflowing gutters.  A lone figure, huddled in the shadows, pulled her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders. This was Madeleine Aurore Moreau, and tonight, like every night, the tremor in her hands wasn't from the chill.  It was the fear.  Fear that her voice, the one thing that kept her tethered to this world, would fail her. Fear that the whispers about her, the whispers of the *oiseau de malheur* – the bird of misfortune – were true.  Tonight, however, a different kind of fear gnawed at her. Tonight,  she wasn't just singing for her supper. She was singing for her life.
