The insistent chirping of the phone cut through the stagnant air of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, a sound Amelia Hawthorne had come to both loathe and rely on. The lobby itself was a study in faded grandeur.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the stained-glass depiction of a majestic, if slightly pigeon-splattered, stag.  Velvet ropes, once a vibrant crimson, now held a bruised, purplish hue, cordoning off a section of threadbare carpet.  Amelia, perched on her worn leather stool behind the mahogany reception desk, smoothed down her crisp, white blouse. It was 8:00 am on a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and already the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and Mrs. Henderson's lilac perfume – the permanent resident of room 203 and self-proclaimed guardian of the Grand Majestic’s dwindling reputation. Outside, the relentless New Orleans humidity pressed against the grand oak doors, promising another sweltering day.
