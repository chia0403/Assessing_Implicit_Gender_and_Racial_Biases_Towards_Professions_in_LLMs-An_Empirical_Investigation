The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice against glass.  Alexandra “Alex” Moreau, her caramel-highlighted hair pulled back in a tight French braid, surveyed the cabin of AirFrance Flight 183 with a practiced eye.

Bound for Buenos Aires, the plane was a microcosm of humanity: a crying baby two rows back, a honeymoon couple whispering sweet nothings in 12A and 12B, and a gaggle of businessmen loudly discussing quarterly reports further down the aisle.  Alex adjusted the silk scarf knotted at her neck, a splash of crimson against her navy uniform.  Beneath the polished veneer of a seasoned flight attendant, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. This flight, she sensed, was going to be anything but routine.
