Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of Chicago's skyline. The city lights, normally a vibrant tapestry woven across the darkness, were muted, obscured by the relentless downpour. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aged mahogany and the faint, metallic tang of Elias's anxiety. He stood rigidly, his tailored charcoal suit doing little to disguise the tremors running through his lean frame.  His knuckles, white against the polished surface of his desk, mirrored the stark white of the single unopened envelope lying before him. It bore the crisp, embossed logo of Thorne Industries, the company his grandfather had founded, the company Elias had bled for, the company that was now, quite possibly, about to slip through his fingers like rain down a windowpane.
