The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Rios's hands as she leaned against the greasy back wall of the Salty Spoon Diner, the pre-dawn chill seeping through the drafty windows.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the red vinyl booths and checkered linoleum floor. Outside, the only signs of life in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Nevada, were the flickering neon sign of the Desert Rose Motel across the street and the occasional rumble of a semi-truck on the distant highway. Amy took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying bacon, a familiar aroma that usually comforted her, but this morning only amplified the gnawing unease in her stomach.  It was 5:30 am, thirty minutes before the Salty Spoon officially opened its doors, but already the first regular, old Mr. Henderson, was tapping impatiently on the glass.
