The rusty nail, slick with sweat and stubbornly refusing to budge, was the perfect metaphor for Elias Thorne's day.  The August sun beat down on the slate roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian mansion, baking the air thick and heavy. Elias, his calloused fingers wrapped around the claw of his hammer, wrestled with the nail, the only sound the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* echoing across the quiet, tree-lined street of Ashworth Avenue in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Connecticut. Below him, the manicured lawns shimmered in the heat, a stark contrast to the gritty, unforgiving world he inhabited high above. Havenwood, with its prim gardens and freshly painted shutters, seemed a world away from the precarious perch Elias occupied, a world where problems weren't solved with brute force and a well-aimed hammer blow.
