The wind, sharp and smelling of pine needles, whipped through the skeletal frame of the barn Silas Thatcher was raising.  Dust devils danced across the freshly tilled earth of the Miller farm, swirling around Silasâ€™s worn work boots. Above him, the late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, cast long, dancing shadows across the Montana valley.  Silas, his calloused hands gripping a heavy oak beam, squinted against the glare.  He was a solitary figure against the vast, open sky, the only sounds the rhythmic clang of his hammer and the mournful cry of a hawk circling high above.  The nearest town, Harmony Creek, a speck of civilization nestled amidst the rolling hills, was a good ten miles away, and tonight, Silas, as he often did, would sleep beneath the half-finished roof of his creation, lulled by the whispers of the wind and the distant howl of coyotes.
