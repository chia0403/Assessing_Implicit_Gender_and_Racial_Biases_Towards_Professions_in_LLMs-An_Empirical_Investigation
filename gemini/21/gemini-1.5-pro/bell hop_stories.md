The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool, conditioned air onto the bustling Fifth Avenue sidewalk.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight slicing through the ornate brass frame, illuminating the pristine white gloves of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch.  Barty, all of nineteen years old and barely five foot six, stood ramrod straight at his post, a scarlet pillbox hat perched atop his head like a particularly flamboyant cherry.  The Grand Majestic, with its marble floors the size of skating rinks and chandeliers that glittered like captured constellations, was a world away from the cramped tenement Barty called home.  But for a few precious hours each day, amidst the rustling silks and clipped accents of the hotel's clientele, he felt like he belonged to that other world, a world of effortless elegance and hushed whispers of untold fortunes. This afternoon, however, a different kind of whisper was circulating â€“ one of a stolen diamond necklace and a guest who had vanished without a trace.
