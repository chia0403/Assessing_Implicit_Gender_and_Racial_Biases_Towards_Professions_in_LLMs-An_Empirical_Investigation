The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow across the aisles of stale chips and discount soda.  Rain lashed against the single pane window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into a shimmering smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of lukewarm hot dogs and lingering desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, tapped a chipped red nail against the worn countertop, her gaze fixed on the digital clock above the lottery tickets.  11:57 pm. Three minutes until the end of her shift, three minutes until she could escape this brightly lit purgatory and walk home to the quiet solace of her tiny apartment.  But three minutes, in the Quick Stop, could be a lifetime.
