Outside, the November wind howled through the narrow streets of Providence, Rhode Island, a city clinging to its faded colonial grandeur. Amelia, her fingers stained with cheap ink from a leaky pen, stared at the dense paragraphs of a landlord-tenant dispute, the case of Mrs. Rodriguez vs. Sterling Properties.  She knew, with a weary certainty, that this was going to be a long night.  Her boss, the perpetually frazzled Mr. Henderson, had dumped the file on her desk just before leaving, muttering something about a crucial hearing the next morning. The weight of the file, both literal and metaphorical, pressed heavily on Amelia, mirroring the weight of the responsibility she felt for Mrs. Rodriguez and the countless others who walked through these doors seeking justice they couldn’t afford.
