The biting November wind whipped at Captain Elias “Eli” Thorne’s turnout coat as he stood on the precipice of Widow’s Bluff, the flickering orange glow reflecting in his tired eyes. Below him, nestled in the valley like a glittering spiderweb, lay the town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  Tonight, Havenwood wasn't twinkling with festive holiday lights; it was choked with smoke, the acrid smell of burning pine heavy in the air. The source was clear: a raging inferno had engulfed the historic Havenwood Lumber Mill, flames licking greedily at the century-old timber framing.  The crackling roar of the blaze echoed up the bluff, a monstrous symphony of destruction playing against the backdrop of the howling wind.  Eli’s jaw clenched. This wasn’t just a fire; it was a fight for the heart of his town.
