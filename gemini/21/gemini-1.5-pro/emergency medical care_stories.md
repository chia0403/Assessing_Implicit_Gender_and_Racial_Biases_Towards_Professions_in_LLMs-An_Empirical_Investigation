The siren's wail was a lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez. It sang of broken bones, burning buildings, and the frantic rhythm of a heart fighting to hold on.  Tonight, it was a high-pitched, insistent scream, slicing through the thick, humid air of a Miami July night.  Amy, perched on the edge of the worn stretcher in the back of Rescue 71, gripped the metal handrail as the ambulance bucked and swerved through Little Havana, its flashing lights painting the pastel-colored buildings in fleeting strobes of red and white. The scent of exhaust fumes mingled with the cloying sweetness of blooming jasmine and the tang of something metallic, likely blood. Amy, a seasoned paramedic with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, braced herself, the adrenaline already tingling in her veins. Tonight, whatever waited at the end of this screaming siren, she would be ready.
