The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the "Elysium Towers," whistling through the exposed steel girders like a mournful ghost.  Dust devils danced across the concrete floor, twenty stories above the bustling streets of Chicago.

The city sprawled beneath her, a dizzying tapestry of grey and brown punctuated by the glittering shards of the Chicago River.  Elysium Towers, destined to be luxury condos, looked more like a giant metal cage at the moment, a monument to half-finished dreams.  And Milly, perched on a narrow beam with a welding torch in hand, was a small but vital part of its slow, arduous construction.  Today, however, the wind carried more than just dust. It carried the premonition of trouble.
