Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his latest patient.  The room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually exuded a calming blend of sea air and lavender.  Today, however, the scent of brewing coffee struggled to compete with the palpable tension hanging in the air.  A knotty driftwood lamp cast long shadows across the worn Persian rug, illuminating dust motes dancing in the gloom.  Elias, his brow furrowed with concern, leaned forward in his worn leather armchair, the squeak a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  He watched as Mrs. Abernathy twisted a tissue in her trembling hands, the silence broken only by the mournful cry of a distant foghorn.  Port Blossom, usually a haven of tranquility, seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the storm to break, both inside and out.
