The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne into a meditative state while polishing glasses.  Tonight, however, it just grated on her nerves. The wind howled down from the desolate peaks of the Blacktooth Mountains, rattling the single, dusty windowpane that overlooked the near-deserted mining town of Dust Devil Gulch, Nevada.  Amy wiped down the sticky mahogany bar top for the tenth time that hour, the only sounds besides the storm the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional clink of ice melting in her own glass of whiskey. It was a Tuesday night, after all, and Dust Devil Gulch wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, even on the best of days. The population had dwindled to barely a hundred souls since the gold mine dried up twenty years ago, leaving behind only ghosts, dust, and the stubborn few who refused to give up on the promise of striking it rich.  The air inside the bar was thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and a lingering hint of desperation.
