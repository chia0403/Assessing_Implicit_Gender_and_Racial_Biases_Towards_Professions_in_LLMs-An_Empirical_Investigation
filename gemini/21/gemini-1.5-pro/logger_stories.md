The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the lodgepole pines, carrying the scent of sawdust and impending snow.  Dawn hadn't fully broken over the Cascade Mountains, painting the eastern sky in bruised purples and icy blues.  The frosted ground crunched under Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's heavy boots as he trudged towards the groaning belly of the lumber mill.  Nestled deep in the Snoqualmie National Forest, the mill was a steel and wood behemoth, a monument to industry amidst the ancient, silent trees.  Its rhythmic rumble, a constant thrumming heartbeat, was the only sound louder than the wind's mournful cry.  Jed, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the thick wool cap on his head and pulled his plaid scarf higher over his weathered face.  Another day, another mountain to conquer.  Or, in Jed's case, another mountain to fell.
