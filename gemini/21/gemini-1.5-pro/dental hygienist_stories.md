The insistent Vermont wind rattled the windowpanes of Green Mountain Dental, whistling a mournful tune that mirrored the mood inside. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name stitched in crimson on her crisp white coat, tapped a manicured nail against the stainless steel tray, the metallic ping echoing in the eerily quiet office. Usually, Tuesday mornings were a whirlwind of chattering patients and the whirring of the polisher, but today, a thick blanket of snow had fallen overnight, transforming the picturesque town of Maple Creek into a glistening, silent snow globe.  The only other person present was Mrs. Higgins, the receptionist, who was knitting a violently purple scarf, her needles clicking with rhythmic precision, the sound amplified by the stillness.  Outside, snow continued to fall, piling up against the quaint, clapboard buildings that lined Main Street, burying the world in a pristine, yet unsettling, white silence.  Amelia had a feeling this was going to be anything but a typical Tuesday.
