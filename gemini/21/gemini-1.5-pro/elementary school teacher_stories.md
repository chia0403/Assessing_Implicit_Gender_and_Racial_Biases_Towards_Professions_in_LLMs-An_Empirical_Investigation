The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the window ledge, pulled Amelia Grace Hawthorne from her grading slumber.  The setting sun cast long shadows across her cluttered classroom, transforming the brightly colored construction paper turkeys clinging to the bulletin board into grotesque, elongated silhouettes.  Room 2B at Maplewood Elementary, usually abuzz with the frenetic energy of second graders, was now eerily quiet.  The lingering scent of glue and crayons hung heavy in the air, a testament to the day's frantic crafting session.  Outside, the crisp November air hinted at the approaching winter, the wind rustling the leaves of the ancient maple tree that gave the school its name. Amelia sighed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, and a stray glitter fleck clung to her cheek like a defiant tear.  This was her third year at Maplewood, and despite the long hours and the occasional glitter-related incident, she wouldn't trade it for the world.  Or so she kept telling herself.  Tonight, however, a strange unease settled in the pit of her stomach, a feeling as persistent and irritating as the robin's chirping.
