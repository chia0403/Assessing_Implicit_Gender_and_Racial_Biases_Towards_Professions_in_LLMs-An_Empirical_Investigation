The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, stinging Elias Vance's exposed cheeks despite the thick balaclava he wore.  The Wyoming sky, a vast expanse of bruised purple-grey, threatened snow.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened his grip on the jackhammer, its vibrations a dull thrum against the frozen ground.  Around him, the flickering orange cones created an eerie, isolated world within the roaring rush of the highway.  It was just past 5:00 AM, the pre-dawn darkness clinging stubbornly to the landscape.  This particular stretch of I-80, miles from the nearest town of Rawlins, was notorious for its brutal winters and unpredictable black ice. Elias and his crew from the Wyoming Department of Transportation were tasked with repairing a section of the road buckled and cracked by the relentless freeze-thaw cycle. The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel from the idling work truck and the faint, metallic scent of the fracturing asphalt.  This was Elias's world, a symphony of rumbling engines, clanging tools, and the ceaseless whisper of the wind.  A world where the only constants were the hard work and the unforgiving elements.
