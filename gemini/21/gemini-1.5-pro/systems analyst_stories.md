Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's 27th-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of downtown Chicago.  The city, normally a vibrant tapestry of movement and sound, was muted beneath the storm's oppressive grey blanket.  Inside, the air buzzed with the low hum of servers and the frantic click-clack of Cassie's keyboard.  It was 11:47 pm on a Tuesday, and she was the only person left in the sprawling office complex of Chimera Technologies, a cutting-edge software development firm specializing in AI-driven financial modeling.  Empty takeout containers littered her desk, remnants of a hastily consumed Pad See Ew, casualties in her ongoing battle against a particularly insidious bug in the company's flagship trading algorithm.  The bug, nicknamed "The Gremlin" by the exasperated development team, had been wreaking havoc for the past week, spitting out nonsensical projections and threatening to derail a crucial product launch.  Cassie, known for her meticulous attention to detail and almost preternatural ability to decipher complex code, was their last hope.
