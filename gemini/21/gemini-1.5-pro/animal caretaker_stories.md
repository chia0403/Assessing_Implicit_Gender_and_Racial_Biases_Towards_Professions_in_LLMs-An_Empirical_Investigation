The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's dark braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud of the Yorkshire Moors.  Around her, the heather-clad hills stretched towards a bruised, twilight sky, the only sound the mournful cry of a curlew overhead.  Mia pulled her thick wool coat tighter around herself, the damp seeping through her sturdy boots.  The air smelled of peat and wet earth, a scent Mia had grown to love in the five years she'd worked at the Howling Edge Wildlife Sanctuary.  Nestled in a sheltered valley, invisible from the exposed moorland track, the sanctuary was her haven, a place of quiet chaos populated by injured foxes, orphaned badgers, and a grumpy one-winged buzzard named Captain.  Tonight, however, a new arrival awaited her, one that had the usually unflappable Mia feeling a prickle of unease. A lynx.  The first the sanctuary had ever taken in.
