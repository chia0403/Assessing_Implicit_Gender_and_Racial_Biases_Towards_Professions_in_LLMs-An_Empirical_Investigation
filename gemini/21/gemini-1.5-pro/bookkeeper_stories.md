The frosted glass of Amelia Grace Holloway's office door, etched with the discreet legend "A.G. Holloway, Bookkeeping Services," rattled faintly with the rumble of the elevated train passing a block away.  Dust motes, disturbed by the tremor, danced in the weak November sunlight filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  Her office, tucked away on the third floor of a pre-war building in Chicago's Loop, was a comforting sanctuary of order and quiet amidst the city's cacophony.  Neat stacks of ledgers lined the mahogany shelves, their spines precisely aligned.  A vintage brass fan, silent now in the chill air, stood sentinel on a corner table, its blades gleaming dully. Amelia, perched on her worn leather stool, meticulously entered figures into a thick, leather-bound journal, the rhythmic scratch of her pen the only sound in the room, save for the occasional sigh of the aging radiator in the corner. The scent of stale coffee and old paper hung in the air, a familiar and oddly comforting aroma to Amelia.  Everything was as it should be.  Until the telephone rang, shattering the quiet with a shrill insistence.
