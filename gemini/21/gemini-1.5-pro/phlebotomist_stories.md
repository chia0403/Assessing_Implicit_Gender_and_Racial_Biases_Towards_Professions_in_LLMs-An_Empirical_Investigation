The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her seven years as a phlebotomist.  It was 5:45 am, the pre-dawn quiet broken only by the rhythmic squeak of her rubber-soled shoes on the polished linoleum floor. Outside, a bruised plum-colored sky hinted at the approaching sunrise over the sprawling metropolis of Chicago.  Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly over her navy blue scrub top, pushed her phlebotomy cart down the deserted corridor of the Oncology ward, the metallic clatter echoing in the stillness.  A faint antiseptic smell, mingling with the aroma of stale coffee from the nearby nurses' station, hung heavy in the air. Today, like every day, Amelia carried with her the delicate balance of professionalism and empathy, ready to face the unique tapestry of human stories woven within the hospital walls.
