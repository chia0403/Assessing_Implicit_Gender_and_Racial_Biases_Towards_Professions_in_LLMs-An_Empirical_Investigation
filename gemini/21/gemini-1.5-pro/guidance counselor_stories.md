The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, blurring the already dreary view of the student parking lot.  Diplomas from obscure online universities and motivational posters featuring kittens clinging to ropes adorned the walls, a strange juxtaposition that somehow reflected Eleanor’s own blend of pragmatic cynicism and enduring hope.  Stacks of college applications, scholarship forms, and disciplinary referrals threatened to avalanche from her desk onto the worn, floral-patterned rug beneath.  The scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral, possibly an ancient air freshener, hung heavy in the air.  Northwood, nestled deep in the forested hills of Oregon, was a town where ambition went to die, and Eleanor Vance, its lone guidance counselor, often felt like she was presiding over its funeral.  This particular Tuesday, however, promised something different.  A new student was arriving, one with a file thicker than any Eleanor had seen in her fifteen years at Northwood, and a reputation that preceded him like a storm front.
