The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a gentle, if slightly off-key, lullaby.  Sunlight, fractured by the colorful paper leaves clinging to the windowpanes, painted kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn linoleum floor.  Crayon masterpieces adorned every available surface, from the walls, festooned with construction paper turkeys and lopsided pumpkins, to Mrs. Vance's own desk, where a vibrant rendering of a purple and orange spotted dog, labelled "Mr. Snuggles," held pride of place.  Maplewood Elementary, nestled amidst the rolling hills and crimson-tipped maples of Vermont, was preparing for its annual Harvest Festival, and the air thrummed with the chaotic energy of five-year-olds buzzing with anticipation. The scent of apples and cinnamon, emanating from the cafeteria where parent volunteers were baking pies, mingled with the faint aroma of glue and finger paint.  It was a Thursday, the kind that held the promise of a long weekend, and Mrs. Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, felt a flutter of excitement mixed with the usual Thursday exhaustion.  Little did she know, this particular Thursday was about to be anything but usual.
