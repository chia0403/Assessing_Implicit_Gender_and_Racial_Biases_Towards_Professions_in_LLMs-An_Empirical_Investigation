The biting November wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of stale bagels and ambition.  Atop the unfinished twenty-seventh floor of the "Elysium Towers" development – a skeletal concrete and steel behemoth that promised luxury living but currently offered only breathtaking views and the constant shriek of construction – stood Elias Thorne, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead. Elias, a once-celebrated movie director whose career had taken a detour through a decade of critically panned rom-coms, clutched a thermos of lukewarm coffee in one hand and a crumpled screenplay in the other.  He stared down at the sprawling cityscape of Manhattan, a concrete jungle mirroring the tangled mess of his latest project, a gritty neo-noir thriller that he hoped, perhaps foolishly, would be his redemption. The sun, a weak, watery orb struggling to pierce the grey sky, cast long shadows that stretched across the unfinished floor, making the rebar and scattered construction debris resemble the bones of some extinct industrial beast. This raw, exposed landscape, so unlike the polished, controlled environments of his film sets, felt strangely fitting. This was where he belonged now, stripped bare, facing the elements, fighting for his artistic life.
