The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge. Below, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, sending plumes of white spray skyward.  Her easel, a sturdy oak veteran of countless outdoor excursions, was braced against a gnarled olive tree, its canvas as yet untouched.  The late afternoon sun bathed the whitewashed village of Oia in a honeyed light, the iconic blue-domed churches shimmering like jewels scattered across the caldera’s rim. Amelia’s fingers, stained with cerulean and crimson, tightened around her palette knife.  This was it. The view she'd traveled thousands of miles for. The scene that had haunted her dreams for months.  But as she lifted her brush, a wave of doubt washed over her, as potent as the sea breeze.  Could she possibly capture this breathtaking beauty, this ephemeral moment, on a mere piece of canvas?
