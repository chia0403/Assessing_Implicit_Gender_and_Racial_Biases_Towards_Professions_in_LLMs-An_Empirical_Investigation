The chipped terracotta pot, overflowing with dusty oregano, felt brittle under Elias Thorne's calloused thumb. He sighed, the Santa Ana winds whipping strands of his dark hair across his forehead, carrying the scent of dry earth and impending fire. October in Southern California always held this tension, a beautiful, terrible stillness before the inevitable flames. Elias surveyed his latest creation â€“ a drought-tolerant xeriscape cascading down Mrs. Rodriguez's hillside property in Topanga Canyon.  Grey-green succulents, flowering cacti, and gravel pathways shimmered in the afternoon sun, a testament to his ability to coax beauty from the parched earth. But even this carefully curated oasis couldn't escape the feeling of unease that crackled in the air, mirroring the growing unease in Elias's own heart. Something wasn't right.  It wasn't just the fire season. It was the quiet. The unnerving quiet of the hummingbirds that had vanished from his feeders, the stillness of the usually bustling coyote trails, and a strange, almost metallic scent that lingered beneath the familiar aroma of chaparral.
