The wind, sharp as a freshly honed chisel, whipped across the desolate peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed skin. Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, clung to the jagged summits, obscuring the valley below. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, perched precariously on a narrow ledge, a hundred feet above the scree-covered slope.  His thick, calloused hands, scarred with a lifetime of working stone, gripped the rough rock face.  A single rope, frayed but strong, secured him to a stunted pine further up the mountainside.  Below him, clinging to the mountain's flank, nestled among the crags and the whispering pines, lay the village of Quarrystone, its slate-roofed houses appearing as small and insignificant as pebbles from this height.  Elias, his eyes narrowed against the wind, searched the cliff face, his gaze tracing the veins of granite and quartz that crisscrossed the stone like the lines on an old man's hand. He was hunting for a particular vein, a seam of sky-blue azurite he'd glimpsed weeks before, a vein that promised to be the finest heâ€™d ever unearthed.  The azurite, he knew, could transform his fortunes, and the fortunes of Quarrystone itself.
