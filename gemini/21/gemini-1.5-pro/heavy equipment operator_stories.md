The biting wind whipped across the barren expanse of the Klondike Plateau, stinging Amelia "Milly" Reyes's cheeks even through the layers of thermal fleece.  Dawn was a pale smear on the horizon, painting the jagged peaks of the Tombstone Mountains a ghostly grey.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the low rumble of the Yukon River miles away and the closer, more insistent growl of the D11 dozer idling beside her.  Milly, perched in the heated cab, exhaled a plume of condensation onto the glass, then rubbed it clear with a gloved hand.  Below her, the frozen earth crunched under the dozer's massive tracks, a prelude to the day's work: carving a road through unforgiving terrain for the new pipeline.  This was her domain, a landscape of rock and permafrost, where the silence was broken only by the roar of engines and the cries of ravens circling overhead.  Isolation was the price of this life, but for Milly, it was also the reward.
