The air in the Bumblebrook Early Learning Center hummed with the chaotic energy of two dozen toddlers unleashed upon the "creative play" area.  Paint smeared tiny fingers, blocks tumbled, and the rhythmic thump of a plastic xylophone battled with the shrieks of delighted squeals. Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her strawberry-blonde hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the scene with a mixture of amusement and exhaustion.  Bumblebrook, nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside, boasted a pristine, eco-friendly design, complete with a sprawling garden and a miniature petting zoo.  But right now, the polished wooden floors were sticky with spilled juice, and the air smelled faintly of mashed banana and finger paint. Amy sighed, grabbed a stray block from the path of a careening tricycle, and plastered a smile on her face.  This was her life.  Messy, chaotic, and yet, filled with a certain untamed beauty.  Today, however, that beauty felt particularly fragile.  A storm was brewing, both literally, judging by the darkening sky outside the panoramic windows, and figuratively, in the form of a new, unsettling quietness from one particular child in the corner.
