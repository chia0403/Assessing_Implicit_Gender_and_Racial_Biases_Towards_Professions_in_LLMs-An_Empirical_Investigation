The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Ramirez-O’Connell’s parka, stinging any exposed skin and turning her breath into fleeting clouds.  The sky, a bruised purple fading into inky blackness, offered no warmth, only the ghostly shimmer of the aurora australis dancing on the horizon.  Evelyn adjusted her thermal goggles, the icy metal biting into her cheek, and surveyed the desolate landscape.  Around her, the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of squat, interconnected buildings, hunched against the relentless cold.  It was December, technically summer in Antarctica, but the temperature still hovered around -20 degrees Fahrenheit.  Inside the heated confines of the station’s IceCube Neutrino Observatory lab, her team awaited her report.  They were on the cusp of a breakthrough, a discovery that could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe. But out here, alone on the ice shelf, beneath the alien glow of the southern lights, a different kind of discovery awaited Evelyn. A discovery far more terrifying.
