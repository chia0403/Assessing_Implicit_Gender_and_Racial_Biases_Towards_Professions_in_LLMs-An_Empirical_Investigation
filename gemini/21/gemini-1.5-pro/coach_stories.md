The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her navy blue baseball cap.  Frost crunched under her worn leather boots as she surveyed the desolate baseball field.  Dead leaves skittered across the infield dirt, piling against the chain-link fence like forgotten dreams.  The bleachers, weathered grey and streaked with rust, stood empty, monuments to past glories and louder Saturdays.  This was Vance Field, named not for Eleanor, but for her grandfather, a local legend.  And this, nestled in the heart of Havenwood, Indiana, a town where Friday night football reigned supreme and baseball was a whisper of summer, was where Eleanor Vance hoped to build something new.  Something lasting. Something *hers*.
