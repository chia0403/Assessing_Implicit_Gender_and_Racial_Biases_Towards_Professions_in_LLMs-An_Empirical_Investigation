The mahogany desk, polished to a gleam that rivaled Judge Seraphina Iris Thorne's own composure, reflected the dying embers of a late November sunset.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes of her chambers, a relentless percussion against the quiet dignity of the Old Bailey courthouse in London.  Outside, the city thrummed with its usual cacophony – the rumble of buses, the distant sirens, the murmur of a million lives intertwined. But within these thick stone walls, a hushed expectancy held sway.  Judge Thorne, a woman whose steel-grey eyes missed nothing, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against a stack of documents, the only sound the whisper of parchment against wood.  The case before her – *Regina v. Blackwood* – was unlike any she'd encountered in her twenty years on the bench. It threatened to unravel the carefully woven tapestry of British justice and expose the dark underbelly of a city steeped in secrets.
