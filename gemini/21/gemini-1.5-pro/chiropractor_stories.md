The insistent California sun, already high and hot even at 8:30 am, beat down on the terracotta roof tiles of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s chiropractic clinic.  “The Balanced Spine” was nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat in the heart of Old Town Pescadero, a quaint, seaside village south of San Francisco.  Salt air mingled with the scent of eucalyptus from the nearby hills, a fragrance Eleanor usually found invigorating. Today, however, it did little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Inside, the waiting room, usually filled with the murmur of conversation and the gentle tinkling of wind chimes, was eerily silent. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner marked the passing of time, each second echoing the growing unease within her.  This morning, Eleanor had arrived to find a single, unmarked manila envelope propped against her front door.  It contained nothing but a faded photograph and a single, cryptic message: "The past is never truly gone, Eleanor."
