The relentless New Orleans humidity clung to Dr. Evangeline "Evie" Moreau like a damp shroud as she navigated the French Quarter’s narrow streets.  Wrought iron balconies, dripping with ferns and trailing ivy, cast dappled shadows across the cracked flagstones.  The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets, usually invigorated her, but today, the cloying sweetness felt oppressive. It was the Tuesday after Mardi Gras, and the city, usually vibrant, wore a weary, post-revelry hangover.  Confetti clung to the wrought iron like stubborn glitter, a melancholic reminder of the joy that had so recently exploded, and now faded, across the Vieux Carré.  Evie’s destination wasn't her pristine dental practice on Royal Street, but a crumbling, three-story townhouse tucked away on a quieter lane, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. This was the home of Madame Evangeline, her great-aunt, and a woman shrouded in as much mystery as the shadows that clung to the Quarter's ancient walls.  Evie hadn’t seen her great-aunt in nearly a decade, not since she’d left New Orleans for dental school.  The urgent summons she'd received that morning, delivered by a cryptic handwritten note, hinted at something dire, something far more unsettling than a simple toothache.
