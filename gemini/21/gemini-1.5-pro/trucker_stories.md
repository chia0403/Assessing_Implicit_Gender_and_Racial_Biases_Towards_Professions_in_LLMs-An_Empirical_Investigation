The cab of the Peterbilt 389 vibrated with the low growl of the Cummins ISX15 engine as Delilah "Dee" Jones eased off the throttle, letting the rig coast down the long, gradual slope leading into Harmony Springs, Nevada.  The desert stretched out on either side, a tapestry of ochre and burnt umber under the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Joshua trees, like spindly, arthritic fingers, clawed at the horizon.  Harmony Springs itself, nestled in a shallow valley, was barely more than a cluster of low-slung buildings huddled around a blinking gas station sign â€“ the only splash of vibrant color in the muted landscape.  Dee, her knuckles white against the worn leather of the steering wheel, squinted at the sign.  It promised hot coffee and clean restrooms, two things she desperately needed after a three-day haul from Phoenix.  This wasn't her usual route, but a last-minute rerouting courtesy of dispatch had landed her on this desolate stretch of Highway 50, aptly nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America."  And in that pre-dawn stillness, with the vastness of the desert pressing in on all sides, Dee felt the truth of that nickname in her bones.
