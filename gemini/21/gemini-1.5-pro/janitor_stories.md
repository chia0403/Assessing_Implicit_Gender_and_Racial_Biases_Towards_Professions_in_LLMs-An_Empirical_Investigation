The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, their sickly glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floors. Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his cleaning cart down the deserted hallway. It was 3:17 AM, the quietest hour in the building, a time when the hum of scientific ambition faded, leaving only the ghosts of experiments past and the steady thrum of the ventilation system.

But for Elias, it was simply a labyrinth of sterile rooms and endless corridors that needed cleaning before the scientists returned to their world-altering work. Tonight, however, something felt different.
