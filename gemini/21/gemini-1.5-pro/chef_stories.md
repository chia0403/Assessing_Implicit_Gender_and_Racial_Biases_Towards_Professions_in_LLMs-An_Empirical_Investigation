The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," shattering the pre-dawn stillness.  Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, muttered a curse under her breath, the delicate scent of lavender hand soap clinging to her skin despite the encroaching aroma of roasting garlic. Outside, the Parisian sky was just beginning to blush a pale rose, the Eiffel Tower a skeletal silhouette against the lightening horizon.  Esme, head chef and reluctant owner of the tiny, yet increasingly popular, bistro, surveyed her domain. Copper pots gleamed from their hooks, knives honed to razor sharpness rested on the magnetic strip, and a mountain of perfectly ripe tomatoes waited patiently on the stainless steel counter, ready to be transformed into her signature Proven√ßal sauce. Today was the first day of spring, and Esme, despite the early hour and the near disaster with the saucepan, felt a flicker of anticipation. It was a new season, a chance for new beginnings, a fresh menu... and perhaps, finally, a moment to breathe.
