The aroma of burnt sugar and coconut oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the shrill whine of the hairdryer Amelia "Amy" Rosario wielded.  Her salon, "Curl Up & Dye," was nestled between a laundromat with perpetually mismatched socks tumbling in the dryer and a bodega that sold lottery tickets and dubious-looking empanadas.  Located on the bustling corner of Bleecker and Mercer in Manhattan’s West Village, it was a tiny, vibrant space crammed with mismatched vintage chairs, overflowing shelves of hair products, and framed photos of Amy’s satisfied clients sporting gravity-defying updos and rainbow-hued tresses.  This Tuesday morning, however, the usual buzz was replaced by a tense silence, broken only by the rhythmic snip of Amy’s scissors and the ominous ticking of the antique clock hanging above the door.  Something was different.  Something felt…wrong.
