The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on Mrs. Higgins' porch railing, seemed to wink at Elias Thorne as he adjusted his tie.  Magnolia blossoms, heavy and fragrant, dripped their sweetness onto the humid Charleston air.  Elias, briefcase clutched in one hand, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the other.  He hated making house calls, especially on sweltering June afternoons like this one.  Mrs. Higgins, bless her eighty-year-old soul, had called him, Elias Thorne, Insurance Agent Extraordinaire (a self-proclaimed title), for the third time that week, convinced her homeowner's policy didn't cover acts of God related to "pesky poltergeists."  Elias had explained, patiently and repeatedly, that poltergeists weren't technically covered, or even technically real, but Mrs. Higgins remained unconvinced, her fear as thick and cloying as the magnolia scent. The wrought-iron gate creaked open with a mournful groan, and Elias stepped onto the porch, the flamingo seeming to wink again, as if sharing a secret about the strange happenings within the Higgins' historic Charleston home.
