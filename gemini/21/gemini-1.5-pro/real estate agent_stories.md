The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she fumbled with the lockbox on the front door of 47 Sycamore Drive.  Dry leaves skittered across the expansive, cracked driveway, a testament to the property's neglect.  The sprawling, three-story Victorian mansion, once a jewel of the prestigious Oakhaven neighborhood of Asheville, North Carolina, now wore its age like a shroud.  Peeling paint, boarded-up windows, and an overgrown garden contributed to its forlorn appearance.  Amy pulled her camel-hair coat tighter, the crisp mountain air seeping through the worn fabric. This listing was a gamble, a fixer-upper in a prime location, but it also held the potential to be the biggest sale of Amyâ€™s career, the one that would finally solidify her reputation in the competitive Asheville real estate market.  The problem? Convincing a buyer to see past the decay and envision the grandeur that lay dormant within these crumbling walls.
