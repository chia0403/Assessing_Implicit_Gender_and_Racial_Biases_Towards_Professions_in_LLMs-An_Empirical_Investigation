The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones outside was a constant, rhythmic backdrop to the whisper of silk against silk within Madame Elodie Beaumontâ€™s atelier.  Located on Rue de la Paix in 1888 Paris, her salon was a sanctuary of plush velvet drapes the color of ripe plums, gleaming mahogany furniture, and the intoxicating scent of beeswax and French lavender.  Sunlight, fractured by the large bay window overlooking the bustling street, illuminated swirling clouds of dust motes dancing in the air, each catching and scattering the iridescent sheen of scattered beads and sequins. Elodie, her auburn hair piled high in a complicated braid adorned with pearl pins, knelt on the polished wooden floor, meticulously pinning the hem of a midnight blue velvet gown destined for the opera.  Her slender fingers, nimble despite years of painstaking work, moved with a practiced grace, the faintest of frowns etching itself between her delicately arched brows as she considered the drape of the fabric. The air thrummed with unspoken anticipation, for this was no ordinary gown, and this was no ordinary client. This was for Madame Dubois, the most celebrated actress in Paris, and the premiere of her newest play was only three days away.
