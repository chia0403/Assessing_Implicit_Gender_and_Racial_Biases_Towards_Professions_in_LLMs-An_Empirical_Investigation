The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the chaotic chirping of crickets that seeped in through the cracked window.  Dust motes danced in the anemic late afternoon sunlight that slanted across the empty desks, illuminating graffiti carved into their surfaces â€“ declarations of love, boredom, and the occasional surprisingly accurate caricature of Mr. Thorne himself.  Avondale High, a squat brick building clinging to the edge of the rapidly gentrifying Echo Park neighborhood in Los Angeles, was emptying out for the day. The clatter of lockers slamming and the echoing shouts of teenagers faded, replaced by the quieter rumble of the city just beyond the chain-link fence that penned in the schoolyard.  Elias, perched on the edge of his desk, graded papers with a red pen that had seen better days, the scent of chalk dust and stale coffee thick in the air. He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose.  Another Tuesday. Another stack of essays about the symbolism of mockingbirds.
