The biting wind whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Abernathy Farm, tugging at the edges of Elias Thatcher's worn woolen coat.  The sun, a pale disc in the iron-grey sky, offered little warmth against the December chill.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, surveyed his land.  Rows of barren apple trees, skeletal and stark, stretched towards the distant, snow-dusted peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. The farm, nestled in the valley known as Whisperwind Hollow, was a tapestry of browns and greys, the vibrant greens of summer a distant memory. The only splash of colour came from the vibrant red of the barn, a beacon against the muted landscape.  A thin layer of ice crackled under Eliasâ€™s heavy boots as he walked, the sound sharp in the otherwise hushed stillness of the morning.  This year's harvest had been meager, and a sense of unease settled over him, heavier than the frost on the withered pumpkin vines.  Winter was coming, and with it, an unspoken fear that whispered through the valley like the wind itself.
