The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle's ankles as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Eventide Manor closed.  A shower of icy rain pellets followed her inside, scattering across the black and white checkered tiles of the grand entrance hall.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, was a magnificent beast of a house, all gables and gargoyles, stained glass and secrets. It was Agnes's domain, her responsibility, her burden, and sometimes, strangely, her solace.  The only sounds, apart from the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, were the distant crashing of waves against the rocks below and the faint, mournful howl of the wind whistling through the eaves.  Agnes, small and wiry with hands gnarled from years of scrubbing and polishing, shivered, pulled her worn cardigan tighter around her, and surveyed her kingdom.  The dust motes danced in the sliver of afternoon sunlight that pierced through the towering arched window, illuminating the portrait of a stern-faced woman in a high-collared gown. Agnes imagined the woman's disapproving gaze following her as she headed towards the kitchen, a bucket and cleaning cloths in hand.  There was much to be done before the master returned.
