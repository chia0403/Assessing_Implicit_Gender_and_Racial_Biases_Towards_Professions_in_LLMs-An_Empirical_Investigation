The mirrored walls of "Sculpt & Sweat" reflected the pre-dawn glow filtering through the blinds, painting the empty studio in streaks of lavender and rose.  A fine layer of dust motes, disturbed only by the gentle whir of the ceiling fan, danced in the artificial light.  Eleanor Vance, clad in a neon pink sports bra and black leggings, surveyed the space with a critical eye.  A rogue yoga mat lay askew beneath the ballet barre, and a stray dumbbell had rolled halfway across the polished floor.  Outside, the sleepy Florida town of Cypress Creek was just beginning to stir, the distant rumble of a garbage truck a low hum against the otherwise silent backdrop. Eleanor, however, had been awake for hours, her mind already racing through the choreography for her 7 a.m. "Booty Blast" class.  She inhaled deeply, the scent of lemon-infused cleaning spray sharp in the air, and grabbed her playlist from the sound system.  Today was the day she launched her new high-intensity interval training program, and despite the pre-dawn jitters, a surge of adrenaline propelled her forward. This was her studio, her dream, and nothing, not even a misplaced dumbbell, could dampen her enthusiasm.
