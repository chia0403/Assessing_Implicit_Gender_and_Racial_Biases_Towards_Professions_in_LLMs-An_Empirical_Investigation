The rusted wrench slipped in Elias Finch's grip, spraying a jet of lukewarm, rusty water across the cracked linoleum floor. He cursed under his breath, a low rumble that vibrated in his chest, and tightened his grip, the knuckles on his calloused hands whitening. The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of mildew and something faintly, unsettlingly sweet, like rotting fruit. Above him, the ancient pipes groaned and shuddered, a symphony of disrepair echoing through the cramped, dimly lit crawlspace beneath Mrs. Gable's Victorian mansion in the sleepy, fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine. Outside, the mournful cry of a foghorn punctuated the silence of the pre-dawn hour, a stark reminder of the town's isolation perched on the edge of the Atlantic.  Elias knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his gut, that this was no ordinary leaky pipe.
