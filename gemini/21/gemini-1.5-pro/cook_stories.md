The clatter of pans, the sizzle of butter, the fragrant steam of simmering stock â€“ these were the sounds that comprised Eleanor Ainsworth's morning symphony. Her small kitchen, tucked away in the back of the "Salty Squid," a seaside tavern in the perpetually fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine, was her domain.  Salt-laced air drifted in through the open window, carrying the cries of gulls and the distant groan of a foghorn. Outside, the cobblestone streets were still slick from the previous night's rain, and the fishing boats bobbed gently in the harbor, their nets laden with the day's catch. Eleanor, with flour dusting her apron and a streak of soot smudging her cheek, hummed along to a melody only she could hear, a quiet counterpoint to the building cacophony of the awakening town.  Today's special was clam chowder, and she intended to make it the best Port Blossom had ever tasted.
