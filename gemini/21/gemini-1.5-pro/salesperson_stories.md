The stale, recirculated air of the Budget Inn & Suites hummed against Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s temples as she tapped a chipped, cherry-red fingernail against the steering wheel of her leased Corolla.  Rain lashed against the windshield, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Barstow, California, population 22,639, wasn't exactly the epicenter of high-end kitchen appliance sales, but Amelia, armed with a catalogue thicker than the local phone book and a smile that could melt asphalt, was determined to make it work.  The flickering neon sign of the Desert Rose Diner across the highway cast a sickly green glow over the cracked parking lot.  Beyond that, the Mojave stretched out, a vast, unforgiving expanse that, in this moment, perfectly reflected the daunting emptiness of her sales quota.  She’d promised herself – and her increasingly skeptical regional manager – that this trip would be different. This time, she’d land the Desert Sands Retirement Community contract, an elusive whale in the arid sea of her sales territory.  This time, she wouldn’t leave Barstow empty-handed.
