The scent of aging paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Amelia Persephone Hawthorne inhaled deeply as she unlocked the heavy oak doors of the Whisperwood Public Library.  Dawn painted the stained-glass windows above the entrance in hues of rose and gold, illuminating swirling depictions of mythical creatures nestled amongst branches laden with books.  Whisperwood, nestled deep in the Redwood National Park, was a town perpetually shrouded in a soft mist, a place where the line between reality and fairytale often blurred. Amelia, with her spectacles perched on her nose and a cascade of auburn braids draped over her shoulder, felt perfectly at home in this liminal space, a guardian of stories whispered between the pages and the rustling leaves.  This morning, however, a different kind of whisper awaited her, one that carried on the damp breeze, promising an unsettling disruption to the library's usual tranquility.
