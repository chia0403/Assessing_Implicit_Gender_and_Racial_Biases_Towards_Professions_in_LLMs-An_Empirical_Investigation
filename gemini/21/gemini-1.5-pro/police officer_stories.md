The Ferris wheel, a skeletal giant against the stormy sky, loomed over the scene like a macabre carnival prize.  The victim, a young man in a tuxedo, lay sprawled at the base of the carousel, a single, crimson rose clutched in his stiffening hand.  This wasn't the kind of night Izzy had envisioned when she joined the force.
