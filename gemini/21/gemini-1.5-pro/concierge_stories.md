The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand crystal chandeliers.  Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking Boston's Commonwealth Avenue, turning the streetlights into hazy halos.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the oversized hearth, casting dancing shadows on the Persian rugs and plush velvet furniture.  This was Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois's domain.  As Head Concierge, Gigi orchestrated the desires of the hotel's elite clientele with a grace that bordered on supernatural.  From securing front-row tickets to sold-out operas to sourcing the perfect shade of peony for a homesick duchess, nothing seemed impossible for her. Tonight, however, a tremor of unease ran beneath her practiced smile.  A guest had just arrived, a man shrouded in an expensive cashmere coat and an air of unsettling mystery, and Gigi had a feeling his request was going to be anything but ordinary.
