The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune, a sound Eliza Jane Humphreys had come to both cherish and resent.  Cherished because it meant a potential customer, a splash of colour in the otherwise quiet monotony of her days. Resented because, more often than not, it heralded the arrival of Mrs. Periwinkle from number 27, complaining about the longevity of her hydrangeas.  This particular Tuesday morning in late October, however, the chime brought neither customer nor complaint. Instead, a gust of wind whipped through the open doorway, scattering crimson and gold leaves across the meticulously swept wooden floor of Eliza’s tiny shop.  Located on a cobbled side street in the quaint, perpetually autumnal town of Alder’s Bend, Petal & Stem was a riot of colour and fragrance, a stark contrast to the greying skies and skeletal trees that lined the street outside.  Buckets overflowing with dahlias, chrysanthemums, and late-blooming roses perfumed the air, their vibrant hues a defiant stand against the encroaching winter.  Eliza, perched precariously on a stepladder, was attempting to coax a stubborn string of fairy lights around a particularly prickly potted cactus when the wind announced its arrival.
