Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of St. Jude's, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the frantic buzzing of Dr. Elias Thorne's phone. He ignored it, his gaze fixed on the swirling grey waters of the Puget Sound, visible through the gaps in the centuries-old cemetery that sprawled across the hillside below. Seattle, draped in a shroud of mist and drizzle, seemed to hold its breath, waiting. Elias, too, felt a sense of anticipation, a prickle of unease that had settled deep in his bones since the call had come in an hour ago.  The dilapidated chapel, usually cold and echoing, felt suffocating tonight, thick with the scent of damp earth and something elseâ€¦ something metallic and faintly sweet, clinging to the back of his throat. He was supposed to be meeting Detective Isabella Diaz here, at the edge of the city, amidst the crumbling headstones and whispered secrets of the dead.  A fresh grave, recently dug and conspicuously empty, awaited them. And Elias knew, with a chilling certainty, that whatever waited inside that gaping hole in the earth would burrow its way into his nightmares for a long time to come.
