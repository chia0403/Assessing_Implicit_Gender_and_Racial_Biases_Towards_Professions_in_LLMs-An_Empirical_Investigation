The salt spray stung Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Kiss*, a rickety ferry chugging its way across the choppy waters of the Northumberland Strait.  Grey clouds, fat with the promise of rain, scudded low across the sky, obscuring the hazy outline of Prince Edward Island in the distance. Amy shivered, pulling her faded denim jacket tighter around her.  July on the Canadian Maritimes was proving to be less idyllic than the brochures suggested.  This was her third season leading tours for "East Coast Adventures," and usually, this crossing was a highlight, with playful seals popping their heads above the waves and the red cliffs of the island shimmering in the sunshine.  Today, however, the only wildlife in evidence were a couple of surly gulls battling over a discarded fish and chips wrapper, and the island itself seemed to be sulking beneath a brooding sky.  Amy hoped the weather wouldn't dampen the spirits of her twelve tourists, currently huddled below deck, battling seasickness and stale coffee. This was their first day of a ten-day exploration of the island, and Amy was determined to make it memorable, even if Mother Nature had other plans.
