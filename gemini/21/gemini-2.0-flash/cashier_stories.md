## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of "Kwik-E-Mart," a 24-hour convenience store, hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the dust motes dancing in the stale air. Rows of brightly colored snacks and sugary drinks lined the aisles like gaudy sentinels. Outside, the late August heat clung to everything like a damp blanket, promising another sweltering day in Harmony Creek, Ohio. The only sound competing with the humming lights was the incessant buzzing of a fly trapped behind the lottery ticket display.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Evelyn Bellweather sighed, the sound barely audible over the sizzle of the hot dog roller. Another graveyard shift. Another parade of bleary-eyed truckers, giggling teenagers, and insomniac coupon clippers. She straightened her slightly crooked "Kwik-E-Mart Employee" nametag, the plastic digging into her skin. It was almost 3 AM, the witching hour of retail, and Margaret felt more like a zombie than a cashier. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, willing herself to focus on the flickering numbers of the register. Anything to avoid thinking about the essay she had due in her online Literature class in just a few hours.
