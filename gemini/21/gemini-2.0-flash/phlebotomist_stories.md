Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and main character:

**Story Opening:**

The smell hit Amelia Jane Hernandez the moment she stepped out of the elevator: stale coffee, antiseptic, and a faint, underlying scent of something indefinably *wrong*. She pinched the bridge of her nose, a habit she’d developed after too many late-night shifts at St. Jude’s. The fluorescent lights of the East Wing recovery floor buzzed above, a relentless hum that seemed to seep into her bones. Tonight was shaping up to be one of *those* nights.

**Setting:**

The East Wing of St. Jude’s Hospital, a large, aging hospital in the heart of a bustling, anonymous city. The East Wing, specifically, houses the post-operative recovery ward, and boasts a surprisingly robust ICU on the floor above. The decor is standard institutional beige and pale green, designed for functionality rather than comfort. The air is perpetually circulated, a constant battle against the spread of germs and the anxiety clinging to the walls. There's a small, perpetually damp staff break room down the hall, furnished with mismatched chairs and a temperamental microwave. At this time of night, around 11:00 PM, the hospital has adopted a slower pace; the hustle has diminished.

**Main Character:**

**Amelia Jane Hernandez**, a 27-year-old phlebotomist. She's been working at St. Jude’s for five years, a job she initially took to pay off student loans and now finds herself surprisingly committed to. Amelia is practical, efficient, and possesses a quiet empathy that often surprises both her and the patients she serves. She has dark, perpetually tired eyes, but a quick smile that can light up her whole face. She wears her dark hair pulled back in a tight ponytail and prefers comfortable, practical shoes to anything fashionable. Beneath her scrubs, she has a small tattoo of a hummingbird on her wrist, a reminder to find beauty and joy even in the most difficult circumstances.
