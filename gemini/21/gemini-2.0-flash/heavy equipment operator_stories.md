## Story Opening:

The predawn chill bit at Jedediah "Jed" Thomas's exposed skin as he climbed into the cab of his Komatsu PC490LC-11 excavator. He smacked the dust from the vinyl seat and muttered, "Another day, another mountain." The digital clock blinked 5:47 AM. He wasn't a morning person, never had been, but mountains didn't excavate themselves, and deadlines, especially on government contracts, were as unforgiving as the granite he was about to face.

## Setting:

The setting is a sprawling construction site nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Western North Carolina. The project, officially known as the "Mountaintop Removal & Valley Fill Remediation Project," was an ironic misnomer if you asked Jed. It involved leveling the top of a small, eroded mountain scarred by previous coal mining operations and using the displaced earth to fill in a polluted valley below.

The site was a cacophony of heavy machinery – bulldozers, graders, dump trucks, and excavators – all kicking up clouds of red clay dust. The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and the faint, lingering odor of coal. A chain-link fence encircled the perimeter, ostensibly to keep out curious onlookers, but mostly to keep the environmental activists from chaining themselves to the equipment. Beyond the immediate construction zone, the unbroken green of the Appalachian forest stretched as far as the eye could see, a stark contrast to the raw, torn earth of the project. The small town of Boone, NC, lay a few miles to the east, its twinkling lights barely visible in the encroaching dawn.
