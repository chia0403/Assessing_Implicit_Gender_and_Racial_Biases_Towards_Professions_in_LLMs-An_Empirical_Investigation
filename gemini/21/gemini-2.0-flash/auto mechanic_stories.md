The smell of burnt oil and regret hung thick in the air, clinging to everything in Leo Maxwell’s garage like a lovesick ex. He coughed, waving a greasy hand in front of his face, but the fumes were persistent, a constant reminder of the misfiring monstrosity he was currently wrestling with. Sunlight, already weak and watery in late October, struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows of Maxwell’s Mechanics, casting the cluttered space in a perpetual twilight. Wrenches lay scattered across the concrete floor like fallen soldiers, testament to the ongoing battle between man and machine. Leo, his coveralls stained with a Jackson Pollock-esque pattern of grease and brake fluid, cursed under his breath as the bolt he was wrestling with stubbornly refused to budge. He’d been at this Ford F-150, affectionately nicknamed “Betsy” by its owner, for three days now, and Betsy was winning.

The garage itself was a testament to Leo’s life: a patchwork of ambition and accumulated odds and ends. Maxwell's Mechanics was nestled in the forgotten corner of Harmony Creek, Ohio, a town that prized antique tractors more than modern marvels. The building was a squat, cinderblock structure, its faded blue paint peeling like sunburned skin. Inside, a vintage Coca-Cola cooler hummed in the corner, perpetually stocked with lukewarm sodas. A calendar featuring scantily clad pin-up girls from the 1950s adorned the wall above the counter, a stark contrast to the overflowing ashtray and the stack of overdue bills that threatened to engulf it. Leo had inherited the place from his grandfather, a legendary gearhead who could coax life out of anything with a spark plug and a prayer. Leo had the spark plugs, but the prayers seemed to be getting lost in the fumes these days.
