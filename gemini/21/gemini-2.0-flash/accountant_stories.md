The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the meticulous dance of digits that consumed Edgar Alistair Finch's life. Outside, a November squall lashed against the glass of Finch & Featherstone, Chartered Accountants, but inside, Edgar remained oblivious, his brow furrowed in concentration as he navigated the labyrinthine spreadsheet on his monitor. His cubicle, number 37B, was a testament to order and precision. A precisely aligned row of paperclips, a perfectly sharpened collection of pencils, and a meticulously labeled filing system were the cornerstones of his professional sanctuary. Edgar was, in short, a creature of habit, a man who found solace in the predictable logic of numbers.

His fingers, nimble and surprisingly graceful for a man of his size, danced across the keyboard, reconciling discrepancies with an almost preternatural accuracy. He was chasing a ghost, a phantom two-pence out of balance in a ledger from the previous fiscal year. Most accountants would have waved it off, considered it a rounding error. But not Edgar. Two-pence, in Edgar's world, represented a crack in the foundation of fiscal integrity, a potential gateway to chaos. And Edgar Alistair Finch was nothing if not a bulwark against chaos.
