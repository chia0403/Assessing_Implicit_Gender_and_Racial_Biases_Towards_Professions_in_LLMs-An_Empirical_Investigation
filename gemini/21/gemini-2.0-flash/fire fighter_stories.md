## The Opening:

The wail of the siren sliced through the pre-dawn stillness, an insistent cry that yanked Firefighter Evangeline "Evie" Riley from the edge of sleep. She jolted upright in bed, the chill of the hardwood floor biting her bare feet as she scrambled for her uniform. Last night’s chili still churned restlessly in her stomach, a familiar companion of disrupted sleep and the gnawing anxiety that came with every alarm.

Through the window, the sky was a bruised purple, slowly bleeding into a reluctant grey. Another day was dawning over the city, and with it, the promise of danger. Evie knew better than to let herself dwell on the “what ifs.” Instead, she focused on the routine: boots on, radio checked, mind clear. She was a firefighter, and that was all that mattered in this moment.

## The Setting:

Fire Station 12, nestled in the heart of the bustling industrial district of Port Blossom, was a paradox. During the day, it throbbed with the energy of a well-oiled machine, a constant hum of drills, equipment checks, and the boisterous camaraderie of the crew. The metal floors gleamed under the fluorescent lights, and the air was thick with the aroma of diesel and strong coffee.

But as night fell, the station transformed. The clang and chatter faded, replaced by the quiet rustle of newspapers, the low murmur of television, and the restless shifting of men and women in their bunks, waiting. Waiting for the call that would shatter the peace and demand everything they had to give.

The station itself was a sturdy, two-story brick building, worn by time and countless alarms. The bay doors, huge and imposing, dominated the front facade, perpetually open and ready to unleash the Engine and Ladder companies onto the streets of Port Blossom. The station was more than just a building; it was a home, a sanctuary, and a constant reminder of the sacrifices made within its walls. It was where Evie found her family, her purpose, and her greatest challenges. It was where she truly belonged.
