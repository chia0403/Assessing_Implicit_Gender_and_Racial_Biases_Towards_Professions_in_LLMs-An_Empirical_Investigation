## Story Opening:

The chill of a November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the gates of Blackwood Asylum. Inside the cab, Dr. Alistair Finch, his breath misting on the frost-laced window, tightened his grip on the worn leather bag at his feet. He’d been summoned, rather urgently, to examine a new patient - a young woman found wandering the moors, claiming to be haunted by ravens. A story straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, he thought with a wry internal smile, but he’d learned long ago to take every patient seriously, no matter how fantastical their delusions seemed.

He paid the driver, the man’s eyes flickering with a nervous unease as he glanced towards the looming stone structure. Alistair offered a curt nod and stepped out into the bone-chilling air, pulling his thick woolen coat tighter around him. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sterile antiseptic smell that seemed to emanate from the asylum itself. As he approached the imposing wrought iron gates, a lone raven perched precariously on the top, its obsidian eyes gleaming in the weak afternoon light. Alistair shivered, not entirely from the cold.

## Setting:

**Blackwood Asylum, North Yorkshire, England, 1888.**

Blackwood Asylum sits perched on a windswept hill overlooking a desolate expanse of moorland in North Yorkshire. The main building is a formidable structure of dark grey stone, its architecture a grim Victorian gothic. The windows are narrow and deeply recessed, giving the impression of eyes peering out from behind a stone mask. High, spiked fences and locked gates surround the asylum, creating an atmosphere of stark confinement.

The interior is a maze of long, dimly lit corridors, lined with rooms and wards. The air is thick with the smells of disinfectant, stale food, and something indefinably *off*. The sounds are a cacophony of whispers, murmurs, the occasional shrill cry, and the constant drip, drip, drip of unseen leaks. The walls are sparsely decorated, often bare except for the occasional faded religious icon or a scribbled drawing, etched with frantic energy. The overall impression is one of oppressive confinement and a slow, creeping descent into madness.
