The rusty wrench slipped, taking Arthur Pendelton’s knuckles with it as it slammed against the corroded pipe. He muttered a curse under his breath, a low rumble that echoed in the cramped, damp crawlspace beneath Mrs. Gable's Victorian monstrosity on Hemlock Lane. Dust motes danced in the faint beam of his headlamp, illuminating a network of pipes that looked more like the circulatory system of some decaying mechanical beast than a functional plumbing system. The air hung thick with the smell of mildew, damp earth, and the vaguely unpleasant aroma of old pennies.

Arthur, a man built like a brick chimney himself, with a salt-and-pepper beard that perpetually collected stray bits of pipe thread, grimaced. This was his fourth time back to Mrs. Gable's this month. First, it was the dripping faucet in the upstairs bathroom, then the mysteriously overflowing toilet, then the gurgling drain in the kitchen sink, and now… this. A slow, insidious leak that threatened to undermine the very foundations of the house, which, knowing Mrs. Gable, she would most certainly blame on him.

Hemlock Lane was quintessential small-town America, a place where houses wore their histories on their gables like proud, if slightly eccentric, ornaments. The towering, gothic-inspired Victorian, complete with a turret and a sprawling, overgrown garden, was the undisputed queen of the street. But lately, it felt more like a malevolent matriarch, slowly sucking the life out of Arthur’s plumbing skills and his already dwindling patience.
