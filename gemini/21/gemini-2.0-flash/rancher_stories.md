The biting wind, smelling of pine and impending snow, whipped at Jedediah "Jed" Bartlett's face as he surveyed his land. He’d seen worse winters, tougher times, but something about this one felt different. The sky, a bruised purple over the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, seemed to hold its breath, pregnant with a silent, heavy anxiety.

He stood on the porch of the main house, the rough-hewn logs of its construction weathered silver by decades of sun and storms. The Bartlett Ranch, nestled deep in the Montana wilderness, was more than just land; it was in Jed’s blood, a legacy passed down from his great-grandfather, a restless spirit who’d carved a life out of this unforgiving landscape. Behind him, a plume of woodsmoke curled lazily from the chimney, a fragile promise of warmth against the encroaching cold. Around him, the ranch stretched out, a tapestry of fading gold and sere brown: sprawling pastures, now mostly empty save for a few hardy stragglers picking at the brittle grass; the skeletal silhouette of the old barn, its red paint peeling like sunburnt skin; and the winding ribbon of the Clearwater River, its surface reflecting the ominous sky.

Jed’s hands, gnarled and calloused from years of hard labor, tightened around the porch railing. He was a man of the land, his face etched with the stories of drought and flood, triumph and loss. He knew these mountains, these valleys, this unforgiving wilderness like the back of his own hand. But even he couldn't shake the feeling that something significant, something unsettling, was about to descend upon the Bartlett Ranch. And whatever it was, he suspected it wouldn’t leave unscathed.
