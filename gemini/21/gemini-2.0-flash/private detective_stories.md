The rain, as usual, was coming down sideways, a greasy, clinging curtain that seemed to seep directly into your bones. Inside, the neon sign outside my office â€“ "FINDERS KEEPERS DETECTIVE AGENCY" - buzzed with a frantic, flickering energy, the only vibrant thing for blocks. I sat hunched in my creaky swivel chair, the springs groaning a mournful tune, nursing a lukewarm coffee that tasted suspiciously of burnt rubber. This was Tuesday night in Duskview, and Tuesdays in Duskview were always the same: miserable, forgotten, and smelling faintly of disappointment.

My name is Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, and I am, for lack of a better term, a private detective. Or, at least, I try to be. Truth is, in a town like Duskview, most folks are too broke to need a detective, and those who aren't usually have skeletons so well-buried they'd need an archeological dig to unearth them. The phone hadn't rung all day, and my stomach was starting to rumble a complaint loud enough to rival the garbage truck rumbling down Biddle Street outside. Duskview, you see, wasn't just a place; it was a state of being. A damp, grey, perpetually on-the-verge-of-collapse state of being. It clung to the ragged edge of the industrial belt, a forgotten stepchild of a bygone era, where the factories had long since closed and the dreams had long since rusted. My office, situated above O'Malley's Irish Pub (at least they still served a decent pint), reflected this perfectly: peeling wallpaper, a perpetually flickering lamp, and the distinct odor of forgotten promises.
