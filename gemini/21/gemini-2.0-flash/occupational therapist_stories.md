**Opening:**

The air in Mrs. Hawthorne's sunroom was thick with the scent of jasmine and impending doom. Amelia Jane Cartwright, Occupational Therapist, adjusted the collar of her starched white blouse, the fabric suddenly feeling constricting. She wasn’t usually this nervous. Her job involved helping people regain independence after debilitating illnesses or injuries; it was challenging, rewarding, and typically didn't involve a frail, ninety-year-old woman staring at her with the intensity of a hawk sizing up its prey.

**Setting:**

The Hawthorne residence, nestled deep within the affluent suburb of Oakwood Crest, was a study in faded grandeur. Once a sprawling estate, the grounds had been whittled down over the years, but the house still retained an air of stately elegance – albeit one dulled by years of neglect. The rose bushes that climbed the weathered brick walls were overgrown and choked with weeds, and the paint on the window frames was peeling like sunburnt skin.

Inside, the sunroom was a pocket of relative brightness, though even here, shadows lurked in the corners. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the threadbare patches on the ornate Persian rug. Wicker furniture, once meticulously arranged, was now askew, and a half-finished tapestry lay abandoned on a small side table, the needle still threaded with a vibrant, but now dusty, length of yarn. The room smelled of lavender potpourri, a faint, almost desperate attempt to mask the underlying scent of age and stagnation.
