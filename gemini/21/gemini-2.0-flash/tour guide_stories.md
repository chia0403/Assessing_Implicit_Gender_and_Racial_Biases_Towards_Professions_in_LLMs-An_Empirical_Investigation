## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

The salt spray stung Amelia Jane Seabrook's face as she squinted out at the churning grey of the North Sea. Another day, another gaggle of camera-toting tourists, and another prayer to St. Magnus for cooperative weather. Her waterproof jacket did little to cut the wind whipping off the water, a constant reminder of the unforgiving beauty of the Orkney Islands. She adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, its metallic gleam a stark contrast to the weathered stone of the ancient Maeshowe chambered cairn behind her.

"Welcome, everyone, to Maeshowe," Amelia's voice boomed, amplified and slightly distorted by the wind. "A neolithic wonder that whispers tales of Vikings, ancient rituals, and mysteries yet to be uncovered." She gave a practiced smile, hoping it appeared genuine despite the bone-chilling dampness seeping into her boots. Most tourists just wanted to see the famous Viking graffiti. Amelia wanted them to feel the breath of history, the connection to the people who had built this place, who had lived and died under these very stones. Today, however, felt like a battle she was destined to lose.

**Setting:**

The story is set on **Mainland Orkney**, one of the northernmost islands of Scotland, in the present day. The Orkney Islands are a rugged and windswept archipelago steeped in history and mythology. The landscape is dominated by rolling green hills, dramatic cliffs, and the ever-present sea. Ancient standing stones, cairns, and Viking settlements dot the landscape, a testament to the islands' rich and complex past.

Specifically, the opening scene takes place at **Maeshowe**, a neolithic chambered cairn built over 5000 years ago. The cairn is a large, grassy mound with a stone-lined entrance passage leading to a central chamber. Inside, Viking runes are carved into the walls, remnants of a 12th-century raid when the Vikings used the tomb as shelter. The area surrounding Maeshowe is open and exposed, often swept by strong winds. The weather is unpredictable, shifting rapidly from sunshine to rain and back again. The air is thick with the scent of salt and the earthy aroma of the surrounding moorland.
