## Story Opening:

The cloying scent of bubblegum fluoride threatened to choke Abigail Lillian Penhaligon. It was Tuesday, which meant the dreaded "Ortho Blitz" at Gentle Smiles Dental, and the air hung thick and sweet, a constant reminder of the tiny, anxious faces she'd be scraping, polishing, and coaxing good oral hygiene from for the next eight hours. Abigail suppressed a sigh, adjusted her mask, and glanced at the clock. 8:02 AM. Two minutes behind schedule already. Mr. Henderson, notorious for being punctual, and even more notorious for having enough plaque to rival the Grand Canyon, was probably pacing a hole in the faux-wood linoleum of the waiting room.

## Setting:

The setting is Gentle Smiles Dental, located in the small, somewhat rundown town of Havenwood, nestled in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia. The clinic itself is a one-story building, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, turquoise blue. Inside, the d√©cor attempts a calming beach theme, with posters of serene ocean scenes and seashell-shaped soap dispensers, but the overall effect is more "landlocked retirement community" than "tropical paradise."

The specific scene is Abigail's operatory, one of three in the clinic. It's a small, sterile space dominated by the imposing dental chair, covered in a cracked and peeling (but meticulously cleaned) vinyl. Stainless steel instruments glint under the harsh fluorescent lighting. A cluttered countertop holds a dizzying array of brushes, pastes, picks, and floss, all meticulously organized (Abigail's one concession to her otherwise chaotic life). A small window, perpetually fogged over, offers a hazy view of the parking lot and the gas station across the street. The air, as always, is a cocktail of bleach, fluoride, and nervous apprehension.
