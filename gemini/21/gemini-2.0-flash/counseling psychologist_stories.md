## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee clung to the air in Dr. Evelyn Mallory’s cramped office, a smell she'd grown accustomed to ignoring. It masked, somewhat successfully, the less pleasant aroma of stale desperation and anxiety that often lingered in the wake of her patients. Today, though, the coffee smell wasn’t working. Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose, her temples throbbing in a dull, insistent rhythm. She'd spent the last hour listening to Mr. Henderson recount, in excruciating detail, his fear that squirrels were spying on him, and the sheer volume of delusional paranoia had left her feeling strangely…contaminated. 

She glanced at the digital clock on her desk: 11:57 AM. Three minutes until her next appointment. Three minutes to center herself, to summon the well of empathy she needed to navigate another person’s emotional labyrinth. Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy, auburn bun. She closed her eyes, picturing the calming grey of the Pacific Ocean – her sanctuary, a world away from this beige-walled reality.

A hesitant knock on the door shattered her brief respite. “Come in,” she called out, bracing herself.

## Setting:

Dr. Evelyn Mallory's counseling practice, "Open Minds Counseling," is located in a converted Victorian house in the somewhat gentrified, but still rough-around-the-edges, neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn. The building, painted a peeling shade of off-white, stands defiantly amidst rows of newly renovated brownstones, a testament to the neighborhood's stubbornly resistant character.

Inside, Evelyn's office is small and cluttered, reflecting her own organized chaos. Mismatched furniture, salvaged from antique shops and flea markets, fills the space. A faded Persian rug softens the worn hardwood floors. Bookshelves overflow with tomes on psychology, philosophy, and even a surprising number of mystery novels. A framed print of Edward Hopper’s “Nighthawks” hangs askew on the wall, a silent observer to the countless dramas that unfold within the room.

The overall effect is warm and inviting, a deliberate attempt to create a safe and non-threatening environment for her patients. But the perpetually half-empty coffee pot, the overflowing in-box on her desk, and the faint scent of anxiety in the air betray the relentless pressure and emotional toll that come with being a counseling psychologist in the heart of New York City.
