The air hung thick and heavy, a wool blanket woven with exhaust fumes and the grit of a hundred unfinished projects. It pressed down on everything in Liberty City, New Jersey, on this particular Tuesday morning. Steam rose from the grates, mimicking the frustration simmering in Anthony "Tony" Demarco's gut. He slammed the door of his beat-up Ford F-150, the dent on the passenger side a silent testament to a close encounter with a rogue dumpster last winter. Across the street, the skeletal frame of the Liberty Tower, a glass and steel behemoth clawing at the sky, dominated the skyline. Tony took a swig of lukewarm coffee, the grounds clinging stubbornly to the roof of his mouth, and surveyed his kingdom for the day.

The Liberty Tower was going to be the jewel of Liberty City, a glittering symbol of its rebirth. Or, at least, that's what the newspapers and the blowhards in suits kept saying. To Tony, it was just another job, just another mountain of steel and concrete that needed to be wrangled into submission. But this oneâ€¦this one felt different. There was a tension in the air, a low hum of unease that buzzed under the surface of the usual construction cacophony. Maybe it was just the pressure of the deadlines, the city breathing down their necks to get this thing finished before the upcoming mayoral election. Or maybe, Tony thought, it was something else entirely.
