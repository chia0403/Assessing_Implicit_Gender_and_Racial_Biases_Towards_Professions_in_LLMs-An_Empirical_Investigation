## Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The Sugarplum Bakery, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of the whimsical, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air always smelled faintly of salt, mingled with the sweet, comforting aroma of vanilla and baking spice emanating from the open doorway. Worn wooden tables, each adorned with a tiny vase holding a single, brightly-colored daisy, lined the walls. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and highlighting the intricate details of the gingerbread houses that lined a shelf behind the counter.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Beatrix "Bea" Eleanor Plumtree, cake decorator extraordinaire, barely looked up from the gravity-defying, three-tiered creation she was painstakingly frosting. Her tongue was caught between her teeth in concentration, her brow furrowed, as she delicately piped a shimmering, edible pearl onto a sugar-spun rose. The radio, tuned to a local station, played a jaunty sea shanty, a counterpoint to the tense silence of the kitchen.

Bea had been working on this cake – a wedding cake for the eccentric owner of the local lighthouse – since dawn. It was supposed to resemble a crashing wave, complete with edible seaweed and tiny, sugar-shelled mermaids. So far, it looked less like a majestic seascape and more like a sugar-saturated disaster zone.

“Just a little more… almost there…” she muttered to herself, her hand trembling slightly as she positioned the final pearl. Then, with a sickening *thump*, the entire top tier shifted, threatening to topple the whole magnificent, sugary mess. Bea gasped, her heart leaping into her throat. “Oh, sugar plums!”
