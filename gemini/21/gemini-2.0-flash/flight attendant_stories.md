## Story Opening:

The cabin lights dimmed, a soft blue imitating the twilight sky even though it was barely past noon. A sigh, barely audible over the gentle hum of the 787’s engines, escaped the lips of Amelia Rose Dubois. This was her favorite part of the flight – that brief lull after the chaotic flurry of takeoff, when passengers settled into their seats, clutching blankets and plugging in headphones, lost in their own private worlds.

Amelia ran a practiced hand down her immaculate navy blazer, checking for stray wrinkles. It was hour eight of a thirteen-hour flight from London Heathrow to Singapore Changi, and fatigue, that familiar unwelcome companion, was starting to creep in. But she wouldn't let it show. "Your comfort is our priority," that was the Skyward Airlines motto, and Amelia took it seriously. Even if her own comfort was rapidly dwindling.

She smiled, a bright, professional smile, and began her walk down the aisle, offering extra pillows and bottled water, a silent guardian angel ensuring the temporary tranquility of her charges. She paused at seat 24B, where a small boy was struggling with his seatbelt.

"Need a little help there, sweetheart?" Amelia asked, her voice warm and soothing, the kind that could calm even the most turbulence-prone passenger.

He shook his head stubbornly, tears welling in his eyes. "I can do it!" he insisted, his voice barely a whisper.

Amelia knelt beside him, her smile softening. "Of course you can. But sometimes even the bravest pilots need a little help, right?" She gently guided his small fingers, and with a satisfying click, the seatbelt fastened.

"Thank you," he mumbled, his face brightening.

"My pleasure," Amelia said, patting his hand. "Now, enjoy your flight."

As she continued down the aisle, a tremor ran through the aircraft, almost imperceptible but enough to make the coffee in her thermos slosh. It wasn't turbulence. It was something… else. And Amelia felt a prickle of unease crawl down her spine, a feeling as familiar and unwelcome as the fatigue clinging to her bones.
