## Opening:

Dr. Eleanor Vance found herself staring at the chipped paint of her office wall, the color a depressing shade of institutional beige that had probably been chosen by a committee with absolutely no understanding of the human psyche. The hum of the fluorescent lights vibrated in the back of her skull, a low, persistent thrum that mirrored the anxiety building in her chest. Another Friday afternoon, another cascade of referrals threatening to bury her alive. Today's stack included a boy who refused to speak to anyone, a girl convinced she was being watched by aliens, and a teacher accusing a sixth grader of "possessing demonic tendencies" because he drew too many skulls in his notebook. Eleanor sighed, the sound a deflated balloon of hope. She loved her job, she truly did. Helping children navigate the treacherous waters of childhood and adolescence was, in its best moments, profoundly rewarding. But days like these, days when the weight of everyone's problems threatened to suffocate her, she wondered if maybe she should have become a beekeeper instead. At least bees didn't require mountains of paperwork.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was located within the labyrinthine halls of Northwood Middle School, a sprawling brick building situated on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Connecticut. The school was a microcosm of the town itself: a mix of old money, blue-collar families, and a growing influx of newcomers seeking refuge from the city's relentless pace. Eleanor's office, tucked away in a quiet corner near the library, was small and functional. Books on child development, trauma, and mindfulness lined one wall, interspersed with framed diplomas and certifications. A worn, comfortable armchair sat opposite her desk, inviting and offering a small measure of solace to the anxious children who often found themselves sitting there. On her desk, amidst a sea of files and half-empty coffee cups, sat a small, framed photograph of Eleanor's golden retriever, Gus, a furry beacon of unconditional love in the often chaotic world of middle school psychology. The window, overlooking the school's sprawling athletic field, offered a view of the changing seasons, a constant reminder that even in the midst of turmoil, life continued to unfold.
