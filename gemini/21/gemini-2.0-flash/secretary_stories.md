The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Iris Hawthorne's hands, the lukewarm Earl Grey inside doing little to thaw the chill that had settled deep in her bones since arriving at Hawthorne & Croft Solicitors at precisely 8:00 am. Outside, London was a swirling vortex of grey, rain lashing against the gothic windows of the firmâ€™s offices on Lincoln's Inn Fields. The ancient building groaned and sighed with the wind, a sound that Amelia had grown accustomed to over the past five years, a sound that had become as commonplace as the rhythmic clatter of her typewriter and the perpetually disgruntled muttering of Mr. Croft.

The waiting room, Amelia's domain, felt particularly cavernous and cold this morning. The imposing mahogany reception desk stood sentinel before a row of threadbare velvet chairs that looked as if they had witnessed centuries of legal dramas unfold. A single, anemic fern, clinging precariously to life in a chipped terracotta pot, occupied a lonely corner. The only hint of color came from the outdated brochures advertising probate services and injury claims, each one curled at the edges from years of handling.

Amelia, meticulously dressed in her navy blue skirt suit and sensible black shoes, was the sole splash of life in the room. She smoothed down the unruly curls that perpetually escaped her bun and sighed, taking another hesitant sip of her tea. It promised to be another long day.
