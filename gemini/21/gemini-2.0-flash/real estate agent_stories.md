## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, sticky air hung heavy over Savannah, Georgia, clinging to everything like Spanish moss. It was mid-July, prime time for sweating through linen suits and battling mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds. The afternoon sun blazed against the pastel-colored houses lining Jones Street, baking the brick sidewalks and turning the air shimmering with heat. A horse-drawn carriage clip-clopped rhythmically past, its tourists oblivious to the discomfort, pointing and snapping photos of the ornate ironwork and blooming azaleas.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth adjusted her sunglasses, the sweat trickling down her temples despite the air conditioning blasting inside her BMW. She drummed her manicured nails against the steering wheel, her smile fixed in place like a porcelain doll's. "Just another day in paradise," she muttered to herself, her voice barely audible above the Beach Boys song playing softly on the radio.

Paradise, in Bea's world, meant pushing multimillion-dollar properties on tourists and retirees eager to buy into the Savannah dream. Today's paradise, however, felt more like purgatory. She was parked across from the haunted Mercer Williams House, waiting for the buyer for the Carmichael Estate to arrive. He was late. Again. And Bea Ainsworth, Savannah's top-selling real estate agent for the last five years, was starting to feel the first cracks in her carefully constructed facade. She hadn't built her empire on waiting, and the ghost of Danny Hansford wasn't exactly keeping her company.
