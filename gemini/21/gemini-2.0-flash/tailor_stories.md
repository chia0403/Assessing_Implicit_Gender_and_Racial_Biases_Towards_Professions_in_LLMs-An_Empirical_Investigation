The needle, a silver sliver in Elias Thistlewood's calloused fingers, danced a practiced waltz across the emerald velvet. The low hum of the gas lamps lining his shop window was a comforting drone against the rising crescendo of London’s evening traffic outside. Elias paused, his brow furrowed as he examined the meticulously-stitched seam. He’d been working on this gown for Lady Beatrice Ashworth for the better part of a week, and it had to be perfect. Lady Ashworth demanded perfection.

Elias Thistlewood's tailoring shop, "Thistlewood & Son," though the "Son" had been painted out years ago, occupied a narrow storefront on a bustling but slightly less fashionable street just off Regent Street. The year was 1888. Inside, bolts of richly colored fabrics – silks, wools, and velvets – lined the walls, radiating warmth and opulence. Spools of thread in every conceivable hue sat organized in neat rows. Sketches of fashionable designs, some his own, some clipped from magazines, were pinned haphazardly to a corkboard behind his workbench. The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, pressed linen, and a faint undercurrent of lavender, the preferred scent for masking the less pleasant smells of the city that often drifted in through the cracks in the ill-fitting windows.
