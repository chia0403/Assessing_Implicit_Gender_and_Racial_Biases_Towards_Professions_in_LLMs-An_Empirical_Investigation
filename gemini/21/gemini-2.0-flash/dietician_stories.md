The stale air of the clinic clung to Amelia Rose Bennett like a second skin. She took a deep breath, trying to fight off the creeping feeling of being swallowed whole by beige. Beige walls, beige linoleum, beige promises of a healthier tomorrow. Even the motivational posters, depicting smiling families happily devouring broccoli florets, seemed to fade into the monochromatic landscape.

Amelia had always imagined her life as a kaleidoscope of vibrant flavors and empowering knowledge, not a soul-crushing symphony of taupe. But here she was, in the basement of the St. Jude's Wellness Center, a small, underfunded clinic in the forgotten corner of Cedar Creek, Iowa, battling bad eating habits and battling, if she was honest with herself, a bit of disillusionment.

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune overhead as Amelia arranged her meticulously organized pamphlets – "The Power of Portion Control," "Demystifying Dietary Fiber," "Saying No to Sugary Drinks" – on her small, scratched desk. She glanced at her watch. 8:57 AM. Three minutes until her first client, Mrs. Henderson, a sweet, well-meaning woman whose love for deep-fried Twinkies was, Amelia suspected, the only bright spot in her otherwise gray existence. Amelia straightened her "Registered Dietitian" name tag, plastering on a smile that she hoped reached her tired eyes. Another day in the land of beige had begun.
