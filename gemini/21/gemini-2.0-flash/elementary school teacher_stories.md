## The Story Opening:

The air in Mrs. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne's classroom was thick with the sticky scent of Elmer's glue and the low hum of twenty-three fifth graders diligently (or not so diligently) constructing miniature dioramas of the Oregon Trail. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her overflowing desk, surveyed her flock with a weary but fond smile. It was Friday afternoon, the last hour before the sweet, sweet freedom of the weekend, and the usual manic energy of Room 204 had simmered down to a more manageable simmer.

Suddenly, the quiet hum was shattered by a piercing shriek. Eleanor, her heart leaping into her throat, scanned the room. It was little Timmy Perkins, his normally cherubic face contorted in horror, pointing a trembling finger towards the terrarium in the corner.

"It's... it's GONE!" he wailed, his voice cracking. "Princess Penelope is GONE!"

## The Setting:

**Room 204, Willow Creek Elementary School, Willow Creek, Oregon.**

Willow Creek was a quintessential small town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The school, a single-story brick building with a faded mural of children playing on the front wall, was the heart of the community. Inside, Room 204 was a vibrant explosion of color and organized chaos. Eleanor had poured her heart into making it a welcoming space.

Brightly colored posters depicting historical figures and grammar rules adorned the walls. Student artwork, ranging from abstract finger paintings to meticulously crafted crayon drawings, covered every available surface. Bookshelves overflowed with well-loved chapter books, picture books, and reference materials. A rug featuring the solar system lay in the center of the room, serving as a designated reading area. And, of course, in the corner, sat the now-empty terrarium - formerly the home of Princess Penelope, a beloved (and somewhat overweight) pet leopard gecko, and currently the epicenter of a fifth-grade mystery.
