Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character details:

**Main Character:**  Arthur Finch

**Setting:** The Grand Hotel Astoria, a faded but still opulent landmark in the city of Prague.  Imagine high ceilings adorned with crumbling frescoes, chandeliers that once blazed with a thousand lights but now hold a scattering of dusty bulbs, and hallways lined with portraits of stern-faced aristocrats from a bygone era. The hotel retains a certain charm, but it's clearly struggling to maintain its grandeur in the face of modern competition and economic shifts.  The lobby is a mix of old-world elegance (plush velvet armchairs, a marble reception desk) and modern necessities (a discreet Wi-Fi sign, a modern espresso machine humming in the corner).  Outside, the hotel faces a narrow cobblestone street, perpetually damp and echoing with the sounds of trams and chattering tourists.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur Finch adjusted the lapel of his subtly fraying uniform jacket, the brass buttons catching the dim light filtering through the Grand Hotel Astoria's stained-glass windows. It was precisely 6:00 AM, and the overnight concierge, a perpetually sleepy young man named Jan, was already halfway out the door, muttering something about needing three strong coffees and a lie-down.  Arthur knew the feeling. Heâ€™d been the head concierge at the Astoria for twenty-seven years, a tenure that had seen empires rise and fall, trends come and go, and a significant, and in his opinion unwelcome, increase in the number of "influencers" demanding free upgrades in exchange for exposure.

He surveyed the lobby, his practiced eye taking in every detail. A small stain on the faded Persian rug by the fireplace. The slightly crooked picture of Emperor Franz Joseph. The way the morning light highlighted the dust motes dancing in the air. The Astoria was his domain, his responsibility, and lately, it felt like he was fighting a losing battle against time and neglect. This morning felt different, though. A prickle of unease settled at the base of his spine. Perhaps it was the unusually persistent ringing of the lobby's only antique telephone, a sound that grated on his nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard. Or maybe it was the pre-dawn stillness, the city holding its breath before the tourist hordes descended. Whatever it was, Arthur Finch had a feeling that this day at the Grand Hotel Astoria would be anything but ordinary.
