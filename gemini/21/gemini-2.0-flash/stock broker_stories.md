## Story Opening:

The acrid smell of burnt coffee clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the chaos that was Thomas Ashton’s life. He slammed his fist on the snooze button for what felt like the tenth time, the insistent beeping finally silenced. Outside, a pre-dawn drizzle plastered itself against the panoramic windows of his downtown Seattle apartment, mirroring the clammy feeling in his palms. He had a bad feeling. A stomach-churning, gut-wrenching, 'something is about to go spectacularly wrong' kind of feeling. He'd learned to trust these feelings; they were usually right.

He levered himself out of bed, the silk sheets tangling around his ankles like mocking vines. He glanced at the digital clock – 5:37 AM. Too early for the market, but never too early to start fighting the inevitable. He needed a plan. He needed information. And he definitely needed more coffee.

## Setting:

Thomas Ashton lives in a modern, minimalist apartment on the 38th floor of the "Emerald Peak" building in downtown Seattle. The apartment boasts floor-to-ceiling windows offering breathtaking views of the Puget Sound and the distant Olympic Mountains, although today, only a grey, blurry cityscape is visible through the rain. The interior is a study in stark contrasts - polished concrete floors are softened by plush, charcoal-grey rugs. Stainless steel appliances gleam in the kitchen, overshadowed by a state-of-the-art coffee machine. A large, wall-mounted screen dominates the living area, usually displaying CNBC or Bloomberg, but currently showing a static image of a sleeping cat. A sleek, modern desk tucked into a corner serves as a makeshift home office, littered with stacks of financial reports and half-empty energy drink cans. Despite the expensive furniture and breathtaking view, there's an underlying sense of sterile isolation, as if the apartment is less a home and more a temporary staging ground for Thomas's ambitions.
