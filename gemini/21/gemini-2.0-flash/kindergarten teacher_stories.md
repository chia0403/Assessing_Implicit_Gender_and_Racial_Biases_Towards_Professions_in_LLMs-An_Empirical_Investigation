The morning sun, filtered through the gauzy curtains of Miss Abigail Willowbrook's classroom, painted stripes of warm light across the colorful rug. Outside, the chirping of sparrows mingled with the distant rumble of school buses arriving at Little Sprouts Elementary. Inside, however, a different sort of symphony was building: the crescendo of twenty-two five-year-olds slowly awakening from the dreamlike state of arrival, their chatter bubbling and bouncing off the brightly painted walls. Abigail inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of crayons, glue, and disinfectant oddly comforting. She adjusted the crooked "Welcome to Kindergarten!" banner above the whiteboard, a small, nervous habit. This was her seventh year, and yet, the first day always held a certain magic, a blank canvas brimming with potential, and a hefty dose of potential chaos.
