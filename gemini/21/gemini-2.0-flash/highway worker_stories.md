The setting was the kind of place where the sky was a perpetual watercolour wash of grey and the wind tasted like iron ore. It was the northernmost stretch of Highway 17, clinging precariously to the rugged, lichen-covered cliffs that dropped down to the churning, icy waters of Lake Superior. The air hummed with the incessant drone of semi-trucks hauling timber and ore, their lonely headlights cutting through the perpetual dusk. It wasn’t beautiful, not in the postcard sense, but it possessed a raw, unforgiving grandeur that had sunk its teeth into the bones of anyone who stayed too long.

The rain hammered down, bouncing off the orange cone beside which stood Elias Finnigan, hunched and miserable. He tugged the brim of his hardhat further down, trying to shield his face from the relentless assault. Elias had spent the better part of the last twenty years patching up this blasted highway, fighting a losing battle against frost heaves, crumbling asphalt, and the unforgiving bite of Lake Superior. This particular morning, his task was filling a pothole so deep and wide it could swallow a small car. He’d seen it happen once, actually. A poor, unsuspecting tourist in a beat-up Honda Civic. Luckily, they’d managed to winch the car out before the lake claimed it entirely.
