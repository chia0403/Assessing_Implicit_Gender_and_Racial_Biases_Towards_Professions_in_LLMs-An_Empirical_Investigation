The midday sun, filtered through a grimy, Victorian-era window, did little to illuminate the cavernous, dust-choked space that Eliza Bellwether now called her office. Cobwebs, thick as Spanish moss, draped from the ornate, plaster ceiling roses. The scent of damp plaster and something vaguely…rodent-related clung to the air. Eliza shivered, pulling her silk scarf tighter around her neck, despite the sweltering summer heat.

This was it. Her new headquarters. Or, more accurately, the dilapidated, forgotten attic of her eccentric aunt Mildred’s sprawling, gothic mansion in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom. Mildred, a woman whose wardrobe consisted solely of sequined caftans and who believed wholeheartedly in the power of communicating with squirrels, had bequeathed Eliza the house, along with its contents and a daunting, never-ending list of “fixer-upper” projects.

Eliza Bellwether, a woman whose aesthetic sensibilities leaned more towards minimalist Scandinavian design, was staring down the barrel of a complete and utter gothic nightmare. And, to make matters worse, her first client in Port Blossom, the notoriously discerning Mrs. Penelope Worthingham, was due to arrive any minute to discuss the redecoration of her prized Victorian parlour. Eliza took a deep breath, straightened the slightly-askew cushions on the one salvaged chaise lounge, and hoped, with a growing sense of dread, that she could somehow convince Mrs. Worthingham that she was perfectly capable of transforming a room overflowing with taxidermied badgers and velvet drapes into a vision of…well, something other than a Victorian taxidermy convention.
