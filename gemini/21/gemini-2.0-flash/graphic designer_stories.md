The biting wind whipped off the grey waters of Puget Sound, stinging Amelia Thorne's cheeks as she hurried down Alaskan Way. The ferry horn bellowed a mournful note, swallowed almost instantly by the cacophony of the Seattle waterfront. She clutched her insulated coffee cup tighter, its lukewarm comfort doing little to thaw her fingers, already numb despite the fingerless gloves she wore. It was a Tuesday morning in early December, the kind that felt like a permanent twilight, and the festive lights strung haphazardly across the awnings of tourist shops only served to highlight the gloom.

Amelia, a freelance graphic designer with a penchant for bold typography and an aversion to early mornings, was late. Again. She’d hit snooze one too many times after a late-night brainstorming session fueled by cheap instant ramen and questionable documentaries about the history of the serif. Now, she was sprinting (well, as much as one could sprint in a bulky wool coat and Doc Martens) to meet Mr. Henderson at “The Kraken’s Kettle,” a tourist trap masquerading as a coffee shop, known for its over-sweetened lattes and strategically placed plush octopi. He was a notoriously punctual, notoriously demanding client, and the prospect of facing his disapproving stare before she even had a chance to properly caffeinate filled her with a quiet dread. This particular project, redesigning the logo for his clam chowder company, "Henderson's Hook, Line & Sinker," was proving more challenging than she’d anticipated, and the pressure was starting to mount.
