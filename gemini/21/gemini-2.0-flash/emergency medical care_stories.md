## The Stethescope's Whisper

**Setting:** A cramped, dimly lit alleyway behind the "Salty Siren" bar in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof overhead, turning the already greasy cobblestones into a treacherous skating rink. The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, jasmine from the overflowing planters lining the back of the bar, and something vaguely metallic that hung heavy on the tongue.

**Opening:**

The rasp of a frantic call crackled over the radio, jolting **Dr. Evelyn Grace Dubois** awake. She hadn't realized she'd even dozed off, the rhythmic drone of the rain a deceptive lullaby amidst the chaos of Mardi Gras weekend. With a groan, she straightened in the cramped ambulance seat, the worn vinyl squeaking beneath her. "Unit 7, report to alleyway behind Salty Siren, possible GSW. Repeat, possible GSW. Proceed with caution."

Evelyn scrubbed a hand across her tired eyes. Gunshot wound in the Quarter during Mardi Gras? Unfortunately, that was far from unexpected. "Copy that, dispatch," she replied, her voice roughened by fatigue and too much coffee. "En route." She reached for the ignition, the familiar weight of the stethoscope around her neck a comforting constant in a night already spiraling towards mayhem. This was her city, her responsibility. And despite the weariness that clung to her like the humidity, Evelyn knew she wouldn't have it any other way.
