The bell above the door of "Shear Delight" chimed a familiar, almost cheerful tune, a stark contrast to the knot of dread tightening in Seraphina Marguerite Dubois' stomach. Outside, the coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was its usual postcard self: weathered clapboard houses clinging to rocky cliffs, lobster boats bobbing in the turquoise harbor, and the faint, salty tang of the Atlantic hanging in the air. Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of hairspray and unspoken anxieties.

Seraphina, a wisp of a woman with a cascade of fiery red curls perpetually threatening to escape their carefully pinned updo, adjusted the floral scarf around her neck. "Shear Delight" was her sanctuary, her little corner of the world where she could transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, where a simple haircut could boost confidence, and a perfectly applied lipstick could reignite a spark. But today, the magic feltâ€¦diminished. The chipped paint on the seashell-encrusted mirror seemed more noticeable, the humming of the ancient hairdryer a little more mournful. Mayor Thompson's wife, bless her heart, was due in any minute for her usual "fluff and color" before the annual Blueberry Festival, and Seraphina had a terrible feeling that today, even her most masterful techniques wouldn't be enough to mask the creeping sense of unease that had settled over Port Blossom like a stubborn coastal fog.
