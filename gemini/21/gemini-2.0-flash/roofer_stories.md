The relentless Florida sun beat down on Elias "Eli" James's back, turning the faded blue of his t-shirt a shade darker with sweat. He cursed under his breath, hooking his safety harness a little tighter to the makeshift anchor point he'd hammered into the cypress shingles. He was perched precariously on the roof of "The Conch House," a pastel-pink monstrosity that looked like a gingerbread house someone had decorated with seashells instead of gumdrops.

The Conch House, owned by a retired cruise director named Dolores Delacroix, was situated on the edge of Key Largo, where the mangrove-lined shoreline met the turquoise waters of the Florida Straits. Salt spray kissed the air, and the constant drone of cicadas mixed with the distant rumble of boats heading out for the day. Palm trees, their fronds rattling like wind chimes, offered little respite from the heat. Eli hated Key Largo, with its gaudy tourist traps and syrupy-sweet cocktails, but Dolores paid well, and right now, that was all that mattered. Another shingle needed replacing, another nail hammered, another day closer to escaping this scorching hellhole.
