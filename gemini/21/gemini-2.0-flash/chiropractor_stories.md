## Story Opening:

The Tuesday morning sun sliced through the blinds of Dr. Eleanor Penelope Albright's office like a poorly adjusted lumbar spine. It illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, each particle a tiny rebel refusing to settle. Eleanor, perpetually battling the effects of gravity and the stubbornness of the human skeleton, felt a kinship with them. She sighed, the sound lost in the gentle hum of the dehumidifier fighting a losing battle against the oppressive August humidity.

She took a long sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a necessary jolt before diving headfirst into another day of tweaked necks, aching backs, and the never-ending cycle of explaining proper posture to teenagers hunched over their phones. Today felt heavier than most. A storm had rolled through the previous night, leaving a thick blanket of humidity and a gnawing feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach. It wasn’t the weather, though. This felt… different.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Albright's chiropractic office, "Albright Spinal Solutions," was located in a renovated Victorian house on Elm Street in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The town, known for its picturesque harbor, blueberry festivals, and close-knit community, was a haven for tourists in the summer and a quiet retreat for locals the rest of the year.

The office itself was a blend of old and new. The original hardwood floors creaked charmingly underfoot, and the stained-glass window depicting blooming dogwood cast a kaleidoscope of color across the reception area. But modern chiropractic tables, anatomical charts, and a sophisticated X-ray machine filled the treatment rooms, a testament to Eleanor's commitment to blending holistic care with modern technology.

The waiting room was designed for comfort, with overstuffed armchairs upholstered in floral prints, a crackling gas fireplace for the colder months, and a selection of current magazines ranging from "Backpacker" to "Coastal Living." Eleanor believed in creating a welcoming space, a place where patients felt comfortable and cared for, even before the adjustments began.
