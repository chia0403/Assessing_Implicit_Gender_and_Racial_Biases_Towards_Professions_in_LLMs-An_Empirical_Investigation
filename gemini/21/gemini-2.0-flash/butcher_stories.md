## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill hung heavy in the air of Little Creek, Montana, a town nestled in a valley where the craggy peaks of the Absaroka Mountains scraped the sky. The scent of pine needles and damp earth battled for dominance, a familiar aroma that meant winter was loosening its grip. The only light emanated from the flickering neon sign above "Bartholomew's Butcher Shop," painting the cobblestone street in a sickly, pulsating pink.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Silas, a man built like a seasoned oak, stood beneath the garish glow, his breath puffing out in white clouds. He was already dressed in his thick, blood-stained apron, the worn leather creaking as he reached for the heavy brass key hanging from a loop on his belt. Bart wasn't a morning person, not in the slightest, but meat waited for no man, and the ranchers expected fresh cuts at dawn. He jammed the key into the lock, the tumblers clicking with a satisfying finality that mirrored the quiet sense of purpose he felt each morning before the world fully awakened. Inside, the air was thick with the lingering aroma of smoked ham and sawdust, a comforting smell that usually eased his grumpy disposition. Usually. Today, however, a prickling unease danced beneath his skin, a feeling as unwelcome and unsettling as a fly buzzing around a perfectly marbled sirloin.
