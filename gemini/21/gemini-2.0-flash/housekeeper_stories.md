## Story Opening:

The scent of lemon and pine hung heavy in the air, a fragile peace offering in the warzone that was, this morning at least, the Pemberton kitchen. Isabella "Izzy" Rosetti surveyed the carnage: scattered flour dust, a precarious tower of mismatched measuring cups, and the sticky aftermath of a battle waged with blueberries. Lord Pemberton, bless his soul, had apparently attempted breakfast again. Izzy sighed, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway. Another day, another culinary crime scene to clean.

## Setting:

**Pemberton Manor, Gloucestershire, England.**

The house itself was a sprawling, centuries-old manor, built from honey-colored stone and perpetually draped in ivy.  Ancient oak trees guarded the manicured lawns, their gnarled branches reaching towards the perpetually overcast sky.  Inside, Pemberton Manor was a labyrinth of grand halls, dusty libraries overflowing with forgotten tomes, and cavernous bedrooms echoing with the ghosts of generations past.  While the family portraits that lined the walls depicted stern-faced men in powdered wigs and women adorned with pearls, the current Lord Pemberton, Arthur, was anything but imposing.  He was, in Izzy's considered opinion, a lovable disaster area, a kindly, eccentric historian more comfortable with dusty manuscripts than the practicalities of daily life. The contrast between the grandeur of the manor and the slightly dilapidated, charmingly disorganized existence within was constant, and Izzy, in her own way, was the bridge that kept it all from collapsing.
