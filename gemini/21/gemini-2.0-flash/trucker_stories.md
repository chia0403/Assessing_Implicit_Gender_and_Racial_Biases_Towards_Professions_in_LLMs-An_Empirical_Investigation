The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated under Jedediah "Jed" Calhoun's calloused palm. He’d killed the engine an hour ago, but the phantom rumble of eighteen wheels on asphalt still hummed in his bones. Outside, the Flying J in Tucumcari, New Mexico, shimmered under the relentless midday sun. Heat waves danced off the chrome stacks of parked rigs, making the air thick enough to chew. Inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle, circulating a tepid, stale breeze that carried the mingled aromas of stale coffee, deep-fried grease, and something vaguely floral that probably masqueraded as air freshener.

Jedediah pushed aside the crumpled napkin and the lingering remnants of his lukewarm chicken fried steak and sighed. He’d been on the road for fifteen hours straight, hauling a load of avocados from California to Dallas. Dallas. Just the word felt like a weight in his chest. He was supposed to be meeting his daughter, Lily, there tomorrow. He ran a thumb over the worn silver band on his ring finger, a band that had seen better days, much like himself. He wasn't sure he was ready. He wasn’t sure he’d ever be ready.
