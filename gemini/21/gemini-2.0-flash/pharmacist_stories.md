Okay, here's a story opening with a pharmacist as the main character:

**Setting:** The story opens on a blustery Tuesday evening in late October in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air smells of salt and decaying leaves, and the wind whips off the harbor, rattling the windows of the weathered clapboard buildings lining Main Street. The sky is a bruised purple, threatening rain.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Port Blossom Pharmacy & General Store" jingled, a familiar sound that barely registered with Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth as she meticulously counted out thirty tablets of amlodipine besylate. Outside, the wind howled, making the old building groan like a weary sailor. Eleanor, though, remained focused, her brow furrowed in concentration. The pharmacy, usually bustling with activity during the day, was now hushed except for the rhythmic whir of the refrigerator storing vaccines and the occasional creak of the floorboards.

Eleanor finished counting, meticulously double-checking her work against the prescription clutched in her hand. She was a stickler for details, a trait that had served her well in her twenty years of running the pharmacy - a legacy passed down from her grandfather, who had first set up shop in Port Blossom back in the 1940s.

"Just needs to be right," she muttered to herself, adhering the label to the bottle with a practiced flick of her wrist. A comforting ritual in a world that felt increasingly chaotic. 

Suddenly, the lights flickered, plunging the pharmacy into near darkness for a heart-stopping second before sputtering back to life. Eleanor gasped, her hand flying to her chest.

"Lord," she breathed, her voice echoing in the sudden quiet. "Not another power outage. Not tonight."

A low rumble of thunder echoed in the distance, a promise of worse to come. Eleanor glanced at the clock above the cash register. Closing time was only an hour away, but she had a feeling this night was far from over. And as she looked towards the front of the store, a shadowy figure could be seen outside, struggling against the wind towards the entrance.
