The stale scent of paper and dust motes hung thick in the air of "Grimshaw & Finch, Outfitters to the Gentleman Adventurer." For Penelope Abigail Higgins, this aroma was as comforting as a cup of Earl Grey on a rainy day. The shop, with its mahogany display cases crammed with pith helmets, meticulously rolled maps, and gleaming brass compasses, was Penelope's sanctuary.

Penelope, a woman of unwavering routine and a disconcertingly sharp eye for detail, was the heart and soul of Grimshaw & Finch, though few beyond the owner and a handful of delivery boys knew it. Hidden away in a cramped back office, illuminated by a single, perpetually flickering gas lamp, she kept the ledgers. Her domain was a chaotic landscape of overflowing receipts, ink-stained quill pens, and precariously stacked tomes bound in cracked leather.

Outside, the London of 1888 throbbed with a vitality that only occasionally leaked through the thick oak door of her office. The rumble of hansom cabs, the hawkers' cries, and the distant strains of a barrel organ were all filtered through the layers of brick and time that seemed to cling to Grimshaw & Finch. Here, in her quiet haven, Penelope reigned supreme, queen of the meticulously balanced ledger, the defender of double-entry bookkeeping, and, unbeknownst to her yet, about to stumble upon a discrepancy that would lead her far beyond the familiar comfort of her dusty desk.
