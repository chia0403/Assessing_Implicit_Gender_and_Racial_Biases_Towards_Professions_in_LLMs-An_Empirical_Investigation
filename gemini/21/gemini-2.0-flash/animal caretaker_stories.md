## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the scents of damp earth, blooming jasmine, and something undeniably…pongy. Eleanor Beatrice Plumtree, caretaker and resident whisperer of the "Havenwood Wildlife Rehabilitation Center," inhaled deeply, wrinkles crinkling around her kind, hazel eyes. It was a symphony of smells she knew intimately; the familiar aroma of her life.

A shrill screech pierced the morning stillness, causing Eleanor to quicken her pace. "Alright, alright, Bartholomew," she muttered, adjusting the strap of her worn canvas bag across her shoulder. "No need to wake the whole forest, you cantankerous old barn owl." Bartholomew, as usual, ignored her and screeched again, his voice echoing through the towering pines that surrounded the Center.

## Setting:

Havenwood Wildlife Rehabilitation Center was a haven, both literally and figuratively. Nestled deep within a protected section of the Redwood National Park, the Center was a sprawling collection of weathered wooden structures connected by winding gravel paths. Each enclosure, from the small cages for orphaned squirrels to the expansive pens for injured deer and raptors, was meticulously designed to mimic the animals' natural habitat.

The main building, a rambling farmhouse with a porch perpetually shrouded in climbing wisteria, served as Eleanor's office, a makeshift hospital, and her living quarters. Inside, the air was always a few degrees warmer, and the scent of antiseptic and chicken broth mingled with the comforting aroma of freshly baked bread. From the porch, you could hear the constant murmur of the forest – the rustle of leaves, the chirping of crickets, the distant hoot of an owl – a constant reminder of the delicate balance that Havenwood fought so hard to maintain. The setting was beautiful but demanding. Every season brought its challenges - harsh winters with animals needing extra calories to survive, summer droughts causing habitat loss and putting stress on local resources. Havenwood was not just a place, it was a constant battle to protect those who could not protect themselves.
