## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The first hammer blow echoed across the quarry, a sharp, percussive note against the low, perpetual hum of the wind. Elias Thorne barely registered it. He was already lost in the grain of the stone, his calloused fingers tracing the faint veins of silver that snaked through the grey marble. This particular slab, freshly hewn from the heart of the Blacktooth Mountain, hummed with a power that resonated deep within his bones. It was destined for something significant, he could feel it. Perhaps a king's tomb, or a goddess's likeness, something that would outlive him and his worn-down hands. A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Mortality had a funny way of feeling less daunting when you spent your days wrestling immortality from the earth.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the shadow of the Blacktooth Mountain, a jagged peak that dominated the landscape of the Kingdom of Aethelgard. The kingdom itself is known for its rich deposits of marble and granite, and its stonemasons are renowned throughout the land for their skill. Elias works primarily at the **Stonehaven Quarry**, a sprawling excavation site carved into the lower slopes of the mountain. The air is thick with the dust of shattered rock, the rhythmic clang of hammers and chisels, and the shouts of men maneuvering massive blocks with ropes and pulleys. The quarry is a hive of activity, a noisy, bustling microcosm of the kingdom itself, fueled by ambition and artistry. Barracks-like structures cling to the mountainside, housing the quarry workers and their families. Life is hard, dictated by the unforgiving rhythm of the sun and the demands of the stone, but it is also honest and rewarding for those who possess the patience and skill to unlock the beauty hidden within the earth. The village of Stonehaven, nestled a short distance from the quarry, provides a meager respite from the relentless labor, offering a single tavern, a blacksmith, and a small market where the workers can barter for necessities.
