## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Get Your Taxes Done Right!" office cast long, skeletal shadows across Bartholomew "Barry" Butterfield's face. It was April 14th, 11:57 PM, and Barry felt as wrung out as the damp dishrag heâ€™d been using to wipe down the counter for the past fourteen hours. His tie, usually a vibrant, though slightly questionable, paisley, now hung limply around his neck like a discarded snake. He squinted at the last form on his desk, a jumbled mess of receipts and scribbled numbers that looked less like a tax return and more like a ransom note written by a caffeinated chimpanzee.

He rubbed his weary eyes. Just three more minutes. Three more minutes and he could finally escape the suffocating scent of cheap coffee and desperation that clung to the air of the office like a stubborn tax lien. He glanced at the ticking clock, its relentless march a soundtrack to his mounting exhaustion.

Suddenly, the front door jangled, shattering the relative silence. A woman, draped in a leopard-print coat that looked suspiciously like it had been rescued from a dumpster, burst in, her breath coming in ragged gasps. "Bartholomew Butterfield!" she exclaimed, her voice a gravelly rasp. "I need your help! It's... it's about the goldfish..."

## Setting:

The "Get Your Taxes Done Right!" office was located in a strip mall on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa, nestled between a payday loan establishment and a nail salon that perpetually smelled of acetone. The office itself was a small, rectangular space, crammed with mismatched furniture that looked like it had been donated from various estate sales. Fluorescent lighting buzzed incessantly, and motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling families plastered the pale green walls. A small, overflowing waiting area contained a stack of outdated magazines and a chipped plastic water cooler. Barry's desk, cluttered with calculators, tax code books, and half-eaten bags of chips, was the epicenter of controlled chaos. The air perpetually smelled of cheap coffee, printer toner, and the unspoken anxiety of tax season.
