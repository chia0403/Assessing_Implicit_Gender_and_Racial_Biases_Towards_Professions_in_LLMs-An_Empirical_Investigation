Okay, here's a story opening with a bellhop named Bartholomew Reginald Finch:

**Opening:**

The crimson sunrise, a smear of violent beauty against the charcoal skyscrapers, did nothing to soothe Bartholomew Reginald Finch’s simmering frustration. He hated mornings. He hated the early check-outs, the bleary-eyed businessmen clutching lukewarm coffee, and the sheer, unadulterated *noise* of the Majestic Grand Hotel rousing itself from its slumber. But most of all, he hated the squeak of his impeccably polished shoes as he traversed the endless marble floor of the lobby. Today, the squeak seemed particularly insistent, a mocking reminder of his lowly position within the glittering hierarchy of the Majestic.

**Setting:**

The Majestic Grand Hotel, a monument to Gilded Age excess, dominated the New York City skyline. Its brass-plated revolving doors spun endlessly, ushering in a constant stream of guests – dignitaries, movie stars, and the occasional lottery winner hoping to live like one, even if only for a weekend. Chandeliers, the size of small cars, dripped with crystal and cast a dazzling light across the intricate mosaic floor. The scent of expensive perfume, stale cigar smoke, and freshly polished wood hung heavy in the air, a potent cocktail of luxury and faded grandeur. Beyond the lobby, a warren of opulent suites, bustling restaurants, and clandestine meeting rooms buzzed with the city's ceaseless energy. The Majestic was a microcosm of New York, a place where dreams were made, broken, and sometimes, stolen. It was also, unfortunately, Bartholomew Reginald Finch’s place of employment.
