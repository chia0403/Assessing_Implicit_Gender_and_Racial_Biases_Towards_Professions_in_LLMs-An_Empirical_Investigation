Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper named:

**Setting:** The Whispering Pines Sanatorium, nestled deep within the fog-choked mountains of North Carolina. Built in 1907, the Sanatorium was originally intended as a refuge for those suffering from tuberculosis. Over the years, it evolved, accepting patients with various mental and emotional ailments. By the 1950s, Whispering Pines had become a notorious institution known for its experimental treatments and questionable patient care. The main building, a sprawling Victorian structure with decaying gingerbread trim and darkened windows, dominated the landscape. Surrounding it were overgrown gardens, a skeletal gazebo, and a dense, forbidding forest that seemed to press in on the sanatorium, eager to reclaim its territory. The air always held a damp chill and a lingering scent of pine needles and something elseâ€¦ something faintly medicinal and unsettling. The sounds were equally unsettling: the rustle of unseen creatures in the woods, the mournful creak of the building in the wind, and occasionally, a faint, echoing laughter that seemed to originate from somewhere within the sanatorium's very walls. Today is late October, and the leaves that haven't fallen are sickly yellow and orange, clinging to their branches as if afraid to let go.

**Story Opening:**

"Another damn leaf," sighed Archibald Theodore Grimsby, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. The wind, a persistent, biting thing that seemed to claw at exposed skin, whipped another cascade of dead leaves onto the meticulously raked path. Archibald, or Archie as he begrudgingly allowed a few of the gentler patients to call him, had been the groundskeeper at Whispering Pines for nearly twenty years, a tenure that, to his mind, warranted a medal of some sort, preferably one made of gold and heavy enough to bludgeon the next idiot who dumped their cigarette butts in his flowerbeds. The sheer hopelessness of trying to maintain order amidst the encroaching chaos of Whispering Pines was enough to drive a sane man mad. He glanced up at the sanatorium, its darkened windows staring back at him like vacant eyes. A flicker of movement in one of the upper windows sent a familiar shiver down his spine. Just his imagination, he told himself, another trick of the light. Still, he tightened his grip on the rake, the worn wooden handle a comforting weight in his hand. He had a bad feeling, a feeling that this autumn would bring more than just falling leaves to Whispering Pines. Something was stirring within those crumbling walls, and Archibald Theodore Grimsby had a sinking suspicion it was about to spill out.
