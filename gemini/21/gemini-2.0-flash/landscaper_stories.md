The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Finch like a wet wool blanket. He tugged the brim of his battered Atlanta Braves cap lower, squinting against the glare that bounced off the perfectly manicured lawn he was currently wrestling into submission. The air smelled of freshly cut St. Augustine grass, gasoline from his ancient lawnmower, and the faintest, almost intoxicating perfume of honeysuckle drifting from the overgrown vines creeping up the wrought-iron fence that separated the sprawling estate from the relative squalor of Bart's own modest bungalow a few miles away.

This wasn't just any lawn; this was the prized possession of Mrs. Eleanor Van Derlyn, widow of the late, great Senator Van Derlyn, and owner of a small empire built on… well, Bart wasn’t entirely sure what it was built on, but he knew it involved a lot of money and even more secrets. Her sprawling plantation-style house, "Belle Haven," perched majestically on a gentle rise overlooking the Chattahoochee River. White columns, tall and imposing, lined the wraparound porch. Azalea bushes, vibrant pink and crimson, erupted in a riot of color against the stark white of the house. Everything about Belle Haven screamed "Old Money" and whispered of a history that Bart, a simple landscaper with calloused hands and a penchant for classic rock, couldn't even begin to fathom. And today, Bart was battling the stubborn crabgrass that threatened to mar the pristine perfection Mrs. Van Derlyn demanded.
