## Story Opening:

The stench hit Amelia Hawthorne the moment she stepped out of the elevator. It was a cloying, sweet-sour aroma, like rotting fruit left too long in the sun mixed with something metallic. Amelia took a shallow breath, bracing herself. It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Gable's toe fungus was on the schedule.

She plastered a professional smile on her face and pushed open the door to Suite 302, "Hawthorne Family Practice," the cheery, albeit slightly outdated, sign proclaimed. The waiting room was a tableau of nervous energy. A young mother jiggled a restless baby, a man in a stained construction vest flipped through a dog-eared Reader's Digest, and a woman with impossibly bouffant hair perched on the edge of her seat, clutching a tissue to her nose.

"Good morning, everyone!" Amelia announced, her voice bright and confident, a stark contrast to the underlying hum of anxiety in the room. "Dr. Chen will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you need anything."

She slipped behind the reception desk, the smell thankfully dissipating slightly. The digital clock flashed 8:03 AM. Just another day, another parade of aches and pains, sniffles and complaints. But beneath the surface of routine, Amelia knew something was different today. There was a palpable tension in the air, thicker than usual, almost tangible. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but a prickle of unease danced along her spine.

## Setting:

The Hawthorne Family Practice is located in the heart of Willow Creek, a small, seemingly idyllic town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The practice itself is housed on the third floor of a modest, brick building that has seen better days. Inside, the decor is a blend of comforting and outdated. Think floral wallpaper, cushioned chairs that sink a little too deep, and framed prints of serene landscapes that are slightly too faded. 

The reception area is the first point of contact, dominated by a large, cherry-wood desk and a small window overlooking the town square. Behind the desk lies the "inner sanctum," a narrow hallway leading to three examination rooms, a small lab, Dr. Chen's office, and a cramped break room that doubles as Amelia's office. The entire space is bathed in the warm glow of fluorescent lights, buzzing softly overhead, a constant, almost imperceptible reminder of the passage of time. Outside, Willow Creek might be a picture postcard, but within these walls, the everyday realities of life, and sometimes death, play out.
