The Tuesday morning sun, a watery pale imitation of its summer self, did little to warm the chill clinging to the air in downtown Harmony Creek. Inside the perpetually overheated confines of "Golden Shield Insurance: Protecting Your Tomorrow, Today!", Arthur Penhaligon sighed, fiddled with the knot of his tie, and stared at the empty chair opposite his cluttered desk. He hated Tuesdays. Mondays were for catching up on weekend disasters; Wednesdays brought hump-day fatigue; Thursdays were a pre-weekend blur. But Tuesdays? Tuesdays were when people woke up and realized all the ways their lives were a precarious, uninsured Jenga tower.

Harmony Creek, Ohio, wasn't exactly known for its high-octane drama. The biggest news of the year was usually the annual pumpkin festival and the ensuing debate about whether Mildred Olson's prize-winning gourd was actually larger than last year's. Still, even in a town where excitement was measured in bushels, things happened. Trees fell on sheds, squirrels chewed through wiring, and Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning Persian cat, Fluffy, managed to lock itself in the pantry (again), causing a small-scale canned tuna apocalypse. And Arthur, with his neatly combed salt-and-pepper hair, his perpetually worried expression, and his unwavering belief in the power of a comprehensive policy, was there to help pick up the pieces.

He glanced at the framed photo on his desk – his wife, Eleanor, her smile as bright and comforting as a warm cup of chamomile tea. Eleanor always told him he had a good heart, that he genuinely cared about people. And he did. Even the ones who showed up with a dented fender and a wildly implausible story about a rogue swarm of bees attacking their vehicle while they were "just checking the structural integrity of the old covered bridge."

The phone rang, a shrill, insistent beep that jolted Arthur from his reverie. He took a deep breath, pasted on his most reassuring voice, and answered, "Golden Shield Insurance, Arthur Penhaligon speaking, how can I protect your tomorrow, today?" But the voice on the other end wasn’t looking for protection. It was a voice filled with a fear that cut through the sterile office air like a shard of ice, and it spoke a name that made Arthur Penhaligon's blood run cold.
