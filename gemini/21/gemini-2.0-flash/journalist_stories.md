The flickering fluorescent light hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Hayes's head, a discordant symphony to the chaos swirling within her. Outside, the November rain hammered against the grimy windows of the *Havenwood Herald* building, a relentless assault that mirrored the incessant drumming in Amelia's chest. She was late. Again. Not disastrously so, only fifteen minutes, but in a town like Havenwood, Maine, where the only real news was the annual pumpkin festival winner and the increasingly alarming number of stray cats, fifteen minutes could feel like an eternity.

Amelia's small office, wedged between the perpetually malfunctioning coffee machine and the even more perpetually gossiping receptionist, Brenda, was a monument to barely-contained disarray. Stacks of newspapers threatened to topple like miniature, ink-stained skyscrapers. Crumpled notes, scribbled with half-formed ideas and frantic interview quotes, littered her desk. Empty coffee cups, each a testament to a late night fueled by caffeine and stubborn determination, formed a precarious pyramid on the corner.

Havenwood itself was a town steeped in the sort of picturesque, melancholic charm that lured tourists in the summer and drove its residents quietly insane in the winter. Nestled on the rugged coastline, it was a tapestry of weathered clapboard houses, stubbornly independent fishing boats, and a pervasive scent of salt and something indefinably *old*. A place where secrets clung to the fog like barnacles to a hull, and where Amelia, a journalist who'd arrived with grand ambitions and a suitcase full of unanswered questions, was quickly learning that unraveling those secrets was a far more difficult task than she'd ever imagined. Today, however, she wasn't focused on unraveling secrets, just on making Brenda stop glaring at her with that "I told you so" expression.
