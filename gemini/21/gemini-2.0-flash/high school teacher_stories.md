The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn despair creeping into Mr. Arthur Reginald Davies’ bones. He stood at the window of his cramped classroom, the blinds still stubbornly drawn against the encroaching February gray. Outside, a thin layer of ice clung to the skeletal branches of the oak tree he could see from his vantage point, mirroring the feeling of fragile, frozen stagnation settling over his life. The clock on the wall ticked with cruel indifference. 6:17 AM. He was always first. Always. He preferred the solitude, the false sense of control he gleaned from being the master of this tiny domain before the tidal wave of hormones and half-formed opinions crashed through his door.

Arthur took a long sip of lukewarm coffee from his chipped “World’s Okay-est History Teacher” mug. The inscription, a sarcastic gift from his senior class last year, felt particularly pointed this morning. He wasn’t okay. Not even remotely. The American Revolution curriculum was stale, his students were listless, and his own passion for history felt like a flickering candle in a gale. He needed to inject some life, some spark, into this purgatory. But all he felt was the weight of the future bearing down on him, heavy and unforgiving.
