Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who's an editor:

**Story Opening:**

The rejection letter arrived on Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's desk like a particularly unwelcome guest. Cream-colored, heavy stock, embossed with the publisher's name - "Starlight Literary" - and smelling faintly of expensive cologne, it was a physical embodiment of her professional failure.  Beatrice sighed, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of the city outside her office window.  She already knew what it said, of course. She could practically recite it from memory: *“While we admire Ms. Davies’ ambition and the unique premise of ‘The Clockwork Heart,’ we feel it ultimately lacks the… spark… to resonate with our current readership.”*

“Spark,” Beatrice muttered, tearing a corner off the offending envelope.  "Everyone wants 'spark' these days. Nobody wants *depth*." She crumpled the paper, the small act of rebellion failing to alleviate the knot tightening in her stomach. Another manuscript, another author who believed in her, and another crushing disappointment.  If this continued, Beatrice feared she'd lose the last vestiges of her own "spark," the very thing that had drawn her to editing in the first place.
**Setting:**

Beatrice Hawthorne's office occupied a cramped corner on the eleventh floor of the "Literary Ink" building in Midtown Manhattan. The building itself was a pre-war brick structure, a stark contrast to the gleaming glass towers that had sprung up around it. Literary Ink was a small, independent publishing house known for championing emerging authors and niche genres, a place that had once held so much promise for Beatrice.

Her office, though small, was a reflection of her personality: organized chaos. Books overflowed from shelves and stacked precariously on every surface.  Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple over at the slightest provocation.  A well-worn armchair sat in the corner, perpetually draped with a half-knitted scarf in a vibrant, almost offensively cheerful shade of yellow.  A framed poster of Virginia Woolf hung above her desk, a silent reminder of the power of words and the importance of fighting for the stories that mattered. The window offered a fragmented view of the city, the relentless energy of New York a constant hum in the background, both inspiring and overwhelming.
