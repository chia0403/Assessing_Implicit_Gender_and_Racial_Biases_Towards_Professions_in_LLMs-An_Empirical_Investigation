The smell of sawdust and pine hung thick in the air, a comforting, familiar scent that clung to John Frederick Miller like a second skin. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of his workshop window, illuminated swirling motes of wood dust dancing in the air. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, unfinished surface of the cherrywood rocking horse, the gentle curve already promising hours of soothing motion for some lucky child. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song through the ancient oaks surrounding the small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. Havenwood was a town built on tradition and resilience, its history etched onto the weathered faces of its inhabitants and the sturdy timbers of its homes, many of which John himself had helped to build or repair. This workshop, tucked away at the edge of town, was his sanctuary, a place where the chaos of the outside world faded into the rhythmic tap of his hammer and the satisfying rasp of his plane. But today, a restlessness stirred within him, a feeling as unsettling as the approaching storm brewing over the mountains, threatening to disrupt the quiet rhythm of his life.
