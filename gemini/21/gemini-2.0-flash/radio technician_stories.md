The hum of the power generator was a constant, dull drone in Elara Vance’s ears. It was a familiar sound, almost comforting in its relentless rhythm. She tightened the grip on her insulated screwdriver, the metallic chill seeping through her worn leather gloves. Outside, the wind howled, a savage, unforgiving beast clawing at the corrugated iron walls of the North Star Research Station’s comms tower. Inside, Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, was battling a far less predictable monster: the archaic, temperamental Collins Radio transmitter, Model 180S-1.

The setting was desolate, breathtakingly beautiful, and profoundly lonely. Located on the highest peak of Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut, Canada, the research station was a cluster of modular buildings clinging precariously to the frozen landscape. It was March, and the sun, a pale, weak disc, barely grazed the horizon. For another month, they'd be bathed in perpetual twilight, a grey-tinged purgatory between the endless night of winter and the fleeting promise of summer. Visibility was near zero, lost in the swirling snow and relentless arctic wind. Elara was the station's sole radio technician, their lifeline to the outside world, and tonight, that lifeline was sputtering.

The static that filled her headphones was crackling with more urgency than usual, punctuated by unnerving silences. If this transmitter died, they would be cut off. Stranded. And in the heart of the Canadian Arctic, in March, that was a death sentence. Elara adjusted her headlamp, casting a pool of light on the tangle of vacuum tubes and wires, a chaotic ballet of obsolescence she was determined to tame. Tonight, the fate of North Star Research Station rested on her shoulders, and the steady hand of Elara Vance, the woman who talked to the ghosts in the machine.
