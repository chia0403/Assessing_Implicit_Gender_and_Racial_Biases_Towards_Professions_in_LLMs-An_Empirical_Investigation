**Opening:**

The shrill ring cut through the stale air of Brenda's cubicle farm like a rusty saw. Brenda Miller, Vice President of Sales at "Synergy Solutions, Inc." (though the "Vice President" part was a bit of a glorified title, mostly meaning she had the biggest sales quota of anyone in her department), flinched and grabbed the phone before it could launch into a second, more ear-splitting assault.

"Brenda Miller, Synergy Solutions, how may I elevate your business today?" she chirped, the practiced, perky tone instantly snapping into place. The phone glued to her ear, she swivelled in her worn-out office chair, the plastic groaning in protest with each movement.

**Setting:**

Synergy Solutions, Inc. occupied the entire fourth floor of a drab, seven-story office building in a nameless industrial park just outside of Cleveland, Ohio. The building was painted a depressing shade of beige that Brenda suspected had been chosen solely for its ability to hide decades' worth of grime.

Inside, Brenda's cubicle was a microcosm of corporate mediocrity. Bare, off-white walls were punctuated by inspirational posters featuring stock photos of smiling, diverse groups of people shaking hands over cryptic graphs. A wilting spider plant, a gift from her mother three months ago, sat precariously on the edge of her desk, its drooping leaves a mournful testament to Brenda's black thumb and her utter lack of work-life balance. Spread across the surface were stacks of brochures advertising Synergy Solutions' latest (and, in Brenda's opinion, completely overpriced) cloud-based CRM system, a half-eaten bag of cheese puffs, and a photo of Brenda's overly enthusiastic golden retriever, Buddy, staring blankly at the camera. The air hung thick with the aroma of instant coffee and barely suppressed desperation.
