The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Officer Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's cheeks as she surveyed the scene. Yellow police tape, a flimsy barrier against the curious and the morbid, danced erratically around the perimeter of the dilapidated pier jutting out from Chicago's North Side. The late February sky was a bruised purple, threatening more snow, and the only light came from the flickering streetlamps lining Lakeshore Drive and the harsh glare of the squad cars illuminating the icy planks.

The air hung heavy with the smell of salt, decay, and something acrid, something Amy couldn't quite place. A gaggle of uniformed officers huddled near the end of the pier, their voices hushed and indistinct against the mournful groan of the wind. Amy tightened the scarf around her neck and adjusted her holster, her heart a cold, heavy stone in her chest. She knew what awaited her down there. She always did. This was Chicago. This was her beat. And Chicago rarely delivered good news, especially on a night like tonight. This was a city of secrets, buried deep beneath the shimmering surface of prosperity, and Amy Rodriguez was often the one digging them up.
