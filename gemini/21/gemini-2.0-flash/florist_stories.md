## Story Opening:

The scent of lilies, sharp and almost medicinal, hung heavy in the air, a constant, floral perfume that clung to Eliza Beatrice Finch like morning dew. She barely noticed it anymore. Instead, her focus was entirely on the cascade of freesias she was coaxing into a more artful arrangement. Her nimble fingers, stained with chlorophyll and smelling faintly of roses and earth, danced around the delicate blooms, teasing them into submission. Outside, the relentless January rain hammered against the glass of "Finch & Feather Florist," blurring the already grey London street into a watercolour wash.

"Bloody awful weather for a funeral," she muttered, more to the chrysanthemums wilting in a bucket than to anyone in particular. "Should be daffodils, not damp despair."

Eliza straightened, a crick protesting in her lower back. She was still relatively young, only thirty-two, but years spent hunched over tables, wrestling with thorny stems and recalcitrant ribbons, had taken their toll. Today was a particularly busy day. Three funerals, two birthdays, and a rather ostentatious declaration of love involving a hundred red roses for some infatuated city banker. The thought made her roll her eyes. Real love, she knew, bloomed quietly, like the miniature orchids tucked away in the back of the shop, not screamed from the rooftops like a gaudy bouquet.

## Setting:

**Finch & Feather Florist** is nestled on a quiet side street just off of Portobello Road in London. The shop itself is a charmingly cluttered haven, overflowing with vibrant colors and fragrant blooms. Stepping inside is like entering a secret garden hidden away from the bustling city. The walls are painted a soft, faded green, adorned with antique botanical prints and whimsical birdcages, some holding actual canaries who trill a cheerful melody. Wicker baskets overflow with dried lavender and potpourri.

The main worktable, where Eliza spends most of her time, is a solid oak monstrosity, scarred and stained from years of floristry. It's surrounded by buckets filled with a dizzying array of flowers: velvety roses in every shade imaginable, delicate tulips, exotic orchids, fragrant lilies, and sturdy carnations. The air is thick with the mingled scents of blooms, damp earth, and the faint aroma of beeswax, which Eliza uses to polish the antique furniture.

Beyond the main shop area lies a small, sun-drenched conservatory, home to more exotic and delicate plants, including the aforementioned miniature orchids, and a comfortable armchair where Eliza occasionally steals a moment to read or sketch. Through the back door, a small, overgrown courtyard provides a miniature escape, a tiny green lung in the heart of the city. It's where Eliza cultivates some of her more unusual flowers and herbs, a secret, fragrant sanctuary that reflects her own quiet, resilient spirit.
