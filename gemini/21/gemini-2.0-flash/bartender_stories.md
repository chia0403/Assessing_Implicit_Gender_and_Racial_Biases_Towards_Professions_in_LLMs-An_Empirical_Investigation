The clinking of ice against glass was a lullaby to Evangeline “Evie” Reyes. It was the soundtrack to her life, the rhythmic pulse that beat beneath the boisterous laughter and hushed confessions of The Serpent's Kiss, a dimly lit, low-slung bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter.

The Serpent's Kiss wasn't just any bar. It breathed history, its exposed brick walls whispering tales of bygone eras, of pirates and poets, of fortunes made and lost over rounds of absinthe and poker. Stained-glass panels depicting sinuous serpents, each with a uniquely malevolent gaze, filtered the outside light, painting the interior in hues of emerald and ruby. The air was thick with the aroma of aged whiskey, spiced rum, and the lingering scent of patchouli from Madame Evangeline’s legendary readings in the back room - a practice Evie, despite sharing her namesake, staunchly avoided.

Tonight, however, the usual buzz felt different, sharper. The clinking of ice seemed to echo with an unsettling resonance. A heavy, humid air clung to the skin, even with the whirring fans overhead. Evie felt a prickling unease crawl along her spine, an instinctive warning that something was about to slither its way into her carefully curated corner of chaos. The jazz band on the small, raised platform was playing a little too slowly, the trumpet a little too mournfully. And the clientele… they were a motley crew, as always, but tonight, they seemed to be observing each other, exchanging furtive glances in the flickering candlelight. Evie straightened behind the mahogany bar, her dark eyes scanning the room, ready for whatever dark secret was about to be unearthed. She just hoped she had enough liquor to handle it.
