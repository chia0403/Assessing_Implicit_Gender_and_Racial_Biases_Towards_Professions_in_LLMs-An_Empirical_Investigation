## Story Opening:

The smell of old paper and leather clung to Eleanor Abigail Ramsey like a comforting shroud. It was a scent she’d known longer than she’d known her own mother's perfume, a smell that grounded her in the hushed, timeless world of the Blackwood County Library. Tonight, however, the familiar aroma was doing little to soothe the knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. The wind howled outside, rattling the aged windows of the Victorian building like skeletal fingers. The power had flickered twice already, plunging her into momentary darkness, and each time, the silence afterwards felt heavier, more pregnant with unseen things.

Eleanor, perched precariously on a rolling ladder, reached for a first edition of "Wuthering Heights," her fingers brushing against the cracked spine. She needed to reshelve it before she left, a ritualistic act that somehow brought order to the chaos brewing within her. Ever since receiving the anonymous note slipped into the return slot this afternoon – a single, dried black rose pressed onto a page ripped from a grimoire and emblazoned with a single, chilling word: "Beware" – the library, her sanctuary, felt…tainted.
## Setting:

**Blackwood County Library:** A sprawling, three-story Victorian building in the heart of Blackwood County, Massachusetts. Built in 1888, it boasts towering oak shelves that reach towards ornate, vaulted ceilings. Sunlight, when it manages to pierce the perpetually overcast sky, streams through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature. The library houses an impressive collection, from well-worn paperbacks to rare and valuable first editions, including a significant section dedicated to local history and folklore, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of past residents and librarians alike. Outside, the library is surrounded by a sprawling, overgrown garden, partially reclaimed by the wild Massachusetts landscape. Ancient trees, their branches gnarled and twisted by time, cast long, eerie shadows even on the brightest days. Tonight, however, the garden is a swirling vortex of fallen leaves and wind-whipped branches, a dark and forbidding barrier separating the library from the rest of the world.
