The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Alistair Finch.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling, danced in the cavernous space that was once the grand ballroom of Blackwood Manor, now his rehearsal space â€“ a testament to his unwavering, if somewhat reckless, dedication to his art.

Alistair, a man whose sharp features were softened only by the perpetual weariness in his eyes, paced the dusty floorboards, muttering lines from the play under his breath, a half-smoked cigarette dangling precariously from his lips.

Tonight, the first dress rehearsal loomed, a precipice of either triumph or utter disaster.
