The scent of bay rum and dust motes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood, barber and purveyor of fine shaves.  His shop, "Blackwood's Blades," nestled on the cobbled side street of Bleakwater Lane, was a haven of quiet industry, a stark contrast to the bustling, chaotic port just a block away.  The windowpanes, grimy from sea spray and years of neglect, offered a hazy view of the churning grey North Sea, its relentless rhythm a constant soundtrack to Silas's work.  Inside, the air was warm and dimly lit, the only illumination coming from a single gas lamp sputtering above the worn leather barber chair and the flickering flames of a small, almost apologetic fire in the hearth.  The walls, lined with chipped porcelain mugs and faded posters advertising long-forgotten cures for everything from baldness to the heartbreak of unrequited love, whispered stories of a bygone era.  Silas, his hands calloused but nimble, carefully honed his straight razor against a worn leather strop, the rhythmic rasp a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a gull overhead.  Today, however, the usual quiet hum of Bleakwater Lane was replaced by a nervous, expectant silence. Something was brewing, Silas could feel it in the very marrow of his bones, and it smelled a lot like trouble.
