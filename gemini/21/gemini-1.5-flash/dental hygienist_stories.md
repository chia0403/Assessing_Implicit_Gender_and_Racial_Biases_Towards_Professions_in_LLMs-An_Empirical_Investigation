The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday morning.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of Dr. Albright's waiting room, painted pale stripes across the worn floral carpet.  Amelia, her name embroidered neatly on the breast pocket of her crisp white scrub top, meticulously polished her instruments.  Each gleaming scaler and tiny mirror held a reflection not just of her own focused face, but of the years she'd spent perfecting her craft – a craft she loved, even if the occasional rogue coffee stain on a patient's shirt threatened to unravel her carefully constructed calm.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of tires, the blare of a distant siren – faded into a muted background noise, easily drowned out by the gentle whirring of the dental drill from the next room.  Today, however, the usual hum of routine felt distinctly off-key.  A peculiar tension hung in the air, thicker than the lingering scent of fluoride.
