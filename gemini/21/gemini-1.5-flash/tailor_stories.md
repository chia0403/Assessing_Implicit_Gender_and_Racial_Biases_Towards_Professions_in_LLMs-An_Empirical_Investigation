The shop itself, nestled between a dilapidated bookshop and a bustling bakery, was a sanctuary of calm â€“ a haven of quiet industry in the heart of the city's increasingly chaotic sprawl.  The air, thick with the promise of impending snow, held a tension Elias felt acutely in his own bones, a feeling far more unsettling than any crooked hem or ill-fitting sleeve.
