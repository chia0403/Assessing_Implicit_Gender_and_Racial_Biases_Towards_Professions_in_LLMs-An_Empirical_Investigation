The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslit chandelier of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the weary, knowing glint in Finley "Finn" O'Malley's eye.  Finn, a bellhop whose nimble fingers could coax a reluctant trunk onto a precarious baggage cart with the grace of a seasoned dancer and whose smile, though often strained, could charm a nickel out of a miser's clenched fist, surveyed the opulent lobby with a practiced indifference.  Rain lashed against the towering gothic windows, painting streaks of grey across the rich mahogany paneling and the plush velvet seating areas where well-heeled guests huddled, their conversations muffled by the storm's insistent roar.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive perfume, old leather, and something vaguely unsettling – possibly the lingering aroma of a spilled whiskey sour – hung heavy and still.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of the Grand Majestic was replaced by a palpable tension, a prickling unease that vibrated through the polished floors and up into Finn’s very bones. Something was about to happen. Something big.
