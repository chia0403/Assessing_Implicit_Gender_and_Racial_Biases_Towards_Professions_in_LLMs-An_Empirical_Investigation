The chipped paint of the windowsill flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's perfectly manicured fingers as she watched the relentless grey drizzle lash against the cobblestones of Greyhaven.  Greyhaven, a town perpetually shrouded in mist and smelling faintly of brine and damp earth, wasn't exactly known for its vibrant, health-conscious population.  In fact, Eleanor, a nutritionist with a PhD and a penchant for kale smoothies, felt like a brightly coloured flamingo amongst a flock of particularly glum penguins.  Her practice, "Nourish & Thrive," occupied a cramped, slightly damp space above a fishmonger's, its cheerful sunflower-yellow sign a stark contrast to the overall melancholic atmosphere of the town.  The aroma of cod and seaweed frequently wafted up the narrow stairwell, a constant, pungent reminder that her mission – to instill healthy eating habits in the notoriously stubborn Greyhaven residents – was going to be anything but easy.
