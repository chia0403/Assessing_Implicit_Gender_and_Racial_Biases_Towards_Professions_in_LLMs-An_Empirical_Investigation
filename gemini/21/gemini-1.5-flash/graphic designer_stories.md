The chipped mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the icy dread clenching her stomach.  Rain lashed against the panoramic window of her Brooklyn loft, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolor of greys and inky blues.  Amelia, a graphic designer whose minimalist aesthetic extended even to her chaotic life, stared out at the storm, the rhythmic drumming of rain a counterpoint to the frantic beat of her own heart.  Her apartment, usually a sanctuary of curated calm – muted tones, carefully arranged succulents, and a meticulously organized workspace – felt claustrophobic tonight.  The looming deadline for the Reimagine Cityscape project, a prestigious competition that could launch her career into the stratosphere, was only hours away, and Amelia felt anything but ready.  The concept, a vibrant, interactive city map, was brilliant, she knew, but the execution… the execution was a tangled mess of half-finished sketches and frustrated sighs.
