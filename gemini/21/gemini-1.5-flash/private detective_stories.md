The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic beat of his own heart.  Jack, not Jack Stratton, Private Investigator, but just plain Jack, hunched over a chipped Formica desk littered with half-empty coffee cups and crumpled photographs.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and desperation â€“ a familiar aroma in his cramped, windowless office tucked away on the grimy backstreets of Chinatown, San Francisco.  Outside, the neon glow of a jade emporium cast an eerie green light on the slick, rain-soaked alleyway, illuminating the overflowing bins and the occasional scuttling rat.  Tonight, however, the usual urban symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens was muted, replaced by the insistent drumming of the storm and the unsettling silence that preceded a reckoning.  Jack rubbed his tired eyes, the grainy image of a terrified young woman etched in his mind, her whispered plea echoing in the oppressive stillness:  "Find him, Mr. Stratton.  Before it's too late."
