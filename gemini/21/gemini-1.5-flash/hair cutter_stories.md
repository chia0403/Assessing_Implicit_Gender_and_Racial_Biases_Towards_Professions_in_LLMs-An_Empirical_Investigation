The scent of burnt sugar and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Rella" Blackwood’s salon, "Snip & Stitch," could conjure.  Rella, perched on a worn leather stool before her latest client – a nervous chihuahua named Princess Fluffybutt III – meticulously trimmed a stray whisker, her nimble fingers a blur of practiced precision.  The salon itself was a quirky testament to its owner’s eclectic tastes: mismatched vintage furniture upholstered in flamboyant fabrics, walls adorned with framed hair samples (mostly from satisfied clients, she claimed), and a vibrant mural depicting a scissor-wielding unicorn battling a tangle of dreadlocks.  Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a small coastal town where time seemed to move at its own languid pace, a pace that perfectly suited Rella's deliberate, almost meditative, approach to her craft.
