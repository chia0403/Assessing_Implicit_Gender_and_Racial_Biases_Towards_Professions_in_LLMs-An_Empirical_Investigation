The flickering neon sign of the "Cyberia Cafe" cast a lurid green glow across Elara Vance's face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into her usually vibrant features.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the twenty-four-hour diner, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Elara, a computer programmer with a reputation for cracking codes faster than anyone in the city of Porthaven, hunched over a steaming mug of lukewarm coffee, her fingers drumming a restless rhythm on the chipped Formica tabletop.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and the faint, metallic tang of ozone from the overloaded power grid that hummed beneath the city.  Outside, the perpetual drizzle of Porthaven – a city built on a network of canals and shrouded in a perpetual twilight – blurred the neon signs into a hazy, shimmering kaleidoscope.  Tonight, however, the usual atmospheric hum of the city felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
