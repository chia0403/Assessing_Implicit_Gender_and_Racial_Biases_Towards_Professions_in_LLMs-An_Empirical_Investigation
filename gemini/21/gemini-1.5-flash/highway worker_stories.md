The sun beat down on Elias Thorneâ€™s neck, a relentless hammer against the already-aching muscles in his shoulders.  Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already-hazy heat shimmering off the asphalt of Interstate 40, somewhere between Winslow, Arizona and Flagstaff.  The air hung thick and heavy, scented with the acrid bite of diesel fumes and the dusty sweetness of creosote bushes clinging to the sparse desert landscape.  Elias squinted, his calloused hand shielding his eyes as he surveyed the freshly laid blacktop, a ribbon of dark gloss snaking through the ochre and rust-colored earth.  A lone vulture circled lazily overhead, a silent sentinel against the vast, empty sky.  His orange safety vest, already faded and stained with the grime of countless days spent battling the unforgiving sun and the unpredictable Arizona weather, felt like a lead weight. Today, the relentless heat was the biggest challenge; tomorrow, it might be a flash flood or a rogue tumbleweed the size of a small car.  Such was life on the highway.
