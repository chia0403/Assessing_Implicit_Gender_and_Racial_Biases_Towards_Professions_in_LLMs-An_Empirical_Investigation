The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of the graveyard.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had begun hours ago, plastered her charcoal grey trench coat to her thin frame.  Not a single headstone stood untouched by the encroaching gloom of twilight, each granite and marble slab slick with moisture and shrouded in a damp, clinging mist.  This wasn’t the picturesque, serene graveyard of Victorian novels; this was St. Jude’s, nestled precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the turbulent Irish Sea, a place where the mournful cry of gulls seemed to blend seamlessly with the whispers of the dead.  Tonight, however, the whispers were louder, sharper, clinging to the damp air like the scent of brine and decaying leaves.  Tonight, Eleanor felt them acutely.  The latest victim, a young woman named Aisling O’Malley, lay just a few feet beneath her, the fresh earth still disturbed, the scent of disturbed soil heavy in the air.  The police had called her in, again, to navigate the treacherous labyrinth of a killer's mind.
