The stale scent of disinfectant clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar perfume in the echoing silence of the Blackwood Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies.  Elias, a man whose life was measured not in hours but in the rhythmic squeak of his mop and the rhythmic thud of his dustpan, ran a tired hand over his thinning grey hair. Midnight had long since passed, and the moon, a pale disc behind the gothic spires of the academy, cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished marble floors.  The only sounds were the occasional drip from a leaky tap in the girls' lavatory and the faint whisper of wind whistling through the cracks in the ancient, oak-framed windows.  Tonight, however, the usual quietude was punctuated by a low, almost imperceptible humming, emanating from somewhere deep within the labyrinthine corridors of Blackwood Academy.  A humming that sent a shiver down Elias's spine, a shiver that had nothing to do with the drafty chill of the night.
