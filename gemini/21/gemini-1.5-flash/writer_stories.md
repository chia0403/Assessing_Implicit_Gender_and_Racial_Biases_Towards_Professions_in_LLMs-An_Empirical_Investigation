The chipped paint of the windowsill dug into Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s elbows as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  October in Whitby clung to her like a damp wool shawl, the wind a relentless, keening wail that echoed the turmoil brewing within her.  Amelia, a writer whose success was as sporadic as the North Yorkshire sunshine, hunched deeper into her worn armchair, the scent of woodsmoke and drying seaweed clinging to her clothes like a second skin.  Her cottage, perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the harbour, was as rugged and untamed as the landscape itself; a testament to its age, with uneven floors, mismatched furniture, and a persistent draft that whistled through gaps in the ancient stonework.  The only constant in the chaos was the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below, a relentless soundtrack to her writer's block.  This time, however, the writer's block felt different; heavier, colder, more ominous than any she'd experienced before.  It was as if the sea itself was holding its breath, waiting for something… or someone.
