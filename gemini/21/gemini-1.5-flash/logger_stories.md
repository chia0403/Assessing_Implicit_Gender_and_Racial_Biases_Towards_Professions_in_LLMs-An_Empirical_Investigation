The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whipping snow into frenzied swirls around Silas Blackwood's worn logger boots.  Silas, his breath misting in the frigid air, squinted at the behemoth of a cedar towering before him – a king among trees, its trunk thicker than any horse he’d ever seen.  The logging camp of Alder Creek nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains was a brutal mistress, a place where the relentless grip of winter tested even the hardiest souls.  This year, however, felt different.  A silence, heavier than the snow, hung in the air, broken only by the occasional snap of a twig underfoot and the distant, lonely cry of a hawk.  Silas felt it in his bones – something was wrong, something far more ominous than a particularly harsh winter.
