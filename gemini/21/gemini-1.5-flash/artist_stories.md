The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He gripped his easel tighter, the wind threatening to snatch it from its precarious perch on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea.  Below, the village of Port Blossom huddled, a cluster of whitewashed cottages clinging to the coastline like barnacles to a whale.  Elias, a landscape artist known more for his brooding seascapes than his sunny disposition, found solace in the raw, untamed beauty of this isolated corner of Cornwall.  The relentless wind howled a mournful symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks â€“ a soundtrack to the turmoil brewing within him, a tempest mirroring the one raging in his soul.  He squeezed a fresh dollop of Prussian blue onto his palette, the vibrant colour a stark contrast to the monochrome landscape before him.  This painting, he knew, would be different.  This painting would be his confession.
