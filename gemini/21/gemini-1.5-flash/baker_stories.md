The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the pre-dawn air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, owner and sole operator of "The Crumb & Kettle."  Eleanor, a woman whose hands were perpetually dusted with flour and whose smile lines deepened with each perfectly risen loaf, stood before her ancient, wood-fired oven, its brick belly glowing a comforting orange in the dim light of the bakery.  The small, stone building itself, nestled on a cobbled lane in the heart of the ancient, seaside village of Port Blossom, was a testament to time, its weathered timbers groaning softly under the weight of years and countless baked goods. Rain lashed against the single, mismatched windowpane, painting streaks of grey across the already gloomy interior, but inside, a cozy warmth radiated from the oven and the simmering pot of something sweet and spiced on the stove.  Outside, the Atlantic roared a constant, rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle crackle of the fire, a sound Eleanor had grown to love as much as the smell of freshly baked bread.
