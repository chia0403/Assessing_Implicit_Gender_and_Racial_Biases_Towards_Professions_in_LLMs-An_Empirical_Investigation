The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Katherine Hayes’s dark auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street.  The scent of roasting chestnuts and damp brick battled for dominance in the crisp air, a familiar autumnal perfume that usually soothed her, but tonight only served to amplify the gnawing unease in her gut.  Rain, a fine, relentless drizzle, plastered the already faded posters advertising off-Broadway plays to the grimy brick walls, mirroring the way anxiety clung to Mia’s chest.  The city, usually a vibrant, chaotic symphony, felt muted, hushed in anticipation – or perhaps, in dread.  She pulled her worn cashmere coat tighter, the collar scratching against her neck a minor discomfort compared to the legal battle brewing inside her.  Her briefcase, heavy with the weight of a case that could shatter a family and possibly ruin her career, bumped against her leg with every hurried step.  The flickering gaslights of Greenwich Village cast long, dancing shadows, transforming familiar streets into a labyrinth of uncertainty.
