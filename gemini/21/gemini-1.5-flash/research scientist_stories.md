The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the ice shelf like a barnacle to a whale.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, danced in the frigid air, stinging exposed skin despite the layers of thermal gear Aris wore.  The perpetual twilight cast long, distorted shadows, making the already alien landscape seem even more surreal.  He adjusted the thermal goggles perched on his forehead, the faint green glow illuminating the swirling snow and the jagged peaks of the distant mountains, a stark, unforgiving panorama.  Aris shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The unsettling hum emanating from deep within the ice – a sound he'd been monitoring for weeks – had grown stronger, deeper, more insistent.  It was a sound that promised something…other.  Something far beyond the scientific parameters of his current research into subglacial microbial life.
