The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already overflowing gutter, mirroring the state of Amelia Katherine Davies's patience.  A rogue tumbleweed, propelled by a spiteful gust of wind, skittered across the deserted parking lot, a tiny, dusty harbinger of the chaotic day that awaited her.

Amelia, clutching a lukewarm coffee and a stack of graded papers that felt heavier than textbooks, sighed.  Another Monday. Another mountain of teenage angst and algebra to conquer.
