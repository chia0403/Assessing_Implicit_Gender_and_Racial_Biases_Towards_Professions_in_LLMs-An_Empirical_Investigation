The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's calloused fingers as he polished a already-gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, crimson smear.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the faint, underlying sweetness of spilled amaretto â€“ a familiar perfume to Elias, the scent of his life for the past ten years.  This wasn't some glamorous, city-center cocktail lounge; The Rusty Mug was a dive bar clinging stubbornly to life in the rain-soaked, forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town where secrets dripped from the eaves like the persistent drizzle outside.
