The iron clang of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's cleaver echoed through the chill morning air, a sharp counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the gaps in the ramshackle butcher shop's timber framing.  Frost clung to the windowpanes like a shroud, obscuring the already grey dawn of a November day in the small, perpetually overcast village of Oakhaven.  Inside, Barty's breath plumed white in the air as he expertly separated a plump, rosy-cheeked piglet from its crackling hide, the rhythmic chop of his blade a familiar song in the otherwise silent building. The air, thick with the scent of blood and sawdust, held a subtle undercurrent of woodsmoke and something else, something faintly sweet andâ€¦ unsettling.  The Oakhaven market was only a few hours away, and Barty, as always, was preparing for a busy day.
