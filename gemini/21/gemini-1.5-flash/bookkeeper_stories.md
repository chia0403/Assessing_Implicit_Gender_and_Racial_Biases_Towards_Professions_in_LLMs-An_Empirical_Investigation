The smell of old paper and dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams was as familiar to Elara Vance as the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her own fingers on the keys of her ancient typewriter.  Her tiny, attic office, perched precariously above the bustling fish market of Grimsborough, was a sanctuary of organized chaos.  Stacks of ledgers, meticulously labelled and tied with faded ribbon, reached precarious heights, threatening to topple at the slightest tremor.  Sunlight streamed through a grime-streaked window, illuminating the swirling dust motes and highlighting the intricate carvings on her oak desk, a family heirloom far older than Elara herself.  Outside, the cacophony of seagulls, hawkers, and the rhythmic slap of fish against the wooden counters of the market below created a constant, vibrant hum, a stark contrast to the quiet precision of Elara's world of numbers.
