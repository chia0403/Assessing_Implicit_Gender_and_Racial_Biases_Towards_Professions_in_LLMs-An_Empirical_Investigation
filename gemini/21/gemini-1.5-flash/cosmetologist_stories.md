The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  It clung to the plush velvet chairs of her salon, "Shear Radiance," a haven of tranquility tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans.  Gas lamps flickered outside, casting long, dancing shadows across the wrought-iron balconies that overlooked Royal Street.  Inside, the air was thick with the murmur of conversation â€“ hushed whispers punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors and the whir of a hairdryer.  Tonight, however, the usual gentle hum of the salon was overshadowed by a palpable tension, a prickle of unease that Sera couldn't quite place, but felt crawling beneath her skin like a restless insect.  The rain, a relentless downpour that had begun hours ago, seemed to mirror her own unsettled mood.
