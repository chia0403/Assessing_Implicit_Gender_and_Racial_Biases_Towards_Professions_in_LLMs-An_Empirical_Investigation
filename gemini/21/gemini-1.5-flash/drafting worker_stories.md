Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the still air of the aging office building, clinging to the towering stacks of blueprints that lined the walls like petrified trees.  Elias, a man whose face was etched with the faint, persistent lines of countless hours hunched over drafting tables, meticulously shaded the rendering of a new high-rise, its glass façade shimmering under his careful hand, a stark contrast to the drab reality of his surroundings.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, graphite, and the lingering scent of ambition – a scent that, for Elias, had begun to fade with the years.
