The chipped paint of the apothecary’s sign, depicting a faded, almost skeletal serpent entwined around a mortar and pestle, creaked faintly in the November wind.  Rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the single, dusty window of Seraphina “Sera” Blackwood’s pharmacy, blurring the already indistinct gaslights of Ashwood’s cobbled High Street.

Sera Blackwood, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously measured powdered willow bark, barely registered the storm’s fury.  She was lost in the precise alchemy of her profession, a world far removed from the chill and uncertainty brewing outside. The only sounds were the gentle hiss of the scales, the scratch of her pen on parchment, and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of rain against the glass.
