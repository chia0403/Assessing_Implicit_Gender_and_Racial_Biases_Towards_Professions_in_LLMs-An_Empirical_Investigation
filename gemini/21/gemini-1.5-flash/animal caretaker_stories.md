The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch's thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  Frozen ground crunched under her worn wellies, the sound a brittle counterpoint to the mournful bleating of sheep huddled against the wind in the far paddock.  Amelia, more affectionately known as "Mia" by the animals and "Miss Finch" by the less affectionate members of the village, shivered, pulling her thick woolen scarf higher.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a familiar aroma that permeated the sprawling, ancient grounds of Blackwood Manor, her home and the sanctuary she'd painstakingly built for over a hundred neglected and abandoned creatures.  Blackwood Manor itself, a rambling gothic structure that seemed to claw at the bruised twilight sky, hunched over the valley like a brooding giant, its darkened windows reflecting the stormy clouds above.  This was Mia's world – a chaotic, messy, utterly delightful world of slobbering hounds, skittish rabbits, and the occasional grumpy alpaca. Tonight, however, even the usual comforting chaos felt overshadowed by a creeping unease.  Something felt…off.
