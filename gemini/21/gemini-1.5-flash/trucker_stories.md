The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the Big Red, a beast of a truck he'd lovingly maintained for fifteen years.  Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already indistinct lines of the Nevada desert highway, turning the landscape into a watercolor of grays and muddy browns.  The wipers fought a losing battle, leaving streaks that mirrored the fatigue etched onto Bart's face.  He was somewhere between Ely and Tonopah, swallowed by the vast emptiness, the only sound louder than the relentless drumming of the rain being the lonely howl of the wind whistling through the gaps in the aging truck's seals. The air inside smelled of stale coffee, sweat, and the faint, lingering scent of diesel fuel â€“ the comforting aroma of home for a man who considered his truck his only true sanctuary.
