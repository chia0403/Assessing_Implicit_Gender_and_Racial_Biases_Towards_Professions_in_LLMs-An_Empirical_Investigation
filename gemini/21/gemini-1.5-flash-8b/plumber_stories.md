The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Wrench" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, pooled and stagnant, reflected the sign's distorted image.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's domain, a labyrinth of cramped apartments and forgotten promises, a place where the echoes of leaky pipes and frustrated tenants lingered long after the sun had set.  Barty, a burly man with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand clogged drains, adjusted his worn leather apron.  He squinted at the address scrawled on the damp cardboard – 27 Willow Creek – a place rumored to be haunted by more than just the ghosts of broken fixtures.  Tonight, Barty would face more than just a leaky faucet; he sensed a deeper, more unsettling problem lurking within the walls of 27 Willow Creek.
