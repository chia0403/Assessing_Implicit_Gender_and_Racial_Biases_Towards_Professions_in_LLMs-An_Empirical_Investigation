The chipped Formica countertop reflected the fluorescent hum of the insurance office, a pale, sickly yellow that clung to everything like a shroud.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the building, mirroring the relentless drumming in Amelia Blackwood's temples.  The rhythmic thudding was amplified by the cacophony of the office: the incessant clicking of keyboards, the low murmur of hushed conversations, and the jarring ring of the phone, a relentless metronome counting down to something unknown. Amelia, a seasoned insurance agent with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless claims, stared at the overflowing file marked "Smith, Reginald."

Setting: A small, second-floor office in a nondescript building in the heart of a bustling but decaying urban area.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and despair, a scent that clung to the worn carpets and the faded floral wallpaper.  The office, while functional, lacked any semblance of warmth or personality.  Outside, the city throbbed with a chaotic energy that seemed to seep into the building, a stark contrast to the contained, almost claustrophobic atmosphere inside.  The overall impression was one of muted desperation, a quiet, underlying hum of unspoken anxieties.
