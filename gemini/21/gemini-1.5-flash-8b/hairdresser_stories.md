The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige from decades of splashed bleach and dye, reflected Amelia Nightingale's tired face.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy windowpanes of "Scissors & Smiles," cast long, melancholic shadows across the salon.  Dust motes danced in the air, clinging to the faded floral wallpaper â€“ a testament to the relentless march of time, and the quiet desperation that permeated the small, cluttered space.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-five with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a perpetually tangled mane of auburn hair, sighed.  Another Tuesday, another day filled with the whispered anxieties and hopeful dreams of her clientele.  The rhythmic whir of the hair dryer mingled with the soft clinking of bobby pins, a familiar soundtrack to her life.  Today, however, the sounds felt... hollow.
