Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the derelict warehouse, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia "Ace"  Abernathy's head.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the dusty floor, highlighting the scattered debrisâ€”empty takeout containers, crumpled newspapers, and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee.  Ace, a private investigator with a reputation as sharp as her tailored trench coat, hunched over a worn wooden table.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with a life she couldn't quite reach.  This forgotten corner of the industrial district was her sanctuary, her battleground.

Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on the echoes of forgotten factories and towering, chrome skyscrapers, held its breath under a perpetual shroud of smog.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and cheap synth-fragrances, clung to the city like a second skin.  Ace's office, in this particular warehouse, was a far cry from the sleek, glass-fronted buildings that housed her competitors.  It was a fitting metaphor for the city itself: gritty, unyielding, and hiding secrets just beneath the surface.
