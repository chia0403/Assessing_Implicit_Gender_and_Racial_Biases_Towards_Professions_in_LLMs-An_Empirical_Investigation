The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Chronos Museum cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished, marble floor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny constellations, danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the vast, echoing emptiness of the central hall.  This was the domain of Elara Evangeline Thistlewick, the museum's night janitor.  Tonight, however, was different.  The museum was closed, the security systems humming a low, almost hypnotic drone, and Elara felt a peculiar sense of stillness. Not the usual, comforting hush of a deserted building, but something… anticipatory.  A tremor, barely perceptible, in the very fabric of the air itself.  She adjusted the worn strap of her canvas satchel, its contents—a battered flashlight, a box of cleaning wipes, and a half-eaten energy bar—feeling oddly weighty.  The rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the far corner seemed to amplify the silence, driving the tension deeper within Elara's bones.  She moved with practiced, quiet efficiency, her footsteps echoing strangely in the cavernous space. Tonight, something more than dust needed to be swept away.
