The back alleys of Harmony City, a sprawling metropolis known as much for its towering skyscrapers and glittering facades as for its labyrinthine underbelly of hidden speakeasies, back-alley markets, and forgotten corners.

The air hummed with the low thrum of the city, a symphony of distant sirens and the rhythmic clang of metal on metal.  The scent of stale beer and roasting street food mingled with the metallic tang of the rain.
