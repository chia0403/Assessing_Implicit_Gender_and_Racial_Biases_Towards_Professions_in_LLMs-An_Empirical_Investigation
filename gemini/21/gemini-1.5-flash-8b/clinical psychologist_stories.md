The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of her laptop keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the grimy window of her cramped Brooklyn apartment, illuminating the chipped paint and worn linoleum floor.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, stared at the patient profile on her screen:  "Samuel Hayes, 32, seeking therapy for PTSD stemming from a childhood accident."  The name, though simple, felt heavy.

The aroma of burnt coffee and stale takeout wafted through the air.  Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her tangled brown hair. Another Monday.  Another case.  She shifted in her worn leather chair, a half-eaten apple core resting on the cluttered desk beside a stack of meticulously organized therapy journals. Outside, the city's relentless pulse thrummed with the sounds of sirens and street vendors, a constant soundtrack to her life. The small, almost anonymous apartment, with its proximity to the bustling street, was both a comfort and a constant reminder of the chaos outside her door.
