The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull beige from years of lukewarm water and forgotten teaspoons, reflected Elara Blackwood's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the gloom of the grand, yet somehow neglected, drawing-room.  The scent of lilies, a potent perfume, hung heavy in the air, competing with the faint, acrid tang of old tobacco.  Elara, her housekeeper's uniform – a serviceable, but faded, navy blue – clinging to her slender frame, sighed.  Another day, another meticulously cleaned room, another unanswered question about the enigmatic inhabitants of Ashworth Manor.

Ashworth Manor, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the brooding moors of Yorkshire, England, was a gothic masterpiece shrouded in whispers and shadows.  Tall, dark windows stared out at the world, their frames stained with age and neglect.  Twisted ivy snaked around the weathered stone walls, clinging like spectral fingers to the decaying grandeur.  Inside, the echoing silence was punctuated only by the rustle of Elara's duster and the creak of ancient floorboards.  Years of dust and secrets had settled here, clinging to the tapestries and portraits like cobwebs spun by forgotten spirits.  The manor's inhabitants, the austere Lord Ashworth and his enigmatic, barely-seen daughter, Lady Beatrice, had lived within these walls for as long as Elara could remember, creating a labyrinth of unspoken words and hidden truths that she, the unseen keeper of Ashworth, slowly, meticulously, pieced together.
