Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Probation Department office, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s thoughts.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the stack of case files, each one a miniature universe of someone's failings and aspirations.  Amelia, a Probation Officer with the District Attorney's office in the gritty urban sprawl of South Bend, felt the familiar weight of her job pressing down on her shoulders.  She was thirty-two, with a weariness etched onto her face that years of late nights and difficult conversations had carved.  Her worn leather jacket, a relic from a bygone era of optimism, hung on the back of the chair.  Today, however, the rain mirrored the storm brewing inside her.  A particularly nasty case, involving a young man named Leo, filled her with unease.  He was a gifted artist, whose talent was seemingly overshadowed by his tendency towards impulsive recklessness.  Amelia had a nagging feeling this case, this young man, would test her limits.  The city outside, reflecting the turmoil within her, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the storm to break.
