The humid air hung thick and heavy in the cabin, a tangible blanket draped over the sleek, polished aluminum of the 787.  Outside, the emerald canopy of the Amazon rainforest rushed past like a living tapestry, vibrant and alive despite the encroaching twilight.  Amelia Santiago, her name embossed in elegant script on her uniform, felt a prickle of unease.  The usual pre-landing chatter of the passengers was muted, a hushed expectancy settling over the economy class section.  She traced the condensation forming on the condensation-resistant window, a miniature rainforest reflecting back at her.  Tonight's flight, from Manaus to Rio, was scheduled to be a routine journey, but a nagging feeling, a subtle vibration of foreboding, persisted.  The jungle, with its untamed pulse, seemed to be whispering secrets into the darkening sky.  The city lights of Rio, usually a welcoming beacon, seemed miles away, lost in the inky blackness.  Amelia knew this flight was more than just a journey between two cities; it held a potential for something unexpected, something... dangerous.
