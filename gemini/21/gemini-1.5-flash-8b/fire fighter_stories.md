The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the firehouse windows like restless spirits.  Rain, the consistency of icy needles, hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mirroring the frantic thump-thump-thump of Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s heart.  Amy, a seasoned firefighter with the Blackwood Volunteer Fire Department, knew this storm wasn't just a weather event; it was a harbinger.  The whispering pines and the guttural groan of the old stone foundation, just outside the small town of Oakhaven, held a tension heavier than the falling rain.  Oakhaven, nestled in a valley hemmed by towering mountains, was a place of quiet beauty, a sanctuary in many ways, but tonight its idyllic facade hid a growing threat. The firehouse, a weathered clapboard building with a faded, red-and-white paint job, stood as a silent sentinel, its flickering fluorescent lights casting long shadows across the worn wooden floors. Amy, clutching her thermal jacket tighter, gripped the worn handle of her duty-issued axe, the metal cold against her trembling fingers.  Tonight, the call wasn't just a call; it was a prophecy.
