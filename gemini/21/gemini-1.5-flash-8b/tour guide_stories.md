The biting wind whipped Amelia Genevieve Blackwood's scarf around her neck, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of colours unfolding before her.  The emerald green of the valley floor, dotted with wildflowers in hues of sapphire and gold, was a breathtaking counterpoint to the slate-grey peaks that clawed at the bruised sky above.  This, Amelia thought, was the heart of the Whispering Mountains, a place where legend whispered on the breath of every breeze and every rushing stream.  Today, she was entrusted with leading a particularly discerning group of tourists â€“ a gaggle of seasoned hikers, a couple of jaded journalists, and a trio of bored-looking teenagers.  Their expectations, she knew, were high.  And Amelia, despite her love for this breathtaking terrain, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  This particular tour was crucial.  This wasn't just about showing them the sights; it was about making them *feel* the spirit of the mountains, about unlocking the secrets that lay hidden beneath the ancient stones and within the echoey valleys.  But could she do it? Could she bring the Whispering Mountains to life for this group, so different from each other and from herself?
