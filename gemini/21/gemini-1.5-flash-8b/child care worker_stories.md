The fluorescent lights of the "Tiny Tots" daycare hummed, a sterile, white-noise symphony that often drowned out the chaos Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez found strangely comforting.  Today, though, the usual babble of toddler giggles and the rhythmic clatter of tiny plastic cups were replaced by an unnerving quiet.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and something else... something metallic, faintly sweet.

Amy, a young woman with a perpetual smudge of paint on her cheeks and a determined set to her usually bright eyes, surveyed the room.  Rows of brightly coloured playhouses stood silent, their miniature furniture abandoned.  The usual boisterous energy had been sucked out, leaving only a lingering sense ofâ€¦ unease.  

The daycare, nestled in the heart of a quiet, tree-lined cul-de-sac on the edge of Oakhaven, was normally a haven of childhood joy.  But this morning, the once vibrant community was shrouded in a peculiar stillness, as if the very air itself held its breath. The faded paint on the playroom walls hinted at the building's history, its quiet corners whispering stories of countless children and their laughter, now replaced by a palpable feeling of something amiss.
