The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air of the little Parisian bakery, "Le Pain d'Or," a tiny, almost hidden gem tucked between a bustling flower market and a shadowy alleyway.

The rhythmic clatter of the old-fashioned bread kneader was her only companion in the cavernous space, save for the occasional squeak of the ancient wooden floorboards under her feet.  Each turn of the crank brought her closer to dawn, and the inevitable judgment that came with it.
