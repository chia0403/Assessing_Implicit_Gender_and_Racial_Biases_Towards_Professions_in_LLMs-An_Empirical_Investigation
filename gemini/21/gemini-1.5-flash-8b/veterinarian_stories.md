The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, clawed at Amelia Blackwood's coat as she hurried down the rutted track leading to the remote Blackwood Valley Animal Clinic.  Dust, whipped into a swirling frenzy by the wind, stung her eyes, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon sun.  The valley itself, nestled deep within the rugged Scottish highlands, was a tapestry of muted colours: grey stone, russet heather, and the stark, almost charcoal-black silhouettes of ancient pines.  Frozen streams, glistening like shards of broken glass, snaked through the landscape, reflecting the bruised purple of the sky. This was no place for a delicate heart, Amelia thought, as the biting wind carried the mournful cries of unseen creatures through the valley.  Her clinic, a small, weather-beaten stone building, stood isolated against the bleak beauty, a testament to her determination and her love for the creatures that called this desolate place home. Amelia Blackwood, her fingers stiff with cold, finally reached the clinicâ€™s weathered wooden door.
