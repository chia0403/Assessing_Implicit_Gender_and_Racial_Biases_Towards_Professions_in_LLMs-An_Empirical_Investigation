Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Elara Nightingale’s chest.  The small, windowless physiotherapy practice, nestled in the shadow of the towering, rust-coloured industrial complex that dominated the city’s outskirts, was usually a haven of quiet focus.  Today, however, the air thrummed with an unseen tension, a palpable anxiety that clung to the scent of antiseptic and damp plaster.  Elara, a physical therapist with sharp eyes and a surprisingly gentle touch, meticulously adjusted the straps of the patient’s brace, her movements precise yet imbued with a desperate urgency.  The patient, a young man named Leo, lay still, his eyes squeezed shut, his face pale as a sheet.  The rhythmic thud of the rain was the only sound that broke the oppressive silence.
