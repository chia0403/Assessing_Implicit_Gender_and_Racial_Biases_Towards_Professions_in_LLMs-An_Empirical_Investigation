The sterile white walls of the Cryo-Genesis Lab hummed with a low, rhythmic thrum, a constant counterpoint to Dr. Aris Thorne's frantic pacing.  Fluorescent lights, harsh and unforgiving, illuminated the meticulously organized shelves of cryogenic storage tanks, each labelled with a cryptic code and a date.  Outside, the city of Neo-Alexandria, a sprawling metropolis built upon the crumbling foundations of the old world, throbbed with its own feverish energy, a stark contrast to the controlled chill of the lab.  Rain hammered against the reinforced windows, a relentless percussion mirroring the pounding in Aris' temples.  He'd been staring at the data for hours, and each number, each graph, each flickering waveform seemed to mock him, to taunt him with the possibility that everything he'd dedicated his life to might be for naught.  He needed to find the error, but the error, if it was there, was hidden deep within the complex algorithms, a phantom lurking in the code.
