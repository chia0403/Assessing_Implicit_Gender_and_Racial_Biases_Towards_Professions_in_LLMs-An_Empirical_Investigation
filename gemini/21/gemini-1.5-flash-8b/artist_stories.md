The chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly from a chipped socket, sat perched precariously on the edge of Amelia Nightingale's easel.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked window of her cramped attic studio.  Damp air hung heavy, clinging to the faded floral wallpaper and the canvases strewn across the floor like discarded scraps of dreams.  Paintbrushes, like skeletal fingers, lay scattered amongst half-finished portraits, landscapes that seemed to weep with an unnamable melancholy, and still life arrangements that echoed the emptiness Amelia felt inside.  The old house, a crumbling testament to a bygone era, seemed to sigh with every gust of wind rattling the broken panes.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of raven's wings, stared at the doll, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek.  The year was 1928.
