The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s camera bag around her thin frame, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  Above, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, gnarled and black against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the bruised sky like skeletal fingers.  She huddled deeper into her worn leather coat, the damp air seeping into her wool socks and chilling her to the bone.  The abandoned quarry, a gaping maw in the earth, yawned before her, swallowed by the encroaching shadows.  This was the perfect light, Amelia thought, the kind that whispered stories of forgotten lives.  Stories she craved to capture, stories that lay buried beneath the layers of grime and neglect, just waiting to be unearthed through the lens of her camera.  This was her favourite subject: the haunting beauty of decay.  Amelia, a photographer famed for her evocative portraits of forgotten landscapes, knew this quarry held a particular, potent beauty, a story desperately yearning to be told.
