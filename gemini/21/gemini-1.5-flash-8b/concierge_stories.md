The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded ochre by years of lukewarm water and forgotten dreams, reflected the glint of Amelia Blackwood's spectacles.  She adjusted them, the thin frames digging into her temples, and squinted at the meticulously organized ledger spread across the polished mahogany desk.  "The Blackwood Manor," she murmured, the name rolling off her tongue like a well-worn melody.  Outside, the rain hammered against the leaded glass of the grand entrance hall, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic flurry of paperwork on her desk.

Amelia Blackwood, concierge of the Blackwood Manor for the past twenty-seven years, was a woman sculpted from quiet efficiency and encyclopedic knowledge of the grand estate.  The Manor, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the whispering Vale of Whispers, was a labyrinth of creaking timbers, echoing corridors, and sun-drenched rose gardens.  Its very existence seemed to whisper of faded grandeur and hushed secrets.  Guests, both seasoned travelers and curious newcomers, arrived and departed, each a chapter in the Manor's long and storied history.  Amelia, with her spectacles perched, was the silent guardian, the unseen anchor, connecting the living to the echoing past.  This particular morning, however, felt different.  A strange chill had settled over the manor, an unnatural quiet that settled heavy on the air, and the ledger felt oddly heavier than usual.
