The scent of aged mahogany and freshly cut roses hung heavy in the air, a perfume Amelia "Em" Cavendish adored.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting a stylized forest, painted dappled patterns across the opulent drawing room.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, illuminating the delicate floral embroidery on the antique Persian rug, a testament to Em's meticulous eye.  She, herself, was a whirlwind of energy, dressed in a tailored linen suit the colour of a summer sky, her fingers tracing the intricate carvings of a Louis XV chair.  Today's client, the enigmatic Mr. Alistair Finch, a reclusive art collector known for his uncompromising taste, was due any minute.

Em had been meticulously designing and decorating his vast Georgian manor for the past six months, a project that had tested her creativity and patience to their limits.  This particular room, the heart of the house, was the culmination of her painstaking efforts.  She'd researched obscure antique dealers in Paris and Berlin, hunted down rare textiles in the bustling markets of Marrakech, and finally, sourced the perfect emerald green velvet drapes that, she knew, would create the perfect backdrop for his extraordinary collection.  A slight tremor ran through her as she considered the weight of the project, and the quiet anticipation that filled the air. The manor, Blackwood Hall, was steeped in history, whispers of tragedy and secrets clinging to its imposing stone facade.  Each creaking board, each shadowed corner seemed to hold a story, a story she was now tasked with weaving into a tapestry of modern elegance and quiet sophistication.
