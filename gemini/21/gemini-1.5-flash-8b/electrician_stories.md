The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Sparkle & Shine" appliance repair shop cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his face smeared with a greasy film that stubbornly clung to his skin despite repeated attempts to wipe it away.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the insistent buzz in his ears.  Barty, a seasoned electrician with hands that seemed to possess a life of their own, crouched beneath a towering refrigerator, its compressor wheezing a mournful symphony of mechanical distress.  The shop, a cramped space crammed with defunct televisions, broken washing machines, and the lingering aroma of burnt toast, was a microcosm of urban decay, a place where time seemed to stand still, trapped in a perpetual loop of repairs and malfunctions.  Outside, the grey city of Veridian sprawled under a bruised sky, the relentless industrial hum of the city a distant roar that only intensified the quiet desperation of the repair shop.
