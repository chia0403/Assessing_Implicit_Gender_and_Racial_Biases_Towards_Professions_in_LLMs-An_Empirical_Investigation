The air in the "Golden Spoon" hung thick with the aroma of simmering saffron and roasting garlic, a fragrant fog that clung to Amelia "Spice"  Sprout's apron as she navigated the bustling kitchen.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows of the old inn, painted the polished wooden counters in shifting patterns of amber and emerald.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminated by the hissing steam rising from the copper cauldrons.  Amelia, her dark braid escaping its careful knot, flicked a stray strand of hair from her face, her brow furrowed in concentration as she carefully seasoned a pan of lamb.  The Golden Spoon, nestled in the shadowed heart of the Whispering Woods, had been her haven for the last ten years, a sanctuary from the world outside, a world sheâ€™d largely forgotten.  But lately, the quiet was disturbed.  Not by the usual clatter of plates or the murmur of travelers, but by a persistent, unsettling feeling of unease that clung to the air like the very smell of the spices she loved.
