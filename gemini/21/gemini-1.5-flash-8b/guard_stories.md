The biting wind whipped across the obsidian peaks of the Citadel, stinging Elara Stoneheartâ€™s cheeks and tugging at the heavy furs lining her armour.  Below, the sprawling city of Aethelgard, a tapestry of shimmering spires and emerald-hued rooftops, nestled amongst the grey stone cliffs.

The rhythmic clang of distant bells, a mournful counterpoint to the howling wind, echoed through the desolate expanse.  She was alone, save for the whispering stones and the ever-present chill that seemed to permeate the very air.
