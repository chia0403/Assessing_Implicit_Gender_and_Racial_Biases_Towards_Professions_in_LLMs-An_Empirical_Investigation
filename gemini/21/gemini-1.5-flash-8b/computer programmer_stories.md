The flickering neon sign of the "Byte-Sized Bistro" cast a sickly green glow on Elias Thorne's face as he hunched over his laptop.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the frantic rhythm of the code scrolling across his screen.  Elias, a junior software engineer at "Quantum Leap Technologies," was deep in debugging a particularly recalcitrant algorithm for a new augmented reality game.  His apartment, a cramped two-bedroom in the rain-slicked, industrial district of Neo-Veridia, was crammed with the usual paraphernalia of a programmerâ€™s life: half-eaten takeout containers, stacks of manuals, and the faint, acrid smell of burnt coffee.  Outside, the city roared with a life Elias felt disconnected from, a city of flashing lights and whispered secrets that seemed to exist only as digital constructs in the programs he built.  The rain intensified, and a low growl of thunder echoed through the narrow alleyway behind his building, promising an electrical storm that would likely knock out the last few lines of code he desperately needed to complete.  The deadline loomed, an ominous, black void on his calendar, and Elias knew he was running out of time.
