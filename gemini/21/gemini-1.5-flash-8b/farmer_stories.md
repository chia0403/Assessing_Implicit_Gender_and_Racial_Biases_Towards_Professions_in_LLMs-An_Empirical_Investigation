The biting wind, a relentless prairie dog yipping at the sky, whipped across the cracked earth of the Blackwood Prairie, stinging Elias Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and despair, danced across the parched fields, swirling around the skeletal remains of last year's crops.  This was the third year of drought, and Elias, a man weathered to the bone like the ancient oaks clinging to the hillsides, felt the gnawing emptiness of a promised harvest wither within him.  His family, the Blackwoods, had farmed this land for generations, and this year, the land seemed to be fighting back.  Elias, a man known for his quiet strength and unwavering resolve, knew something had to change.  He just didn't know what.  His name, Elias Blackwood, was etched into the very fabric of the prairie, a familiar rumble echoing through the dry, cracked earth.

The Blackwood homestead, a weathered clapboard house clinging to the side of a low ridge, seemed to shrink into the landscape with each passing day.  A lone, skeletal oak stood sentinel in the front yard, its gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal arms towards a sky the color of burnt orange.  The well, once a reliable source of life-giving water, had dwindled to a shallow, muddy pit, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the drought.  Scattered, sun-baked patches of struggling sunflowers, pathetically small and fragile, clung to life, their faces turned towards the scorching sun, a silent prayer for rain.  A single, mournful crow perched on the rusty weather vane atop the barn, its caw a haunting counterpoint to the silence of the dying prairie.
