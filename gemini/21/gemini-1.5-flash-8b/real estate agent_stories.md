The biting wind whipped Amelia Thorne's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, overgrown lot.  The property, advertised as the "Dreamland Estate," was less a dream and more a forgotten nightmare.  Twisted branches of ancient oak trees clawed at the bruised, grey sky, their skeletal fingers reaching like grasping hands toward the derelict Victorian mansion at the heart of the property.  Amelia, a seasoned real estate agent with a penchant for the dramatic, felt a shiver more than just from the chill.  This place held a palpable history, a history that whispered secrets in the rattling windows and sighed in the rustling leaves.  She adjusted her worn leather satchel, already feeling the familiar weight of the potential, or perhaps, the impending doom.

Rain-slicked cobblestone streets wind through the heart of Blackwood, a town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, its houses clinging to hillsides like ancient, weathered stone. The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  The Blackwood Valley, renowned for its beauty and isolation, was also shrouded in a pervasive sense of foreboding, particularly in the shadows of the valley's forgotten estates.
