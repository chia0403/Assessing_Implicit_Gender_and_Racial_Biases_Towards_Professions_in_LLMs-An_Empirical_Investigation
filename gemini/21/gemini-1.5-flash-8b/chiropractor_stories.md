The fluorescent lights of Dr. Alistair Finch's office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of his shoes against the linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating the faded posters on the walls – inspirational quotes about the power of the spine, anatomical diagrams that looked more like abstract art.  Alistair, a chiropractor with a precise, almost surgical, manner, adjusted the spine of a patient, a young woman named Emily, with a practiced hand.  The office, nestled in the quiet, suburban corner of Oakhaven, was more a testament to practicality than aesthetics.  Bookshelves overflowing with medical texts lined one wall, a testament to Alistair’s unwavering dedication to his craft.  A small, perpetually overflowing bin of discarded x-rays sat in the corner, a subtle indicator of the steady stream of patients who sought relief from the aches and pains of modern life. Outside, the gentle murmur of traffic on Oakhaven Avenue was a comforting, if somewhat distant, sound.  This was Alistair's sanctuary, his battlefield, where he wielded not a scalpel, but a hand, to restore harmony to the human frame.
