The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening crimson stains on the worn wooden floor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the glinting steel of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's cleaver.  Barty, a man sculpted from sinew and weathered oak, hunched over a slab of beef, the rhythmic thud of his blade a counterpoint to the mournful hoot of an owl outside.  The air, thick with the earthy aroma of blood and brine, clung to the walls, a persistent whisper of the life that had once pulsed within the carcasses before him.

**Setting:**  A cramped, dimly lit butcher shop in the cobbled alleyways of 19th-century London.  The shop, barely larger than a small room, was crammed with hanging hams, stacks of sausages, and various cuts of meat.  A pungent mixture of blood and spices hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the city buzzed with the clamour of horse-drawn carts and the distant rumble of industry, creating a stark contrast to the quiet, almost spectral atmosphere of the shop.  A thick fog clung to the buildings, blurring the already hazy outlines of the town and shrouding the street in a perpetual twilight.
