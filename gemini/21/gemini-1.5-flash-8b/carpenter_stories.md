The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar blanket comforting Elias Thorne, son of a carpenter, around him.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated panes of the workshop window, dappled the polished wood shavings scattered across the floor.  Elias, a young man of twenty-three with hands calloused but surprisingly delicate, meticulously carved a tiny wooden bird from a piece of salvaged mahogany.  Each feather, each wingtip, was sculpted with a precision that hinted at a hidden artistic soul buried beneath the practicalities of his craft.  The workshop, tucked away in the shadowed alleyways behind the bustling marketplace, was a sanctuary, a refuge from the clamor of the city.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, crunched beneath his boots as he occasionally wandered to fetch more wood or the perfect length of twine from the nearby market stall.  The aroma of roasting meats and spices mingled with the workshop's familiar scent, a symphony of the city's pulse echoing around him.
