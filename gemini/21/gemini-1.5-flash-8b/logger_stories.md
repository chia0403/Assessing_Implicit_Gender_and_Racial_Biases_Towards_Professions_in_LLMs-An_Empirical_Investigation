The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, clawing at Silas Blackwood's weathered face.  He squinted, his eyes adjusting to the grey-white gloom that clung to the mountainside like a shroud.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a scent that always seemed to follow him, a persistent, unwelcome companion on these solitary climbs.  Silas, a logger with hands like knotted oak and a heart hardened by years of relentless work, trudged onward.  He was alone, as always, save for the rustling leaves and the distant, mournful cry of a hawk circling high above the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains.

**Setting:**

The rugged, windswept slopes of the Cascade Mountain range,  Oregon.  Deep within the wilderness, beyond the reach of roads and towns, lay a dense forest of ancient firs, hemlocks, and pines.  This particular section, known locally as "The Whispering Woods," was rumored to be haunted by restless spirits and guarded by unseen forces.  The air was perpetually damp, the shadows deep and unpredictable.  Patches of snow clung to the higher elevations, contrasting with the muted greens and browns of the forest floor.  A network of ancient trails, barely discernible through the undergrowth, crisscrossed the terrain, leading to isolated logging camps and forgotten clearings.
