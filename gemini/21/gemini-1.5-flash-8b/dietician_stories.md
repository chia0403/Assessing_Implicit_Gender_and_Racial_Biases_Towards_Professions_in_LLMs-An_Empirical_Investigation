The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, like old pennies submerged in stagnant water.  Dr. Amelia "Amy"  Chen, a registered dietitian with a meticulous approach to even the most mundane tasks, squinted through the haze.  The vibrant emerald green of the rain forest canopy, a kaleidoscope of life unseen, offered little reprieve from the oppressive heat.  Her small, sun-bleached bungalow, tucked between towering trees on the edge of a remote Nicaraguan village, felt more like a humid terrarium than a home.  The walls, constructed of woven palm leaves, strained under the relentless humidity, whispering stories of centuries past.  A constant drip-drip-drip echoed through the space, the sound of the monsoon season already well underway.  Outside, the chirping of unseen insects mingled with the rhythmic thud of raindrops on the tin roof. Amy's mission, as always, was simple: to bridge the gap between the breathtaking natural beauty of the rainforest and the nutritional needs of its inhabitants.  This remote community, isolated and struggling, was her current challenge.
