The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Spindle" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Oakhaven.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of ozone and stale coffee.  Amelia Blackwood, radio technician extraordinaire, adjusted the delicate dial of a vintage Marconi receiver, her calloused fingers tracing the intricate etchings.  A faint, almost inaudible hiss crackled through the speakers, a whisper of static that promised something more.  The antique clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, its pendulum swing echoing the pounding rhythm of Amelia's heart.  Tonight, the whispers of the Aether held a potential danger, a beckoning unknown, and Amelia, with her worn leather apron and perpetually surprised expression, was ready to answer the call.


Old Oakhaven, nestled between the whispering pines and the ominous, eternally fog-shrouded Blackwood Hills, was a city steeped in secrets. Its cobblestone streets, perpetually damp and smelling of decaying leaves, concealed ancient tunnels and forgotten rituals.  Towering gothic architecture, crumbling around the edges, and overgrown with ivy, clung to the steep hillsides.  The city's history, a tangled vine of whispered legends and lost technologies, pulsed through the very stones underfoot.  The air itself seemed to hold the echoes of conversations long since ended, the faint scent of forgotten alchemy.  Radio technology, a relative newcomer to Oakhaven, was viewed with suspicion and reverence, both a gift and a curse to its residents.
