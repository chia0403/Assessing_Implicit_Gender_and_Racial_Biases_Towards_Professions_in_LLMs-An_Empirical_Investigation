The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  Dust motes danced in the skeletal sunlight filtering through the bare branches of the ancient oaks, casting long, mournful shadows across the ravaged landscape.  It was the third week of November, and the once vibrant flowerbeds of the Blackwood Estate were a bruised, earthy canvas.  Amelia, a landscaper with hands that spoke fluent languages of loam and clay, felt the familiar knot of frustration tighten in her chest.  This was a job beyond saving, she thought grimly.  A job that had been handed to her with a smile and a cheque, then abandoned to the elements.

The Blackwood Estate, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the town of Ashwood, was a grand, if neglected, manor.  Its imposing stone facade, etched with the ghosts of bygone eras, seemed to watch, unblinking, as the garden withered around it.  A half-buried fountain, its once-polished bronze now covered in a thick layer of lichen, stood as a monument to forgotten grandeur.  A riotous tangle of weeds clawed at the stone walls, pushing back against the crumbling remnants of formal parterres.  Amelia, nestled amongst the chaos, felt a familiar pang of empathy for the abused beauty before her.  She was a healer of landscapes, a whisperer of life into barren soil, and yet even her touch felt inadequate in the face of such utter desolation.
