The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and the unspoken anxieties of the pre-dawn crowd.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Blackwood's brow, mirroring the sheen of the polished hardwood floor of "Sunrise Strength."  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of countless feet echoed through the studio, a symphony of determination punctuated by the occasional strained groan.  Amelia, a woman with a determined jawline and eyes that held the unwavering gaze of a seasoned mountain climber, surveyed the room.  Her bright orange leotard, a trademark of her exuberant personality, vibrated with the energy she channeled into her classes.  This was it, the first Sunrise Strength class of the week.  Her loyal regulars were already filling the space, their faces a mixture of sleepiness and anticipation.  The pre-dawn glow painted the sky in shades of bruised purple and pale pink, casting long shadows across the walls that seemed to pulse with the growing energy of the class.  Amelia took a deep breath, a silent promise to herself and her students that this morning's session would be one for the books.
