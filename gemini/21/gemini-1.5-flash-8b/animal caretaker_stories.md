The biting November wind whipped around Elara Vance, snagging at the frayed edges of her worn coat as she surveyed the sprawling, wrought-iron enclosure.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that bordered the Blackwood Manor's grounds.  Within the enclosure, a dozen snowshoe hares, their fur the colour of freshly fallen snow, huddled together, their soft breaths puffing in the cold air. Elara, Animal Caretaker at Blackwood Manor, adjusted her thick woolen scarf, the scent of pine needles and damp earth filling her lungs.  This was her sanctuary, a place of quiet responsibility, a place where the rhythms of nature – the soft snuffling, the rhythmic nibbling, the hushed rustling of leaves – were the soundtrack to her life.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic edifice steeped in centuries of hushed secrets and whispered histories, held its breath, waiting for the coming of winter.  Elara, however, was always prepared, meticulously tracking the hares' food supply, ensuring the quality of their water, and adjusting the temperature of their heated burrows as the nights grew colder.  This year, however, something felt different. The usual comforting routine was tinged with an unnerving quiet.  The manor's usual symphony of life, usually orchestrated by the staff and the animals, was at a disconcerting low volume.
