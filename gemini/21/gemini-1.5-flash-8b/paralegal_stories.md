Rain hammered against the grimy, corrugated iron roof of the law firm, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless pounding of Amelia Hawthorne's heart.  The air in the back office, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy, mirroring the weight pressing down on her.

This small, windowless office, tucked away on the second floor of a crumbling building on the edge of the city's forgotten district, was her fortress. It was also her purgatory.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air, and making the worn, beige walls seem even more oppressive.  The city, a vibrant tapestry of lights and sounds just beyond the rain-streaked windows, felt miles away.  Today, the relentless downpour seemed to reflect the relentless, almost inescapable tide of legal battles she was caught in.  A phone rang, its sharp, insistent tone cutting through the silence, and Amelia knew another case, another tragedy, was waiting for her, trapped within the pages of those documents, waiting to be unearthed.
