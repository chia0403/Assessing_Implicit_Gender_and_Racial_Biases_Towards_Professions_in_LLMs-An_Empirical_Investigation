The crimson sun bled across the horizon, painting the jagged peaks of the Veridian Mountains in hues of fire and ash.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grit, danced across the cracked earth of the Obsidian Flats.  This was the domain of  Bartholomew "Barty"  Stoneheart, heavy equipment operator extraordinaire, and today, it was his domain's fury that held his attention.  Barty, a man sculpted from sun-baked earth and steel, surveyed the scene from atop the cab of his Caterpillar 990H.  The machine, a behemoth of hydraulics and metal, was a testament to both his strength and the unforgiving landscape.  Sweat beaded on his brow, not from the exertion, but from the oppressive heat radiating off the scorched earth.  His worn, leather-clad hands, calloused and scarred, gripped the levers with a practiced certainty.  Before him stretched a valley, a scar across the otherwise desolate landscape, where a relentless sandstorm had carved a path of destruction.  A once-lush oasis lay choked under tons of windblown sand, and the job was Barty's.
