The biting wind whipped Amelia "Storm"  Fitzwilliam's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  Below, the cobbled streets of Old St. Denis, a city clinging precariously to the flanks of the jagged, volcanic mountains, were a swirling tapestry of grey and shadow.  A perpetual drizzle, characteristic of the region, clung to everything, even the skeletal, smoke-stained peaks that clawed at the bruised, overcast sky.  Amelia, a roofer with hands hardened by years of clinging to precarious angles, adjusted her worn leather gloves.  Her gaze, sharp as a hawk's, swept across the dilapidated rooftops.  Each terracotta tile, each weathered plank, a silent testament to the city's struggles and resilience.   Her purpose was clear:  to find the source of the leak that had begun to erode the roof of the Maison Dubois, a crumbling structure renowned throughout the city for its exquisite, but now threatened, stained glass windows.  This wasn't just a repair; it was a race against time, and the relentless weather was her adversary.
