Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "The Shifting Sands," a small, dimly lit massage parlour tucked away on a side street in the bustling port city of Aethelgard.  The rhythmic drumming punctuated the soft hum of the ancient air conditioner, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic sighs emanating from the therapy rooms within.  Inside, Elara Solstice, a massage therapist with hands as supple and strong as polished ebony, meticulously kneaded the tense muscles of a client, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the sea that often seeped into the room through the open window.  Aethelgard, a city built on the ebb and flow of maritime trade, held a tension mirroring the relentless waves crashing against its harbour walls.  Elara, however, found a different kind of solace in the quiet rhythm of her work, in the gentle release of her clients' anxieties and the quiet hum of the ancient, worn machinery.
