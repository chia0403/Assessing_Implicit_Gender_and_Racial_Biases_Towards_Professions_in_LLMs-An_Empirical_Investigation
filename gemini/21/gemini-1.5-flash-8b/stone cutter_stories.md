The biting wind whipped dust and grit across the sun-baked plains of Xylos, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  A thousand shades of ochre and terracotta swirled around her, mirroring the countless carved stones stacked haphazardly in the quarry.  Her hands, roughened and stained with the earth-toned hues of Xylos, gripped the worn handle of her chisel.  Elara Stonehand, a name whispered with respect and a touch of fear in the mountain villages, was alone, as always, in the heart of the Serpent's Spine quarry.

The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and dried earth, punctuated by the metallic tang of the stone itself.  Sunlight, fractured by jagged peaks, illuminated the colossal, grey-veined monolith that stood before her.  For generations, the Serpent's Spine, an ancient, mythical mountain, had been the quarry's source of raw material â€“ stone imbued with a strange energy, capable of whispering secrets to the skilled, and nightmares to the unskilled.  Elara, however, understood these whispers.  She heard the stories etched into the very grain of the stone, the echoes of forgotten gods and long-lost civilizations.  The Serpent's Spine was more than just a mountain; it was a library.  Her task, her obsession, was to unearth its secrets, one chipped fragment at a time.
