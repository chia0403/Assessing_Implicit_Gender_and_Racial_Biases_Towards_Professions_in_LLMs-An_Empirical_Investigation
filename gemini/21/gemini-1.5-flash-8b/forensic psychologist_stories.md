Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Dr. Eleanor Vance's temples.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and something vaguely metallic, clung to her like a second skin.  Broken glass crunched under her boots as she navigated the debris-strewn floor, the fluorescent lights flickering erratically, casting long, dancing shadows.  This wasn't your typical crime scene; it was a forgotten chapter, a story left incomplete, and Dr. Vance, forensic psychologist with a penchant for the meticulously obscured, was determined to unearth its secrets.

The setting:  The dilapidated "Ironclad Works," a once-proud industrial behemoth now a crumbling husk on the outskirts of the rust-colored city of Ashwood.  Its imposing silhouette, scarred with rust and pockmarked by time, loomed over the surrounding landscape of neglected housing estates and overgrown fields.  The factory had fallen silent years ago, swallowed by the relentless march of progress and forgotten by all but the scavengers and the whispers of local legend.  Dr. Vance, however, had heard the whispers, drawn by the unsettling murmurings of the locals who spoke of a "curse" that clung to the building, a shadow of despair that had claimed its previous inhabitants.  And she knew, with the chilling certainty that only a forensic psychologist could possess, that the truth hidden within these walls would be far more unsettling than any ghost story.
