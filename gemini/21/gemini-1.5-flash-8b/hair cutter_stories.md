The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" salon reflected the afternoon sun, glinting off the discarded combs and stray bobby pins scattered across the worn linoleum floor.  A faint scent of lavender and something faintly metallic – perhaps old copper – hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma to Amelia Hawthorne, but perhaps a little too cloying for some.  Amelia, her own auburn hair tied back in a neat bun, meticulously trimmed the ends of a particularly unruly mane.  The client, a young woman named Lily with eyes the colour of stormy seas, fidgeted nervously, her gaze flitting from the intricate patterns on the salon's wallpaper to the ever-present, slightly-too-loud jazz music emanating from a vintage record player tucked away in a corner.  Today, as always, Amelia was both a stylist and a silent confidante.  The salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling heart of Bloomsbury, was more than just a place to cut hair; it was a sanctuary, a space where whispers and secrets were often as important as the snips and shears.
