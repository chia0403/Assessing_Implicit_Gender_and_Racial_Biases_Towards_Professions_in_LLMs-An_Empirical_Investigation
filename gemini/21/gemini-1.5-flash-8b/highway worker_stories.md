The biting wind whipped dust devils across the cracked asphalt of the I-95 median, stinging Amelia Rodriguez's cheeks and swirling the loose gravel into a gritty haze.  The sun, a pale disc behind a bruised, grey sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate landscape.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, adjusted the worn leather strap of her tool bag, the weight a familiar comfort against her hip.

The old concrete median barrier had been disintegrating, a hazard she'd been tasked to repair.  The highway itself stretched like a ribbon of scars across the countryside, and the rhythmic thump of her jackhammer was a lonely sound against the endless expanse.
