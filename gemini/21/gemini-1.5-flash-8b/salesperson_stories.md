The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Guaranteed" retail outlet hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Blackwood's life.  She was a salesperson, a highly-trained, meticulously-choreographed cog in the vast, impersonal machine that was the store.  Rows upon rows of brightly-coloured, almost-too-perfect items stretched out before her, each one a potential sale, a potential commission.  Today, however, the fluorescent glow seemed to mock her.  The air, thick with the synthetic scent of "freshly-baked bread" and "ocean breeze," felt stifling.  The store, a testament to mass-produced efficiency, was a sprawling, sterile cavern, bathed in an unnatural uniformity.  Customers moved through the aisles like ghosts, their faces a blur of muted expressions, their purchases as predictable as the storeâ€™s meticulously-planned displays.  Elara, on the other hand, felt her spirit slowly draining, a battery running low in the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights.  It was a Tuesday, and the rain outside hammered against the enormous storefront windows, mirroring the drumming of the pressure cooker in her head.
