The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating the meticulously arranged instruments lining the stainless steel trays.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a smile that could disarm even the most stubborn molar, leaned into the patient's chair.  Across the polished expanse of the waiting room, a chipped porcelain doll sat on a small, dusty table, its painted eyes seeming to stare intently at the door.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis built on the forgotten foundations of ancient ruins, thrummed with an unseen energy.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and dust, carried the faint whiff of burnt sugar.  This wasn't just any dental practice; this was the Whispering Teeth Clinic, located in the heart of the city's forgotten quarter, a place where whispered stories of strange ailments and even stranger remedies clung to the air.
