The biting wind whipped through the narrow cobbled streets of Blackwood, stinging Elara Blackwood, Judge of the High Court, in her cheeks.  Rain, slick and persistent, plastered the worn tapestry of the alley walls to her cloak.  The scent of mildew and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the city's oppressive humidity and the unseen evils that festered beneath its grey facade.  Blackwood, named for the brooding colour of the sprawling city, was a place of shadows and whispers, where justice was a fragile bloom struggling to survive in the harsh climate of corruption.


Elara Blackwood, her sharp eyes already scanning the shadowed doorways, adjusted the heavy chain of her office keys around her slender waist.  The keys, more a symbol of authority than a practical tool, felt strangely light in her grasp, their usual cold steel dampened by the oppressive atmosphere.  She was on her way to the House of Whispers, a notorious tavern known for its dubious clientele and even more dubious dealings.  A case involving a stolen grimoire, a priceless artifact said to hold the secrets of ancient magic, had led her here.  The rumours, swirling like the rain-soaked fog, suggested the culprit might not be so easily discovered, or so easily deterred.  Tonight, Elara had to confront not just a thief, but the darkness that seemed to consume Blackwood from within.
