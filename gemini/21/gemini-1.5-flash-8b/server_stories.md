The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow where spilled coffee had long since dried, felt like a second skin to Amelia Blackwood.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of "The Rusty Mug," illuminating a half-eaten plate of greasy fries and a forgotten napkin.  The air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and something faintly floral â€“ likely a desperate attempt to mask the persistent smell of yesterday's fry oil. Amelia, her name barely a whisper on the already-loud din of the diner, sighed, tracing the faded script on the grease-stained menu with a finger.  It was another slow Tuesday.  Her uniform, a perpetually wrinkled beige polyester, seemed to absorb the monotony of the diner like a sponge.  The worn-out diner was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a town so perpetually grey it practically bled into the sky.  Across the street stood the imposing, but abandoned, Oakhaven National Bank, a silent testament to the town's fading prosperity.
