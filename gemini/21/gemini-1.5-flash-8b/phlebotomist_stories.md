The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a constant, low thrum, was the only sound that rivaled the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's own heartbeat.  Her gloved hands, usually precise and steady, trembled slightly as she held the vein-finder, its tiny light dancing erratically over the patient's pale arm.  Another missed vein. Another anxious sigh escaping her lips.

Amelia, 26 years old and a phlebotomist at the bustling Midtown Medical Centre, worked in a sterile, yet oddly claustrophobic, space.  Rows of identical beige examination rooms lined the corridor, their doors a muted grey, each one a miniature theatre of whispered anxieties and drawn breaths.  The air, thick with the antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of blood, clung to Amelia like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy city skyscrapers, barely pierced the gloom, casting long shadows that danced with the shadows of her own mounting stress.  Today, the patient, a gaunt woman with hollow cheeks and eyes that mirrored the endless grey sky outside, was particularly resistant.  The woman's name, a muffled whisper, was Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Amelia felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that this particular draw would be more than a simple blood test.
