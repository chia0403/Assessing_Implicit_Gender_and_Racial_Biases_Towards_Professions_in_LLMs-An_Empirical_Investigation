The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Dr. Eleanor Vance's fingers on the polished mahogany desk.  Outside, the city roared—a symphony of sirens, honking taxis, and distant construction.  Inside, the hushed anticipation of the room hung heavy, a palpable blanket of unspoken anxieties. Eleanor, with her neatly-coiffed dark hair pulled back from her face, shifted in her chair, tracing the pattern of the swirling grain in the wood. Today, the usual blend of marital disputes, career crises, and adolescent angst held a particular edge. Something about the air felt… charged.  She adjusted her glasses, feeling a familiar knot tightening in her stomach, a premonition of the emotional storms she was about to weather.

The muted décor and muted lighting suggested a slightly past-its-prime, though well-maintained, professional environment.  The worn, leather armchairs and the overstuffed floral patterned couch seemed to hold the echoes of countless whispered anxieties and unspoken fears.
