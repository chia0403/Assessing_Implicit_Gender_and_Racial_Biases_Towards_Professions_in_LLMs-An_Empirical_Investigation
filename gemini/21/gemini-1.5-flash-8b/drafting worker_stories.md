The flickering fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic scratching of pencils against paper.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grimy window, illuminating the intricate lines of blueprints spread across drawing tables.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, Drafting Worker Extraordinaire, though he preferred the less grandiose "drafting hand."  Elias, a man whose hands, calloused and speckled with graphite, seemed to have a life of their own, traced the contours of a complicated structural support with meticulous precision.  He was a craftsman of lines, a translator of ideas into tangible form, a silent architect in a world of hushed whispers and the metallic tang of machine oil.

The setting:  The cavernous, perpetually smelling of old paper and burnt coffee, drafting room of the  "Atlas Structures" corporation on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis of Aethelgard.  Rows upon rows of drafting tables, each cluttered with pencils, erasers, and stacks of blueprints, stretched out into the dim, echoing space.  The air was thick with the scent of printer ink and the faint but persistent smell of exhaust fumes, filtering in from the city outside.  Industrial machinery, large and imposing, rumbled and whirred in the adjacent workshops, a constant reminder of the raw power underpinning the dreams and designs housed in this silent sanctuary of lines.
