The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" grocery store hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of shopping carts and the low, almost imperceptible murmur of customers.  Amelia Rosewater, a cashier with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a perpetually tired smile, stared at the barcode scanner, a small, metallic insect humming in her hands.  Another Tuesday.  Another endless stream of shoppers, each with their own little dramas, their own anxieties neatly packaged in bags of groceries.

The store, a sprawling behemoth of beige and pale blue, smelled faintly of stale bread and disinfectant.  Rows upon rows of identical shelves stretched into the hazy distance, punctuated by the occasional vibrant splash of produce, a fleeting reminder of life's fleeting beauty.  A faint, almost imperceptible, smell of cinnamon wafted from a nearby bakery display, a tempting aroma in the face of the mundane.  Amelia, her uniform a dull grey, felt it all – the pressure of the fluorescent lights, the weight of the day, the unspoken hopes and fears tucked into the plastic bags. Today, though, something felt…different.  Perhaps it was the way the afternoon sun bled through the shop windows, casting long, dancing shadows across the aisles.  Perhaps it was the single, lonely sunflower seed tucked into her apron pocket. Perhaps, just perhaps, it was the stranger who entered the store moments ago, eyes fixed on a particular aisle.
