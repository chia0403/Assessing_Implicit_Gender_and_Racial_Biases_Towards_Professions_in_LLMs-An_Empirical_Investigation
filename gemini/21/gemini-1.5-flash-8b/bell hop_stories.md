The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of the Grand Plaza Hotel.  Rain, thick and persistent, hammered against the ornate copper roof, a relentless counterpoint to the hushed whispers carried on the breeze from the dimly lit shops lining the square.  Augustus "Gus" Featherstone, bell hop extraordinaire at the Grand Plaza, hunched deeper into his threadbare, midnight-blue uniform.  He adjusted the overflowing satchel slung across his shoulder, the weight of unclaimed luggage pressing down on him like the oppressive London night.  His breath puffed white in the frigid air, and the pungent scent of coal smoke, mingling with the aroma of damp earth and brewing coffee from the nearby market stalls, filled his nostrils.  He was, in essence, the embodiment of the Grand Plazaâ€™s quiet grandeur; a supporting cast member in a meticulously crafted, if somewhat weary, production.  The hotel, a monument to Victorian opulence, felt more like a cathedral of sighs than a haven of luxury this evening.  The vast lobby, usually bustling with the arrival and departure of esteemed guests, was eerily quiet.  Only the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the rain and the occasional shuffling of a nearby porter's feet broke the stillness.
