The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's cluttered shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering bulb above, swirled in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender shaving soap and aged mahogany.  Barty, a man whose face bore the marks of countless razored chins and whispered secrets, leaned over the next client, his calloused fingers deftly maneuvering the shears.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of horse-drawn carts and the muffled cries of vendors drifted in, a symphony of the bustling city of Veridian.  Veridian, a city of towering cobblestone buildings and narrow, winding alleys, where secrets whispered from one shadowed corner to another. This was Barty's sanctuary, a place where the murmurs of the street faded to quiet contemplation as the rumble of the city's engine gave way to the quiet hum of his shears.
