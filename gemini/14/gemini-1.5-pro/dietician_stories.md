The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts clinging to the frigid air.  Above her, the skeletal branches of the London plane trees lining the street clawed at the bruised twilight sky. Amy clutched her battered leather satchel tighter, its contents – a meticulously annotated food diary and a half-eaten apple – jostling against her ribs.  She was late, unforgivably late, for her appointment with Mr. Silas Blackwood, a notoriously difficult client who lived in a crumbling Georgian townhouse tucked away in the labyrinthine heart of Greenwich Village. The wrought-iron gate, shaped like a snarling Cerberus, loomed before her, its hinges groaning like a mournful ghost as she pushed it open. The small, enclosed courtyard beyond, choked with overgrown ivy and neglected rose bushes, felt oppressive, even in the fading light.  Amy shivered, not entirely from the cold, and adjusted the scarf around her neck.  This was her third visit to Mr. Blackwood, and each time the house had seemed to exude a greater air of melancholy and decay, mirroring, perhaps, the health of its reclusive inhabitant.
