The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the aging windows of the Rejuvenate Physical Therapy clinic and carrying the scent of wet leaves and woodsmoke. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne adjusted the thermostat, her breath puffing out in small white clouds.  The clinic, nestled in the sleepy, artsy town of Harbor Springs, Michigan, was quiet save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the faint hum of the ultrasound machine.  Amy, with her auburn braid draped over her shoulder and her hands tucked into the pockets of her fleece vest, surveyed the empty treatment tables with a mix of anticipation and a touch of melancholy. Tourist season was over, the summer bustle had faded, and the long, quiet winter stretched ahead.  This year, the quiet felt different. Heavier, somehow.
