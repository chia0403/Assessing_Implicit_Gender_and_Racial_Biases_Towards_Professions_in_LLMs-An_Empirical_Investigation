The stale, recycled air of the All-American Motor Inn hummed a monotonous C-sharp, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's existential dread.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the avocado-green shag carpet.  Outside, the wind whipped tumbleweeds across the desolate stretch of Arizona highway visible through the sliding glass doors of her room.  Amy, clutching a lukewarm Styrofoam cup of motel coffee, stared out at the bleak landscape.  Dust devils danced in the distance like restless spirits, mirroring the turmoil churning in her stomach.  This was her third motel in as many nights, a pit stop on her seemingly endless quest to sell industrial-grade cleaning solvents to the sparsely populated towns dotting Route 66.  This trip, unlike the brochure promising "wide open spaces and boundless opportunity," felt more like a slow descent into oblivion, each mile further solidifying her suspicion that she'd made a terrible career choice.
