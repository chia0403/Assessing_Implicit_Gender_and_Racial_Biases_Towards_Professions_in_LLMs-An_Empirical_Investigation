The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with a relentless monotony that mirrored the relentless monotony of Eleanor's days, filled with broken promises, half-truths, and the faint, lingering scent of desperation that seemed to permeate everything within a five-mile radius of the building.  She was waiting for Daniel "Danny" Kowalski,  a repeat offender with a rap sheet longer than Eleanor's arm and a charming smile that had gotten him into, and out of, more trouble than he cared to admit.  He was twenty minutes late.  Again.
