The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the site.  Grey, skeletal scaffolding clawed at the bruised London sky above the half-finished structure, silhouetted against the weak afternoon light.  Rain threatened, a misty haze already clinging to the air, blurring the jagged edges of Canary Wharf’s towering glass and steel across the Thames.  Below, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal punctuated the wind’s howl as construction workers, tiny figures from her vantage point on the tenth floor, welded the final supports for what would soon be the shimmering glass atrium of the new Tate Modern extension. Cassie shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter, the chill seeping through the seams of her worn leather boots. This was her baby, this behemoth of glass and steel rising from the former industrial docklands. Every curve, every angle, a testament to her vision. And yet, today, a gnawing unease overshadowed her usual sense of accomplishment.  Something felt wrong, disjointed, like a misplaced line in a meticulously drafted blueprint.
