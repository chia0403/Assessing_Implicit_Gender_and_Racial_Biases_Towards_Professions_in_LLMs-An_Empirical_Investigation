The biting wind whipped off the slate-grey expanse of Lake Superior, carrying the scent of pine and the distant thrum of an approaching freighter.  Sawdust dusted the worn corduroy jacket of Elias Thorne, clinging to the damp fabric like stubborn burrs. He squinted against the late November sun, a pale, watery disc struggling to penetrate the gathering clouds, its weak rays glinting off the frost-rimed nails clutched between his teeth. Elias’s breath plumed white in the frigid air as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the boathouse rising slowly against the backdrop of the rugged, snow-dusted shoreline of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.  The rhythmic clang of his hammer echoed across the stillness, a lonely counterpoint to the mournful cry of a lone gull circling overhead. This boathouse, commissioned by a reclusive artist who lived further down the windswept coast, was Elias’s last job of the season, and he was determined to finish it before the lake froze solid, locking the peninsula in its icy grip for the long winter ahead.
