The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Petrova's parka as she prepped her Cessna 185 Skywagon for takeoff.  The small plane, affectionately nicknamed "Borealis," was coated in a thin layer of frost that glittered under the weak, pre-dawn sun.  Around them, the vast expanse of Denali National Park stretched out like a crumpled white blanket, jagged peaks piercing the iron-grey sky.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the scent of pine and the distant, almost imperceptible, rumble of glaciers calving.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted her fur-lined hood and ran a gloved hand over the propeller. This was her life â€“ ferrying supplies and the occasional intrepid tourist to remote cabins and research stations scattered across the six-million-acre wilderness.  Today's mission, however, was different.  A distress call had crackled over the radio just before dawn, a faint, garbled message from a stranded climber high on the slopes of Mount Foraker.  And Amelia, the best bush pilot in the Interior, was the only one who dared to try a rescue in these treacherous conditions.
