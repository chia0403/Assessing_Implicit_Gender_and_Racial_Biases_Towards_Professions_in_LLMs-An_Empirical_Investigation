The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Black Bear Cliff.  Below her, the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic crashed against jagged rocks, the spray a constant, icy mist.  The lighthouse on Gull Island, a solitary white sentinel against the gathering storm, was her target. Mia, clad in a thick, weather-beaten parka and fingerless gloves, squinted through the viewfinder of her vintage Hasselblad, its weight reassuring in her hands.  The air smelled of salt and impending rain, and the only sound besides the relentless ocean was the distant, mournful cry of a gull.  This remote stretch of the Maine coastline, just past the sleepy town of Port Blossom, was a world away from the bustling New York galleries where she usually displayed her work. But Mia found solace in the raw, untamed beauty of these isolated places, her lens capturing the fleeting moments of light and shadow that revealed their hidden soul.  This lighthouse, battered but unyielding against the elements, was the perfect embodiment of that resilience, and she was determined to capture its essence before the full force of the storm broke.
