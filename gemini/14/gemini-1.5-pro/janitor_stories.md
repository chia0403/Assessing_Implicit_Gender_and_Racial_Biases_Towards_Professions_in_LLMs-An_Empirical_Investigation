The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Bioresearch Building hummed a lonely B flat, their pale glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floors. It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour for Elias Thorne, Head Janitor and, at this moment, sole occupant of the twelve-story structure. Outside, a November wind howled around the corners of the building, rattling the large glass panes that showcased Zenith's impressive atrium. Inside, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic swoosh of Elias' mop and the occasional drip from a leaky faucet in the third-floor women's restroom, a drip he'd been meaning to fix for weeks.  Zenith Bioresearch, specializing in cutting-edge pharmaceuticals and boasting state-of-the-art laboratories, was a sterile, gleaming monument to scientific advancement by day.  By night, it was Elias' domain, a silent kingdom of echoing hallways and empty labs, where he ruled supreme over dust bunnies and errant paperclips. Tonight, however, something felt different.  A low hum, distinct from the usual electrical thrum of the building, vibrated through the floor and up into the handle of Elias' mop.
