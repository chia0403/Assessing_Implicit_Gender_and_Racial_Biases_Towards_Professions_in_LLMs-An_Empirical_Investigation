The biting November wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, stinging Beatrice "Bea" Kettlewell's eyes as she wrestled the eighteen-wheeler, nicknamed "The Wanderer," through a patch of black ice. The sun, a pale ghost behind the bruised clouds, offered little warmth, and the thermometer on her dashboard hovered stubbornly just above zero.  Bea, bundled in layers of flannel and fleece, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white. The CB radio crackled with the static of long distances and the occasional bored drawl of another trucker miles away, a small comfort in the vast, unforgiving emptiness. The Wanderer, a battered Kenworth with a faded turquoise cab and a mural of a leaping stag on its trailer, rumbled and groaned, a faithful but aging companion on Bea's solitary journeys across America's heartland.  Tonight, her destination was Rock Springs, a small mining town clinging to the edge of the Red Desert, promising a warm cup of coffee and a few hours of sleep before the next haul. But the ice, the wind, and the unsettling quiet of the plains hinted at a journey that might not be as straightforward as planned.
