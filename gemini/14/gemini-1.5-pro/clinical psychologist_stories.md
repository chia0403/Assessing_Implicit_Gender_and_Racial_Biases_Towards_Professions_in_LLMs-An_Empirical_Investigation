The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance's ankles as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of the St. Jude’s Institute.  Gargoyles perched on the gothic building’s eaves leered down at her, their granite faces slick with rain. The sprawling complex, a former monastery nestled in the isolated Welsh valleys, now served as a private psychiatric hospital – a place of last resort for patients with particularly complex and often unsettling conditions.  Eleanor pulled her tweed jacket tighter, the damp chill seeping through to her bones despite the thick wool.  The iron-studded oak door groaned in protest as she pushed it open, the scent of antiseptic and beeswax candles instantly replacing the sharp, metallic tang of the rain. Inside, the flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the worn flagstone floor, illuminating the portraits of past benefactors – stern-faced men and women who seemed to follow her with their watchful gazes. Tonight, the air hung heavy with a peculiar stillness, a disquieting calm that always preceded a storm.
