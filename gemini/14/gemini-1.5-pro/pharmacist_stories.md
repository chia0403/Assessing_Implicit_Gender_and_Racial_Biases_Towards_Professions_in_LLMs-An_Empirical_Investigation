The relentless New Orleans humidity clung to Eleanor Josephine Dupres like a damp shroud, even inside the cool, dimly lit sanctuary of Dubois Pharmacy.  The scent of antiseptic battled with the lingering aroma of beignets from the cafe next door, a constant olfactory tug-of-war that mirrored the duality of the French Quarter itself â€“ a place of both shadowed alleys and sun-drenched courtyards, ancient secrets and boisterous revelry. Rain pattered against the arched windows, blurring the view of wrought-iron balconies overflowing with vibrant bougainvillea. Eleanor, perched on a high stool behind the antique mahogany counter, meticulously counted out capsules into a small amber vial, the only sound the rhythmic click of the plastic against glass and the gentle whir of the ceiling fan above.  The pharmacy, established by her great-grandfather in 1888, was a relic, a stubbornly persistent echo of a bygone era in a city that ceaselessly reinvented itself. It was a world of hand-written prescriptions, apothecary jars filled with mysterious powders, and whispered remedies passed down through generations.  And Eleanor, with her quiet demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of herbal tinctures and pharmaceutical compounds, was its steadfast guardian.  Little did she know that a single prescription, slipped across the counter just before closing time, would shatter the tranquil rhythm of her life and plunge her into the heart of a mystery as old as the city itself.
