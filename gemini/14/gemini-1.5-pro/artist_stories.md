The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Port Blossom. Below, the quaint Cornish fishing village huddled against the churning slate-grey sea, a kaleidoscope of brightly painted cottages clinging to the hillside like a handful of scattered jewels.  The wind, a restless artist itself, whipped Amy's auburn braid across her canvas, momentarily obscuring the half-finished watercolour landscape taking shape beneath her nimble fingers.  Late October in Cornwall meant a symphony of greys and blues, punctuated by the defiant ochre of the drying bracken and the occasional flash of crimson from a lone, wind-battered poppy. Amy shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around her, but refused to retreat to the warmth of her tiny rented cottage. The wild beauty of this place, the raw energy of the approaching storm, was something she needed to capture, to translate onto the textured paper before her, before it vanished like the fleeting sunlight struggling to break through the heavy clouds.
