The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he trudged across the frozen farmyard, his breath clouding the air.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised snow before nightfall.  Scattered across the Peterson farm, nestled in the folds of the rolling hills of County Donegal, Ireland, were huddled sheep, their thick wool barely providing enough insulation against the encroaching cold. Elias pulled his tweed cap lower over his ears and tucked his stethoscope more securely into his worn leather bag.  He'd received a frantic call from old Mrs. Peterson that morning.  Something was ailing her prize ewe, a pedigree Texel named Aoife, and Elias, the only vet for miles, had braved the worsening weather to see to it. The farm, a patchwork of stone walls and sagging barns, had been in the Peterson family for generations, and Elias had treated everything from lame donkeys to calving cows within its boundaries. Today, however, there was an unfamiliar tension in the air, a palpable unease that went beyond the usual anxieties of a sick animal.
