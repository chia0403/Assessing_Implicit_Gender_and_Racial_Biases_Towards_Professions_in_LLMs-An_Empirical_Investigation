Rain lashed against the bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Seattle. The rhythmic drumming against the glass was a stark counterpoint to the quiet sobs emanating from the worn leather armchair across from his mahogany desk.

His office, nestled in a historic building overlooking Puget Sound, usually offered a calming view of ferries crisscrossing the water and the Olympic Mountains rising in the distance. Today, however, the stormy grey canvas outside only mirrored the turbulent inner landscape of the woman sitting before him.  A half-empty box of tissues sat on the small table beside her, a testament to the weight she carried. The faint scent of saltwater and damp wool clung to the air, a reminder of the relentless Seattle rain that seemed to seep into everything.
