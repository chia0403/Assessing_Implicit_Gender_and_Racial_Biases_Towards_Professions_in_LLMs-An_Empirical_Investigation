The biting November wind whipped off the East River, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he hurried across the Roosevelt Island Tramway platform.  The city lights, a glittering constellation spread below, offered little warmth against the penetrating cold.  Above, the cables hummed a low, mournful song, a soundtrack to Elias’s exhaustion.  He’d been operating for twelve hours straight at Manhattan General, a marathon surgery to separate conjoined twins, a procedure so delicate, so fraught with peril, it had left him feeling hollowed out, a husk filled only with the echoing rhythm of his own racing heart.  Tonight, however, the usual solace of his quiet island apartment held little appeal. Tonight, Elias needed the anonymity of the city, the comforting rumble of the subway, the press of strangers, anything to drown out the whispering doubts that, despite the successful outcome, still clung to him like surgical gloves. He clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, the weight a small anchor in the swirling vortex of his thoughts, and stepped into the swaying tram car.  Roosevelt Island, usually a sanctuary, felt tonight like an isolated outpost, a world away from the vibrant, pulsing life he craved.
