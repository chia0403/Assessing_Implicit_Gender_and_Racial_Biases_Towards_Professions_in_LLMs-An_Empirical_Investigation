The rain, a slick, shimmering curtain, draped itself over the Art Deco facade of the Hotel Magnifique.  Neon signs from the Parisian boulevards reflected in the puddles gathering at the curb, painting the scene in vibrant, distorted hues. Inside, the lobby hummed with a low thrum of activity.  Bellhops whisked luggage across the polished marble floor, while a string quartet played a melancholic waltz near the grand staircase.  Behind the imposing mahogany concierge desk, amidst a flurry of requests for theatre tickets and dinner reservations, stood  Genevieve Dubois.  Her name tag, pinned to her impeccably tailored midnight blue uniform, glinted under the crystal chandelier. Genevieve, with her effortless elegance and encyclopedic knowledge of the city, was the linchpin of the Magnifique, a magician capable of conjuring anything a guest desired, from a last-minute private jet to a perfectly chilled bottle of vintage champagne. But tonight, a different kind of magic was about to arrive at her doorstep.
