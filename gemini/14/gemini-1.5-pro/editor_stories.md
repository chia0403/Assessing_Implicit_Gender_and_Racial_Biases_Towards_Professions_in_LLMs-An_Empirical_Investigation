Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his head.  Loose manuscripts, marked with his precise and unforgiving red ink, swirled across the worn wooden desk like autumn leaves caught in a gust. Elias, his full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, sat hunched beneath a flickering gas lamp, the harsh light illuminating the deep lines etched into his face. His office, nestled in the eaves of a crumbling Victorian mansion overlooking the perpetually fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine, was a chaotic sanctuary crammed with towering stacks of books, overflowing ashtrays, and the lingering scent of pipe tobacco and despair.  Outside, the year was 1923, a period of supposed prosperity and jazz-fueled revelry, but within the confines of Elias's self-imposed exile, the world felt as bleak and desolate as the November sky.  He was a man haunted by words, both his own and those of others, trapped in a cycle of literary dissection that offered little solace and even less hope.
