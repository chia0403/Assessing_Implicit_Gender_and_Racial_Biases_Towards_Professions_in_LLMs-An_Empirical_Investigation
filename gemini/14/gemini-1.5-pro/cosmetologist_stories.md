The flickering neon sign of "Seraphina's Styles" buzzed erratically, casting a lurid pink glow over the rain-slicked streets of Hollow Creek. Inside, amidst the chemical perfume of hairspray and the hum of dryers, Seraphina Bellweather sighed, wiping a stray strand of bleach-blonde hair from her cheek.  Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was a town choked by kudzu and secrets, a place where the only things that thrived were gossip and the relentless humidity. It was the kind of town most people left, but it was the only home Seraphina had ever known, and her salon, tucked between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed bakery, was her castle. Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was absent, replaced by an unsettling quiet broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large plate glass window. Seraphina glanced at the clock - 10:57 pm.  Just three minutes until closing, and not a soul in sight.  She had a feeling, deep down in her gut, that tonight, the quiet wouldn't last.
