The biting November wind howled through the eaves of Ashworth Manor, rattling the leaded panes of the windows that Elara Reyes meticulously polished each Tuesday.  A fine layer of frost dusted the manicured lawns that stretched down towards the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth of the grand hall, casting flickering shadows on the intricate tapestries depicting scenes of heroic battles and mythical beasts.  Elara, small but wiry beneath her starched uniform, hummed a melancholic tune as she worked, the scent of lemon oil mingling with the lingering aroma of Mrs. Ashworthâ€™s expensive perfume. The house, a sprawling gothic monstrosity perched on the cliffs overlooking the Yorkshire coast, was mostly empty these days.  The family were in London for the season, leaving Elara, the gardener, and the taciturn cook, Mrs. Hemlock, as the sole occupants of its echoing halls.  It was a lonely existence, but Elara preferred it that way.  There were secrets within these walls, whispered in the rustling of the silk drapes and the creaks of the ancient floorboards, and she found solace in their quiet company.
