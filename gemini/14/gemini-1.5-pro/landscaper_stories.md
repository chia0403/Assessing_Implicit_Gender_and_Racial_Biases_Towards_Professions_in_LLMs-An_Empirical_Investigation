The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Millie” Hawthorne’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson leaves swirling around her ankles.  The late November air in Oakhaven, Oregon hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a familiar perfume that Millie, despite the chill, found comforting.  She stood on the edge of the sprawling Blackwood estate, her worn leather work boots sinking slightly into the mud, surveying the scene.  The grand Victorian house, a gothic behemoth of gables and stained glass, loomed over her, its shadow stretching long across the neglected gardens.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, choked the rose bushes, and the once magnificent fountain stood dry and cracked, a forlorn centerpiece in a sea of overgrown weeds.  Millie had her work cut out for her. This wasn’t just a garden restoration; it was a resurrection. And she, Amelia Hawthorne, Landscaper Extraordinaire (as her faded business card proclaimed), was just the person to bring it back to life.
