The air in Mrs. Gable's basement hung thick and damp, smelling of mildew and something vaguely metallic.  Dust motes danced in the single bare bulb hanging precariously from a cracked rafter. Pipes, a tangled mess of copper and galvanized steel, snaked across the low ceiling like metallic vines.  Eleanor Vance, clad in her usual denim overalls and a faded "Vance Plumbing" t-shirt, surveyed the scene with a weary sigh. Her toolbox, a battered steel behemoth practically vibrating with the assortment of wrenches and pipe cutters within, lay at her feet.  This was the third flooded basement Eleanor had visited that day in the small, perpetually soggy town of Havenwood, Oregon, and the persistent drizzle outside promised more to come.
