The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, beer-tinged glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, a relentless percussion accompanying the melancholic drone of a bluesy harmonica solo spilling from the jukebox.  Behind the worn mahogany bar, Elias Thorne, his knuckles white against the brass tap, pulled a pint of stout with the practiced ease of a man who'd poured a thousand sorrows into a thousand glasses.  He slid the foamy brew towards a lone figure hunched in a booth, the brim of his fedora hiding his face in shadow. Port Blossom, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Pacific, was a place where dreams came to die, and Elias, the silent custodian of their demise, watched it happen every night.
