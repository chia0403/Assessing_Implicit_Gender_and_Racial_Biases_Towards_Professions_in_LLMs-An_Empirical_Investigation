The insistent California sun, still low in the sky, streamed through the rainbow-painted windows of Room Three, illuminating swirling glitter dust motes that danced like tiny fairies. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her curly brown hair pulled back in a messy bun secured with a bright yellow butterfly clip, surveyed her kingdom. Tiny chairs sat upside down on brightly patterned tables, awaiting their pint-sized occupants.  A giant papier-mâché caterpillar hung suspended from the ceiling, its segments adorned with the handprints of her previous class.  The walls, a cheerful buttercup yellow, displayed a riot of colorful artwork, testament to the boundless creativity of five-year-olds. Outside, in the small, enclosed playground of Sunnyside Elementary, the swings hung motionless, waiting for the joyful shrieks and squeals that would soon fill the air.  This was Amelia’s favorite time of day, the quiet before the storm, the moment of potential before the day unfolded, full of sticky fingers, spilled juice, and the wonderfully chaotic energy of kindergarten.
