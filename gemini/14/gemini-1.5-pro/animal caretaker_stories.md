The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Yorkshire Moors.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, clung low to the undulating landscape, obscuring the usually breathtaking view of heather and gorse.  Amy pulled her thick wool coat tighter, the scent of lanolin and damp earth filling her nostrils.  Her destination, nestled in a sheltered dip between two windswept hills, was Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary.  A collection of weathered stone buildings and sturdy enclosures, Oakhaven was Amy's domain, her responsibility, and her refuge. This morning, however, the refuge felt more like a fortress against the encroaching winter, and a sense of unease, sharper than the icy air, nipped at the edges of her awareness.
