The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ponderosa pines, carrying the scent of sawdust and snow.  The sky, a bruised purple, promised another early nightfall. Jasper "Jax" Holcomb, his breath clouding the frosty air, deactivated the chainsaw with a practiced flick of his wrist. The freshly felled giant, its fragrant heartwood exposed, lay across the frozen ground, a testament to Jax's strength and skill. Around him, the slopes of Mount Trumbull, draped in a thinning blanket of pine needles and early snow, rose towards the darkening sky.  The logging camp, a cluster of rough-hewn cabins and equipment sheds nestled in a sheltered hollow below, was already twinkling with the warm glow of kerosene lamps.  It was a harsh, isolated life, but it was Jax's, and he wouldn't have traded it for anything â€“ at least, that's what he told himself as the first fat snowflakes began to fall.
