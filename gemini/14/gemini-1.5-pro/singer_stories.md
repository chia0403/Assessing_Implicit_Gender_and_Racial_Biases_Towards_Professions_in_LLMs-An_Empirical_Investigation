The chipped porcelain sink, cold against Elara Nightingale's cheek, offered little comfort.  The air in the cramped dressing room, thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap hairspray and stale cigarette smoke, mirrored the knot in her stomach. Outside, the raucous laughter and clinking glasses of The Rusty Microphone, a dive bar nestled in the forgotten corner of New Orleans' French Quarter, hinted at the indifferent crowd she was about to face.  Elara traced the faded gold lettering on her battered guitar case – "Elara Nightingale: Songbird of the South" – a title that felt increasingly ironic with each passing gig.  Tonight, the only bird singing seemed to be the rusty hinge on the dressing room door, groaning in protest as it swung open to reveal the bar's surly owner, a man whose face resembled a crumpled napkin.
