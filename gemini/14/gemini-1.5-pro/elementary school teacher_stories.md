The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Pearl Holloway as she struggled to unlock the heavy oak door of Maplewood Elementary.  Frost glittered on the browning grass of the playground, and the skeletal branches of the ancient maple tree at the edge of the field clawed at the grey, pre-dawn sky.  Nestled in the heart of the sleepy Vermont town of Harmony Creek, Maplewood was a small, two-story brick building that smelled perpetually of chalk dust, peanut butter sandwiches, and the faint, sweet tang of hand sanitizer. This morning, however, the familiar scent was overwhelmed by the sharp, metallic smell of snow, promising a blizzard before the school day was through.  Amelia shivered, pulling her bright red wool coat tighter around her, and finally managed to wrestle the stubborn lock into submission.  As she stepped inside, the dim hallway swallowed the sound of the wind, leaving only the hushed echo of her own footsteps and the nervous flutter in her stomach. This wasn't just any Monday. Today was the day the new student arrived.
