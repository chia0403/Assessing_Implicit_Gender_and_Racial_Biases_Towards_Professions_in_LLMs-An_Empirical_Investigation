The rusty nail, slick with morning dew, slipped between Calloused fingers. Elias Thorne, his full name a formality rarely uttered on a rooftop, grunted and adjusted his grip. Below him, the town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, was slowly waking. Wisps of smoke curled from chimneys, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and frying bacon. But Elias smelled only tar and the faint, metallic tang of blood. He was perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the Harmony Creek Baptist Church, a hulking edifice that had watched over the town for more than a century.  The slate tiles, worn smooth by time and weather, offered little purchase, and the wind, a playful but insistent hand, tugged at his worn canvas jacket.  It was a Tuesday, and normally Tuesdays were quiet in Harmony Creek.  Today, however, held a different kind of stillness, a tense, expectant silence that prickled the hairs on Elias's neck.  He'd felt it the moment he'd climbed out of his truck that morning â€“ a feeling like the world was holding its breath, waiting for something to break.
