The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, but fiercely ambitious bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais district of Paris.  Rain lashed against the tall windows, obscuring the view of the usually bustling rue de Thorigny.  Inside, the only light came from a single lamp hanging above the stainless steel prep table where  Chef Antoine Moreau, his apron stained with the ghosts of a thousand sauces, ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, a deep frown etched on his face.  He wasn't worried about the storm. He was worried about the soufflé.  Or, more accurately, the distinct lack of rise in the goddamn soufflé.  Tonight was the night Jean-Luc Montaigne, the most feared food critic in France, was due to dine at Le Papillon Bleu, and Antoine had staked everything on a flawless meal. A deflated soufflé was not part of the plan.
