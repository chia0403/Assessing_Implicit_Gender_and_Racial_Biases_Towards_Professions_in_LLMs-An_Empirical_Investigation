The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of Widow's Peak, the highest point overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon.  Below her, nestled amongst the Douglas firs and shrouded in pre-dawn gloom, a faint orange glow pulsed like a malignant heartbeat. Smoke, thick and acrid, clawed its way up the steep, rocky incline, stinging her eyes and coating the back of her throat with soot.  Havenwood's volunteer fire department, all six of them including Mia, had been battling the blaze at the abandoned sawmill for nearly three hours, and it showed no sign of yielding. The old building, a skeletal monument to Havenwood's bygone lumber industry, was proving a stubborn adversary, its dry, aged timbers kindling like tinder. The rhythmic whoosh of the wind through the trees sounded almost mournful, a lament for the town's history, and perhaps, its future.  This wasn't just a fire; it felt like something more.  Somethingâ€¦ malevolent.
