The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and rustling the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots as he trudged up the long, winding path to Athelney House, a sprawling gothic mansion perched on a hill overlooking the bleak Yorkshire moors. Athelney, with its gargoyles leering from every cornice and its ivy clinging like grasping claws, had seen better days.  The stone was weathered and stained, the windows mostly dark, and a general air of melancholy hung about the place like a shroud.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, was one of the few souls who still breathed life into the estate, tending to its sprawling gardens and struggling to maintain some semblance of its former glory. This morning, however, the usual crispness of the air held a different edge, a tension Elias couldn't quite place. It felt as if the very stones of Athelney were holding their breath, waiting for something to happen.
