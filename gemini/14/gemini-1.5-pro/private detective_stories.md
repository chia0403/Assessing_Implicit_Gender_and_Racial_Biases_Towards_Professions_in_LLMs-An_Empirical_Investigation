Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Neon light from a flickering "Loans & Liquor" sign across the street painted the room in sickly green hues, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the stale air. Elias Vance Thorne, Private Investigator, sat hunched over his battered oak desk, the cheap whiskey in his glass trembling slightly along with his hand.  His office, tucked away on the third floor of a crumbling building on Bleaker Street, a few blocks from the clamor of Times Square, wasn't exactly bustling.  The year was 1948, a city still recovering from the war, and business had been slower than a three-legged dog in a greyhound race.  The only sound besides the rhythmic drumming of the rain was the insistent ticking of a vintage clock on the wall, each tick a stark reminder of the unpaid bills piling up faster than the cigarette butts in the overflowing ashtray beside him.  The ringing telephone sliced through the silence like a rusty knife, jarring him from his grim reverie.
