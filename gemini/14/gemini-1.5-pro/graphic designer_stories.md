The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of fiery red hair across her chapped lips. She tugged her oversized scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chin, and hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts and stale cigarette smoke swirling around her.

Tonight, however, the usual buzz was amplified.  A low hum of excited chatter emanated from the back, interspersed with the clinking of glasses and the rhythmic thump of what sounded suspiciously like a bongo drum.  Something unusual was brewing, even for The Inkwell.
