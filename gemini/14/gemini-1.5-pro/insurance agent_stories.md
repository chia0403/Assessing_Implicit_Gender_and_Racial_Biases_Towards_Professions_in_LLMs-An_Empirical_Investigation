The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Dew Drop Inn, mimicking the persistent throbbing in Beatrice "Bea" Adelaide Finch's temples. The neon sign outside, advertising "Rooms & Cold Beer," flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Bea, a claims adjuster for the Reliable Life Assurance Company, sighed, the humid Florida air clinging to her like a damp shroud.  Her sensible beige pumps sank slightly into the gravel parking lot, and she clutched her briefcase tighter, wishing for the hundredth time that Mrs. Henderson had picked a more convenient time to die. Not that there was ever a *convenient* time for such a thing, of course, but a Tuesday afternoon in the middle of a tropical storm in the backwoods of Florida seemed particularly inconsiderate.  The Dew Drop Inn was supposedly the last place Mrs. Henderson had been seen alive, and Bea, ever the diligent investigator, needed to speak with the proprietor.  Lightning cracked overhead, illuminating the ramshackle building and the lone, rusty pickup truck parked outside.  Bea took a deep breath, the air thick with the smell of ozone and stale beer, and pushed open the heavy wooden door, a single, jangling bell announcing her arrival.
