The rusty scissors, cool and familiar in Elias Thorne's hand, snicked rhythmically against the comb. Outside, the neon glow of "Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour" reflected in the rain-slicked streets of Aethelburg, a city built more on secrets than foundations. Aethelburg wasn't a place you found on maps, not anymore. Tucked between dimensions, it existed in the shimmering space between Here and Almost-There, a haven for the peculiar, the forgotten, and those with something to hide. The air hummed with a low, ethereal thrum, a constant reminder of Aethelburg's precarious position in reality.  Elias, with his sharp cheekbones, perpetually tired eyes, and a neat, dark beard he trimmed himself with religious precision, had seen more strange heads of hair walk through his door than most barbers saw in a lifetime. Tonight, however, promised to be different.  A bell tinkled above the door, announcing a new arrival, and the air in the small barbershop crackled with an unfamiliar energy.
