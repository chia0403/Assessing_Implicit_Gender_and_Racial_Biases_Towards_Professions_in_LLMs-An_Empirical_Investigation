Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's office, mimicking the frantic drumming of her fingers against the mahogany desk.  The ornate clock on the wall, a relic from the firmâ€™s founding in 1887, chimed six times, a mournful clang in the otherwise silent space.  Amelia Thorne, CPA, straightened the stack of invoices before her with a sigh, the faint scent of lavender hand lotion clinging to the yellowed paper.  Outside, the gas lamps of Gaslight Square flickered and danced in the downpour, casting long, distorted shadows across the cobblestone streets of Victorian London.  The fog, thick and clinging like a damp shroud, obscured the normally bustling scene, leaving only the muffled clip-clop of a distant hansom cab and the rhythmic rush of water cascading from overflowing gutters.  This night, however, held a different sort of unease for Amelia. It wasn't the weather, nor the usual pressures of balancing the books for Thornton & Sons Trading Company. Something was amiss, a discrepancy she couldn't quite place, a missing sum whispering of secrets hidden within the ledger.
