The wind, sharp and laced with the scent of pine, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick woolen cloak as he surveyed the granite face of Widow's Peak.  The setting sun bled crimson across the jagged, snow-dusted summit, painting the valley below in hues of violet and deep grey. Nestled in that valley, barely visible through the gathering dusk, lay the village of Oakhaven, its flickering lamplight a fragile constellation against the encroaching darkness. Elias, his calloused hands resting on the head of his worn hammer, felt the familiar thrill of anticipation mixed with a healthy dose of respect.  This particular granite face, notorious for its unpredictable fissures and the tragic accident that had earned it its name, was his next commission - a grand angel for the newly built church spire.  The stone, cold and unforgiving beneath his gloved fingertips, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and devastating ruin, and Elias, as he always did, approached it with the reverence of a supplicant.
