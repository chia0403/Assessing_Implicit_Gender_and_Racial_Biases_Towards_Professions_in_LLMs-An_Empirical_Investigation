The bell above the door of "Nailed It," jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large picture window.  Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, her name tag pinned jauntily to her fuchsia apron, glanced up from the intricate floral design she was painting on Mrs. Henderson's acrylics. Outside, the neon signs of the other businesses lining Magnolia Street blurred into colourful streaks through the downpour.  Magnolia Street, a once-thriving artery of the small town of Oakhaven, was now a patchwork of quirky independent stores clinging on for dear life against the onslaught of the new mega-mall on the outskirts.  The scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, mingled with the sweet perfume of the hibiscus Esme had placed on the counter that morning, a tiny splash of tropical defiance against the November gloom.  Mrs. Henderson sighed contentedly. "Just like a little piece of summer, Esme," she murmured, admiring her nails. But Esme, her smile a practised reflex, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. Something was about to change on Magnolia Street. She could feel it in the air, thick and heavy like the coming storm.
