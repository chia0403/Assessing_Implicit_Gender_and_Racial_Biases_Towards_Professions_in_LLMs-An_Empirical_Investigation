The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. His brown leather satchel, heavy with the tools of his trade, bumped against his hip with each stride.  The gaslights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and contorted like the spines he realigned daily. Elias pulled his scarf tighter around his neck, the chill seeping into his bones despite the thick wool of his overcoat.  His destination, a grand but slightly dilapidated townhouse on Prince Street, belonged to Mrs. Agatha Grimshaw, a woman whose wealth was surpassed only by her collection of mysterious ailments. Tonight's complaint, as relayed by her frantic maid via a breathless phone call, was a "crick in her neck that sounded like a rusty gate." Elias braced himself. Mrs. Grimshaw's diagnoses were often as eccentric as her personality.  The wrought-iron gate creaked open as he reached the steps, revealing a dimly lit foyer and the scent of lavender and something elseâ€¦something faintly metallic.
