The late afternoon sun, filtered through the sheer linen curtains, cast long, elegant shadows across Amelia Thorne’s studio.  Located in a converted carriage house tucked behind a row of Victorian brownstones in Boston’s Back Bay, the space hummed with creative energy. Swatches of silk and velvet were draped artfully over a worn leather Chesterfield sofa, rolls of wallpaper lined the walls like ancient scrolls, and a colossal mood board, bursting with paint chips, fabric samples, and magazine tear-outs, dominated one entire wall.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, perched precariously on a rolling stool, a pencil clutched between her teeth as she surveyed her latest masterpiece-in-progress: a miniature replica of a grand ballroom, painstakingly crafted to scale.  The scent of bergamot and sandalwood, emanating from a nearby diffuser, mingled with the faint aroma of coffee, a testament to the numerous all-nighters Amelia had pulled in recent weeks.  This wasn't just any commission; this was the project that could catapult Amelia Thorne Designs from a well-respected local firm to a name whispered in the hallowed halls of interior design royalty.
