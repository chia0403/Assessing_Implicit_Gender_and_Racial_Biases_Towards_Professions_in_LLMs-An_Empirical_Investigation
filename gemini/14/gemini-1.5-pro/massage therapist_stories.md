The Himalayan salt lamps cast a warm, apricot glow across Serenity Now Massage Therapy, painting the exposed brick walls in a soothing hue.  Rain lashed against the large storefront window, blurring the neon OPEN sign into a hazy streak of pink. Inside, Eliza Jane Cartwright, her fingers still tingling from the last client's knotted shoulders, sighed and wiped down the massage table with a lavender-scented antiseptic. The scent mingled with the earthy aroma of the diffuser's patchouli and sandalwood blend, creating a fragrant haven against the November chill that seeped in through the ill-fitting door. Eliza glanced at the clock: 9:52 pm.  Two minutes shy of her last appointment, and still no sign of Mr. Henderson, the new client who'd booked a deep tissue massage for a mysteriously vague "sports injury."  Eliza hoped he wouldn't be a no-show.  Rent in Portland was exorbitant, and she needed every client she could get, especially with the holidays looming.
