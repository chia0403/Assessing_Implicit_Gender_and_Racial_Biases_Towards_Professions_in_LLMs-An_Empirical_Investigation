The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kingston Drafting & Design office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life for the past seven years.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and blueprint ink, clung to everything â€“ her clothes, her hair, even her thoughts.  Outside, the late-August sun beat down on the asphalt of downtown Philadelphia, baking the city into a shimmering mirage.  But inside, within the sterile white walls of Kingston Drafting, it was perpetually a cool, dimly lit twilight. Amelia, perched on her stool, meticulously traced the lines of a proposed apartment complex, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic scratch of her drafting pencil was the only sound that dared to compete with the incessant hum, a quiet rebellion in the otherwise stagnant air.  The floor beneath her feet vibrated slightly from the passing El train, a constant reminder of the life teeming just beyond the confines of her small, ordered world.  This Thursday, however, felt different.  A low thrum of anticipation, almost electric, pulsed in the air, and Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on why.
