The wail of the siren sliced through the thick, humid Charleston night, its two-toned scream echoing off the pastel-painted townhouses lining Queen Street.  Rain hammered against the windshield of Medic 1, blurring the already distorted glow of neon signs advertising everything from voodoo readings to shrimp and grits.  Inside the ambulance, Amelia “Amy” Grace Hawthorne, EMT-P, braced herself against the dashboard as her partner, Luis Sanchez, wrestled the rig around a horse-drawn carriage full of giggling tourists.  The scent of salt air mingled with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant wipes and the coppery ghost of someone else's blood, a familiar perfume Amy wore every shift.  Tonight's call:  unknown medical emergency at the Battery, right at the edge of where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers meet to form the Charleston Harbor.  Amy adjusted the strap of her oxygen tank, the rhythmic hiss of the regulator a counterpoint to the drumming rain and Luis's colorful commentary on Charleston drivers.  A feeling of unease settled in her stomach, a knot tightening with each flash of lightning illuminating the stormy sky. This wasn't going to be a simple twisted ankle.  She could feel it.
