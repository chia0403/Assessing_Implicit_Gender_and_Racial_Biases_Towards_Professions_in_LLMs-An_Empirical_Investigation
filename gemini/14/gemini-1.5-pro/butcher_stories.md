The biting wind whipped around Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Harding as he hoisted a side of pork onto the heavy oak block in his shop. Frost rimed the windowpanes of Harding's Fine Meats, obscuring the view of the bleak, grey December sky that pressed down on the small town of Oakhaven. The shop, nestled between a perpetually dusty antique store and Mrs. Peabody's relentlessly cheerful bakery, usually held the warm, savory scent of curing meats. Today, however, the air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and something else… something Fitz couldn’t quite place, something unsettling that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. He glanced at the ornate grandfather clock ticking in the corner.  5:57 am. Three minutes before opening. Three minutes before Oakhaven, a town that valued routine above all else, would begin its predictable daily waltz. Three minutes before everything changed.
