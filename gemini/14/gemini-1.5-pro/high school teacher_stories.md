The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of Ashwood High.  Elias, still rubbing the sleep from his eyes, surveyed the battlefield of desks and chairs. Papers lay scattered like fallen leaves after a storm, testament to yesterday's frenzied debate on the symbolism of fire in *Fahrenheit 451*.  Outside, the October sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the sunrise struggling to break through the heavy Indiana clouds.  Ashwood, a small town nestled amongst endless cornfields, was just beginning to stir.  The faint rumble of a tractor in the distance underscored the rural rhythm of life, a rhythm Elias, a city boy at heart, was still trying to acclimate to after five years.  He inhaled the scent of chalk dust and old textbooks, a smell he'd come to associate not with stuffiness, but with the promise of a new day, a new discussion, a new chance to ignite the spark of learning in his students. Today, however, that familiar scent held a faint undercurrent of something else â€“ something unsettling, like the metallic tang of ozone before a storm.
