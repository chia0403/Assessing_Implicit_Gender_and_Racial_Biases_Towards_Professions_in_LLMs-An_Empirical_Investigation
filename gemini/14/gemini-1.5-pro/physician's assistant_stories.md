The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, carrying the scent of pine needles and impending snow as Eleanor Vance hurried across the cobblestone walkway connecting the clinic to St. Ignatius Hospital.  Her breath plumed out in frosty puffs, clinging to the collar of her forest green parka. The iron gate creaked its protest as she pushed through, the sound swallowed by the wind's mournful howl.  Duluth, Minnesota, in late November was a brutal mistress, beautiful but unforgiving.  Eleanor, a Physician Assistant at the small, understaffed hospital, was already bracing herself for a long shift, hopefully not punctuated by the all-too-common influx of hypothermia cases and fractured bones from slips on the icy sidewalks. The flickering gaslights illuminating the hospital's facade cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her weariness.  Inside, the warmth promised little respite. Eleanor knew the waiting room would be overflowing with patients, each with their own burden of illness and worry, and she was the first line of defense against the encroaching winter and all its associated maladies.
