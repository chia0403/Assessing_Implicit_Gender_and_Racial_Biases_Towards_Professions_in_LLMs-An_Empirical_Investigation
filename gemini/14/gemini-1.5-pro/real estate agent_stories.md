Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s sleek, silver Mercedes, blurring the already fading twilight into a watercolour wash of greys and blues. The rhythmic swish of the wipers kept time with the anxious flutter in her stomach.  Perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling asphalt driveway, the car pointed towards a dilapidated Victorian mansion silhouetted against the stormy sky.  Blackthorns, thick with glistening droplets, clawed at the wrought iron gates, partially obscuring the peeling paint of the "For Sale" sign Amy had hammered into the sodden ground earlier that day. Ravenswood Manor, as it was grandly – and somewhat ironically – named, stood on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic just outside the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine.  It had been on the market for two years, stubbornly resisting every attempt Amy had made to find a buyer. Tonight, however, she had a serious prospect, someone who, she prayed, wouldn't be deterred by the ominous weather or the house’s rather… unsettling reputation.
