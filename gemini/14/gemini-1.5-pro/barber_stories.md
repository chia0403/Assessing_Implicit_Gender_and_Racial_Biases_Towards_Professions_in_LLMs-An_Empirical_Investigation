The rusty squeak of the screen door announced another sweltering afternoon in Harmony Creek, Alabama. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through Elias Walker's barbershop, illuminating the faded portrait of a pompadoured Elvis Presley hanging precariously above a chipped porcelain sink. Elias himself, a man built like an oak barrel with hands as weathered as the leather strop he used, was meticulously trimming the sideburns of old Mr. Abernathy, a man whose gossip moved faster than the ceiling fan whirring lazily above. Outside, cicadas droned a relentless chorus against the backdrop of the slow, steady chug of a distant train. Harmony Creek, a town forgotten by time and bypassed by progress, held its breath in the humid stillness, waiting, as it always did, for something to happen.
