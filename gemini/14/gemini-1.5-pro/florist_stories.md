The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two-note tune as the November wind gusted in, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from arranging a morning delivery of hyacinths, shivered and pulled her moss-green cardigan tighter around her.  Petal & Stem, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat on Sycamore Street in the quaint, slightly forgotten town of Oakhaven, was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary.  Here, amongst the buckets of vibrant blooms and the earthy scent of potting soil, she felt a sense of peace she found nowhere else.  Outside, the grey skies promised rain, and the first flakes of the season began to tentatively drift down, dusting the cobblestone street with a premature whisper of winter.
