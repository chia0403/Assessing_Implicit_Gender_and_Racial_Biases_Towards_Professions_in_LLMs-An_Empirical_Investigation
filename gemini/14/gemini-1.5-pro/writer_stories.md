The salt spray stung Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her balcony, the rusty metal cold beneath her fingertips.  The lighthouse, her solitary refuge and unwilling muse, moaned low in the rising wind.

October had painted the distant mainland in hues of fiery orange and deep crimson, a stark contrast to the steely grey of the sea that mirrored Amelia’s current mood.  Her writer's block, once a fleeting annoyance, had solidified into an impenetrable wall, as formidable as the granite cliffs below.  Three months she’d been here, ostensibly to finish her novel, and all she had to show for it were a handful of crumpled pages and a growing sense of despair.  The isolation, once a welcome escape, had become a prison of her own making.  The only sound, besides the wind and the mournful cry of the gulls, was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of a single, persistent woodpecker against the lighthouse’s thick, whitewashed walls.  It was a relentless, maddening sound, echoing the frantic beat of her own frustrated heart.
