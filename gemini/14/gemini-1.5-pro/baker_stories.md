The aroma of burnt sugar and woodsmoke hung heavy in the crisp autumn air, a scent Amelia Thistlewick usually found comforting.  Today, however, it only amplified the knot in her stomach.  Her bakery, "Thistlewick Treats," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually optimistic florist on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, was usually a haven of warmth and the sweet scent of cinnamon rolls. This morning, though, the normally bustling kitchen was eerily silent, the only sound the crackling of the dying embers in the hearth. Amelia, her flour-dusted apron askew and her usually vibrant green eyes shadowed with worry, stared at the blackened oven door, her heart sinking with each tick of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Oakhaven's annual Apple Harvest Festival was tomorrow, and her prize-winning apple pie, the centerpiece of her display, was currently residing within that charred metal tomb.
