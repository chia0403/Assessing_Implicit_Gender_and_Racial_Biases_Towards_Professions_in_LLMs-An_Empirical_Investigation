The rusted hinges of O’Malley’s Auto Repair shrieked in protest as Elias Vance Kettering wrestled the door open, the sound swallowed by the pre-dawn stillness of the Mojave Desert.  A thin layer of dust, the fine, red sand that plagued everything in this forgotten corner of California, coated the concrete floor of the garage. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows of the dormant engines and tool chests scattered around the space. Outside, the first hint of sunrise painted the jagged peaks of the Granite Mountains a fiery orange, but inside, the chill of the desert night still clung to the air.  Elias, his hands stained with grease and his brown hair sticking up in unruly tufts, surveyed his domain with a sigh. Another day, another dollar – or hopefully, enough dollars to keep the wolves of debt at bay and the electricity running in this dusty sanctuary.
