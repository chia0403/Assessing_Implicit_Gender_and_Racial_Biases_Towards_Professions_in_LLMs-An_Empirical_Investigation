The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, slicing through Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's worn leather jacket as she stood on the edge of Navy Pier.  The Ferris wheel, a skeletal giant against the bruised purple sky, creaked rhythmically, a mournful counterpoint to the screams of delighted tourists. Below, the lights of Chicago glittered like a scattered handful of diamonds, beautiful and cold. Izzy pulled her collar higher, the damp chill seeping into her bones. It was the kind of November night that made her miss Puerto Rico, the warmth of her grandmother's kitchen, the scent of caf√© con leche and cinnamon. But Chicago was her city now, her beat, her responsibility.  And tonight, the city had a problem.  A body had been found washed up against the pilings, just beyond the reach of the pier lights, and it looked like more than just a tragic accident.
