The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, Virginia, a town so small its only claim to fame was its disproportionately large library. Within those brick walls, amidst the hushed reverence for the written word, resided Miss Elara Thistlewick, the town librarian. Elara, a woman whose spirit bloomed as vibrantly as the wildflowers she pressed between the pages of forgotten novels, felt a distinct prickle on the back of her neck as the library doors creaked open, admitting not the usual trickle of afternoon patrons, but a gust of wind and a single, raven-black feather.  The feather twirled lazily to the floor, landing near a shadowed alcove filled with dusty tomes on local folklore and forgotten histories â€“ a section Elara rarely ventured into, preferring the comforting predictability of the Dewey Decimal System.  The bell above the door jingled a discordant tune, and a chill deeper than the November air settled in the silent room.
