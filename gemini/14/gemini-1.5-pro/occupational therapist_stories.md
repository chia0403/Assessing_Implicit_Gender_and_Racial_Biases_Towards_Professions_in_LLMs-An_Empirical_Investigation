The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the community centre, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the thrum of anxiety in Elara Reyes's chest.  The air inside, thick with the scent of damp wool and instant coffee, did little to soothe her nerves. Grey light filtered through the grimy windows, painting the peeling paint of the walls in a depressing monochrome.  Elara, clutching a worn leather satchel overflowing with assessment tools and brightly coloured therapy putty, surveyed the room.  Folding chairs scraped against the linoleum floor as the last few members of the Silver Linings Senior Group shuffled in, their faces a mixture of apprehension and forced cheer. This was Elara's first solo community outreach project since graduating, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on her like the oppressive Herefordshire sky.  Her mission: to assess the group's fine motor skills and develop a program to help them maintain their independence. But Elara suspected that beneath the surface of bingo nights and sing-alongs, a deeper current of loneliness and fear ran through this community, and she wasn't sure a handful of stress balls and some dexterity exercises would be enough to stem the tide.
