The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand crystal chandeliers.  A cacophony of hushed conversations, the clinking of champagne flutes, and the rhythmic swish of silk gowns filled the air, punctuated by the occasional trill of laughter.  Thick carpets, the colour of a summer sky just after dawn, swallowed the sound of footsteps.  Ornate columns, carved with mythical beasts and swirling floral patterns, stretched towards the impossibly high ceiling, painted with a fresco depicting the Roman god Mercury, his winged sandals glinting in the artificial light.  In this whirlwind of wealth and whispered secrets, Silas Finch, a bellhop of slight build and even slighter means, navigated the gilded maze with the practiced ease of a seasoned courtier, a small, worn leather-bound book tucked discreetly into his breast pocket.  He wasn't watching the glittering guests, though. His gaze was fixed on something far more intriguing: a small, unassuming wooden box being carried by a man with eyes as cold and grey as a winter storm.
