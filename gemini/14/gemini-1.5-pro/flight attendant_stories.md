The stale recirculated air hung heavy, thick with the scent of lukewarm coffee and someone's overly enthusiastic application of duty-free perfume.  Alexandra "Alex" Moreau smoothed down the crisp navy of her uniform jacket, her reflection staring back from the polished galley counter – a woman perpetually poised, even when battling a low-grade headache and the gnawing suspicion that she'd left her electric toothbrush charging in her apartment in Rome. Outside, the Lisbon airport glittered under a bruised, pre-dawn sky. Flight 417 to New York JFK was delayed, again, due to a "minor technical issue," which Alex, in her five years of flying, had learned could mean anything from a faulty coffee maker to a potential engine malfunction.  The passengers, a motley collection of businessmen in crumpled suits, chattering families, and bleary-eyed tourists, were growing increasingly restless in the cramped waiting area of gate 27A.  Alex plastered on her best reassuring smile – the one that promised smooth skies and on-time arrival – and prepared to deliver yet another vague update.  Little did she know that this delay, and the subsequent flight, would be anything but ordinary.
