Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of Neo-Kyoto's Shinjuku district. The 27th floor offered a spectacular, if somewhat melancholic, view of the city's sprawling cyber-punk landscape.  Inside, the only light came from the flickering holographic displays surrounding Elias, each showcasing lines of code cascading down like digital waterfalls.  Empty ramen containers littered his workstation, a testament to the 72-hour coding marathon he was currently submerged in. Elias, clad in a worn-out coding hoodie and three-day stubble, ran a hand through his tangled dark hair, his eyes bloodshot but focused. The air hummed with the low thrum of his custom-built server rack, the heart of his latest project â€“ a revolutionary decentralized operating system he believed could reshape the digital landscape.  Tonight was the night he planned to finally upload the genesis block. Tonight was the night everything changed.
