Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Hayes-Thorne's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of Manhattan.  The Chrysler Building, usually a beacon of Art Deco elegance, was now a shimmering ghost swallowed by the storm.  Inside, the only sound competing with the drumming rain was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's manicured nails against the polished mahogany of her desk.  Scattered across its surface were the remnants of a deal gone sour â€“ preliminary sketches of a proposed luxury resort in the Maldives, now waterlogged and ironically mirroring their fate. Amelia, the newly appointed Chief Operating Officer of LuxWorld Resorts, had staked a considerable amount of her reputation on this project, and its failure felt like a cold fist clenching around her ambition.  The air in the office, usually crisp and scented with expensive lilies, was thick with the metallic tang of stress and the lingering aroma of burnt coffee.  The digital clock on her computer flashed 6:57 pm, mocking her with the promise of a weekend that would now be consumed by damage control.
