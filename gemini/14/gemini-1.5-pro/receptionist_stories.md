The relentless clack-clack-clack of Amelia Grace Holloway's acrylic nails against the worn keys of the ancient computer echoed through the otherwise silent reception area.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the grimy windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, a once-opulent establishment now faded and frayed at the edges like a forgotten photograph.  Velvet ropes, once a vibrant crimson, now sagged dusty and burgundy, cordoning off a moth-eaten wingback chair missing most of its buttons.  A faint aroma of stale perfume and mothballs hung in the air, mingling with the lingering scent of yesterday's overcooked cabbage from the hotel restaurant downstairs. Outside, the bustling sounds of New Orleans, a vibrant symphony of jazz music and chattering voices, seemed a world away. Amelia, perched on her worn vinyl stool, stared at the blinking cursor on the screen, the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her nails the only sound accompanying her silent contemplation of the cracked plaster ceiling.  It was a Tuesday, slow as molasses in January, and the Grand Majestic was as empty as a tomb.  Little did Amelia know, the stillness was about to be shattered.
