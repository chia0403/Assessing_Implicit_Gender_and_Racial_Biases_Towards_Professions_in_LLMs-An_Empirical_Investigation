The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Reyes's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her rented cottage porch. Below, the churning grey waters of the North Atlantic gnawed at the rocky coastline of Inversgaidh, a tiny Scottish village that clung precariously to the edge of the world.  Three brightly painted fishing boats bobbed in the harbour, dwarfed by the looming presence of Dunvegan Head, its cliffs streaked with centuries of wind and rain. October had arrived in the Highlands, bringing with it a biting wind that carried the scent of peat smoke and the mournful cries of gulls. Mia, usually energized by the raw beauty of the landscape, felt a creeping unease settle in her chest. She’d come to Inversgaidh seeking inspiration, a quiet place to finish her latest novel, a gothic thriller set in a crumbling manor house not unlike the one perched on the hill overlooking the village.  But the silence, broken only by the wind’s howl and the distant rumble of the sea, was beginning to feel less like solitude and more like isolation. The words wouldn't come, the plot felt thin, and the characters, once vivid in her mind, now seemed like distant, flickering shadows.
