The biting November wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the Alberta badlands, whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal remains of pump jacks. Dust devils, born from the parched earth, danced across the desolate landscape, occasionally obscuring the already hazy view of the distant Rockies.  A lone grader, its massive blade scraping against the hard-packed dirt road, carved a path through the wilderness. Inside its heated cab, bundled in a thick Carhartt jacket and a well-worn baseball cap, sat Beatrice "Bea" Amelia Johnson. Bea expertly manipulated the controls, her hands, roughened from years of wrestling heavy machinery, moving with a practiced grace. This unforgiving terrain was her office, her domain. For twenty years, sheâ€™d tamed these badlands, carving roads for exploration crews and building access routes to remote oil wells, always the first one in, often the last one out. But today was different. Today, the road she carved led not to progress but to something ancient, something buried deep within the heart of the earth, and Bea had a feeling it was about to change everything.
