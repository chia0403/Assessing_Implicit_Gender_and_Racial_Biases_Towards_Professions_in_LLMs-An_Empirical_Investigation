The flickering neon sign of "A-Plus Tax Solutions" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Juniper Street. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a certified public accountant and the sole proprietor of the aforementioned establishment, tapped a chipped porcelain mug against her cluttered desk.  It was April 14th, the penultimate day of tax season, and the air inside the small office was thick with the scent of stale coffee, desperation, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Files teetered precariously in stacks that threatened to topple at any moment, mirroring the fragile state of Amelia’s sanity.  Outside, the relentless Oregon rain hammered against the single, grime-streaked window, a melancholic soundtrack to the frantic tapping of keyboard keys and the low hum of the space heater struggling to combat the damp chill.  This was Amelia’s annual descent into chaos, a two-month marathon fueled by caffeine and the sheer terror of impending deadlines. This year, however, felt different.  A strange unease prickled at the edges of her awareness, a sense that something more than just tax season was looming.
