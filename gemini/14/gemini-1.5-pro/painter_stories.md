The salt spray kissed Elara Aurelia Vance's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel braced against a gust of wind that threatened to send her tumbling into the turquoise waters below.  The Isle of Skye, a jagged emerald rising from the tempestuous Scottish sea, was her muse this summer.  Croft houses, clinging to the hillsides like barnacles to a ship's hull, dotted the landscape, their whitewashed walls stark against the vibrant green.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and peat smoke, vibrated with the cries of gulls wheeling overhead. Elara, clad in a paint-splattered oilskin and a woolen scarf wound tight around her neck, squinted at the scene before her, her fingers itching to capture the dramatic play of light and shadow on the canvas.  This particular view, a lonely lighthouse perched on a rocky promontory, had captivated her for days.  It stood sentinel against the relentless waves, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Atlantic.  This, she decided, would be her masterpiece.
