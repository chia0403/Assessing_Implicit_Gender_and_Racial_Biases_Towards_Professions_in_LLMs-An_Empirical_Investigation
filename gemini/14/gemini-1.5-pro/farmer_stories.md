The biting wind whipped across the frost-covered fields of Thistlebrook Farm, stinging Elias Thatcher's cheeks like icy needles.

He'd inherited it from his father, and his father before him, the land passed down through generations like a worn, well-loved storybook. This morning, however, the usual peaceful rhythm of the farm was punctuated by a gnawing unease in Elias's gut, a feeling as heavy and cold as the iron of his shovel.  Something was different. Something was wrong.
