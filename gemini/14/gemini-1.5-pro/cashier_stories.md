The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner in Amelia Reyes's hand.  It was 11:47 PM on a Tuesday, the kind of late November night in Oakhaven, Oregon that smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves. Outside, the only illumination came from the hazy glow of the streetlights and the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign that flickered intermittently, promising refuge and lukewarm coffee to the night owls and insomniacs of this small, forgotten town nestled between the towering pines of the Cascade foothills. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, sighed and ran a hand through her tangled brown hair, wishing, not for the first time, sheâ€™d chosen a different career path.  The Quick Stop, with its sticky linoleum floors, perpetually overflowing trash cans, and clientele that ranged from the eccentric to the downright unsettling, was not exactly her dream job.  But rent was due, and dreams didn't pay the bills in Oakhaven.
