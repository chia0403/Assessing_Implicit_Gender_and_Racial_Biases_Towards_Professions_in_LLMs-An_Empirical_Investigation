The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She wrestled her battered Nikon D850 from its case, the cold metal biting back against her gloved fingers.  Above her, the skeletal branches of ancient oaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes etched against a canvas of bruised purple and angry orange.  Amelia hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, the collar scratching against her neck.  She was perched precariously on a crumbling stone wall overlooking the desolate, windswept moors of Dartmoor National Park, the only sound the mournful cry of a distant curlew and the rhythmic whisper of the wind whistling through the heather.  Tonight, the moor was her studio, the storm, her muse.
