The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of Dr. Evelyn Evangeline Dubois’s knuckles as she adjusted the worn wooden frame of her office window.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the gaps in the aged cypress shutters, danced in the still air.  Her clinic, "Dubois Chiropractic," nestled on the edge of Breaux Bridge, was a charmingly dilapidated Creole cottage, its peeling paint a testament to the passage of time, much like the aging bones of many of her patients.  Inside, the scent of essential oils – a carefully chosen blend of calming lavender and invigorating peppermint – fought a losing battle against the pervasive humidity.  Evelyn, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed, the weight of a long day already settling on her shoulders.  The day had been filled with strained backs, pinched nerves, and the usual complaints of a population that seemed to perpetually suffer from the aches and pains of hard work and hard living.
