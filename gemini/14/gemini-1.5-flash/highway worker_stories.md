The rasping groan of the asphalt cutter was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne.  He’d heard it for fifteen years, a constant companion to the summer heat shimmering off Highway 17, the relentless drone punctuated only by the sporadic shriek of tires on blacktop and the distant, mournful wail of a train horn. Today, the heat hung heavy and thick, a suffocating blanket draped over the sun-baked shoulders of the Coastal Range.  Dust motes danced in the wavering air above the freshly-cut road, a miniature, shimmering desert echoing the vast expanse of the California landscape stretching before him.  Elias wiped a smear of sweat and grime from his brow, the sweat stinging his eyes as he adjusted the cumbersome straps of his safety vest.  The midday sun beat down on his broad shoulders, the air thick with the smell of tar, exhaust fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder of the morning's near-miss with a distracted tourist in a cherry-red convertible.
