The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, amber light of the lobby:  *Augustus "Gus" Finch, Concierge*.  Gus Finch, however, was not gleaming. He was slumped in his plush, burgundy chair, a half-empty cup of lukewarm chamomile tea growing cold beside him, the faint scent of lavender barely masking the metallic tang of impending doom. The opulent lobby of the Blackwood Hotel, normally a symphony of hushed conversations and the clinking of crystal, was eerily quiet.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows overlooking the rain-slicked streets of Prague, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Gus.  The usually vibrant stained-glass ceiling, depicting scenes of mythical Slavic creatures, seemed to dim under the oppressive weight of the storm, and even the perpetually cheerful potted palms looked droopy.  Tonight, the Blackwood held a secret, and Gus, with his encyclopedic knowledge of its guests and his uncanny ability to anticipate their needs, knew he was about to become entangled in it.
