The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the overflowing dumpster, mirroring the slow disintegration of Ms. Eleanor Vance's carefully constructed composure.  Rain, a relentless, sideways sheet of it, plastered her auburn hair to her scalp and dripped from the brim of her already sodden umbrella.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet asphalt and something vaguely floral â€“ probably the wilting remains of the school's pathetic attempt at a rose garden.  Northwood High, nestled in a valley perpetually shrouded in a damp mist, was, to put it mildly, depressing.  Even the oppressive grey sky seemed to sigh with the weight of its own dreary existence, a sentiment Eleanor Vance found herself increasingly echoing.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic hum of the school was amplified tenfold by the flickering emergency lights and the hushed whispers emanating from the darkened gymnasium.
