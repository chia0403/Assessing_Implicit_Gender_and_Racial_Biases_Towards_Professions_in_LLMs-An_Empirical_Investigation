The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of vanilla, almond, and the faint, metallic tang of buttercream.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the humid stillness of "Sweet Surrender," Amelia Katherine Bellweather's cake decorating studio.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – except her fiercely proper grandmother – called her, hummed a jaunty tune as she meticulously piped intricate rosettes onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the ivory fondant shimmering under the lights like a miniature glacier.  Outside, the relentless Seattle rain hammered against the windowpanes, a stark contrast to the sugary perfection unfolding before her.  The studio itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic Pike Place Market district, was a chaotic explosion of color and sugary scent: towering stacks of cake boards, rainbow-hued sprinkles spilling from overturned jars, and a dizzying array of piping bags, each meticulously labeled with a different flavor and shade of frosting.
