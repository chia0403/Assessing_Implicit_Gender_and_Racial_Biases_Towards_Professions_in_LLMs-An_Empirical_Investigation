The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he polished a glass, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the low thrum of conversation in The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering mess.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, almost imperceptible sweetness of desperation.  Elias, with his perpetually tired eyes and hands that moved with the practiced grace of a surgeon, was the only constant in this chaotic, ever-shifting tableau.  He'd seen it all in his ten years behind the bar: broken hearts mended with cheap bourbon, drunken boasts turned to tearful confessions, and the quiet dignity of those who sought only the fleeting solace of anonymity in a glass. Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual Friday night buzz was muted, replaced by a tension so thick you could almost cut it with a rusty bottle opener.  Something was brewing, something Elias could sense in the very marrow of his bones, a storm far more potent than the one raging outside.
