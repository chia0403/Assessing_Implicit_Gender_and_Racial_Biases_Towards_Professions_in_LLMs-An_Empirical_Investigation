The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk felt familiar beneath her fingertips, a comforting texture against the unsettling tremor in her stomach.  It was the first day of school, a day usually brimming with the chaotic energy of excited children and the crisp scent of new crayons, but this year, a thick, unsettling silence hung in the air, heavier than the humid August afternoon pressing against the single, sweat-beaded pane of the classroom window.  Oakwood Elementary, a rambling brick building that smelled perpetually of old glue and slightly burnt popcorn, usually vibrated with life. Today, it felt…still.  The usually vibrant primary-colored murals seemed muted, their cheerful depictions of playful animals and bouncing letters dulled by the oppressive quiet.  Even the mischievous squirrels that normally chattered outside the window were absent, leaving only the relentless drone of cicadas as a soundtrack to Eleanor’s mounting unease.
