The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a discordant lullaby, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished wooden floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow sweep of Elias Thorne's mop, danced in the beams like tiny, frantic fireflies.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rhythmic swish of cleaning fluid and the squeak of rubber on varnish, pushed the mop with a weary sigh.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, stale pizza, and something vaguely chemical – the result, Elias suspected, of a particularly enthusiastic chemistry experiment gone awry.  It was 2:17 AM, the academy silent except for the hum of the lights and the quiet, methodical rhythm of his work.  Tonight, however, the usual placid routine felt… different. A prickling unease, like static clinging to his skin, made the familiar emptiness of the gymnasium feel less empty, more… watched.
