The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted quadrangle of St. Jude’s Hospital.  Rain, a relentless, sideways drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, clinging to the collar of her coat like a second skin.  The imposing gothic architecture of St. Jude’s, usually a source of quiet, gothic beauty, seemed to loom menacingly under the bruised, pewter sky.  Its stained-glass windows, normally ablaze with colour, were muted and shadowy, reflecting the turmoil brewing within Eleanor herself.  Tonight, the quiet efficiency of the operating theatres felt a million miles away, replaced by a gnawing anxiety that tightened in her chest with each gust of wind.  The emergency call had come just an hour ago, a curt, clipped message delivered with the chilling formality only reserved for the most critical cases.  And Eleanor, despite years honing her surgical skills, felt a cold dread creep into the spaces between her ribs.  This wasn't just another surgery; this was personal.
