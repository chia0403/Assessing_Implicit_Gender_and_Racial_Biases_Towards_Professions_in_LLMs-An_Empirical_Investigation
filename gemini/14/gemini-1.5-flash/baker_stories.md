The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Frost clung to the windowpanes of "The Gilded Crumb," painting intricate, ephemeral lacework across the display cases promising warmth and sweetness within.  The street outside, cobbled and deserted save for the occasional scavenging cat, was still draped in the inky shadows of a November morning.  A thin veil of fog clung low, blurring the gaslights into hazy orbs, and the only sounds were the distant rumble of a passing tram and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia’s own heart, a steady beat echoing the rhythm of her life: flour, butter, sugar, love.  The aroma of warm bread, already rising from the ovens within, promised a day of comforting creation, despite the lingering chill in the air and the unspoken anxieties that lay just beneath the surface of her usually cheerful disposition.
