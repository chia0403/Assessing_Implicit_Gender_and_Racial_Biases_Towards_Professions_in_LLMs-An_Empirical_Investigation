The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday afternoon.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener, battling a persistent undercurrent of stale coffee and slightly-off potato chips.  Amelia, meticulously arranging a pyramid of brightly colored candy bars, sighed.

Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt parking lot, turning the air shimmery and hazy.  Even through the grimy windows, Amelia could feel the heat radiating into the store, a constant reminder of the oppressive July heat that seemed determined to melt both the ice cream and her patience.
