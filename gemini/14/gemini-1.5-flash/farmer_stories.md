The rasping cough tore through Elias Thorne's chest, a sound as familiar as the creak of his barn doors.  He spat a glob of rusty phlegm onto the frost-covered earth, the breath misting briefly in the pre-dawn chill.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp soil, hung heavy above the valley, clinging to the low-slung, snow-dusted eaves of his farmhouse.  Elias, a man etched by years of toil under a relentless sun and the biting wind of the Wyoming plains, hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat.  His farm, nestled between the whispering pines and the frozen Snake River, was a patchwork quilt of fields â€“ some still showing the browning stubble of harvested wheat, others already blanketed in a pristine layer of snow.  The rising sun, a fiery orb struggling to pierce the lingering darkness, cast long shadows across the landscape, highlighting the stark beauty and unforgiving nature of his world.
