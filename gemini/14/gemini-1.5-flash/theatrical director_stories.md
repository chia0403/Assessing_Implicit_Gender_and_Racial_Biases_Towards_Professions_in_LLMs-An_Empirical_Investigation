The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant stage door of the dilapidated Blackwood Theatre.  Rust groaned in protest with every heave, a sound almost as mournful as the howling wind whistling through the gaps in the crumbling brickwork.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of dust, decay, and a faint, lingering perfume of decades-old theatrical sweat – a heady mix that, to Mia, smelled intoxicatingly of possibility.  The Blackwood, a once-grand Victorian playhouse teetering on the brink of collapse both physically and financially, was her latest, and perhaps most ambitious, project.  Its faded grandeur, the peeling paint, the echoing emptiness – all were canvases waiting to be filled with the vibrant chaos of her next production:  Shakespeare's *King Lear*, a play as tempestuous and unpredictable as the night itself.
