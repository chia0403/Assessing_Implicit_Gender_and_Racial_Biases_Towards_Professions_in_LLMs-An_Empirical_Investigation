Rain lashed against the grime-coated windows, mirroring the relentless downpour of another slow Tuesday night at the diner nestled on the wrong side of Harmony Creek.  Amelia, her usually vibrant auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun to escape the humid kitchen, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic clatter of a distant spoon against a ceramic mug.  Tonight, even the usual comforting drone of the old jukebox seemed to mock her empty tip jar.
