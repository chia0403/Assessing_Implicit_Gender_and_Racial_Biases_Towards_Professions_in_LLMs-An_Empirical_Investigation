The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hands, a meager comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her tiny, book-lined office, perched precariously on the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the heart of Salem, Massachusetts, smelled faintly of old paper, damp wool, and the lingering sweetness of gingerbread – a stark contrast to the bitter taste of disappointment currently coating her tongue. Outside, the Salem Common, usually a vibrant tapestry of autumnal hues, was now a sodden canvas of grey, reflecting the bleakness of her latest sales figures.  Mia, a seasoned insurance agent with a reputation for uncanny empathy and even uncannier luck in avoiding truly catastrophic claims, was staring down the barrel of her worst quarter yet.  And it wasn't just the plummeting profits; something felt…off. A prickling unease, as familiar and unwelcome as the Salem damp, settled deep in her bones.
