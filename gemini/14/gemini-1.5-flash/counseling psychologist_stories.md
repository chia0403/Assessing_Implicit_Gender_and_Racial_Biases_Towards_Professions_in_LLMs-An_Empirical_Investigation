The flickering neon sign of the "Blue Moon Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across Dr. Eleanor Vance's rain-streaked windshield.  The air hung heavy with the scent of exhaust fumes and frying onions, a fitting aroma for the kind of night she was having.

Outside, the usually vibrant streets of Oakhaven, California, were deserted except for the occasional, hurried figure hunched against the relentless November downpour.  The rain hammered against the roof of the diner, a relentless rhythm mirroring the anxieties that thrummed beneath Eleanor's meticulously composed exterior.
