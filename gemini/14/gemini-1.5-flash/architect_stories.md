The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar discomfort that did little to dampen the thrill coursing through him.  He gripped the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping his dark hair across his eyes as he surveyed the breathtaking panorama unfolding before him.

Elias, a renowned architect known for his minimalist designs, felt a familiar tug of inspiration – a raw, untamed energy that promised a challenge far greater than any he’d encountered in the sterile confines of his London studio.
