The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Shetland Islands, stinging Dr. Elara Rhysâ€™s cheeks and whipping her thick, auburn braid across her face.  Salt spray, heavy with the scent of seaweed and impending storm, stung her eyes as she wrestled the battered Land Rover Defender up a treacherous, barely-there track.  The grey sky threatened to unleash its fury at any moment, mirroring the turmoil churning within Elara.  Her headlights cut through the gloom, revealing only fleeting glimpses of the rugged, wind-battered landscape:  sheer cliffs plunging into a churning sea, the skeletal remains of ancient crofts clinging precariously to the hillside, and the occasional flash of dark, shaggy Shetland pony disappearing into the swirling mist.  Tonight, however, Elara wasn't concerned with the capricious elements or the beauty of the islands; her focus was entirely on the emergency call that had jolted her from a much-needed, albeit short-lived, sleep.  A prized Shetland stallion, apparently injured badly, and a desperate farmer awaiting her expertise. The fate of the magnificent animal, and perhaps the farmer's livelihood, hung precariously in the balance.
