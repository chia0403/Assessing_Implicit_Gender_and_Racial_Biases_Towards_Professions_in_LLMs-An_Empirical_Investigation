The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tearing at Elias Thorne’s already threadbare coat.  Fallen leaves, the colour of burnt umber and decaying mahogany, skittered across the gravel path like frantic mice escaping a predator.  Elias, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A deeper, more unsettling chill had settled over the grounds since… well, since *it* had happened.  Blackwood Manor itself, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and shadowed turrets, loomed above him, its countless windows like vacant, staring eyes in the twilight.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else… something subtly metallic, a faint whisper of blood carried on the wind.  For Elias Thorne, groundskeeper and sole caretaker of Blackwood's sprawling estate for the past fifteen years, this wasn't just a bad autumn; it was the beginning of something far worse.
