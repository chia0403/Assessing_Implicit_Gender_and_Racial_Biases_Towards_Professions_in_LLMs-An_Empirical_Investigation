The wind, a rasping, unforgiving hand, clawed at the weathered face of Silas Blackwood as he surveyed his spread.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced across the parched earth of the Broken Spur Ranch, the afternoon sun beating down with the merciless intensity only the Arizona desert could muster.  The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of dry chaparral and the faint, metallic tang of blood – not fresh, thankfully, but the lingering ghost of a coyote’s unfortunate encounter with a barbed-wire fence earlier that week.  Silas squinted, his eyes, the colour of faded denim, scanning the endless expanse of scrubland, his gaze settling on the distant, shimmering heat haze that distorted the already indistinct line where sky met earth.  This was his kingdom, harsh and unforgiving, a land that demanded respect and offered little in return, but a land Silas Blackwood loved fiercely, despite its relentless challenges.
