The chill wind, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers as he hauled the last of the day's pig carcasses into his shop.  Barty's Fine Meats, it proclaimed above the door in faded gold lettering – a grandiose title for a business that occupied a cramped, single-story building wedged between a perpetually leaky fishmonger and a perpetually grumpy cobbler on the cobbled side street of Oakhaven.  Oakhaven itself clung precariously to the cliff edge overlooking the turbulent grey sea, the salty air a constant companion, as relentless as the waves crashing against the rocks below.  The air hung heavy with the aroma of Barty's trade – a potent mix of blood, sawdust, and the faintly sweet tang of rendered fat, a smell both comforting and unsettling to those unfamiliar with its source.  Tonight, however, the usual butcher-shop bouquet was tinged with a sharper, more metallic tang – the scent of fear.
