The wail of the siren was a lullaby to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a sound that had lulled her to sleep and jolted her awake for the better part of two decades.  Tonight, however, the usual adrenaline-fueled anticipation was muted by a bone-deep weariness that clung to her like the damp coastal fog rolling in off the Pacific.  The ambulance, a battered Ford Transit painted in the garish fluorescent yellow and orange of the San Francisco Bay Area Emergency Medical Services, swayed precariously on the rain-slicked streets of North Beach.  The scent of salt and decaying seaweed battled with the metallic tang of blood, a familiar, unwelcome perfume in the close confines of the vehicle.  Evelyn gripped the worn leather of the passenger seat, the city lights blurring into streaks of neon through the downpour, mirroring the chaotic jumble of thoughts in her mind.  Ahead, the destination flickered on the GPS: Fisherman's Wharf, a place usually bustling with tourists, now cloaked in the inky shadows of a storm-wracked night.
