The salt spray stung Officer Amelia Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the battered patrol car onto the narrow, winding road clinging to the cliff edge.  Below, the Pacific churned, a restless grey beast gnawing at the foundations of Big Sur.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and eucalyptus, offered little respite from the relentless fog that clung to the cypress trees like a shroud.  Amelia squinted, her gaze fixed on the ribbon of asphalt ahead, barely visible through the swirling mist.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the engine, the only sounds louder than the relentless cry of the gulls circling overhead.  This wasn’t just another night shift in Monterey County; this was a call into the heart of the wilderness, a place where the line between civilization and chaos blurred as easily as the fog itself.
