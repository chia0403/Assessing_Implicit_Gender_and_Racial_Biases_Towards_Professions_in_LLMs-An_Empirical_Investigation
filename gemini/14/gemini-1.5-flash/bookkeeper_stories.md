The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to dispel the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun struggling to pierce the gloom of the ancient oak trees outside, danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the room.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of meticulous habit and even more meticulous hair – a severe bun that never so much as a stray strand escaped – sighed, the sound swallowed by the rustling of papers and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome to the quiet symphony of her work.  Her office, a cramped space above the bustling fishmongers of Grimsborough Quay, smelled faintly of brine and old ledgers.  The air was thick with the scent of salt, damp wool, and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of something sweeter, something she couldn't quite place – perhaps the lingering ghost of Mrs. Gable’s plum jam from yesterday’s delivery.
