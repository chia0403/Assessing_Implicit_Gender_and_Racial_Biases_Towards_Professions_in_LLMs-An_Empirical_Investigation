Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling hospital grounds, a stark contrast to the sterile, clinical environment Amelia inhabited. Today, however, the usual calm before the evening shift felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, thicker than the lingering scent of disinfectant, a premonition that something was about to disrupt the predictable flow of her day.
