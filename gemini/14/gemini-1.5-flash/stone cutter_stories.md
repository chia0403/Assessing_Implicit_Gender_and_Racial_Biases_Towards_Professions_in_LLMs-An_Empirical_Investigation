The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the narrow valley, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a hawk circling high above.  Dust motes, thick as summer flies, danced in the weak afternoon sun that struggled to penetrate the towering cliffs surrounding the village of Stonecutter's Hollow.  This was Elias Thorne’s workshop, a rough-hewn shelter carved into the very rock face he spent his days shaping.  Elias, his hands gnarled and strong as the stone itself, paused his work, wiping a smear of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. The granite, a block the size of a small pony, sat before him, resisting his efforts with an almost stubborn patience, reflecting the same stubbornness in Elias’s own heart.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and the sharp, clean tang of freshly cut stone.
