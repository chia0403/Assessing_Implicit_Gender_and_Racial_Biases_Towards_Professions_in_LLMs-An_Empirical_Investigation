The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle shop cast a lurid green glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Steam curled from the overflowing takeout containers clutched in her gloved hands, a fragrant counterpoint to the biting November wind whipping through the alleyway behind the sprawling tech campus.  Elara, a computer programmer with eyes that held the tired wisdom of someone who’d spent too many nights wrestling with cryptic error messages and too few sleeping soundly, shivered, pulling her coat tighter. The alley, a labyrinth of overflowing dumpsters and fire escapes, felt both claustrophobic and strangely comforting, a familiar refuge from the sterile perfection of the office she'd just left.  Tonight, however, even the comforting anonymity of the alley felt threatened by the unsettling hum emanating from the shadowed doorway across from her.  It wasn't the hum of a faulty transformer, or even the distant drone of city traffic; it was something… else. Something that prickled at the edges of her awareness, a low thrum that resonated deep in her bones.
