The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s pencil on mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the still air above her drafting table, a miniature, swirling galaxy mirroring the vast, complex blueprints spread across its surface.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the sharp, slightly sweet odor of the correction fluid she used sparingly, each dab a testament to her meticulous nature.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling industrial complex of the Blackwood Manufacturing Company, but inside, time seemed to slow to a crawl, measured only by the steady advance of Amelia’s pencil, charting a course through a world of angles, curves, and precise calculations.  Tonight's project: the schematics for a new line of automated harvesters, machines that would soon reshape the landscape of the nearby Salinas Valley.
