The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune above Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, its faded red paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the swirling chaos of Barty's workplace.  Hair clippings, thick as fallen snow, carpeted the floor around a worn leather barber's chair, while faded photographs of grinning, long-gone clients clung precariously to the walls. The air hung thick with the scent of Bay Rum, stale coffee, and the lingering ghost of pipe tobacco â€“ a potent cocktail that spoke volumes about the age and character of the establishment, and its owner.  Outside, the relentless Louisiana sun beat down on the sleepy town of Cypress Bend, its heat shimmering off the cracked asphalt of Main Street.  But inside Barty's, time seemed to have slowed to a crawl, a deliberate, almost stubborn resistance to the relentless march of progress.
