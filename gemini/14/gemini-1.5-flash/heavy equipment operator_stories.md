The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song across the desolate expanse of the Powder River Basin, whipping snow into frenzied dervishes that stung Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s cheeks.  Amy, her breath clouding in the frigid air, gripped the controls of her Caterpillar D11T, the massive machine rumbling beneath her like a slumbering behemoth.  The sun, a weak, watery disc struggling against the thick overcast, cast long, skeletal shadows from the drilling rigs scattered across the frozen landscape, each a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the unforgiving sky.  This wasn't the picturesque Wyoming of postcards; this was raw, unforgiving country, where the only constant was the relentless churn of heavy machinery and the ever-present threat of the elements.  Today, the threat felt particularly potent.  The wind threatened to rip the steel skin from her bones, and the forecast promised a blizzard of epic proportions.  Amy checked her fuel gauge – nearly empty.  This wasn’t just a bad day; it was shaping up to be a survival test.
