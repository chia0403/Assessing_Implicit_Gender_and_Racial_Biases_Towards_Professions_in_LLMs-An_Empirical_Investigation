The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Elias Thorne's ears, tugging at the brim of his worn felt hat.  Below, the city of Oakhaven sprawled, a tapestry of gaslit streets and rain-slicked cobblestones shrinking with the encroaching dusk.  Elias, perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the old Victorian mansion, felt the familiar, exhilarating tremor of height beneath him.  He wasn't afraid of heights; he was a roofer, after all, and the dizzying panorama was as familiar to him as the calloused skin on his hands. But tonight, the wind carried something else besides the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth – a chilling premonition that clung to him like the clinging ivy snaking up the mansion’s crumbling brickwork.  The job itself was simple enough – repair a leak before the first snow fell – but a strange unease settled in his gut, a sense that something far more sinister than a leaky roof awaited him in the shadows of this grand, decaying house.
