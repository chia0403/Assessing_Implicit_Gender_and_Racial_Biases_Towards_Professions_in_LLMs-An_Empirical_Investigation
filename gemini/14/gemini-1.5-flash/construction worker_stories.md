The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne’s ankles, a frigid caress that seeped through the worn soles of his work boots.  Dust, the fine, grey grit of pulverized concrete and demolition debris, clung to everything – his eyelashes, the collar of his faded denim jacket, the grimy canvas of his lunch pail.
