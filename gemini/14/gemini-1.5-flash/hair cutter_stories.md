Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the street outside.  The only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome in a slow, mournful waltz.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet solitude of Reli's evening was about to be shattered. A frantic knock, sharp and insistent, echoed through the tiny space, followed by a muffled sob that sent a shiver down Reli's spine.
