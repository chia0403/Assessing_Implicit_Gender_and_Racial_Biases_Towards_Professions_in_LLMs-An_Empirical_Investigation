The scent of aged paper and dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight – a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Silas Weathersby Memorial Library – usually brought a sense of quiet contentment.  Not today.  Today, the silence felt heavy, oppressive, like a shroud draped over the towering oak bookshelves that lined the hallowed halls.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge against the gothic stained-glass windows, a counterpoint to the frantic thump-thump-thump of Eleanor’s own heart.  The library, usually a sanctuary, felt…watched.
