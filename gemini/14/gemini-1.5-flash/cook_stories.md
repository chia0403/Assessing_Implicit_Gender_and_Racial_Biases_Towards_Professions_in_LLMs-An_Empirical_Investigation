The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's face as she hauled the last crate of glistening, ice-cold oysters onto the creaking wooden dock.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine, diesel, and something indefinably fishy â€“ the pungent, earthy aroma that clung to the very fabric of the small fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged coast of Maine.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the pastel-hued fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbor, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and crimson. Mia, her hands roughened by years of scrubbing pots and shucking shellfish, wiped her brow with the back of her hand, a satisfied grin stretching across her face.  Tonight, the renowned Lobster Shack on the Cliff would be serving her signature oyster stew, and she was determined to make it the best yet.
