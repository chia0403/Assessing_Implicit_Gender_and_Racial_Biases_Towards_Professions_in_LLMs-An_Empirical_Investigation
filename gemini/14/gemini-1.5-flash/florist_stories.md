The scent of jasmine, heady and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up shopfront next door.  Inside "Petal Pushers," however, it was a riot of colour and warmth.  Amethyst hydrangeas spilled from wicker baskets, their deep purple a perfect foil to the sunshine yellow of miniature sunflowers nestled amongst them.  Elara Josephine Thorne, owner and chief floral architect of Petal Pushers, hummed a low tune as she delicately arranged a spray of crimson roses, her nimble fingers expertly weaving in sprigs of silvery eucalyptus.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon, but within the small, flower-filled haven, Elara felt a comforting sense of calm amidst the impending storm.
