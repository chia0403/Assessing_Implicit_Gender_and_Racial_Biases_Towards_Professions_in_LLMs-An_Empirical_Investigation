The greasy smell of motor oil clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar aroma that mingled with the faint sweetness of spilled cola and the acrid tang of burnt rubber.  Elias, a man whose hands were perpetually stained a symphony of grime and grease, squinted at the engine nestled before him in the cavernous belly of Thorne's Auto Repair.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy windows of the workshop, illuminating a scene of organized chaos: tools hung haphazardly from pegboards, tires were stacked precariously against the wall, and a half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned on a workbench cluttered with spark plugs and wrenches.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Route 66, the occasional rumble of a passing truck the only interruption to the otherwise simmering stillness of the desert town of Dust Devil, population 317 (give or take a few tumbleweeds).
