The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Hayes, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick thermal layers beneath her parka.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly yellow at the horizon, offered no hint of the sun, swallowed long ago by the relentless polar night.  Evelyn, her breath puffing out in frosty clouds, adjusted the heavy-duty headlamp strapped to her forehead, its beam cutting a narrow swathe through the swirling snow.  The research station, a cluster of squat, snow-covered buildings clinging precariously to the ice shelf, was a distant, blurry smudge in the gloom.  She was alone, miles from safety, her only companions the relentless wind and the unsettling silence punctuated only by the crunch of her boots on the hard-packed snow. The object of her solitary vigil, nestled beneath the ice, lay several hundred feet below, a secret she hoped to unearth before the encroaching storm swallowed her whole.
