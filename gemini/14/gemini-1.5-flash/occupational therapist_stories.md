The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the tangled kelp.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey-green waters of the Atlantic, cast long shadows across the rocky outcrop where she stood.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  This wasn't exactly the typical occupational therapy setting – her usual domain was the brightly lit, sterile environment of the Coastal Pines Rehabilitation Center – but then again, Eleanor Vance wasn't your typical occupational therapist.  She believed healing could happen anywhere, even amidst the unforgiving beauty of the Maine coastline, especially when it involved a patient as stubborn as old Silas Blackwood and his equally stubborn fishing boat, the *Sea Serpent*.
