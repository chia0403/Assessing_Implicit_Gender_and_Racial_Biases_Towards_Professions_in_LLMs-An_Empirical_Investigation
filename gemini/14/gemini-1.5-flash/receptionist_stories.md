The air conditioning, perpetually set to a bone-chilling sixty-eight degrees, fought a losing battle against the oppressive humidity of a Houston summer.  The only other sound, besides the hum of the lights, was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Ameliaâ€™s perfectly manicured nails on the polished granite countertop of her desk.  Today, however, the usual quiet ennui of her job felt different; heavier. A premonition, perhaps, or simply the weight of another Monday looming.
