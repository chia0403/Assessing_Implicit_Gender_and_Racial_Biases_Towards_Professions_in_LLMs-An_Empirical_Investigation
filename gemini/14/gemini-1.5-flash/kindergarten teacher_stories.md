The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom!" sign flaked onto the worn welcome mat, mirroring the slow decay of Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s own spirit.  It was the last day of August, a humid, oppressive blanket clinging to the brick walls of Sunny Meadows Elementary, and the scent of impending doom, or at least impending chaos, hung heavier than the honeysuckle climbing the ivy-covered fence.  Inside, the kindergarten classroom, usually a kaleidoscope of brightly colored drawings and enthusiastic chatter, felt eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner, a metronome counting down to the inevitable onslaught of tiny, sugar-fueled humans.  The only evidence of life were the half-deflated balloons left over from the school's open house the previous evening, drooping like weary soldiers after a long campaign.  Ms. Vance sighed, the sound barely audible above the ticking clock, and ran a hand through her already-frazzled auburn hair.  This year felt different, heavier somehow, a premonition she couldn't quite shake.
