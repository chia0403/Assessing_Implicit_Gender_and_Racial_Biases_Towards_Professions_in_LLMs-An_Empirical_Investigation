The biting London wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Nightingale's hair across her face as she surveyed the deserted park.  October leaves, skeletal and russet, clung stubbornly to the ancient oaks, their rustling a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia's own heart.  She stood at the edge of Regent's Park, a figure clad in a vibrant purple windbreaker that defied the chill,  her determined jawline etched against the overcast sky.  Her usual pre-dawn yoga class, a vibrant tapestry of sweat and shared breath, had been cancelled due to the sudden downpour.  Instead, Amelia found herself staring at the deserted paths, the familiar sights and sounds of the park – the squirrels, the pigeons, the distant rumble of the city – all muted by the damp, gray air.  It was a day for introspection, not for instruction.
