The greasy air hung thick with the smell of burnt rubber and motor oil, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty"  Kingston.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights of "Kingston's Kustom Kinks," a small, cluttered garage nestled between a bakery and a pawn shop on the outskirts of Rustwood.  Rusty, chipped paint adorned the walls, a testament to countless hours spent wrestling with sputtering engines and stubborn transmissions.  Barty, a man whose hands, calloused and strong, seemed to possess a sixth sense for the subtle tremors of a malfunctioning part, hunched over a battered, mint-green 1978 Mustang, its hood propped open like a gaping maw.  A faint whine emanated from beneath, a mournful sound that resonated with the rhythmic click-clack of Barty's tools.  He traced a finger along the intricate pattern of the engine's block, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the dusty street, the only sound besides the car's sigh was the occasional honk of a passing truck, a small, insignificant interruption to the symphony of the garage.
