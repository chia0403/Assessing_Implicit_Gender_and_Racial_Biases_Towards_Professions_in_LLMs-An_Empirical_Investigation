The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Rusty Mug" cast long, distorted shadows across Amelia Kensington's weary face.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mimicking the insistent rhythm of her pounding headache.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit diner.  Empty tables, marred by the remnants of yesterday's breakfasts, lined the room.  A single, half-eaten plate of pancakes sat forlornly on one, a testament to the diner's quiet, almost spectral, atmosphere.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hair the shade of burnt umber, sighed, the sound barely audible above the relentless drumming of the rain.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was a mausoleum of missed chances and lukewarm coffee, and she felt buried beneath it all.
