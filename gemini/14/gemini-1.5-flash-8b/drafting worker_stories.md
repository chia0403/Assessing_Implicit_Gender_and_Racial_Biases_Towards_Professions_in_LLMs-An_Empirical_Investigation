The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous lullaby, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias Thorne's pen against the tracing paper.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air, reflecting the pale blue glow of the computer screen displaying a complex architectural rendering.  Elias, a drafting worker for the sprawling, multi-national firm of  Aether Architects, was immersed in his work, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the acrid scent of toner, hung heavy in the cramped, windowless space.  A faded poster of the Eiffel Tower, ripped at the edges, hung precariously on the wall, a testament to the room's forgotten history and the ceaseless march of architectural innovation outside its sterile confines.  The year was 2042.
