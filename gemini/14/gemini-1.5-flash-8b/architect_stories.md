The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayes's thoughts.  Amelia Hayes, architect extraordinaire, or perhaps more accurately, architect-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown, stared at the blueprints spread across the worn oak table.  Each line, each symbol, each meticulously drawn dimension, mocked her.  The project, the grand, ambitious, and tragically under-funded renovation of the crumbling Victorian orphanage, seemed to be defying her every attempt at resolution.

The workshop, a small, cluttered space tucked behind the sprawling, ivy-covered Victorian house that Amelia was currently trying to restore, was a testament to its owner's passion and, perhaps, a little madness.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, highlighting the haphazard array of tools, sketches, and discarded coffee cups.  The scent of old wood and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a comforting, if slightly unsettling, aroma.  A lone, oversized potted fern drooped sadly in a corner, mirroring Amelia's own spirits.  Outside, the relentless rain continued its relentless assault on the weathered building, a soundtrack to the growing storm within Amelia's soul.
