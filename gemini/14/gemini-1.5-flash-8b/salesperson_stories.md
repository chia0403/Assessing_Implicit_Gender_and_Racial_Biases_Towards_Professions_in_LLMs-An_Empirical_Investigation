The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, But Mostly What You Don't" mega-store hummed, a low, insistent drone that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Butterfield’s heart.  Amelia, a third-generation salesperson with a perpetually tired smile and a nametag that read "Amelia Butterfield -  Passionate about Potential," stared blankly at the overflowing display of novelty salt and pepper shakers.  She was in the "Gourmet Garnishing" aisle, a purgatorial zone of brightly colored ceramic cats,  miniature windmills, and meticulously arranged, yet ultimately pointless, decorative spice jars.

The store, a sprawling behemoth in the heart of Zenith, a city built on the principle of excessive consumerism, stretched before her like a concrete labyrinth.  Giant skylights poured a pale, filtered sunlight onto the chaotic displays of trinkets, gadgets, and, inexplicably,  miniature replica spaceships.  This particular section, the "Gourmet Garnishing" aisle, was renowned for its unpredictable clientele: the eccentric collectors of peculiar paraphernalia, the bargain-hunting hoarders, and the perpetually lost tourists.  Amelia’s task: to convert each wandering soul into a satisfied, if slightly bewildered, customer.

Today, however, the drone of the fluorescent lights seemed to mock her efforts.  Another slow Saturday. Another soul-crushing inventory of salt shakers.  Another potential sale lost in the cacophony of pointless choices.
