The sterile white of the operating room hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, a soundtrack to the rhythmic clicking of Dr. Eleanor Vance's instruments.

But within its gleaming walls, a constant tension existed, a silent war between the life-affirming purpose of medicine and the overwhelming weight of mortality that hung heavy in the air, especially during these late-night hours.  The city lights, a million pinpricks of brilliance, twinkled against the star-strewn sky, a stark reminder of the countless lives that pulsed with their own quiet rhythms, unaware of the delicate ballet unfolding within these sterile, seemingly emotionless walls.
