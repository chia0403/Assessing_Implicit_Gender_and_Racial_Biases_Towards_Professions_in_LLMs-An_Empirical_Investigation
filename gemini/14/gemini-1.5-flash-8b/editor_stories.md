The fluorescent hum of the newsroom was a constant, insistent drone, a soundtrack to Amelia Petrova’s life.  Empty coffee cups, half-eaten sandwiches, and the faint scent of stale printer ink clung to the air, a familiar perfume of deadline anxiety.  Amelia, her fingers flying across the keyboard of her battered iMac, was knee-deep in a story about a controversial new housing development slated for the city’s historic waterfront district.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the mood in the room; a perpetual drizzle seemed to mirror the endless stream of copy edits and revisions.

Amelia Petrova, a senior editor at The London Chronicle, hunched over her desk, the stark white of the computer screen reflecting in her tired eyes. The city, a labyrinth of cobbled streets and towering Victorian architecture, thrummed with a life she rarely felt part of.  Her apartment, a small, sunless flat above a bustling market, was her refuge, a place where the pressure of deadlines and the opinions of countless anonymous readers faded into the background, replaced by the gentle clatter of pots and pans and the distant murmur of the London Underground.  But tonight, the hum of the city, the relentless rhythm of the news cycle, felt as though it was vibrating within her skull. This story...this story was going to be a nightmare.
