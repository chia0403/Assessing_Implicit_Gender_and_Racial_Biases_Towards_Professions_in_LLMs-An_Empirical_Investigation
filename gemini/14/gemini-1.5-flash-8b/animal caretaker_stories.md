The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's cloak around her ankles, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and something faintly metallic, a smell that clung to the jagged peaks of the Cairngorms like a persistent ghost.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker for the Highland Wildlife Sanctuary, shivered, pulling her wool scarf tighter.  The sanctuary, nestled high on the slopes overlooking Loch Morlich, was a patchwork of weathered stone buildings and enclosed runs, each home to a unique collection of Scottish wildlife.  Today, however, the usual bustling symphony of chattering squirrels, bleating sheep, and the rhythmic hoots of tawny owls felt strangely muted.  A thick blanket of snow had fallen overnight, transforming the familiar landscape into a hushed, almost ethereal, white world.  The path leading to the snow leopard enclosure, normally a well-trodden route, was now a treacherous, unmarked trail, swallowed by the relentless white.  Amelia's boots crunched softly on the frozen ground, the only sound besides the wind's mournful howl.  She clutched a steaming mug of hot cocoa, its warmth a small comfort against the biting chill, as she pressed on, her determination as unwavering as the jagged peaks surrounding her.
