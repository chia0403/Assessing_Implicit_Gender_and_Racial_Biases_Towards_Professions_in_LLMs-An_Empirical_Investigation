The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, a carpenter of renowned skill but questionable patience, as he wrestled a stubborn oak beam into place.  Dust motes danced in the pale winter sun, illuminating the skeletal framework of the grand hall Elias was constructing.  It was a colossal undertaking, commissioned by Lord Ashworth, a man famed for his extravagance and even more famed for his exacting demands.  The hall, destined to be the centerpiece of Ashworth Manor, was to be a monument to the lord's perceived power and opulence, a testament to his ruthless ambition and Elias's unyielding, albeit sometimes begrudging, dedication to craftsmanship.

The setting was the small, frost-bitten village of Oakhaven nestled at the foot of the whispering Blackwood Mountains.  Snow clung to the thatched roofs of the cottages, mirroring the icy grip of the winter on the very soul of the valley.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint sounds of the villagers going about their quiet lives, punctuated by the occasional creak of a frozen well or the distant barking of a sled dog.  Elias's workshop, a small, cramped affair tucked beneath the eaves of his modest cottage, was a stark contrast to the grandeur of the hall he was building. Yet within its confines, nestled among the tools and the sawdust, lay a quiet determination, a quiet fire burning brighter than any winter wind.
