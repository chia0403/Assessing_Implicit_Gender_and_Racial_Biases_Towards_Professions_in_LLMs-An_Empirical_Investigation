The biting wind, a relentless terrier, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face.  He huddled deeper into his worn leather jacket, the coarse wool offering scant protection against the November chill.  Rain, the consistency of fine gravel, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a soundtrack to the symphony of creaks and groans that echoed through the skeletal structure.  Elias, a roofer with hands calloused to the texture of grey slate and the feel of rusting nails, was perched precariously on a crumbling section of the roof, his gaze sweeping across the sprawling industrial park.  Broken glass littered the yard, a testament to the warehouseâ€™s forgotten glory.  Rust-eaten machinery lay scattered like discarded toys, their metallic bodies whispering tales of a lost industrial might.  The only other sign of life was the faint plume of smoke curling from a distant chimney, a lone beacon in the encroaching dusk.  This was Elias's domain, a forgotten corner of the city, a place where the ghosts of forgotten factories and dreams lingered in the biting wind.
