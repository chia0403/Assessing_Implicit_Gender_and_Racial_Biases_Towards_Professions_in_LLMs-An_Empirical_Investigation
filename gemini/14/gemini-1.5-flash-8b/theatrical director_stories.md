The scent of mildew and aged wood, a comforting perfume to some, hung heavy in the air of the "Old Globe" Theatre.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the cavernous space, illuminating the chipped paint of the proscenium arch and the skeletal remains of forgotten sets.  This was Amelia "Amie" Nightingaleâ€™s domain, her sanctuary, and her battlefield.  Amie Nightingale, a theatrical director with a reputation as volatile as the lightning striking the peaks of the nearby mountains, surveyed the scene with a mixture of frustration and exhilaration.  Her latest play, "Echoes of the Obsidian Heart," a sprawling epic about a forgotten kingdom, was weeks behind schedule, the actors were resistant, and the whispers of dissatisfaction were beginning to echo through the backstage corridors.

The setting:  The Old Globe Theatre, a crumbling, yet historically significant, open-air amphitheatre nestled within the foothills of the jagged, windswept peaks of the Azure Mountains.  The year is 1888.  The air vibrates with the pulse of the surrounding wilderness, its raw energy mirroring the passionate turmoil within Amie's soul. The theatre itself, once grand, now bears the marks of time and neglect.  The wooden benches, worn smooth from countless performances,  are scattered amongst the rough-hewn stone, and the vibrant colours of the once-pristine stage canvas have faded, leaving behind a muted palette of faded blues and greens.  The surrounding landscape is harsh yet breathtaking; wildflowers bloom in defiance of the rocky terrain, and the echoes of the wind carry tales of forgotten kings and mythical beasts.  A persistent drizzle, common in the foothills, creates a backdrop of misty ambiance, lending an almost ethereal quality to the brooding atmosphere.
