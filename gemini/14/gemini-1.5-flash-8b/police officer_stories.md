Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct station, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's thoughts.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the scattered files and half-eaten takeout containers that testified to the all-nighter sheâ€™d endured.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of stale coffee and the ever-present scent of despair, a familiar companion in the gritty, industrial heart of  Port Blackwood.

Port Blackwood, a city built on the rust-eaten bones of forgotten factories and choked by a perpetual haze of smog, sprawled across the flat plains like a wounded beast.  The towering silos of the abandoned grain terminal, their rusted metal sides etched with the ghosts of forgotten harvests, loomed over the dilapidated housing projects that clung to the city's edge like barnacles on a ship.  Neon signs flickered erratically, their sickly yellow light bleeding into the oppressive twilight, casting the city in a sickly, unsettling glow.  This was the precinct that Izzy knew, the place where hope felt as fragile as a single raindrop on a windowpane.
