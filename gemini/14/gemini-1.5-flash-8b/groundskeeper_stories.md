The chill wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of Blackwood Manor.  Rain, driven by the wind, hammered against the slate roofs, a ceaseless tattoo that echoed the frantic drumming in Elara Blackwood's ears.  Elara Blackwood, groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, shivered, tucking the frayed edges of her worn wool coat tighter around her.  The manor, a looming gothic masterpiece of grey stone, seemed to absorb the storm, its many windows like vacant, dark eyes staring out into the tempestuous night.  This wasn't just any autumnal downpour; this was the kind that spoke of encroaching winter, a winter that held secrets as old and deep as the manor itself.

The grounds, usually a tapestry of autumnal colours, were now a muted palette of grey and brown, the once vibrant foliage flattened and sodden under the relentless downpour.  Leafy pathways, usually crisp and clear, were now treacherous, slick with mud and glistening with rainwater.  Elara, familiar with every inch of the sprawling estate, navigated the treacherous terrain with practiced ease, her well-worn boots making almost no sound on the saturated earth.  Each step was a measured, deliberate dance around the hidden hazards â€“ fallen branches, treacherous patches of ice. This was her territory, her responsibility.  And tonight, it felt as if the very grounds were holding their breath, awaiting something, or someone.
