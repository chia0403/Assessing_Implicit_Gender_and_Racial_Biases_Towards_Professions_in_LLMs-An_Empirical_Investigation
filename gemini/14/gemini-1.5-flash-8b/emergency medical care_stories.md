The flickering fluorescent lights of the Emergency Room hummed a discordant symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Petrova's heart.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the antiseptic smell of disinfectant, hung heavy in the sterile, yet somehow claustrophobic, space.  Outside, the city roared, a restless beast agitated by the approaching storm.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already chaotic scene within. Amelia, a paramedic with the rapid response unit for five years, had seen more than her share of trauma.  Tonight, however, the weight on her shoulders felt different, a palpable pressure that had nothing to do with the adrenaline coursing through her veins. It had to do with the unspoken narrative woven into the chaos.  The ER, a temporary shelter from the storm outside, was not just a place of healing, but a reflection of the brokenness in the world around it.
