The flickering fluorescent lights of the data center hummed, a low, insistent drone that had become Alistair Finch’s lullaby.  He was buried beneath a mountain of server logs, a veritable Everest of ones and zeros, each painstakingly analyzed for any deviation from the norm.  Alistair Finch, systems analyst at GlobalCorp, was renowned for his meticulous attention to detail, his ability to predict system failures before they occurred.  But tonight, even his finely-tuned algorithms were failing him.

The setting was the cavernous server room of GlobalCorp, a sprawling metropolis of interconnected metal boxes and humming wires.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the polished metal surfaces and swirling into the air like miniature specters. The air itself was thick with the cloying smell of burnt circuits and ozone.  Rows upon rows of servers, stretching as far as the eye could see, resembled a futuristic graveyard.  The only other presence was the faint rhythmic click-clack of Alistair’s keyboard, a lonely counterpoint to the relentless hum of the machines.  He’d been hunched over his console for twelve hours straight, the dark circles under his eyes a testament to his dedication.  Outside the thick reinforced glass walls, the city pulsed with life, oblivious to the silent battle raging within the bowels of the corporation.  The only sound, besides the hum and the clicks, was the steady, almost imperceptible, ticking of a small, antique clock on his desk, a relic from a life before the relentless demands of the digital age.
