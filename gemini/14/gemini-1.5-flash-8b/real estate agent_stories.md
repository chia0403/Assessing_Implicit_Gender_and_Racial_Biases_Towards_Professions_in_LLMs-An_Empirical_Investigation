The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestone street.  London, a city perpetually shrouded in a melancholic haze of fog and anticipation, pressed in on her.  The scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes hung heavy in the air, a tangible weight mirroring the pressure building inside her.  She clutched her worn leather briefcase, the familiar weight a comforting anchor in the chaos.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, the deal to save the historic Blackwood Manor, a property steeped in scandal and whispered secrets, would either fall into place or crumble to dust.

Amelia, a third-generation real estate agent with the unassuming name of Hawthorne Realty, was accustomed to navigating the labyrinthine world of London property. But Blackwood Manor held a particular allure, a dark siren’s song that had drawn her in against her better judgment.  Located on the crest of a hill overlooking the city, the manor's imposing facade, scarred with time and tragedy, seemed to mock the city's relentless rhythm. Locals referred to it, simply, as "The Cursed House."  Stories whispered around fireplaces and in the hushed tones of afternoon tea parties spoke of ghostly apparitions, unresolved tragedies, and a fortune hidden somewhere within its crumbling walls.  Amelia, however, preferred to look past the folklore and focus on the undeniable potential.  Tonight, she would either prove the skeptics wrong, or be swept away by the legend herself.
