The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, sickly yellow by years of lukewarm water and dried tea, mirrored the perpetual hum of unease in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windowpanes, cast long, skeletal shadows across the tiny, cluttered kitchen of her modest Victorian home.  A single, wilting geranium in a chipped terracotta pot clung precariously to life on the windowsill, a stark contrast to the vibrant turmoil brewing within her.
