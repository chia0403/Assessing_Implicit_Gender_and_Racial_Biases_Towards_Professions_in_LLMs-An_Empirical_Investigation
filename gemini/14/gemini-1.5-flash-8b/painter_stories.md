The biting wind whipped at Elara Nightingale's canvas, a frantic dance mirroring the turmoil within her.  Grey skies, mirroring the churning emotions in her soul, clawed at the weathered wooden planks of the old studio perched precariously on the cliff's edge.

Each wave, a monstrous finger, seemed to grasp at the jagged coastline, threatening to swallow the fragile studio whole.  This was her sanctuary, her tormentor, her muse.
