The humid air hung thick and heavy in the galley of the Boeing 787, clinging to the shimmering stainless steel surfaces like a second skin.  Outside, the sprawling expanse of the Pacific Ocean, a bruised indigo under the late afternoon sun, blurred into the hazy horizon.  Amelia "Amy" Carter, her name etched in faded gold lettering on the nametag clipped to her uniform, wiped down the counter, the rhythmic swish of the microfiber cloth a counterpoint to the low hum of the plane's systems.  The scent of jasmine tea, a subtle but persistent aroma carried on the recycled air, mingled with the metallic tang of cleaning solution.  Amy's small, tired eyes scanned the empty workstations, each one a silent testament to the journey that was winding down. Tonight's flight, from Honolulu to Los Angeles, was a slow one, a gentle descent into the quietude of the pre-dawn hours.  Her route had been a predictable, almost monotonous loop for the past six months, a life-cycle of take-offs and landings, of smiles and polite conversations, and the ever-present hum of the aircraft.  The monotony had settled into Amy like the humid air, almost unnoticeable until you were truly aware of it. But tonight, something was different.
