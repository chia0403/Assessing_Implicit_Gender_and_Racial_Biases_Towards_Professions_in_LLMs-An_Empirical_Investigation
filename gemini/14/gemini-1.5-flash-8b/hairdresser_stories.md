The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky beige from years of spilled bleach and conditioner, mirrored the muted grey of the sky outside.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Nightingale's tiny salon, "The Whispering Shear."  The rhythmic drumming, a constant companion to the clinking of shears and the soft sighs of clients, amplified the damp chill that seeped through the drafty door.  Amelia, her fingers still slick with the residue of a recent henna application, surveyed the salon's sparse furnishings:  a worn mahogany armchair, a stack of magazines piled high with faded illustrations of sculpted hairdos, and a single, dusty floral arrangement perched precariously on a chipped side table.  The air, thick with the heady scent of rosemary oil and lavender, seemed to cling to everything, a comforting blanket in this otherwise bleak afternoon.
