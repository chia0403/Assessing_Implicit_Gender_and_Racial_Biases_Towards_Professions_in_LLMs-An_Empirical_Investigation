The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey-green from years of scrubbing and neglect, felt strangely warm beneath Elara Blackwood's fingertips.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of the sprawling, Victorian manor, illuminating a constellation of cobwebs that clung to the faded wallpaper like spectral, whispering figures.  Elara, her uniform – a faded, starched blue dress – draped over her frame like a second skin, adjusted the worn brass handle of the drain, the metallic tang of rust filling her nostrils.  The house, known locally as Blackwood Manor, hummed with an unseen energy, a low thrum that resonated deep within the ancient walls.  It was a symphony of whispers and sighs, a chorus of unspoken secrets echoing through its shadowed corridors.

Elara, thirty-two years old, felt a familiar tug of unease. This house, despite her years of meticulous cleaning and hushed reverence, still whispered to her of things unseen, unspoken.  Today, that whisper was different. A new note, sharp and insistent, had been added to the old song.
