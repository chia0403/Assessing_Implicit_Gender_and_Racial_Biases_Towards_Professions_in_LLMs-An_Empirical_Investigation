The wind, a relentless, whispering coyote, clawed at the corrugated iron roof of the Silas Blackwood Ranch, a lonely outpost nestled in the heart of the Dust Bowl.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and despair, danced across the parched earth, swirling around the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the dilapidated barn.  Fifty-year-old Silas Blackwood, weathered like the cracked, sun-baked earth beneath his boots, squinted at the bruised, grey sky.  A hawk, its wings a blur of shadow against the ominous clouds, circled overhead, its piercing cry the only sound that broke the suffocating silence.  This was the year the whispers of the drought became screams.  The cattle, Silas's livelihood, were dwindling.  Hope, like the dwindling water in the wells, was nearly gone.
