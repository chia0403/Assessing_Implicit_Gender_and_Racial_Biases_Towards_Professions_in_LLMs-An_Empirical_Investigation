The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the narrow cobbled street.  The scent of roasting chestnuts, a familiar comfort in the chilly air, struggled to pierce the relentless roar of the city traffic, a symphony of horns and clanging trams.  Above, the gothic spires of St.  Michael's Cathedral pierced the leaden sky, their silhouettes stark against the gathering twilight.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a keen eye for detail and a practiced hand, paused at the edge of the throng, her gaze drawn to a figure slumped against a weathered brick wall.  He was young, no older than twenty, clad in threadbare clothes that seemed to absorb the chill of the night.  He clutched a worn leather-bound book, its pages almost as faded as the faded paint on the building.  Something about his posture, the way his shoulders hunched inwards, felt different, deeply pained.  She had seen this look before, the look of silent struggle etched on the faces of her patients.  Driven by an intuition that often surprised her, she pushed through the crowd, the rhythmic beat of her own footsteps a counterpoint to the city's cacophony.
