The biting wind whipped Amelia Petrova's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling ruins of Pompeii.  Dust motes danced in the pale winter sun, illuminating the skeletal remains of a once-bustling city, now a silent testament to the fury of Vesuvius.  Amelia, a tour guide with eyes that held the colour of a Mediterranean sunset, adjusted her worn leather satchel, a familiar weight settling against her shoulder.  Today's group, a gaggle of boisterous American tourists, were clamouring for her attention, their chatter a low hum against the roar of the wind.  She'd been leading tours of this UNESCO World Heritage site for over a decade, and yet, each visit felt like a new discovery, a rediscovery of the lives lost and the stories whispered in the petrified air.  The city's palpable silence, a stark contrast to the vibrant throngs of people that she guided, often felt more present than any human voice.
