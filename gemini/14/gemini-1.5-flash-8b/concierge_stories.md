The rain hammered against the leaded glass of the grand foyer, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic drumming in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s chest.  The scent of lilies, usually a calming balm in the opulent Maison Dubois, felt cloying, suffocating.  Tonight, it clung to the air like a shroud.  Her crisp, starched uniform, usually a beacon of composure, felt damp and heavy against her skin.  Elara, concierge of the Maison Dubois, the most exclusive hotel in Paris, found herself utterly out of her depth.

**Setting:**

The Maison Dubois, a Parisian hotel steeped in history and whispered secrets.  Crystal chandeliers, impossibly tall, illuminated the cavernous foyer, casting an ethereal glow on swirling patterns of tapestries and gleaming marble floors.  The air hummed with the low murmur of hushed conversations and the distant clinking of silverware in opulent dining rooms.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of Parisian sophistication was muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness, a premonition of something amiss.  The heavy oak doors, normally polished to a reflective sheen, seemed to absorb the light, making the grand hall feel even more profound, almost oppressive. Outside, the Parisian evening was drenched in rain, adding to the overall sense of foreboding.
