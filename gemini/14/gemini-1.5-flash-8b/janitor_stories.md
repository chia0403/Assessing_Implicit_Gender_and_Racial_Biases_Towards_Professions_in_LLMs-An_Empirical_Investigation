The flickering fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Institute hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's nightly ritual.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating the labyrinthine corridors of the sprawling, gothic-style building.  Rain lashed against the ancient, leaded windows, a mournful dirge that echoed through the empty halls. Elias, a janitor whose uniform – a faded navy blue polo shirt and patched khaki trousers – blended seamlessly with the muted greys and blacks of the Institute’s interior, pushed a worn metal cart laden with cleaning supplies.  His hands, calloused and speckled with grime, expertly maneuvered the cart down the polished but scarred wooden floor.  He was a shadow, a silent presence in a world of scholarly whispers and hushed pronouncements.  Tonight, though, something felt different.  The air hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrumming, and the rain seemed to pick up its tempo, pounding a frantic rhythm against the windows.  The Blackwood Institute, a bastion of academic rigor and intellectual pursuit, felt profoundly, unnervingly alive.
