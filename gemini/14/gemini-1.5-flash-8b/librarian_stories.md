The chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring vacantly, sat perched precariously on the edge of the antique book cart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the dusty window of the Whispering Pines Library.  Amelia Blackwood, her auburn braid snagged on a stray thread of tapestry, sighed, a sound barely audible above the rustle of turning pages and the rhythmic *click-clack* of her heels against the polished wooden floor.  She was, as always, late.

The library, a grand Victorian structure nestled amidst whispering pines and ancient oaks, held a peculiar stillness.  The scent of aged paper and cedarwood hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, earthy aroma of the surrounding forest.  Sunlight, fractured by stained-glass windows depicting scenes of mythical creatures and forgotten heroes, dappled the rows of meticulously organized bookshelves, casting long shadows that seemed to stretch into the very heart of the building.  Sunlight didn't reach the back rooms, only whispering shadows that held the secrets of forgotten stories.  Amelia, however, preferred the quiet hum of the stacks, the hushed reverence of the readers, and the comforting weight of the books. She was a librarian, through and through.  Today, however, her thoughts were elsewhere, lingering on the strange events that had plagued the quiet town since the last full moon.
