The chill seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, not from the November air, but from the palpable dread hanging in the butcher shop, "The Cleaver's Edge."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating the glistening crimson stain on the worn butcher block.  A stain that shouldn't be there.  Barty, a man weathered like the oak tables that lined his shop, stared at the macabre mark.  It was the color of a freshly spilled forest, a colour he knew all too well, yet this one feltâ€¦different.  The scent of blood mingled with the sharper tang of something metallic, something akin to fear itself.


The setting was a cramped, dimly lit butcher shop nestled on the edge of Blackwood, a small, perpetually overcast town nestled between the whispering pines and the brooding moor. The shop, its walls lined with rows of gleaming knives and rusty hooks, smelled constantly of blood and the faintly sweet aroma of cured meats.  Old, almost forgotten recipes hung on the shop's rough, wooden walls, faded with age and time, their faded inks barely legible amidst the grim surroundings.  A flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of the uneven floor, illuminating the glint of steel on a nearby cleaver. The windows, frost-covered, provided a glimpse of the world outside, a world steeped in the heavy stillness of a coming winter.
