The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the frost-covered Citadel, stinging Sergeant Alistair Thorne's cheeks.  The air, thin and frigid, hung heavy with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic, something…unnatural.  He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the premonition that settled in his gut like a lead weight.  The Citadel, normally a bastion of serene, if austere, order, felt…strained.  Every shadowed crevice seemed to hold a silent, expectant menace.

The Citadel, a towering structure of obsidian and glacial ice, was perched atop a jagged peak, its formidable walls mirroring the jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains.  Thousands of years of accumulated snow and ice had sculpted the landscape into a stark, unforgiving panorama.  Only the occasional flickering torchlight from the guard towers pierced the perpetual twilight.  A network of tunnels, carved into the very rock face, snaked beneath the Citadel, their entrances obscured by drifts of frozen snow.  Inside these tunnels, whispers of ancient prophecies and long-forgotten rituals echoed on the chill winds, intertwining with the rhythmic thud of boots and the rasping commands of officers.  Alistair, a seasoned guard, had seen many a strange storm brew in these icy heights, but this one felt different.  It felt...dangerous.
