The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fix-It Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a constant, unwelcome companion, dripped from the eaves and pooled in the cracked pavement.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber of unimpeachable, if somewhat grubby, reputation.  Barty, his waterproofed canvas jacket clinging to his frame, hunched over a tangled mess of pipes beneath a sagging fire escape.  He swore, a guttural sound lost in the rhythmic drumming of the rain, as a particularly stubborn copper joint refused to yield.  His calloused hands, stained with rust and grease, worked with a frantic urgency, the flickering neon light reflecting in the sweat beading on his brow.  This was no ordinary clog; this was a nightmare.  The building, a crumbling tenement known as the "Ironclad," had a history as long and twisting as its labyrinthine plumbing, and tonight, it was demanding its due.
