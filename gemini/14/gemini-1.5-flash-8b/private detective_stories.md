Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated "Rusty Mug" diner, a relentless percussion that echoed the pounding in Amelia "Ace" Kensington's temples.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, smoky room.  Outside, the neon sign of the "Midnight Moon Motel" flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked parking lot.  This was Ace's turf, the desolate outskirts of Havenwood, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the forgotten past.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a reputation sharper than a rusty hunting knife, nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee, her gaze fixed on the flickering sign.

**Setting:** The Rusty Mug Diner, a ramshackle establishment on the edge of Havenwood, a small, forgotten town on the outskirts of a sprawling, forgotten forest.  The atmosphere is damp, gritty, and infused with the desperation of the town's inhabitants.  The diner itself is a microcosm of Havenwood's state, with peeling paint, mismatched furniture, and the pervasive aroma of neglect.  The Midnight Moon Motel, a faded beacon of a bygone era, stands as a stark contrast, its faded glamour juxtaposed with the bleak reality of the surrounding area.
