The biting wind, a relentless, icy rasp, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Sawtooth Mountains, stinging Elias Blackwood's cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the scent of pine needles and damp earth a meagre comfort against the bone-deep cold.  The year was 1889, and the timberline, a jagged, unforgiving frontier where the sky scraped the earth, was Eliasâ€™s domain.  He wasn't just a logger; he was a master of the forest, a man who understood its rhythms and secrets, a man who lived on the edge of both survival and wilderness.  Sunlight, when it dared to pierce the grey curtain of clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swaying pines, creating a stark, almost dreamlike atmosphere.  The valley, nestled between the towering peaks, was a tapestry of shadowed forests, a world of murmuring streams and the constant, low groan of the ever-present wind.  Elias knew this landscape intimately, the way a sailor knows the sea. Every creak of the timber, every rustle of leaves, every whisper of the wind held a message he could understand.  Today, though, the whispers were particularly urgent.
