The biting wind, carrying the scent of salt and something indefinably wild, whipped against Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's cheeks as she navigated the narrow, cobbled lane. The sky above Port Abernathy was a bruised plum color, threatening snow. Sea gulls wheeled and cried overhead, their mournful calls echoing off the weathered stone buildings that huddled together for warmth.

Ainsworth Veterinary Clinic, perched precariously on a clifftop overlooking the churning North Sea, was more than just a practice; it was a legacy. And tonight, Ellie had a bad feeling this legacy was about to be tested.
