## Story Opening:

The hum of the fluorescent lights was a persistent, almost sentient, drone in the otherwise quiet office of the National Historical Preservation Society of Iowa. Mildred Abernathy straightened the stack of brochures on the reception desk, her fingers smoothing the glossy paper showcasing the Grant Wood farm. It was Tuesday, which meant the phone would likely be silent until after lunch, giving her a precious hour or two to… well, to do what exactly? 

Mildred sighed, a sound lost in the hum. The endless filing, the repetitive typing, the relentless ordering of office supplies – it all felt like being buried alive under a mountain of beige paperwork. She yearned for something more, something… *interesting*. Something to pull her away from the beige existence of her desk at the National Historical Preservation Society, even for just a little while. She idly tapped her pen against a stack of invoices, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the monotone hum. Perhaps she should finally tackle that historical novel her grandmother had sworn was true, the one about a cursed locket and a missing heiress. Anything, truly, was better than another day spent wrestling with the complexities of postage rates.
