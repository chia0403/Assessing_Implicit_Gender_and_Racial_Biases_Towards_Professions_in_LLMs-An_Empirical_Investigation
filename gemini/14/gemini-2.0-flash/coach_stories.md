## Opening:

The squeak of rubber on polished hardwood echoed through the cavernous gymnasium, a soundtrack Amelia Rose Thorne knew as intimately as her own heartbeat. Outside, a November rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of Northwood High, blurring the already grey sky into a watercolor wash. Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of sweat, ambition, and the faint, lingering aroma of industrial floor cleaner. Amelia stopped dribbling the basketball, the rhythmic thump falling silent as she focused on the two figures struggling across the court.

"Come on, Diaz! Drive to the basket! Pretend it's your prom date and you haven't seen him in three weeks!" Amelia barked, her voice laced with the weary exasperation only a high school basketball coach could possess. Diaz, a lanky sophomore with more heart than coordination, stumbled, the ball slipping from his grasp and rolling harmlessly into the bleachers.

Amelia sighed. This was going to be a long season.

## Setting:

Northwood High was a brick behemoth, built in the heyday of the townâ€™s coal mining boom, a time that felt both impossibly distant and painfully recent. The school stood on a hill overlooking the small town of Crestwood, Pennsylvania, its shadow looming large over the dwindling strip of family-owned businesses and weathered houses that lined Main Street. Crestwood, like so many other once-thriving industrial towns in the Rust Belt, was clinging to life, its glory days faded like a worn photograph.

Northwood High was a reflection of the town itself: sturdy but showing its age, filled with a mixture of resilience and resignation. The gymnasium, built in the 1950s, was the school's pride. Its varnished floor gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, and faded banners celebrating past championships hung from the rafters, whispering tales of bygone victories. It was a place where the hopes of a town, starved for something to celebrate, rested squarely on the shoulders of a group of teenagers, guided by Amelia Rose Thorne.
