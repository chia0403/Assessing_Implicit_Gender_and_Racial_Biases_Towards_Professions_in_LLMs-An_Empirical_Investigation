**Opening:**

The scent of stale lilac potpourri and desperation hung thick in the air of 14 Willow Creek Drive. Agnes Pettigrew, a scent she'd come to recognize as the hallmark of a property that had languished on the market far too long. Eleanor Vance felt a familiar prickle of annoyance. She hated houses like these, houses that sucked the life out of even the most optimistic buyer. But duty called, and Eleanor Vance, Real Estate Agent Extraordinaire, was nothing if not dutiful.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance found herself standing on the threshold of 14 Willow Creek Drive in the sleepy, picturesque town of Havenwood Falls, nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains. Havenwood Falls was the kind of place where gossip traveled faster than the local bus and everyone knew your grandmaâ€™s maiden name. The houses were a mix of charming Victorian homes that had seen better days and newer, cookie-cutter developments trying desperately to blend in with the historic landscape.

14 Willow Creek Drive was a Victorian. Once a stately beauty, it was now faded and forlorn. The paint peeled in sun-blistered ribbons, revealing patches of grey wood beneath. The once vibrant rose bushes that lined the porch were now thorny, overgrown monsters, clawing at the crumbling foundation. Inside, the air was heavy with the aforementioned lilac and dust. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-covered windows, leaving the interior in a perpetual state of twilight. The floors creaked ominously with every step, and a distinct chill permeated the air, even on this relatively mild October afternoon. It was, in a word, depressing.
