## Story Opening:

The biting wind howled a mournful dirge down Willow Creek, rattling the frosted windows of "Arthur Finch's Finest Cuts." Inside, Arthur Finch, his thick fingers stained a familiar crimson despite repeated scrubbings, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. Sawdust danced in the weak morning light filtering through the grime-streaked glass, catching on the pristine, albeit chilling, rows of neatly displayed meat.

Arthur, a man built like a seasoned oak, with a face weathered by decades of northern winters and a surprisingly gentle glint in his hazel eyes, always felt a pang of satisfaction gazing at his work. Each cut, from the perfectly trimmed sirloins to the meticulously spiced sausages, was a testament to his dedication. Yet, today, the familiar comfort was overshadowed by a nagging unease. The air felt heavy, not just with the lingering aroma of smoked bacon, but with somethingâ€¦else. Something Arthur couldn't quite place, something that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck.

He dismissed it with a snort, blaming the restless sleep brought on by his aching hip and the dwindling supply of aged cheddar at home. Time to focus on the day ahead. Time to prepare for the influx of hungry townsfolk, eager for a hearty stew to ward off the encroaching frost.

## Setting:

**Arthur Finch's Finest Cuts**, nestled in the heart of the small, isolated town of Willow Creek, Montana, is more than just a butcher shop. It's a cornerstone of the community. The building itself is a sturdy, single-story structure built from weathered timber, a testament to the hardiness of the region. Its exterior, painted a faded burgundy, is adorned with hand-painted lettering announcing its wares in bold, slightly crooked font.

Inside, the shop is a symphony of textures and smells. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sawdust, worn smooth by years of foot traffic. Behind the long, glass-fronted counter, a gleaming array of knives and cleavers hangs on a magnetic strip, their polished surfaces reflecting the fluorescent lights overhead. The air is thick with the mingled scents of fresh meat, smoked ham, and the sharp tang of brine.

To the rear of the shop lies the "back room," a maze of stainless steel tables, meat grinders, and walk-in freezers. This is Arthur's sanctuary, the place where he transforms raw ingredients into culinary masterpieces. It's a place of focused labor, of precise cuts and careful measurements, and a place where Arthur feels truly at peace, even on days like today, when a shadow of unease lingered in the air. Willow Creek itself, a town clinging to the edge of the wilderness, is ever-present just outside the door.
