## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Eleanor Miriam Vance stared out at the churning Atlantic, the wind whipping strands of her auburn hair across her face. The spray tasted of salt and disappointment. Her fingers, meticulously manicured as always, tightened around the lukewarm coffee cup. "Another one," she muttered, the words lost in the crashing waves. Another client gone, another carefully crafted meal plan tossed aside, another well-intentioned lecture about the dangers of fad diets falling on deaf ears. Eleanor Miriam Vance, registered dietitian, was beginning to think she should have taken that pottery class instead. At least then she'd have something tangible to show for her efforts, something that wouldn't crumble the moment someone saw a celebrity endorse the latest grapefruit-and-kale cleanse.

**Setting:**

The small, coastal town of Seabrook Cove, Maine. Picture postcard perfect, with its weathered clapboard houses painted in shades of robin's egg blue and daffodil yellow, its charming lighthouse perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, and its perpetually buzzing harbor filled with lobster boats. Eleanor’s office, "Nourish & Thrive," was located above Mrs. Higgins’ iconic "Knit & Nibble" yarn shop on Main Street. The scent of wool and freshly baked blueberry muffins permeated the building, a comforting aroma that ironically clashed with Eleanor's mission to promote healthy eating habits in a town obsessed with lobster rolls and whoopie pies. The constant influx of tourists, eager for an authentic New England experience (read: excessive butter and fried everything), only amplified the challenge. Despite its idyllic appearance, Seabrook Cove held its fair share of dietary demons, lurking beneath the surface of its charming façade.
