The fluorescent hum of the Accu-Draw Mobile Phlebotomy van vibrated in rhythm with the frantic thumping in Elara Beatrice Finchâ€™s chest. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the dilapidated row houses that lined the streets of the Ironbound district in Newark, New Jersey. Inside, the air smelled faintly of antiseptic wipes and stale coffee, a familiar scent that usually soothed her, but today did little to quell her unease.

Elara adjusted the strap of her oversized messenger bag, crammed with Vacutainers, butterfly needles, and emergency gauze, and nervously smoothed down the front of her navy scrubs. The Ironbound wasn't inherently dangerous, not really. It was a vibrant, bustling neighborhood, alive with the sounds of Portuguese being spoken on every corner and the tantalizing aroma of grilling churrasco. But today, the atmosphere felt different, thicker, heavier somehow.

Her patient, listed as Mr. Silas Blackwood, resided in a building that looked like it hadn't seen a fresh coat of paint since the Truman administration. Peeling lead paint curled away from the brick facade like brittle, decaying leaves. The iron gate guarding the entrance creaked ominously in the light breeze, a sound that echoed the apprehension twisting in Elara's stomach. She hoped this wouldn't be a long day. She hoped, with a fervor that surprised even her, that Mr. Silas Blackwood was just an elderly gentleman who needed a routine blood draw and not something... else.
