## Story Opening:

The persistent thrum of the Boeing 777 vibrated through Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s bones, a familiar lullaby after ten years in the sky. Sweat beaded on her brow as she navigated the crowded aisle, offering a practiced smile and a tiny bottle of complimentary water to a harried-looking mother wrestling with a squirming toddler. Flight 804 from London Heathrow to New York JFK was always a beast – crammed with businessmen, families desperate for American sunshine, and the occasional celebrity hiding behind oversized sunglasses. But today, the air felt different, thick with a tension she couldn't quite place. It wasn't turbulence; Amelia could feel that in her teeth. This was something…else. A subtle tremor in the collective psyche of 300-plus passengers, a premonition whispering in her ear: *Something’s about to happen.*

## Setting:

The story begins approximately thirty minutes into the aforementioned transatlantic flight, Flight 804 from London Heathrow Airport to New York JFK. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER, is currently cruising at 35,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. The interior of the plane is a mix of muted blues and greys, designed to soothe but currently adding to the oppressive atmosphere. The overhead bins are packed tight, and the cabin is dimly lit, allowing passengers to settle in for the long haul. The galley, a cramped but well-organized space at the rear of the plane, is where Amelia Grace Hawthorne spends most of her time, a sanctuary of stainless steel and coffee fumes amidst the chaos. Small windows offer glimpses of the vast, indifferent ocean below, a constant reminder of the vulnerability of their metallic vessel suspended between two continents. The temperature is carefully maintained, but a faint chill seems to emanate from the unseen depths of the plane, clinging to the edges of the flight attendants' smiles and the unspoken anxieties of the passengers.
