**Opening:**

The bell above the door of "The Healing Hand" chimed, a cheerful sound that did little to lift the weight settling on Miriam Eleanor Ainsworth's shoulders. She barely glanced up from the prescription she was deciphering, a frantic scrawl that looked less like handwriting and more like a seismograph reading during a particularly violent tremor. Another afternoon, another patient, another dose of worry. But Miriam, a creature of routine and unwavering dedication, pushed it aside. This was her sanctuary, her calling, and even the looming threat of corporate acquisitions couldn't dim the quiet satisfaction she found in helping people.

**Setting:**

"The Healing Hand," Miriam's pharmacy, stood proudly on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint New England town seemingly untouched by the relentless march of progress. The building itself was a two-story brick structure, its facade softened by climbing ivy and window boxes overflowing with geraniums. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting aroma of beeswax polish, chamomile tea, and faintly, that unmistakable medicinal tang of the dispensary in the back. Wooden shelves lined the walls, stocked with neatly arranged bottles and boxes of medications, vitamins, and homeopathic remedies. A vintage cash register, a relic from her grandfather's time, sat on the counter, its brass worn smooth from years of use. A small seating area near the front offered worn, floral-patterned armchairs and a small table littered with local newspapers and pamphlets on health and wellness. The whole place exuded a sense of warmth and trust, a welcome contrast to the sterile, impersonal feel of the chain pharmacies that were slowly encroaching on Havenwood's borders.
