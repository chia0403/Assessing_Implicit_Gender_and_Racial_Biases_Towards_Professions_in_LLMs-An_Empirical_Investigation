The fluorescent lights of "Good Food Grocers" hummed a monotonous tune, the soundtrack to Amelia Rose Cartwright's Thursday evening. Amelia, her nametag slightly askew and hair pulled back in a messy bun, scanned a box of "Yummy Bites" granola bars with practiced ease. Another customer, another dollar closer to escaping this purgatory of overflowing shopping carts and demanding coupon enthusiasts.

The setting was, in short, beige. Beige walls, beige floors, even the uniforms were a depressing, faded beige. "Good Food Grocers" on Elm Street prided itself on its affordability, not its aesthetic appeal. The air hung thick with the combined scents of wilted lettuce from the produce section and the overly-sweet aroma of the bakery goods wafting from the back. Outside, Elm Street was a typical small-town thoroughfare, lined with brick buildings that had seen better days, a laundromat, a boarded-up antique store, and the ever-present rumble of a passing truck disrupting the quiet hum of everyday life. Amelia could practically taste the dust of Elm Street, clinging to everything like a persistent reminder of her own stagnant existence.
