The hum of the server room was a constant lullaby to Dr. Eleanor Vance. It wasn't a pleasant lullaby, mind you, more of a persistent, mechanical drone that vibrated through the floor and tickled the soles of her feet, even through her sensible lab shoes. But after five years of dedicating her life to Project Chimera, sheâ€™d grown almost fond of it. Tonight, however, the hum felt like a taunt. Tonight, it seemed to be mocking her lack of progress.

Eleanor, hair pulled back in a messy bun that defied gravity, stood before the wall of screens, the glow illuminating the sharp angles of her face. She traced the data streams with a weary finger, the lines a chaotic symphony of numbers and symbols that spoke to a language only she truly understood. Outside, the Alaskan winter raged, howling winds and driving snow obscuring the remote research station, nestled deep within the Chugach Mountains. The facility, built on a forgotten Cold War bunker, was officially known as the Aurora Bioresearch Center, but Eleanor and her small team affectionately referred to it as "The Fortress of Solitude." It felt fitting, given the isolation and the secret, potentially groundbreaking research that went on within its reinforced walls. Tonight, however, it just felt lonely.
