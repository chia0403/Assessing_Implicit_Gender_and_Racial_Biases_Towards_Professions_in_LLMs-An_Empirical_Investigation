Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a salesperson named:

**Story Opening:**

The stale air of the office cafeteria hung heavy with the scent of lukewarm coffee and burnt toast, a symphony of mediocrity that perfectly mirrored Richard Alexander Hardingâ€™s morning. He stared blankly at the swirling brown depths of his mug, the liquid reflecting the lines etched deeper into his forehead with each passing quarter. Three months. Three months he'd been hovering just below quota. Three months of empty promises and "not right nows" echoing in his ears like a mocking chorus. He'd even tried the damn self-help CDs Brenda from accounting swore by, but even Tony Robbins couldn't convince Mrs. Gable that she needed the Platinum Package of data management solutions. Today, though, today had to be different. Today, Richard Alexander Harding was closing a deal. Or he was going to lose his damn mind.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the sterile, fluorescent-lit offices of "Synergy Solutions," a mid-sized data management software company in the sprawling suburban office park of Schaumburg, Illinois. The decor is a bland tapestry of corporate grey and muted blues, punctuated by the occasional motivational poster featuring stock photos of mountain peaks and slogans about teamwork. Richard's specific workspace consists of a cubicle adorned with faded family photos and a calendar perpetually stuck on the month of July. Beyond the office building, glimpses of the surrounding landscape reveal a monotonous expanse of asphalt parking lots, strip malls, and the ever-present hum of the nearby highway, a constant reminder of the relentless pace of modern life and the pressure to keep up. Occasional scenes might also take place at potential clients' offices, representing a stark contrast - from the sleek modernity of tech startups to the cluttered, old-fashioned spaces of established businesses.
