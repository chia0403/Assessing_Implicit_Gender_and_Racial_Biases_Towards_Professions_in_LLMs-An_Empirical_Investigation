## The Scent of Petrichor and Secrets

The scent of petrichor, that earthy perfume released by rain on dry soil, clung thick in the air. Dew-kissed blades of grass sparkled emerald in the nascent dawn, clinging to the final remnants of the overnight storm. For a moment, all was still, a hushed expectancy settling over the manicured lawns of Whisperwind Estates, the wealthy enclave nestled against the rolling hills of Oakhaven.

Then, the whir of a small engine broke the silence.

Driving a battered, lime-green pickup truck with "Grounds for Improvement" emblazoned on the side in faded yellow lettering, arrived Elias Thorne, the resident landscaper for Whisperwind Estates. Elias, all six-foot-two of him, with hands calloused from years of coaxing life from the earth and hair the color of sun-baked clay, killed the engine. He stretched, popping a few vertebrae, and took a deep breath, inhaling the rejuvenated air. He loved this time of day, before the world fully awakened and the demands of perfectly sculpted hedges and pristine flowerbeds began to weigh on him.

But today, there was something else hanging in the air besides the petrichor. A subtle unease. A feeling that the silence wasn't quite natural, that something beneath the surface was about to erupt. And in a place like Whisperwind Estates, where appearances were everything and secrets were currency, eruptions could be quiteâ€¦ messy.
