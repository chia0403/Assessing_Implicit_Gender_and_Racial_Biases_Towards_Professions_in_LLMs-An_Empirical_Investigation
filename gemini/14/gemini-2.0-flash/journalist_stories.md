The stale, metallic tang of burnt coffee hung in the air, a persistent olfactory reminder of the long night that had just bled into dawn. Amelia Grace Davies rubbed the grit from her eyes and stared at the flickering cursor on her laptop screen, a blinking testament to her writer’s block. The words felt like sludge in her brain, heavy and unwilling to move.

Amelia was holed up in the ‘Reading Room’ of the dilapidated Lighthouse Keepers Inn, a place that had seen better days – and probably better stories. The Inn perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean, on the tiny, barely-populated island of Inis Mara, just off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland. The room itself was a cavernous space, lined with dusty, leather-bound books that had long since stopped being read. Salt-laced air seeped through the ill-fitting window frames, and the mournful cry of gulls echoed incessantly outside. The only other occupant was a half-eaten scone and a precarious tower of research papers teetering beside her keyboard.

Amelia, a seasoned investigative journalist for the *Dublin Chronicle*, had come to Inis Mara seeking a respite from the relentless city grind and the aftermath of a particularly bruising exposé. She’d hoped the isolation and the raw beauty of the island would clear her head and allow her to finally tackle the biography she’d been commissioned to write – the life story of legendary, but notoriously reclusive, Irish poet, Seamus O’Malley, who called Inis Mara home. But so far, the silence had only amplified the noise in her mind, and the waves crashing against the cliffs seemed to mock her creative inertia. All she had to show for her week on the island was a growing collection of empty coffee cups and a gnawing feeling that she was on the verge of something… but whether it was a breakthrough or a breakdown, she couldn't be sure.
