The aroma of decaying leaves and damp wool clung to the air as Professor Alistair Leopold Finch meticulously re-shelved a particularly gruesome tome on ritualistic sacrifice. Outside, a November fog had swallowed the ancient campus of Blackwood University whole, reducing the imposing Gothic architecture to ghostly silhouettes. Alistair hated November. Not just for the oppressive gloom that mirrored his mood, but for the way it amplified the already unsettling atmosphere of Blackwood, a place that felt permanently steeped in forgotten secrets and whispered histories. The library, a vast, echoing space filled with towering shelves and the silent ghosts of countless scholars, was his sanctuary, his refuge from the world outside. But even here, tonight, a prickling unease lingered, a feeling that something was amiss, something more than just the usual November dread. He smoothed his tweed jacket, the familiar texture a small comfort, and glanced at the grandfather clock looming in the corner. 11:47 PM. Far too late to still be here. He should head back to his small, cluttered cottage on the edge of the Blackwood Forest. But the thought of facing the fog-choked darkness, the rustling whispers of the unseen woods, held no appeal. He reached for another book, something innocuous this time, a travelogue perhaps, anything to distract him from the growing sense of unease.
