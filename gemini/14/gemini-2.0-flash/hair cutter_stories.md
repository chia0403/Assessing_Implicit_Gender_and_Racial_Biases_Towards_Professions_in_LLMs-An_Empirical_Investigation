## Story Opening:

The scent of peppermint and hairspray hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia Rose Blackwood like a second skin. Outside, a late October rain lashed against the window of "Amelia's Snippets," blurring the already muted grey of the Seattle skyline. Amelia, her own dark hair pulled back into a messy bun, sighed and tightened the silk kimono she wore over her denim overalls. She loved this time of day, the lull before the evening rush, the quiet moment to herself before the parade of appointments began.

She traced a finger through the condensation on the window, momentarily distracted by a flock of pigeons taking flight from the nearby building. Amelia found a strange comfort in their erratic, determined movements. It reminded her of her own journey, from a small town in Oregon to owning her own salon in the heart of the city.

The soft chime of the front door snapped her back to reality. A woman, dripping and looking thoroughly miserable, stood framed in the doorway, clutching a magazine to her chest like a life raft.

"Amelia?" she asked, her voice hesitant and laced with a hopeful tremor. "I... I have an appointment with you?"

Amelia straightened, a practiced smile already forming on her lips. "Welcome to Amelia's Snippets! Come in, get out of the rain. You must be..."

## Setting:

**Amelia's Snippets:** A cozy, bohemian hair salon nestled in the heart of Seattle's vibrant Belltown neighborhood. The space is relatively small, but packed with character. Mismatched vintage furniture – a plush velvet armchair in the corner, a reclaimed wood coffee table laden with fashion magazines – creates a welcoming and eclectic atmosphere.

**Details:**

*   **Walls:** Painted a calming shade of sage green, adorned with framed vintage hair advertisements and quirky, locally-made art.
*   **Styling Stations:** Three well-lit styling stations, each equipped with a comfortable chair, a large mirror, and a rolling cart filled with the tools of Amelia's trade – scissors, combs, brushes, and an array of hair products.
*   **Washing Station:** A sleek, modern washing station sits tucked away in a slightly more private area, complete with comfortable headrests and aromatherapy diffusers.
*   **Waiting Area:** The aforementioned velvet armchair and coffee table make up the waiting area, offering a haven for clients to relax before their appointments. A bookshelf crammed with novels and magazines adds to the cozy, lived-in feel.
*   **Aromatic Ambience:** The air is constantly filled with a carefully curated blend of scents - usually peppermint, lavender, and the subtle aroma of the various hair products.
*   **Overall Impression:** Amelia's Snippets is more than just a hair salon; it's a sanctuary, a place where clients can relax, express themselves, and leave feeling refreshed and confident. It reflects Amelia Rose Blackwood's personality: warm, creative, and undeniably unique.
