The harsh fluorescent lights of "Glamour Galore" hummed a relentless tune above Abigail Mae Thornton's head, a soundtrack to the chaos of a Saturday morning. Abigail, armed with a meticulously organized tray of highlighting foils and a half-empty travel mug of lukewarm Earl Grey, surveyed the salon battlefield with the weary eyes of a seasoned general.  The air hung thick with the scent of ammonia, hairspray, and a potent mix of nervous energy emanating from the half-dozen women already perched in their respective stylist chairs.

Glamour Galore, nestled in the heart of downtown Harmony Creek, Ohio, wasn't exactly the cutting-edge of the beauty industry. Think floral wallpaper peeling at the edges, mismatched furniture rescued from various estate sales, and a general aesthetic that screamed "early 2000s suburban chic clinging desperately to relevance."  But it was Abigail's haven.  She'd inherited the salon from her Aunt Millie two years ago, and while she dreamed of updating the décor, she secretly loved the comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere. It was a place where women came to gossip, confide, and leave feeling just a little bit brighter, both inside and out.  And Abigail, with her deft hands, warm smile, and uncanny ability to predict the perfect shade of blonde for any given complexion, was the heart and soul of it. Today, however, even her well-honed professional composure felt strained. Today, Mildred Abernathy, the town's notoriously picky mayor's wife, was due for a full makeover before the annual Harmony Creek Harvest Festival. And if Mildred wasn’t happy, well, Abigail knew that Glamour Galore's reputation, and potentially its very survival, hung in the balance.
