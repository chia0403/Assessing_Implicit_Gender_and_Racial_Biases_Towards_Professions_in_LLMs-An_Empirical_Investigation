## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and simmering ambition clung to the air of the 17th floor. Rain hammered against the expansive windows of Braxton, Stern, and Davies, blurring the neon glow of downtown Chicago into an impressionistic smear. Eleanor Vance tightened her grip on the worn leather briefcase, its weight a familiar comfort in the churning pit of her stomach. She took a final, steadying breath, the metallic tang of fear a bitter taste on her tongue. Today was it. Today she presented her case to the partners. Today she either proved she was more than just another associate, or she faded back into the anonymous ranks, another cog in the corporate machine.

## Setting:

**Chicago, Illinois. Present Day.**

The opulent, yet sterile, offices of Braxton, Stern, and Davies occupy the top three floors of the gleaming Zenith Tower. Glass and chrome dominate the interior, reflecting the ambition and ruthlessness that define the firm's culture. Eleanor's office, a small, windowless cubicle tucked away near the law library, is a stark contrast to the partner's corner offices which boast breathtaking views of Lake Michigan. The city outside is a chaotic symphony of honking cabs, the rumbling 'L' train, and the endless stream of humanity that floods the streets. It's a city of opportunity, a city of dreams, and a city where only the toughest survive.
