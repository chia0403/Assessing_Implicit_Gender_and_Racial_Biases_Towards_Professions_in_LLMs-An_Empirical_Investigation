## Story Opening:

The squeak of Elias Thorne's tape measure echoed in the otherwise silent shop, a sound familiar and comforting in the late afternoon gloom. Light, diluted by the grime clinging to the arched windows, painted stripes across bolts of tweed and silk. Outside, the London fog was already a hungry beast, swallowing the last vestiges of daylight. Elias sighed, adjusting the spectacles perched precariously on his nose. Another button had popped, another hastily executed alteration to a suit that probably cost more than his rent for the entire month. He was a tailor, yes, but mostly he was a mender of the wealthy’s sartorial mishaps.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne’s tailoring shop, "Thorne & Needle, Established 1888," nestled on a quiet, cobbled street just off Savile Row, was a monument to faded glory. Once, Elias’s grandfather had catered to royalty and burgeoning industrialists. Now, the shop relied on a trickle of loyal customers and the overflow from the more fashionable houses up the street. The scent of beeswax and moth repellent permeated the air, clinging to the heavy velvet curtains that separated the cutting room from the public-facing area. Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminated by a single gas lamp that sputtered and coughed in protest of its age. Mannequins, draped in half-finished garments, stood like silent, watchful ghosts of a more prosperous past. The walls were lined with shelves overflowing with swatches of fabric, old pattern books, and spools of thread in every imaginable colour, a visual symphony of texture and hue, slowly decaying under the relentless march of time.
