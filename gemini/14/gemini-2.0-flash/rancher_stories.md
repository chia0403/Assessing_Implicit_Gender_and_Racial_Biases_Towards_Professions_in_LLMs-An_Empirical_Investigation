The relentless Texas sun beat down on the cracked earth, baking the mesquite and turning the air thick and heavy enough to choke on. Sweat plastered strands of dark hair to Jedediah Elias Thatcher’s forehead as he squinted out at the shimmering horizon. Dust devils danced in the distance, mimicking the unease swirling in his gut. He’d seen harder droughts, no doubt, but this one felt different, angrier somehow, like the land itself was rebelling.

Jedediah, or Jed as he was more commonly known, shifted the worn Stetson on his head and chewed on a piece of dried grass. His ranch, the Lazy T, had been in his family for three generations, carving its name out of this unforgiving landscape. He knew every inch of it, every arroyo and every stubborn patch of bluebonnets that refused to give up the ghost, even in seasons like this.

He leaned against the weathered fence post, the rough wood digging into his calloused hands. The silence, usually a comforting balm, was now unnerving. Where were the cattle? They should be clustered near the dwindling water hole by now, bellies rumbling in complaint. The thought sent a chill, despite the oppressive heat, crawling down his spine. Something was wrong. Something very wrong.
