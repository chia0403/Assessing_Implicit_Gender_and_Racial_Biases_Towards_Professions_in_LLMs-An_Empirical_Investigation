The hiss of the air brakes was the first warning. Then, the vibrating rumble of the engine, growing louder, closer, until it filled the world. Joseph Bartholomew "Bart" Miller barely had time to register the runaway semi barreling towards him before diving for the dusty shoulder of Highway 17, the gravel biting into his face as the behemoth roared past.

Highway 17 wasn't exactly picturesque. It sliced through the heart of the Mojave Desert like a rusty zipper, a parched, unforgiving artery connecting the small, forgotten towns scattered across the endless expanse of sun-baked rock and scrub. Bart knew every crack and pothole between Barstow and Baker like the lines on his own calloused hands. He'd spent the last twenty years patching them, filling them, and sometimes just staring at them, wondering if the road stretched on forever and, if it did, why anyone would choose to travel it.

The sun beat down mercilessly, even in early spring, turning the asphalt to a shimmering mirage. The air tasted of dust and diesel, seasoned with the faint, metallic tang of impending rain that never seemed to arrive. Bart's orange safety vest clung to his sweat-soaked t-shirt, the scent of road tar mingling with the cheap cologne he splashed on every morning, a futile attempt to ward off the creeping despair that the desert seemed to breed. He picked himself up, spitting out a mouthful of gravel, and stared after the truck, a plume of dust hanging in its wake. Today, patching that pothole just outside Ludlow felt less like a job and more like a death wish.
