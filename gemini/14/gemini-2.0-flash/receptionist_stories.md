The fluorescent lights of the lobby buzzed with a nervous energy that mirrored the one thrumming beneath the skin of Genevieve Anastasia Dubois. She hated Mondays.

Sunlight fought a losing battle against the tinted windows, casting the lobby in a perpetual state of subdued twilight. Abstract art, all sharp angles and clashing colors, adorned the walls – expensive and deliberately thought-provoking, but ultimately, to Genevieve, just plain ugly.
