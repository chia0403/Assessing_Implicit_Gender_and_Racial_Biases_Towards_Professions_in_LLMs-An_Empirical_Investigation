Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a janitor named Bartholomew "Bart" Finch:

**Setting:**

The setting is the **Grand Majestic Theatre** in the crumbling, once-glamorous downtown district of **Astoria, Oregon**. The theatre, a relic of the Art Deco era, now primarily hosts community theatre productions, the occasional washed-up rock band clinging to fading glory, and the persistent echoes of a past filled with glittering costumes and roaring applause. The ornate lobby, with its faded velvet seating and peeling gold-leaf accents, smells perpetually of dust, stale popcorn, and Bart Finch's lemon-scented cleaning spray. The stage, though still impressive in size, is often plagued by creaking floorboards and temperamental lighting. Backstage, a labyrinth of dressing rooms, prop storage, and forgotten costumes, holds a sense of both magic and decay.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Finch knew the sound of a ghost weeping. He'd heard it enough times echoing through the Grand Majestic Theatre's cavernous halls after midnight. Tonight, however, the sobs were distinctly… human. He paused in his rhythmic sweeping, the bristles of his push broom scratching against the sticky floor of the concessions area. It was past 2 AM. The community theatre’s disastrous production of *The Importance of Being Earnest (With Added Llamas)* had finally wrapped up, leaving behind a wake of discarded licorice, confused audience members, and a general air of existential dread. He’d already scrubbed down the bathrooms (twice, thanks to a rogue incident involving a child, a bag of gummy bears, and an overabundance of enthusiasm), and was nearing the end of his shift. The weeping, though, was a new development.

Bart sighed, resting his broom against the counter. He was a man of routine, of predictable rhythms in a world that often felt chaotic. Weeping wasn't on the schedule. He hoisted himself over the counter, his knee cracking audibly as he landed on the other side, and followed the sound, his worn sneakers squeaking softly on the polished marble floor. The sobs were coming from the back of the theatre, near the costume room - a place he'd always found a little creepy, even without the addition of audible sorrow. He grabbed his trusty flashlight from his belt, a beam of light cutting through the gloom. "Hello?" he called out, his voice raspy from years of breathing in dust and disinfectant. "Is someone there?"
