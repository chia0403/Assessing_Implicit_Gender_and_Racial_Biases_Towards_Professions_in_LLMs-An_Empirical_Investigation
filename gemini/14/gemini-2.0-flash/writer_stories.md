## Story Opening:

The clatter of rain against the corrugated iron roof was doing little to inspire Eloise Juniper Bellwether. In fact, it was having the opposite effect. Another drop, thicker and heavier than the last, hammered against the metal, and Eloise groaned, pushing away from the chipped, Formica-topped table. "Just shut up, will you?" she muttered, not expecting the rain to comply, but needing to direct her frustration somewhere. The cursor blinked mockingly on the ancient, sputtering laptop screen. An entire morning, and all she had to show for it was half a sentence about a particularly depressing seagull.

## Setting:

Eloise was holed up in her grandmother's dilapidated beach shack on the Isle of Skye. The shack, optimistically named "Seagull's Rest" by Eloise's Nana Elsie, was perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the turbulent waters of the Sound of Raasay. It was a single room, sparsely furnished with threadbare floral armchairs, a wonky bed that smelled perpetually of damp wool, and the aforementioned table. A small, wood-burning stove in the corner provided erratic warmth, and the only source of light, besides the gloomy daylight filtering through salt-encrusted windows, was a single, flickering bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling. The walls were painted a sickly shade of pale green, peeling in strips and revealing the rotting wood beneath. Outside, the landscape was a study in muted greys and browns: the churning sea, the jagged, windswept cliffs, and the ever-present, brooding mountains in the distance. It was a place of raw, unforgiving beauty, perfect for inspiring great art, or, as Eloise was currently experiencing, a deep and abiding sense of writer's block.
