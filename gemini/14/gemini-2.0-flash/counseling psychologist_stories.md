## Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug, warmed only lukewarm by the tepid tea within, did little to soothe Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth’s gnawing anxiety. The hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, usually a comforting white noise, seemed to amplify the rhythmic drumming in her temples. Outside, a relentless drizzle turned the already dreary November day into a gray, suffocating blanket. Eleanor stared out her window, watching the distorted reflections of the passing cars smear like watercolor paint across the wet asphalt. She’d been expecting him, of course. Had even preemptively braced herself for the inevitable fallout. But knowing something intellectually and feeling it viscerally were two vastly different beasts. And right now, the beast inside her was roaring. The intercom buzzed, its abrupt intrusion making her jump. “Dr. Ainsworth, Mr. Harding is here to see you.”

## Setting:

The office of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, counseling psychologist, resided in a converted Victorian house nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in the historic district of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Once a grand family home, the house now hosted a collection of independent practices, ranging from acupuncture to legal mediation. Eleanor's suite, Suite 3B, consisted of a small, cluttered waiting room with worn floral wallpaper and a mismatched collection of chairs, and a slightly larger, more comfortable office. The office was furnished with a plush, overstuffed armchair for patients, a smaller, but equally comfortable chair for Eleanor, and a low coffee table littered with brochures on mindfulness, stress reduction, and local support groups. A framed print of Van Gogh's Starry Night hung slightly askew on the wall, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the muted tones of the rest of the room. A large, oak desk stood in the corner, piled high with files, appointment books, and various trinkets – a small Buddha statue, a smooth, river stone, and a half-finished crossword puzzle. The overall effect was one of comforting, if slightly chaotic, order, reflecting Eleanor's own personality: warm, approachable, and always a little bit overwhelmed.
