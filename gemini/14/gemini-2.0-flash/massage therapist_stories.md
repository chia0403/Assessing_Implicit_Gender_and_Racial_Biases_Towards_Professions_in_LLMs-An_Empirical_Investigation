The late afternoon sun, a fiery orange orb dipping towards the Pacific, cast long shadows across the polished bamboo floors of "The Sanctuary," Amelia Grace Hawthorne's massage studio. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back into a loose bun revealing the graceful curve of her neck, inhaled deeply, the scent of sandalwood incense clinging to the air. She ran a calloused thumb along the worn spine of her favorite book of anatomy, a comforting weight in her hand. The rhythmic crashing of waves against the cliffs below The Sanctuary, normally a soothing counterpoint to her work, felt today like a restless, agitated drumbeat in her ears. Her last client, a tense CEO riddled with deadlines, had just left, and even after scrubbing her hands raw, she could still feel the man's anxiety clinging to her fingertips.

The Sanctuary, nestled on a bluff overlooking the rugged Mendocino coastline, was her haven. She'd poured years of savings and sweat equity into transforming the dilapidated, one-room cabin into a space of tranquility. Sunlight streamed through the large picture window, bathing the massage table in its warm glow. Soft Celtic music drifted from hidden speakers. Every detail, from the smooth river stones arranged in a meditation garden outside to the plush, organic cotton towels folded neatly in the corner, was carefully curated to ease the burdens of her clients. Yet today, the beauty of her creation felt like a sharp contrast to the knot of unease tightening in her stomach. Something was about to change. She could feel it in her bones.
