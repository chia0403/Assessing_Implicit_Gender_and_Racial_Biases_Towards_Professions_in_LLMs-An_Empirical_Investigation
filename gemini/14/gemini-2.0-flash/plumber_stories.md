## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, slick with sweat and the grime of decades, and landed with a clatter against the rusted pipes. Daniel Augustine Miller swore, a low, guttural sound that echoed in the damp, claustrophobic crawlspace beneath Mrs. Higgins' Victorian mansion. He hated crawlspaces. Hated the way the dust motes danced in the thin beams of his flashlight, hated the way spiders felt like they were constantly investigating his ears, and most of all, hated the way the old pipes here always put up a fight. He shifted his weight, the gritty soil digging into his kneepads, and muttered, "Just five more minutes. Just five more minutes and I'm out of here." He tightened his grip on the next pipe, the cold metal a stark contrast to the clammy heat that clung to him like a second skin. This was supposed to be a simple fix, a leaky connection. Of course, nothing was ever simple in this house.

## Setting:

The story begins in the murky, dust-laden crawlspace beneath the opulent Victorian mansion belonging to Mrs. Eleanor Higgins, a wealthy widow with a penchant for antiques and a distinct lack of patience. The house, nestled on a sprawling estate on the outskirts of the small, historically preserved town of Havenwood, Connecticut, is a relic of a bygone era. Its ornate architecture, complete with turrets, gables, and stained-glass windows, speaks of a grandeur that feels slightly out of place in the modern world. The interior is crammed with antique furniture, porcelain dolls that seem to watch your every move, and portraits of stern-faced ancestors that line the dark, wood-paneled halls. The crawlspace, however, is a stark contrast to the rest of the house. It's a cramped, earthen-floored space, choked with cobwebs, ancient pipes that hiss and groan with every sigh of the house, and the musty scent of decay. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth and the faint, unsettling odor of something long forgotten. It's a place where secrets seem to linger, clinging to the dust motes and the rust-eaten pipes, waiting to be unearthed.
