The air hung thick and heavy, a soup of diesel fumes and the promise of a sun that would bake the already parched earth. Dust, fine and reddish-brown, coated everything â€“ the chain-link fence surrounding the construction site, the cabs of the idling bulldozers, and even the salt-and-pepper stubble on Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan's chin. He spat a wad of chewing tobacco into a dented, overflowing garbage can, the metallic tang a familiar taste on his tongue. 

This was it, the start of another scorching day at the Whispering Sands Resort & Casino. Not exactly whispering today, though. More like roaring with the rumble of machinery and the curses echoing from disgruntled workers, all vying for a piece of the multi-million dollar pie. Bart Finnigan, a man built like a brick shithouse and about as subtle, adjusted his hardhat, emblazoned with the faded logo of his union Local 17, and grabbed his tool belt. He was a foundation man, and he was damned good at it. Today, he was laying the groundwork, literally, for the high-roller suites. He just hoped he could finish the job before the desert sun turned his brain to scrambled eggs.
