## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum of the office lights was a constant, unwavering drone, a mechanical symphony that accompanied Amelia Claire Davenport through yet another marathon tax season. Outside, a watery March sun struggled to pierce the grimy windows of Davenport & Davies, but inside, the illumination was artificial, sterile, and, frankly, depressing. Amelia stifled a yawn, the scent of stale coffee and impending deadlines clinging to the air like a persistent cough. Her eyes, usually bright and observant, felt gritty and tired as she stared at the mountain of Form 1040s piled on her desk, threatening to topple over like a badly constructed Jenga tower. It was 9:17 PM, and the numbers were beginning to swim.

## Setting:

The setting is Davenport & Davies, a small, independently owned income tax preparation firm located in a slightly rundown office building on the edge of downtown Portland, Oregon. The decor is aggressively beige, a deliberate attempt to project neutrality and professionalism that, in reality, just feels bland and uninspired. The building itself is older, hinting at a more vibrant past, but years of neglect and cost-cutting measures have left it with a lingering air of faded glory. The office is crammed with desks overflowing with paperwork, calculators, and half-empty coffee mugs. File cabinets line the walls, their metal surfaces scarred and dented, a testament to years of frantic rummaging. A single, sad-looking ficus plant sits in the corner, bravely battling the dry, recycled air. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation, a silent acknowledgment of the relentless pressure that comes with helping people navigate the labyrinthine complexities of the American tax system. This is Amelia Davenport's kingdom, for better or for worse, at least until April 15th.
