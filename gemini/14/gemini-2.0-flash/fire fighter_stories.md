The smell of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that fought a losing battle against the acrid bite of smoke. Rain lashed against the cracked windows of the abandoned bakery, a relentless drumming that mocked the flickering, inadequate beams of Lieutenant John Alexander Riley's flashlight. The abandoned Battersea Bakery, once a London landmark famous for its treacle tarts, was now just a gutted husk, a testament to neglect and a breeding ground for shadows.

John coughed, pulling his oxygen mask tighter. He hated these kinds of calls. False alarms, usually teenagers looking for a thrill, or the less savoury kind, squatters trying to keep warm with makeshift fires. But this one felt different. The smoke was too thick, too insistent, and the air hung with a palpable tension that had his senses screaming.

He adjusted the strap of his helmet, the weight a familiar comfort. The rain continued to fall, a cold, relentless shroud that clung to everything. It was a Tuesday night, 11:47 PM. Most of London was asleep, dreaming of sugar plums and sugar daddies, oblivious to the slow, insidious burn that was eating away at the Battersea Bakery and the knot of unease tightening in John Alexander Riley's gut. He had a bad feeling about this. A really bad feeling.
