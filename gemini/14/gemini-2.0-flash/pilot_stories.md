The rasping cough tore through Amelia Rose Harding's chest, mirroring the ancient radial engine sputtering to life just ahead of her. Dust devils, spun up by the prop wash, danced across the cracked asphalt of the abandoned airfield. Here, miles from anything that even resembled civilization in the heart of the Namib Desert, was where she felt most alive.

This was 'Skeleton Coast Airstrip', more graveyard than runway, and it was Amelia's haven. Here, hidden from the world and its troubles, she nursed both herself and her beloved 1943 Boeing-Stearman PT-17 Kaydet back to health.
