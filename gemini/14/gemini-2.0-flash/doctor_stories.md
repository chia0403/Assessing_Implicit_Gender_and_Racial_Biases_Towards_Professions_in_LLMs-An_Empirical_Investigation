The insistent shrill of the tea kettle sliced through the pre-dawn quiet like a scalpel. Dr. Eleanor Anne Hawthorne groaned, burrowing deeper under the threadbare patchwork quilt. She’d been on call for three nights running, a record even for St. Jude’s Hospital in the backwater town of Havenwood, Maine. The tea kettle, a gift from her late grandmother, was a lifeline, but right now it just felt like another unwelcome intrusion.

Eleanor, with her tangled mess of chestnut hair escaping its braid and dark circles etched under her kind, hazel eyes, hauled herself out of bed. The floorboards creaked under her bare feet as she shuffled towards the tiny, cluttered kitchen. The morning light, already starting to paint the sky with hues of pale orange and rose, streamed through the lace-curtained window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

Her cottage, perched precariously on the edge of Havenwood Cliffs, was a sanctuary of sorts, a stark contrast to the sterile, often heartbreaking environment of the hospital. Built over a hundred years ago, it was charmingly dilapidated, with mismatched furniture salvaged from yard sales and walls plastered with faded botanical prints. The salty scent of the ocean, mingled with the damp earthiness of the surrounding pines, permeated every corner.

Eleanor filled her chipped ceramic mug with the steaming water, the aroma of chamomile a small comfort against the exhaustion that clung to her like a shroud. She knew, with a weary sigh, that this brief respite wouldn’t last. Havenwood, with its aging population and a persistent shortage of medical staff, always had a crisis brewing just beneath the surface. And Eleanor Hawthorne, bless her tired heart, was almost always at the center of it.
