## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The opulent, if slightly faded, lobby of the "Grand Aurora Hotel" in New Orleans, Louisiana. It's late August, and the humidity hangs thick in the air, even within the faux-Gothic grandeur of the hotel. Crystal chandeliers, dusty and dimmed, cast a weak, yellow light on the ornate, though slightly threadbare, Persian rugs that line the polished marble floor. The scent of jasmine and old money battles with the faint, lingering aroma of spilled daiquiris from last night's impromptu cocktail hour. Outside, the city throbs with a muted, pre-dawn energy, a low hum that vibrates through the building's very foundations.

**Story Opening:**

Percival Bartholomew Beauchamp, all starched uniform and weary resignation, leaned against the bellhop stand, polishing the already-gleaming brass plaque with a vigor that bordered on aggression. The clock above the reception desk ticked with an almost mocking insistence, each second dragging him closer to the end of his shift. He hated the early shift. Hated the bleary-eyed tourists, the businessmen smelling of stale scotch and regret, and the occasional, offensively cheerful honeymooners. He longed for the anonymity of the night shift, where he could blend into the shadows and become another ghost haunting the Grand Aurora's hallowed halls.

Tonight, however, held a particularly unpleasant air. A storm was brewing, not just outside in the humid air, but within the very fabric of the hotel. A tension, thick and palpable, coiled around his gut, a feeling he knew intimately. He'd worked at the Grand Aurora for twelve years, and he'd learned to read its moods. And tonight, the old dame was spitting venom.
