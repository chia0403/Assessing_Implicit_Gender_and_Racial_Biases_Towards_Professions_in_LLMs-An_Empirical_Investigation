Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist named Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt rosemary clung to the air like a persistent ex. Dr. Eleanor Vance, PhD, her brow furrowed in concentration, flipped the blackened sprig with a pair of tongs. “Damn it, Harold,” she muttered, more to the air than the slumbering golden retriever sprawled by the Aga. “This was *organic* rosemary. Certified sustainable, ethically harvested…”

She tossed the offending herb into the composting bin, the metallic clang echoing in the cavernous kitchen. Another culinary disaster. Maybe she should stick to nutritional analysis and leave the actual *cooking* to someone else. Like a chef. Preferably one who didn’t consider “charred” a desirable flavour profile.

But tonight, perfection was non-negotiable. Tonight was the dinner party to end all dinner parties. Tonight, she was hosting the elite of the Oak Haven Wellness Retreat, and she needed to prove that healthy eating could be both nutritious AND delicious. Even if it killed her.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Oak Haven**, a prestigious, secluded wellness retreat nestled in the rolling hills of the **Berkshires, Massachusetts.** The retreat itself is housed in a sprawling, renovated Victorian mansion. Think pristine white clapboard siding, wrap-around porches adorned with hanging baskets overflowing with vibrant herbs, and manicured lawns stretching towards the horizon.

**The specific scene is Eleanor's own, smaller cottage, located on the grounds but slightly removed from the main retreat buildings. The cottage is meticulously decorated with a modern farmhouse aesthetic:** Shiplap walls, exposed beams, reclaimed wood furniture, and a colour palette of muted greens, creams, and soft blues. Sunlight streams through the large windows, highlighting the gleaming stainless steel appliances and the rows of neatly organized cookbooks in the open kitchen. Despite the apparent order, there is a subtle chaos, a sense of controlled but palpable stress, radiating from the disorganized piles of recipe cards and the scattered ingredients on the counter. It's clear that while Eleanor *preaches* calm, healthy living, she's currently struggling to embody it.
