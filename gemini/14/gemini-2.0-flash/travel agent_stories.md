The stale, recycled air of Paradise Found Travel hung heavy with the scent of coconut sunscreen and desperation. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon signs of downtown Harmony Creek into a hazy, multicolored mess. Inside, the only color came from the faded brochures plastered across the walls, promising sun-drenched beaches and vibrant coral reefs. But looking at Mildred Abigail Periwinkle, hunched over her overflowing desk, you’d never guess such vibrant escapes existed.

Mildred, travel agent extraordinaire (at least according to the dusty certificate hanging crookedly above her head), sighed and rubbed her throbbing temples. Harmony Creek in October was hardly a tourist mecca. Mostly, people were trying to *leave* it. Her phone hadn't rung all morning, and the stack of bills threatening to topple off her desk was starting to resemble a particularly malevolent Jenga tower. Mildred desperately needed a sale, something to remind her why she’d traded a perfectly respectable life as a librarian for the chaotic, often heartbreaking, world of booking dream vacations. A dream vacation for someone else, of course. Her own passport was as virgin as the Arctic ice cap.
