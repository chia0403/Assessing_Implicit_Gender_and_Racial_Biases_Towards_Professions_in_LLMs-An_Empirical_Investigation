The clatter of cutlery was a constant companion to Elara Josephine Rossi, a soundtrack she knew as intimately as her own heartbeat. The "Seafoam Siren," a seafood bistro clinging precariously to the edge of the boardwalk in Crescent Cove, hummed with the predictable chaos of a late summer Saturday. Sunlight, hazy with the promise of a fiery sunset, streamed through the large, salt-streaked windows, glinting off the chrome of the espresso machine and painting the worn wooden tables in a warm, honeyed glow. Outside, the cries of seagulls mingled with the rhythmic crashing of waves against the pier pilings, a constant reminder of the town's reliance on the ocean.

Elara, balancing a tray laden with clam chowder and lobster rolls, navigated the crowded aisles with practiced ease. The scent of garlic butter and fried fish clung to the air, a comforting aroma she usually found comforting. But tonight, even the familiar rhythm of the restaurant, even the breathtaking view of the setting sun over the Atlantic, felt strangely suffocating.
