The acrid smell of burnt insulation hung heavy in the air, a grim reminder of the morning's near-disaster. Elias Thorne, all six foot four of him, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, smearing grease across his forehead. He cursed under his breath, the metallic tang of fear still lingering on his tongue. Another few minutes, and the whole damn warehouse would have gone up in flames.

The setting was the vast, echoing interior of "National Shipping & Logistics," a behemoth of corrugated iron and concrete located in the grimy industrial district of North Harbour. Sunlight filtered weakly through the grimy skylights, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across mountains of stacked crates and the skeletal forms of forklifts parked for the night. The air was thick with the scent of cardboard, diesel, and the faint, lingering odor of stale coffee - a constant reminder of the army of warehouse workers who toiled here around the clock. It was a labyrinthine place, a maze of pallets and packing tape where secrets could easily be lost, and the constant hum of the ventilation system did little to dispel the feeling of isolation. Elias knew every faulty wire, every overloaded circuit, every potential fire hazard within these walls. He was, after all, the only electrician National Shipping & Logistics bothered to employ full-time. And tonight, Elias Thorne felt like he was the only thing standing between this entire operation and a smoldering ruin.
