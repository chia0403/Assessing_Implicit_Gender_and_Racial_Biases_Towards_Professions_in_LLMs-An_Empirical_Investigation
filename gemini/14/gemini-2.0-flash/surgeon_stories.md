The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Eleanor Vance's cheeks as she wrestled with the stubbornly heavy door of the lighthouse. Salt spray, clinging like a shroud, obscured the already faint glimmer of dawn. She finally forced it open, the screech echoing through the hollow, stone structure. The scent of brine and damp stone filled her lungs, a familiar and, tonight, deeply unwelcome comfort.

Eleanor, a surgeon of considerable skill and even more considerable reputation back in Edinburgh, had come to this godforsaken spit of land off the Scottish coast, the Isle of Kerrigan, hoping for respite. A chance to finally outrun the ghosts that had been hounding her sinceâ€¦ well, since the incident. She'd imagined solitude, peace, perhaps even a renewed connection to the ocean she'd always loved as a child.

Instead, she found herself staring at the worried face of Mrs. McLeod, the island's only midwife and, judging by the woman's frantic energy, the sole reason Eleanor hadn't been pulled from her temporary isolation weeks ago. "Dr. Vance, thank God you're here!" she gasped, pulling Eleanor inside with surprising strength. "It's young Ailis McPherson. The babe's breech, and she's been labouring for two days. We can't get a signal out to the mainland. You're the only one who can help her."

The lighthouse, stripped of its original purpose decades ago and crudely converted into a two-bedroom holiday rental, suddenly felt a lot smaller. And the peace Eleanor had so desperately sought evaporated like sea mist under a harsh, unforgiving sun. This wasn't respite; this was a summons, a desperate plea. And Eleanor Vance, though she tried to deny it, knew she couldn't, wouldn't, turn away.
