The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum hanging low in the sky, cast long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oak trees across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Estate. A chill, laced with the scent of damp earth and dying leaves, clung to the air. Inside the sprawling Victorian manor, a grand gala was undoubtedly underway, the clinking of champagne glasses and polite laughter a muffled counterpoint to the rustling whisper of the wind through the browning rhododendron bushes.

But Elias Theodore Finch, groundskeeper, wasn't thinking about champagne or laughter. He was crouched low, his worn gardening gloves stained with the stubborn red clay of the rose garden, meticulously snipping away the blackened, diseased canes of a particularly temperamental Madame Delbard. Elias wasn't invited to the gala, and truth be told, he wouldn't have gone even if he were. He preferred the company of the silent, watchful oaks and the demanding, yet ultimately rewarding, company of his roses. Besides, he had a more pressing concern than hobnobbing with Blackwood's wealthy clientele. He'd noticed something… off… with the marble fountain in the south garden that morning. A subtle discoloration, an unnatural stillness in the water. And Elias Theodore Finch, after thirty years of tending Blackwood Estate, knew that unnatural stillness rarely boded well.
