The fluorescent lights of Binder, Bolt & Beck hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the meticulous existence of Bartholomew Archibald Finch. Bartholomew, or Bart as he reluctantly allowed his colleagues to call him, sat hunched over a ledger, his brow furrowed in concentration so deep it could have knitted a sweater. The air in the dimly lit cubicle farm, perpetually smelling of stale coffee and regret, was thick with the low drone of printers and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of keyboards.

His desk, an island of order in a sea of beige cubicles, was a testament to his methodical nature. Every pen stood precisely in its assigned holder, every stack of paperwork was labeled with meticulous care, and the single, slightly wilted fern in a ceramic pot stubbornly clung to life, a tiny rebellion against the soul-crushing atmosphere. The window behind him offered a view of a brick wall and the occasional scurrying pigeon, a reminder that there was, perhaps, a world beyond debits and credits, a world Bartholomew hadn't glimpsed in years. He tapped the eraser of his pencil against a column of figures, a nagging feeling tugging at the edges of his consciousness, a sense that something was... off. Not incorrect, necessarily, but *off*. It was a feeling he usually attributed to an unbalanced ledger, but this felt different, deeper. This felt like something significant was about to disrupt the perfectly balanced equation that was Bartholomew Archibald Finch's life.
