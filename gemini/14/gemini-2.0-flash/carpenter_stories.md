The salty air whipped through Elias Thorne's beard, stinging his cheeks and carrying the mournful cry of gulls. He stood on the weathered planks of the old pier in Port Blossom, Maine, the late afternoon sun painting the water in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple. The pier, much like Elias himself, had seen better days; barnacles clung to its pilings like stubborn regrets, and the wood groaned a weary lament with every surge of the tide.

Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands gnarled and calloused like the roots of ancient oaks, had been coming to this pier since he was a boy, fishing with his grandfather and dreaming of faraway lands. Now, at forty-five, the furthest heâ€™d traveled was Bangor, and his dreams were more likely to involve straight seams and sturdy joints than uncharted horizons. His worn leather work boots were planted firmly on the splintered wood, and his gaze was fixed on the dilapidated boathouse at the pier's end. It was his latest project, a commission from old Mrs. Crabtree, who swore the ghost of her late husband, Captain Silas, still tinkered with his fishing gear inside. Whether it was ghosts or simply rot that plagued the structure, Elias was determined to breathe new life into it, one painstakingly placed plank at a time.
