Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who works in emergency medical care:

**Setting:**

A bustling, rain-slicked intersection in downtown Chicago at 2:17 AM. The air is thick with the smell of exhaust, wet asphalt, and a faint undercurrent of desperation. Neon signs buzz and flicker, casting distorted reflections on the slick pavement. The constant hum of the city, usually muffled at this hour, is punctuated by the jarring wail of sirens in the distance.

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the dispatch radio cut through the relative quiet of Ambulance 6, making Isabella Rose "Izzy" Martinez jump in her seat. Rain plastered the windshield, blurring the already distorted cityscape into impressionistic streaks of color.  Izzy, her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun, grabbed the microphone, the metal cold against her fingertips.

"Ambulance 6, go ahead." Her voice was calm, professional, a stark contrast to the frantic thrumming of her pulse. Even after five years on the job, the sudden call to action still ignited a rush of adrenaline.

"Ambulance 6, respond to the intersection of Wacker and State. Motor vehicle accident, multiple vehicles involved, possible entrapment.  Proceed with caution.  PD is en route, but ETA is unknown. Acknowledge."

Izzy exchanged a quick glance with her partner, Mark Chen, who was already reaching for the ignition.  "Acknowledged, dispatch. En route."  She clipped the microphone back in place, her eyes scanning the chaotic landscape for the quickest route.  The radio crackled again, confirming the grim reality of her job: tonight, someone was having the worst night of their life, and Isabella Rose Martinez was about to be right in the middle of it.
