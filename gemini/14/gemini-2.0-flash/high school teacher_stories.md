## Story Opening:

The stale coffee, brewed far too early and reheated in the microwave until it tasted vaguely of burnt plastic, did little to soothe Mr. Alistair Finch's frayed nerves. He stared out at the pre-dawn gloom, the skeletal branches of the oak trees scratching at the windows of his classroom like ghostly fingers. Another Monday. Another week grappling with hormonal teenagers, standardized test anxiety, and the slow, soul-crushing realization that his passion for literature was slowly being eroded by the relentless tide of paperwork. He sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the fluorescent lights, and ran a hand through his already disheveled brown hair. Maybe today, just maybe, he could inspire at least one of them to actually read *Moby Dick*.

## Setting:

The story opens in Mr. Alistair Finch's classroom, room 212, at Northwood High School. Northwood is a brick behemoth of a school, built in the 1970s and showing its age in the chipped paint, the perpetually flickering lights, and the faint smell of old gym socks that seemed to permeate the hallways. Alistair's classroom is on the second floor, overlooking the mostly barren football field. The room itself is small and cluttered, overflowing with stacks of ungraded papers, well-worn copies of classic novels, and a haphazard collection of student artwork, some inspiring, mostâ€¦ not. The walls are plastered with posters of famous authors, literary quotes, and slightly outdated maps of the world. A large, whiteboard dominates one wall, currently covered in a spiderweb of half-erased notes about symbolism and themes. The desks are arranged in uneven rows, each bearing the scars of countless doodles and whispered conversations. Despite the chaos, there's a certain lived-in warmth to the space, a testament to Alistair's attempts to create a haven for his students within the often-sterile environment of high school.
