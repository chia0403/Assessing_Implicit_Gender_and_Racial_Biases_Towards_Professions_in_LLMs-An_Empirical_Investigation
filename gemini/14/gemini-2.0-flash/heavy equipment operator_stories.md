The desert wind, a relentless bully, whipped sand against the cab of the Caterpillar D11 bulldozer, making it sound like a thousand tiny devils scratching to get in. Dale "Dusty" Miller, his face a roadmap of sun-etched lines and dirt, spat a stream of tobacco juice into the dented can nestled between his seat and the console. He squinted at the shimmering horizon, the heat already radiating off the parched earth in visible waves, distorting the already bleak landscape of the Atacama Desert. This was his office, his kingdom, his purgatory, depending on the day.

The Atacama, stretching between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains in Chile, was the driest non-polar desert on Earth. Here, the landscape was a brutal tapestry of rust-colored rocks, dust-choked plains, and jagged, volcanic peaks. The air was thin and unforgiving, and the sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down with merciless intensity.

Dusty Miller had been here for six months, working for a mining company called Solaris Minerals, carving roads and leveling plateaus for a new lithium mine. It wasn't glamorous work, and it sure as hell wasn't easy, but it paid damn well. And for Dusty, a man with a past he was trying to outrun, the isolation and the sheer, bone-jarring physical labor were exactly what he needed. He adjusted his sweat-stained baseball cap, the bill pulled low over his eyes, and shifted the massive dozer into gear. Another day, another mountain to move.
