The biting January wind whipped off the Firth of Forth, stinging Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's cheeks as she struggled to secure her easel. The North Berwick Law loomed in the distance, its conical silhouette stark against the churning, steel-grey sky. Salt spray kissed her skin, and the air thrummed with the cry of gulls wheeling overhead. Amelia shivered, pulling her worn tweed scarf tighter around her neck. She loved this place, loved the raw, untamed beauty of the Scottish coast, even when it threatened to freeze her fingers solid. It was here, standing on this rugged stretch of beach known as Yellowcraig, with the omnipresent hum of the North Sea in her ears, that Amelia truly felt alive.

Her tiny, whitewashed cottage, nestled in the lee of a dune just a few hundred yards inland, was her sanctuary. The scent of linseed oil and turpentine perpetually hung in the air, a comforting aroma that mingled with the salt-tinged breeze that seeped in through the ill-fitting windows. Inside, canvases leaned haphazardly against the walls, a kaleidoscope of moody landscapes, portraits catching the harsh light, and abstracts pulsing with the colours of the sea. It wasn't much, but it was hers, and it was where Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne wrestled with the demons of her past and the glories of the present, one brushstroke at a time.
