The tar, sticky and yielding under his boots, gave a faint *schlop* each time Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins moved. Above him, the July sun beat down with the relentless fury of a scorned lover. He squinted, pushing a stray bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, and adjusted his worn baseball cap. The cap, a faded blue affair bearing the logo of the local Little League team, was his only concession to coolness.

He was perched precariously on the roof of the First Congregational Church of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek, population 2,347, was a place where gossip traveled faster than the creek itself after a heavy rain, and where the only thing more reliable than the annual town picnic was the inevitable roof leak after every winter. The church, a stately white clapboard building with a towering steeple, was the heart of Harmony Creek, both literally and figuratively. Now, its heart was ailing.

The century-old cedar shingles, baked dry and cracked by decades of sun and storms, were practically crumbling under his touch. Bart sighed, the sound lost in the drone of cicadas and the distant rumble of a tractor on Farmer Johnson's field. He loved this town, this church, this familiar, back-breaking work. But sometimes, staring out at the endless rows of corn and the lazy curve of the Black River, he felt a pang ofâ€¦something. A yearning for something more, something beyond the familiar rhythm of hammer and nail.

He shook his head, dismissing the thought as the sun playing tricks on his weary mind. Today, there was only the roof, the heat, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing that he, Bartholomew Higgins, roofer extraordinaire, was helping to keep the good people of Harmony Creek dry and sheltered.
