The humid New Orleans air clung to Detective Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau like a second skin, plastering her dark hair to her forehead and making the cheap rayon of her blouse feel like sandpaper. It was barely 8 AM, but the oppressive heat already promised a scorcher. The smell of chicory coffee and stale beignets, usually a comforting aroma that spoke of home, did little to soothe the churning in her stomach.

Izzy stood on the cracked sidewalk of Dauphine Street, the chipped paint of the Creole townhouses peeling like sunburned skin. The narrow street, normally bustling with tourists even at this hour, was cordoned off with yellow police tape, its festive, vibrant hues a stark contrast to the grim scene unfolding within.

A lone mockingbird, perched precariously on the wrought-iron balcony of Madame Delacroix's infamous voodoo shop, let out a series of shrill calls, a mournful serenade that echoed the feeling in Izzy’s own heart. The victim lay just inside the shop's doorway, sprawled amongst the dusty jars of herbs and forgotten curios, his lifeless eyes staring up at the spiderwebbed ceiling. This was going to be a long, hot day, and Izzy had a feeling, a cold, clammy premonition that settled deep in her bones, that this case wasn't going to be anything like the petty theft and Bourbon Street brawls she was used to. This felt… different. This felt like New Orleans magic, and not the tourist-friendly kind.
