The chipped ceramic mug warmed Arthur Penhaligon's hands, a welcome contrast to the November chill that clung to him like a persistent ex. Outside, the rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Plymouth Probation Office, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxieties in his chest. This particular Monday morning felt heavier than usual, soaked through with the unspoken dread that always preceded a case review.

Arthur, a man whose own life felt perpetually under observation despite being firmly on the right side of the law, took a slow sip of lukewarm coffee, its bitter taste a familiar comfort. The office itself was a study in beige â€“ beige walls, beige carpet, beige desks piled high with paperwork. Even the flickering fluorescent lights seemed to exude a pale, lifeless beige. It was a space designed, perhaps deliberately, to stifle any flicker of hope or optimism, a holding pen for those caught between the iron bars of the justice system. He had been a probation officer for fifteen years, and the beige had seeped into his soul, painting his once-bright idealism in shades of muted grey.
