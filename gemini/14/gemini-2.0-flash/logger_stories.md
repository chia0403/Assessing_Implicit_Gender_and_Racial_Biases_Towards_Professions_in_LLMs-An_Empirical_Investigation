## Story Opening

The bite of the axe, sharp and familiar, resonated in the crisp, morning air, slicing cleanly through the aged Douglas fir. Elias Thorne, his breath clouding around his rugged face, leaned into the swing, muscles coiling and uncoiling with practiced ease. The satisfying crack of splintering wood followed, a promise of felled timber and a hard-earned day's pay. But today, something felt different. A subtle unease, like a splinter lodged deep beneath the skin, prickled at the back of his neck. He paused, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, and scanned the forest, the towering trees standing sentinel, silent witnesses to his labor. The only sound was the mournful cry of a distant raven, a sound Elias usually ignored, but today, it seemed to echo his own disquiet. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

## Setting

The year is 1938. The setting is the dense, unforgiving wilderness of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. Towering conifers, ancient and gnarled, carpet the hillsides, their roots clinging to the steep slopes like grasping fingers. Thick underbrush of salal and ferns carpets the forest floor, obscuring hidden dangers and treacherous terrain. The air is perpetually damp, clinging with the scent of pine, decaying leaves, and the constant promise of rain. The small, isolated logging camp, nestled precariously in a clearing carved out of the woods, is a ramshackle collection of rough-hewn cabins and a communal mess hall. Itâ€™s a place where life is lived on the edge, where the roar of the logging saws and the thud of falling trees are the constant soundtrack, and where the only law that truly matters is the law of the woods. The nearest town, Port Angeles, is a grueling day's ride away, offering a brief respite of saloons, stores, and the fleeting comfort of civilization, but always beckoning the loggers back to the demanding embrace of the wilderness. The forest is both a source of sustenance and a constant threat, a place of breathtaking beauty and unforgiving hardship.
