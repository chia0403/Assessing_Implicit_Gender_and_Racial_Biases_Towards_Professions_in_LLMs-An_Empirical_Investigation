## Story Opening:

The clatter of the antiquated blueprint duplicator sounded like a dying elephant struggling to breathe in the cramped, humid room. Amelia Isabella Bellweather winced, her fingers smudged with graphite and smelling faintly of ammonia. Another hour and another fifty copies of the "Proposed Expansion: Substation Gamma-7" would be churning out. It was the same damn project she'd been drowning in for the last three months, and the only thing expanding faster than the substation was her already overflowing inbox.

## Setting:

Amelia's world was the drafting department of "Bell & Davies Power Solutions," a company clinging stubbornly to mid-20th-century methods in the heart of a rapidly modernizing city. The department itself was crammed into the back of a sprawling warehouse, its walls lined with rows upon rows of meticulously labeled blueprints dating back to the company's inception in 1932. Sunlight, when it bothered to penetrate the grimy warehouse windows, was filtered through a thick layer of dust motes dancing in the stale air. The furniture was a motley collection of mismatched desks and chairs salvaged from various forgotten corners of the building. The only modern concession was the temperamental blueprint duplicator, a hulking machine that constantly threatened to overheat and fill the room with a choking, chemical-laced fog.
