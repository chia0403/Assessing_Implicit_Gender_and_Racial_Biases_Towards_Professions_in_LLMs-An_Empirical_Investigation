The biting wind whipped around Ms. Clara Beatrice Plumtree, tugging at the frayed edges of her beloved, oversized cardigan and threatening to steal the carefully constructed bun perched atop her head. She squinted against the late autumn sun, a weak, watery imitation of its summer self, as she unlocked the gate to Sweetbriar Elementary. The swing set groaned a lonely tune in the empty playground, a metallic lament for the boisterous laughter and chaotic energy that usually filled the air.

Sweetbriar itself was a charming, if slightly dilapidated, building nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a small town famous for its maple syrup and an unnerving obsession with all things autumnal. The brick exterior, painted a cheery sunflower yellow, was marred by patches of faded paint and the occasional stubborn vine creeping its way up the walls. Inside, the familiar scent of old books, beeswax polish, and childrenâ€™s dreams permeated the air, a comforting aroma that always calmed Clara's anxieties, even on days like this. Today, the quiet was unsettling, a stark contrast to the vibrant hum that usually preceded the arrival of her third-grade class. It was Thanksgiving break, and Clara was coming in to get ahead of the holiday rush with some grading. The silence, however, felt heavier than usual, a blank canvas threatening to be filled with whatever worries her overactive imagination could conjure.
