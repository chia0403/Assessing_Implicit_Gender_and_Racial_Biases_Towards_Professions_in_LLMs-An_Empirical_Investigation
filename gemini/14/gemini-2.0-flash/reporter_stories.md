## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Firth of Forth, stinging Anya Petrova's cheeks as she stood precariously on the crumbling seawall in North Queensferry. The sky, a perpetually bruised purple over the water, threatened snow. In the distance, the iconic red towers of the Forth Bridge loomed, a skeletal giant against the turbulent backdrop. The air smelled of brine and decay, a scent Anya usually found invigorating, but today, it felt like a harbinger of bad news.

**Story Opening:** Anya Petrova, a name whispered with a mixture of respect and exasperation in the hallowed halls of the Edinburgh Evening News, pulled her wool scarf tighter around her neck, a fruitless attempt to ward off the chill. The spray from the waves crashed against the wall, sending icy droplets showering over her. She ignored it. Her focus was fixed on the choppy waters below, searching for any sign, any glimmer, that would prove Inspector MacMillan wrong. He'd said there was no hope, that the current would have carried him far out by now. But Anya, hardened by years of chasing down stories that no one else would touch, refused to believe it. Thomas. Her brother. Gone. It couldn't be. The voicemail message he'd left just hours before - cryptic, urgent, terrifying - still echoed in her mind: "Anya, they know. Get out. Don't trust..." The line had cut off abruptly, leaving her with a knot of dread in her stomach and a burning need to uncover the truth, even if it led her into the darkest corners of Scotland.
