The Tuesday morning sun, already a brutal glare through the palm trees, beat down on the faded turquoise stucco of the Sunshine Insurance Agency. Inside, the air conditioner wheezed like a dying manatee, barely keeping pace with the rising humidity. **Barnaby Augustine Butterfield**, freshly showered but feeling like he'd already run a marathon through a swamp, straightened his tie – a cheerful monstrosity featuring cartoon dolphins – and sighed. He hated Tuesdays. They were the day after Monday, which was bad enough, but also the day after Mrs. Periwinkle's Bingo Night, which meant she’d inevitably be in by 9:00 AM sharp, demanding to know why her hurricane insurance didn't cover the “emotional distress” caused by a rogue gecko that had “clearly sabotaged” her daubers.

Barnaby ran a hand through his thinning hair, the faintest scent of coconut sunscreen clinging to his fingertips. He’d moved to Serenity Shores, Florida, five years ago hoping for, well, serenity. Instead, he got sunstroke, alligators in the swimming pool, and a constant barrage of claims involving everything from sinkholes swallowing golf carts to iguanas short-circuiting Christmas lights.

He glanced at the wall clock, its hands inching toward Mrs. Periwinkle's anticipated arrival. Maybe, just maybe, if he pretended to be on a very important phone call… he’d reached for the receiver when the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. It wasn't Mrs. Periwinkle. It was a woman, tall and striking, with eyes the color of the storm clouds brewing out over the Gulf. She was wearing a linen suit that screamed "expensive," and Barnaby instinctively knew this Tuesday was about to get a whole lot more complicated than a bingo-related gecko incident.
