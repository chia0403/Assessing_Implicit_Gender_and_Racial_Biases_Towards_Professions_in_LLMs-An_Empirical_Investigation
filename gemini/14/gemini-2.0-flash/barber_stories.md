## Story Opening:

The aroma of sandalwood, bay rum, and a hint of rebellion hung thick in the air of "The Sharp Edge." Bartholomew "Bart" Finch carefully stroked the worn leather of his straight razor. He hummed a low, bluesy tune that was a favorite of his, "St. James Infirmary Blues," though he always denied knowing the words. Today, though, the familiar ritual couldn't quite soothe the knot that had taken root in his gut. He glanced at the chipped enamel clock hanging precariously above the mirror. 11:57 AM. Just three minutes. Three minutes until the man who could change everything walked through his door. Or, more likely, didn't.

## Setting:

**The Sharp Edge Barber Shop** sat on the corner of Elm and Vine, a stubborn holdout against the encroaching modernization of downtown Havenwood, Pennsylvania. It was a small, one-room affair, its walls painted a faded olive green that had probably been trendy sometime in the 1950s. Two vintage barber chairs, upholstered in cracked, but lovingly maintained, red leather dominated the space. One chair was currently unoccupied; the other stood sentinel, prepped and ready. A long, mirrored wall reflected the scene, amplifying the feeling of comfortable, if slightly shabby, familiarity.

Newspaper clippings – mostly about local sports teams and the occasional historical feature – were haphazardly tacked to a corkboard behind the reception desk. A dusty bookshelf crammed with dog-eared paperbacks and well-worn magazines served as a waiting area. The linoleum floor, checkered in black and white, was meticulously swept, though time had etched its mark in countless scuffs and faded squares. The air was always filled with the distinct and comforting smells of shaving cream, aftershave, and the faint, ever-present whisper of sharpened steel. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and glinting off the chrome of Bart's prized collection of antique shaving mugs. It was a place that smelled of memories, of whispered secrets, and of the enduring appeal of a perfectly crafted haircut.
