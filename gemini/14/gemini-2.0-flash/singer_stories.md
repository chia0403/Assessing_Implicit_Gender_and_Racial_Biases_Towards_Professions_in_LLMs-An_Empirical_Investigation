## Story Opening:

The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and regret. Marie Laveau "Ruby" Dubois could taste it on her tongue as she adjusted the microphone, the metal cold against her suddenly clammy hand. The Paradise Lounge wasn't packed tonight, but the few patrons scattered amongst the plush velvet booths and dimly lit tables held her gaze, each one a silent judge. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, mirroring the slow drip of condensation from the sweating pitcher of beer on the bar. Tonight wasn't about the money; tonight was about proving she hadn't lost it all, that the voice that had once captivated sold-out crowds hadn't cracked and crumbled into nothing but whispered apologies. She inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of stale smoke and spilled whiskey grounding her, and finally, with a hesitant nod to the pianist, began to sing.

## Setting:

**The Paradise Lounge, New Orleans, Louisiana.**

Imagine a place bathed in shadows, the only real illumination coming from the small, ornate stage and the flickering candlelight on each table. The walls are a deep burgundy, adorned with framed black-and-white photographs of jazz legends and faded posters advertising long-forgotten acts. The air is thick with the smells of cheap perfume, expensive whiskey, and the ghost of countless cigarettes. The floor is covered in a plush, patterned carpet, worn thin in places from years of dancing feet. The bar, crafted from dark, polished wood, is a haven for regulars, its surface sticky with spilled drinks and whispered secrets. The overall atmosphere is one of faded glamour, a place where dreams come to both thrive and die under the watchful eye of the city.
