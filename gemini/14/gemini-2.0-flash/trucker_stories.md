The hiss of the air brakes was the closest thing to a morning alarm Dale Everett had ever needed. He grunted, wrestling himself upright in the narrow bunk of his Peterbilt 389, affectionately nicknamed “The Iron Maiden.” Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruised plum color, just starting to bleed into the faintest pink over the endless plains of Wyoming.

Dale reached for the chipped ceramic mug perched precariously on the dashboard. It held the last dregs of yesterday’s coffee, thick and bitter, but he wasn’t complaining. After another ten hours on the road, he’d take whatever jolt he could get. The scent of diesel hung heavy in the air, a smell that had become as comforting as a mother's hug.

The setting was the Flying J truck stop just outside of Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was a microcosm of America itself, a place where chrome met grit, and dreams met the hard reality of miles and deadlines. Semi-trucks lined the lot like metallic dinosaurs resting after a long migration. Inside, the diner would be buzzing with drivers swapping stories, lamenting fuel prices, and boasting about their hauls. Dale knew them all - Big Joe, Two-Finger Tony, and even the elusive "Whispering" Wendy, the only woman he knew who could parallel park a double trailer in her sleep. He pulled on his well-worn cowboy boots, ready to face another day on the asphalt river, another stretch of open road stretching before him like an untamed beast.
