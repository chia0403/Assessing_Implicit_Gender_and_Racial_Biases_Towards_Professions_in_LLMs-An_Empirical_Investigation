**Story Opening:**

The salt air stung Eleanor Beatrice Thorne’s face, but she barely noticed. Her entire world was compressed into the viewfinder of her battered Pentax K1000. The pre-dawn light, a hazy, ethereal blue, was just beginning to kiss the jagged cliffs of Port Issel, transforming them from menacing shadows to sculpted, almost mournful shapes. She held her breath, adjusting the aperture, a silent mantra repeating in her head: *balance, light, shadow, emotion.*

Eleanor Beatrice Thorne, renowned photographer of the forgotten and overlooked, had a knack for capturing the soul of a place. But this trip, this desolate, wind-bitten peninsula in Cornwall, was different. She wasn't just documenting, she was searching. Searching for something she wasn’t even sure existed, something whispered about in hushed tones by the locals, something buried deep within the legend of the lost lighthouse keeper and the storm that swallowed him whole.

She clicked the shutter. The sound, a sharp, mechanical snap, echoed in the vast emptiness. For a moment, she felt a pang of unease, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck as if she were being watched. But when she lowered the camera, all she saw was the relentless churning of the sea, the crying gulls circling overhead, and the ancient, enduring strength of the cliffs. The world felt vast, empty, and ultimately, indifferent to her search.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Port Issel, a small, isolated fishing village clinging to the north coast of Cornwall, England.** The village is characterized by:

*   **Dramatic Coastline:** Jagged, slate-grey cliffs plunge directly into the turbulent Atlantic Ocean. Rocky beaches are exposed at low tide, revealing hidden coves and treacherous currents.
*   **Traditional Architecture:** Stone cottages with slate roofs huddle together, weathered by years of storms and sea spray. The harbour is small but busy with fishing boats.
*   **Atmospheric Weather:** The weather is notoriously unpredictable, ranging from glorious sunshine to sudden, violent storms. Thick fog is a common occurrence, adding to the sense of mystery and isolation.
*   **Close-knit Community:** The villagers are a hardy and independent bunch, steeped in local lore and wary of outsiders.
*   **The Old Lighthouse (offshore):** Partially destroyed and now abandoned, the lighthouse stands on a small, rocky islet just offshore. It is only accessible by boat on calm days and is central to the village's legends.
*   **Eleanor's Accommodation:** Eleanor is staying in a small, sparsely furnished cottage on the edge of the village, overlooking the sea. The cottage is old and drafty, but it provides her with a base and a much-needed sense of privacy.
