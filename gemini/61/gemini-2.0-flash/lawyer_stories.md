## Story Opening:

The aroma of old leather and desperation hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Abigail Thorne, Esq. She traced a finger along the chipped mahogany of her desk, the polished surface cool beneath her touch. Outside, the pre-dawn light painted the grimy brick buildings of the Bowery in a muted grey, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues she usually preferred. Eleanor preferred art deco jewel tones, sapphire blues and emerald greens, a defiant splash of colour in a world that often felt monochrome.

She inhaled, the scent of her lukewarm coffee doing little to dispel the gnawing unease that had settled in her stomach. On her desk, sandwiched between a stack of unpaid bills and a dog-eared copy of the New York Penal Code, lay the crumpled telegram. Its stark black lettering seemed to pulse with a silent urgency, a harbinger of something wicked brewing.

The telegram was short, cryptic, and delivered to her office by a man who looked like he’d been swallowed by shadows and spat back out. It read simply: *”Come to Blackwood Manor. Midnight. Your services required. - S.”*

Eleanor knew only one person who would summon her in such dramatic fashion: her estranged and notoriously eccentric aunt, Seraphina Thorne. And Blackwood Manor, a dilapidated Victorian monstrosity perched on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River, was a place Eleanor had vowed never to set foot in again.

But duty, especially familial duty, was a stubborn weed that refused to be eradicated, even in the most barren of hearts. And besides, the nagging feeling that something terrible had happened was too strong to ignore.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the dimly lit, cluttered office of Eleanor Abigail Thorne, Esq. The office is located in a historic building in the Bowery district of Manhattan, New York City, circa 1935. It's a small, cramped space that reflects Eleanor's pragmatic nature and slightly bohemian sensibilities. Filing cabinets overflow with case files, bookshelves are crammed with legal tomes and art books, and vintage posters depicting classic film noirs adorn the walls. The overall impression is one of determined competence struggling against the pressures of a city and a life that can feel relentlessly overwhelming. The grimy window overlooks a street waking up to another day of hustle and bustle, a stark contrast to the potential mystery brewing just beyond Eleanor’s door.
