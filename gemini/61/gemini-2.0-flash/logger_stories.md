Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scream of the Stihl 066 echoed through the ancient forest, a metallic shriek that momentarily silenced the chatter of ravens and the rustle of wind in the towering pines.  Sawdust exploded in a fine, golden spray as Jedediah “Jed”  Bartholomew wrestled the saw, its teeth biting deep into the heart of the old-growth Douglas fir. He braced himself, his heavily-muscled legs digging into the damp earth. He could feel the vibrations through his thick work gloves, the pulse of the engine a primal rhythm against his own heartbeat. Today was going to be another long day, but Jed didn't mind. He had a job to do. 

**Setting:**

The story is set in the misty, rugged terrain of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.  It's late fall, the air thick with the smell of damp earth, decaying leaves, and evergreen needles.  The forest is a tapestry of greens and browns, punctuated by the pale grey of fog clinging to the high peaks.  The trees are immense, some centuries old, their trunks thick as cars.  Undergrowth is dense, a tangled mess of ferns, salal, and thorny bushes.  The sky is perpetually overcast, casting a soft, diffused light across the landscape.  The nearest town, Forks, is several miles away, a small logging community clinging to the edge of the wilderness, its economy entirely dependent on the bounty of the forest. The area where Jed is working is a designated logging plot, owned by a large timber company.  It's a place where man clashes with nature, where the ancient beauty of the forest is slowly being chipped away, tree by tree.
