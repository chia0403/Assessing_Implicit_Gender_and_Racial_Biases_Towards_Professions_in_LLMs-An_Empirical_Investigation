Okay, here's a story opening with the requested details:

**Story Opening:**

The beige carpet felt strangely damp under Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's feet. He hated visiting accident sites. The metallic tang of blood always clung to the air, a grim reminder that paperwork rarely captured the true cost of human error. This one was particularly bad. A late-model sedan, crumpled like a discarded beer can, lay half-embedded in a sycamore tree. Yellow police tape rippled in the faint breeze, a silent warning against encroaching too close to the wreckage.

Bart adjusted his tie, its knot feeling suddenly too tight. He pulled out his phone, trying to get a better signal, and squinted at the crumpled claim form in his hand. Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, the claimant, was thankfully at the hospital. He was here to assess the damage, take pictures, and try to piece together the sequence of events that had turned a quiet Tuesday afternoon into a scene straight out of a horror film. He just hoped whatever he found would make sense, and maybe, just maybe, make sense of the gnawing feeling in his gut.

**Setting:**

The setting is a residential street in the small, affluent town of Havenwood, Connecticut. It's a leafy, idyllic place, the kind of town where people leave their doors unlocked and wave to each other on the sidewalk. The accident site is on a particularly picturesque stretch of road, lined with mature trees and well-manicured lawns. The time is early afternoon, around 2:00 PM, on a cool, overcast day. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the lingering smell of gasoline. The overall atmosphere is one of jarring contrast â€“ the peaceful tranquility of Havenwood shattered by the brutal reality of the car accident.
