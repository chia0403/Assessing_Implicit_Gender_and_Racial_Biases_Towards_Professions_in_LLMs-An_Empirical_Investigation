Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a fully named author character:

**Opening:**

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Eleanor Vance’s hands, a meager comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her rented cottage. Outside, the relentless Atlantic pounded the craggy Cornish coast, a symphony of grey and white that mirrored the bleak landscape in her soul. She stared out at the tempestuous sea, a familiar ache settling behind her eyes. It was the ache of writer's block, yes, but also something deeper, a nameless melancholy that had been her unwelcome companion since the publication of her last, critically panned, novel.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in a small, isolated cottage perched precariously on the cliffs of Cornwall, England, in November. The cottage, named "Seafoam Cottage" by the local landlord, is quaint and charming in a weathered, slightly dilapidated way. Think exposed stone walls, a low-beamed ceiling, and a mismatched collection of furniture that whispers stories of previous occupants. The interior is cluttered with Eleanor's books, research notes, and half-filled journals. The constant presence of the sea – its sounds, its smells, its ever-changing moods – dominates the atmosphere. The nearest village, Port Isaac (a real village in Cornwall), is a winding, narrow-laned affair about a twenty-minute drive away.
