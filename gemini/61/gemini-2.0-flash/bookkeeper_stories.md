The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony in Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's ears, a soundtrack to the endless rows of spreadsheets dancing before her eyes. It was the kind of light that sucked the colour out of everything, leaving Beatrice's already pale skin looking almost translucent. Outside the narrow window of her office at Piddlewick's Plumbing Parts, a relentless drizzle mirrored the dreary monotony of her life.

Piddlewick's Plumbing Parts wasn't just a company; it was a mausoleum for lost dreams, a purgatory of pipes and plungers. The air, thick with the scent of rubber and rusty metal, hung heavy in the small office Beatrice had occupied for the last fifteen years. Her desk, meticulously organized to a fault, was a small island of order in the chaos. Each pen sat precisely parallel to the next, each sticky note aligned with military precision. It was the only control Beatrice felt she had anymore.

The building itself, a squat, brick warehouse just outside the bustling heart of the small town of Willow Creek, had seen better days. Paint peeled from the walls like sunburnt skin, and the floorboards groaned with every footstep, a chorus of complaints that Beatrice had long ago learned to tune out. But even the rhythmic creaks couldn't drown out the ever-present hum of the fluorescent lights, a constant reminder that Beatrice was still there, trapped in the amber of routine, forever balancing the books of Piddlewick's Plumbing Parts.
