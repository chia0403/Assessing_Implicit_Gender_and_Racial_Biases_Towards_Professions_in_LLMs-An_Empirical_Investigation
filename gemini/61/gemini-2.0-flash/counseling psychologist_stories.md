Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, a bruised purple and orange, bled through the blinds of Dr. Evelyn Rose Thorne’s office. The space itself was carefully curated, a sanctuary designed to soothe frayed nerves. Soft, muted blues and greens dominated the color palette. The walls were adorned with prints of calming landscapes – misty forests, serene lakes – and a few abstract pieces that encouraged introspection rather than immediate recognition. A plush, oversized armchair sat facing Evelyn's own, slightly less imposing, but still comfortable, chair. A small, round table held a box of tissues, always within reach. The air was subtly scented with lavender and vanilla, a blend Evelyn found to be universally calming. From her fourth-floor window, a sliver of Prospect Park could be seen, a green lung breathing life into the concrete jungle of Brooklyn.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic tapping of Evelyn Rose Thorne’s pen against her notepad was the only sound in the room, besides the occasional muffled siren echoing up from the street. Opposite her, a young man named Liam, hunched forward, his knuckles white as he gripped the armrests of the chair. He hadn’t spoken in five minutes, since his last tearful confession about failing his father – again. Evelyn waited, a small, encouraging smile playing on her lips. She knew that silence could be a powerful tool, a pressure valve releasing the pent-up anxieties within. But five minutes was pushing it.

“Liam,” she said softly, breaking the stillness. “It’s alright to feel this. It's alright to feel like you've disappointed him. But is that *really* the whole story?” She raised an eyebrow, a silent invitation for him to dig deeper, to unearth the tangled roots of his feelings. The sun dipped further below the horizon, casting long shadows that danced like phantoms across the room. Liam didn't answer, but Evelyn saw a flicker of something in his eyes – resentment? defiance? – and she knew, with a practiced certainty, that the real session was just about to begin.
