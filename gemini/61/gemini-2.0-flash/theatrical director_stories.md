**Setting:** The cavernous, dusty interior of the Grand Majestic Theatre, located in the dilapidated arts district of a fading industrial city called Atheria. The theatre, once a jewel of vaudeville, is now a patchwork of peeling paint, ripped velvet seating, and the lingering scent of dust and forgotten dreams. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grimy, arched windows high above the stage, illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny, restless spirits. It is a late Tuesday afternoon in mid-October, the air holding a chilling bite that seeps through the cracks in the old walls.

**Story Opening:**

The echo of a single, thunderous clap reverberated through the cavernous space, followed by a protracted, disgruntled sigh. "That," declared Theodosia Beatrice Finch, her voice cutting through the stillness, "was profoundly…pathetic."

Theodosia stood center stage, bathed in the dim, filtered sunlight, a stark contrast to the three hapless actors cowering in the wings. She was a whirlwind of controlled chaos, her silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, a single strand persistently escaping to tickle her sharp jawline. Her posture was ramrod straight, her gaze laser-focused, and her hands, adorned with chunky, antique rings, were poised to conduct an orchestra of critique. She wore her usual uniform: a black turtleneck sweater that hinted at a past life of elegance and faded black trousers that spoke of the present struggle. The scent of sandalwood and theatrical smoke clung to her like a second skin.

"Mr. Henderson," she continued, her voice dripping with a theatrical disdain that could curdle milk, "your Romeo, bless his tragically short life, possessed more passion for his dry cleaning than for Juliet. And Miss Davies," she turned her piercing blue eyes on the trembling woman stage left, "your Nurse conveyed all the emotional depth of a rusty doorknob. As for you, Mr. Abernathy…well, let’s just say that Mercutio’s demise was less a noble sacrifice and more a merciful escape for the audience."

She paused, taking a dramatic drag from an unfiltered cigarette, the cherry glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom. "We have three weeks until opening night. Three weeks to transform this…travesty…into something resembling Shakespeare. So, let's try, shall we, to inject a little bit of soul into these poor, lifeless characters. From the top! And this time," she added, exhaling a plume of smoke that seemed to mock the very air they breathed, "imagine that your immortal souls depend on it. Because frankly, mine does."
