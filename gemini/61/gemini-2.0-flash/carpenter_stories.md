The late afternoon sun, a molten coin slipping behind the jagged teeth of the Blue Ridge Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across the workshop floor. Dust motes, disturbed by the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his hammer, danced in the golden light like tiny, impatient spirits. Elias Theodore Faulkner, his forehead beaded with sweat and sawdust clinging to the stubble on his jaw, paused in his work. He held the half-assembled rocking horse aloft, its smooth, unfinished wood glowing a warm honey color. 

He was in his element here, surrounded by the comforting scent of pine and cedar, the familiar weight of his tools in his calloused hands. The workshop, affectionately known as "The Sawdust Symphony" by his late wife, Margaret, was a converted section of the barn on their small farm just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. It was a chaotic but comforting space, a testament to decades of tinkering and crafting. Scraps of wood lay piled in corners like forgotten dreams, blueprints hung crookedly on the walls alongside faded photographs of Margaret and him, younger, their faces flushed with the joy of simpler times. The air hummed with the ghosts of past projects: a child's crib, a sturdy dining table, intricate birdhouses, each imbued with Elias's careful touch and unwavering dedication.

He squinted at the rocking horse, imagining a child's delighted laughter as it swayed back and forth. A small, bittersweet smile touched his lips. He wasn’t making it for a specific child, not yet. He was just… making. It was a rhythm, a comfort, a way to fill the silence that had been his constant companion since Margaret’s passing. The Sawdust Symphony needed to play on.
