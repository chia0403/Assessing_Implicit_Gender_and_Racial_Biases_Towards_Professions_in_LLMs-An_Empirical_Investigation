Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and character information.

**Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Elara Willowbrook

*   **Occupation:** Animal Caretaker

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** The Havenwood Sanctuary, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. It's a sprawling, privately funded animal rescue and rehabilitation center dedicated to native wildlife. Think lush forests, clear streams, and meadows dotted with wildflowers, with enclosures and buildings strategically placed to minimize human impact on the natural environment.
*   **Time:** Early autumn. The leaves are just starting to turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The air is crisp and carries the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke.

**Story Opening:**

The screech owl's eyes, wide and unnervingly intelligent, followed Elara Willowbrook as she entered the flight enclosure. Her boots crunched on the fallen leaves scattered across the aviary floor, the only sound besides the gentle rush of the nearby creek. The owl, a young male named Orion, perched on a thick branch, his mottled grey-brown plumage blending seamlessly with the bark. He'd been found tangled in barbed wire a few weeks ago, his wing badly damaged. Now, after weeks of careful tending, Elara was hoping to see him take his first test flight. Elara pulled a thick leather glove over her left hand. "Alright, Orion," she said softly, her voice barely a whisper. "Let's see what you can do." She held out a piece of raw chicken, the scent carrying on the cool morning air. Orion hesitated for a moment, then hopped down to her gloved hand, his talons surprisingly gentle. He devoured the offering in a few quick bites. Elara hoped it was a sign of strength and confidence, a promise of the freedom she longed to give him back.
