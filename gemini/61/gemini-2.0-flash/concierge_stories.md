## Story Opening:

The scent of lilies and old money hung thick in the air of the Grand Meridian Hotel lobby. Sunlight streamed through the towering, arched windows, illuminating the meticulously polished marble floor and the discreetly humming Klimt hanging above the registration desk. Eleanor Ainsworth-Hayes, impeccably dressed in her navy blue uniform, smoothed a stray strand of her silver-blonde hair behind her ear, a gesture she’d perfected over twenty years of service.  She plastered on her most practiced, welcoming smile, a smile that could soothe the anxieties of a nervous bride, defuse the temper of a demanding CEO, or coax a forgotten birthday into a night of unforgettable splendor.

Today, however, the smile felt a little strained. 

Mr. Sterling, the hotel's owner, had summoned her to his office this morning, a summons that reeked of impending doom. He'd only said, "Eleanor, my dear, a matter of some...delicacy requires your immediate attention." And when Reginald Sterling, a man who considered a wrinkle in his bespoke suit a personal affront, spoke of "delicacy," it usually meant a guest was about to cause an unspeakable scene.

Just then, the revolving door spun open, and the air shifted with the arrival of a whirlwind of fur and nervous energy. A woman, draped in a leopard-print coat that screamed "New Money," shrieked, "Where is she? Where is Eleanor Ainsworth-Hayes? I demand to speak to her *immediately!*"

Eleanor inhaled deeply, adjusting her smile.  This, she suspected, was the delicacy Mr. Sterling had been warning her about.
