## Story Opening:

The sun, a molten coin in the smoky dawn sky, did little to cut through the chill that clung to Silas Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley's bones. He took another long pull from his thermos of lukewarm coffee, the bitter liquid doing more to wake him up than the insistent chirping of the jobsite radio. Bart stared out at the scene before him: a ravaged landscape of jagged rocks, piles of displaced earth, and the skeletal remains of a soon-to-be-finished overpass. This was his kingdom, his canvas. And today, he was going to paint it with concrete.

## Setting:

The story takes place in a remote, mountainous region of western Colorado. The specific location is a sprawling construction site carved into the side of a steep incline. Bart and his crew are working to build a crucial section of a new interstate highway, designed to connect two isolated towns and improve freight transport. The air is thin and dry, often laced with dust from the constant movement of heavy machinery. The surrounding landscape is dominated by towering, snow-capped peaks, sparse pine forests, and unforgiving canyons. The overall atmosphere is one of grit, hard work, and a constant battle against the elements. Mobile trailers serve as makeshift offices and break rooms, providing a minimal level of comfort amidst the demanding environment. The sounds of roaring engines, the rhythmic clang of metal, and the shouted instructions of foremen fill the air, a symphony of progress in a rugged and unforgiving land.
