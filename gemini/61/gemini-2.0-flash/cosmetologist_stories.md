Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a cosmetologist:

**Setting:** The "Salon Serendipity," a vibrant and eclectic salon tucked away on a cobblestone side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. Sunlight streamed through the beveled glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and catching the sparkle of brightly colored beads and feathers draped artistically around vintage mirrors. The air hummed with the low thrum of jazz music, a constant soundtrack to the snipping of scissors and the murmur of conversations. It smelled of hairspray, citrus shampoo, and a faint hint of chicory coffee brewing in the back.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the Salon Serendipity jingled a cheerful, albeit slightly frantic, tune. Esmeralda Marie Dubois barely looked up from the intricate balayage she was meticulously applying to a client's flowing auburn locks. "Be right with you, cher," she called out, her voice laced with a warm Louisiana drawl that could soothe even the most stressed-out bride-to-be. But the jingle persisted, followed by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of polished nails on the front desk. Esmeralda sighed, carefully set down her brush, and wiped her hands on her apron.

"Alright, alright," she muttered, turning to face the interruption. "Patience, my darlings, patience is a virtue."  She rounded the corner, expecting to greet a harried tourist or a socialite rushing in for a last-minute touch-up. Instead, standing before her, was a man whose eyes held the intensity of a hurricane brewing offshore and hair that seemed to defy gravity, in all the wrong ways. His presence instantly disrupted the salon's carefully curated tranquility, like a discordant note in a jazz melody. And Esmeralda Marie Dubois knew, with a shiver that had nothing to do with the salon's breezy AC, that her day was about to get a whole lot more complicated than a bad root job.
