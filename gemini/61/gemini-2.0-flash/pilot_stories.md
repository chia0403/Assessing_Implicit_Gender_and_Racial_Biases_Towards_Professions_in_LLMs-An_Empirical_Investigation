Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a pilot as the main character:

**Setting:**

The story opens on the cracked and sun-baked tarmac of the Dust Devil Airfield, a forgotten relic nestled deep within the Mojave Desert. The air shimmers with heat, distorting the horizon and making the distant mountains appear to dance. The only signs of life besides a lone Joshua Tree stubbornly clinging to the parched earth are the rusting skeletons of abandoned planes and the dilapidated Quonset hut that serves as the airfield's office, its paint peeling like sunburned skin. The year is 1957, and the Cold War's shadow stretches even into this desolate corner of America.

**Opening:**

The screech of metal on metal was the only sound louder than the buzzing of the flies. Amelia "Amy" Claire Cartwright grunted, wrestling the stubborn access panel off the wing of her ancient Stearman biplane. Grease smeared across her brow and the faded blue of her flight suit. Damn carburetor. Again. She spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the dust, the gritty taste a familiar comfort. She squinted at the engine, a labyrinth of wires and pipes bathed in the unforgiving desert sun. This wasn't the life she'd imagined after graduating top of her class at flight school. Not the thrilling dogfights or daring rescue missions of the pulp magazines. This was… Dust Devils and dusty planes, giving joyrides to bored tourists and hauling the occasional crate of questionable goods across state lines. Amelia sighed. At least it was flying. And for now, that was enough. The radio crackled to life inside the Quonset hut, a static-laced voice cutting through the stillness. “Cartwright, Dust Devil. You copy?”
