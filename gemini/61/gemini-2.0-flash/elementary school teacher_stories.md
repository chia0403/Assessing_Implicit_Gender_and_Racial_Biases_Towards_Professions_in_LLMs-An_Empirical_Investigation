The insistent ringing of the school bell, a sound Amelia Josephine "Josie" Bell had grown to both loathe and love, sliced through the warm honey-gold afternoon. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight streaming through the windows of her classroom, creating miniature galaxies on the worn, linoleum floor. Room 2B, in the heart of Maplewood Elementary, was a riot of colorful chaos: paper mâché volcanoes precariously perched on desks, construction paper planets dangling from the fluorescent lights, and half-finished drawings of fantastical creatures scattered across the rug in the reading corner. Josie, perched on a tiny plastic chair, was surrounded by a gaggle of chattering seven-year-olds, each vying for her attention with tales of playground dramas and the complexities of trading Pokémon cards. It was Friday, thankfully, and the end-of-week energy was palpable, a fizzy, slightly manic undercurrent to the otherwise endearing pandemonium. But as much as she loved these little humans, Josie knew she needed a quiet evening, a strong cup of chamomile tea, and perhaps a good, old-fashioned novel to escape the miniature world she inhabited five days a week. The last thing she expected was for that escape to begin before she even left the building.
