## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:**  The humid air hung heavy with the scent of frangipani and something vaguely antiseptic, a hallmark of the Kai Lani Wellness Center, a sprawling, open-air spa nestled into the cliffside overlooking the turquoise waters of Oahu's North Shore. The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks below provided a constant, soothing soundtrack, punctuated occasionally by the screech of gulls overhead.  The massage bungalows, each a small haven of tranquility, were crafted from bamboo and adorned with flowing white curtains that danced in the gentle trade winds. 

**Story Opening:**

The knot in Evelyn Kai’s stomach tightened with each step she took across the polished teak floor.  Evelyn Kai, licensed massage therapist and, lately, purveyor of increasingly forced smiles, plastered another one on her face as she approached Bungalow Number Four. Through the gap in the curtains, she could see the pale, tense form of her next client, a woman whose profile picture on the Kai Lani's online booking system revealed a permanent frown and a penchant for diamond-studded sunglasses.  

Evelyn took a deep breath, trying to channel the calm serenity that radiated from the promotional photos of the Wellness Center. It was harder than usual today.  The usual ocean breeze felt stifling, the soothing music on the spa's speakers grated on her nerves, and the scent of frangipani just reminded her of Grandma Lehua's funeral lei from last month, and the mounting pressure to save the family's struggling coffee farm. 

She smoothed down the crisp white linen of her uniform, checked her watch one last time, and with a final, silent prayer for patience, she pulled back the curtains and entered Bungalow Number Four, ready to untie the knots in someone else’s body while her own felt irrevocably tangled.
