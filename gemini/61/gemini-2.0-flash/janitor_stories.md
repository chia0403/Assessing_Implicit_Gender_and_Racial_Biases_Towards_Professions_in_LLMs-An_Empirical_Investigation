Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a janitor as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The chime of the closing announcement echoed through the deserted halls of the Museum of Technological Marvels, a sound that usually brought a small, predictable measure of relief to *Percival Bartholomew Higgins*. But tonight, the familiar electronic melody only seemed to amplify the oppressive silence. Percy sighed, the sound lost in the cavernous rotunda where a gleaming, three-story-tall replica of the first computer, ENIAC, stood as a silent testament to human ingenuity. He adjusted the strap of his cleaning bucket, the plastic digging into his shoulder. Relief would have to wait. Tonight was Hologram Night, and Hologram Night always meant a mess.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place within the **Museum of Technological Marvels**, a sprawling, modern building located in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Its sleek, glass and steel exterior is a stark contrast to the aged artifacts and interactive exhibits held within. The museum houses a diverse collection, ranging from ancient astronomical tools to cutting-edge virtual reality simulations. The exhibits are divided into themed halls: The Age of Invention, The Digital Frontier, The Future is Now, and the aforementioned rotunda, which features the ENIAC replica as its centerpiece.

The museum is generally well-maintained during the day, bustling with tourists, school groups, and tech enthusiasts. However, after closing, the atmosphere shifts. The bright, inviting space transforms into a maze of shadows and echoing corridors, where the hum of deactivated machinery blends with the rhythmic swish of Percyâ€™s mop.

**Details:**

*   **The Age of Invention:** Filled with brassy gears, steam-powered contraptions, and models of early automobiles. Often needs dusting and polishing.

*   **The Digital Frontier:** Packed with vintage computers, gaming consoles, and displays showcasing the evolution of the internet. Prone to fingerprints and sticky spills from overenthusiastic gamers.

*   **The Future is Now:** Features holographic displays, robotic demonstrations, and interactive AI exhibits. This is where "Hologram Night" takes place, leading to the most significant mess of all.

*   **Rotunda:** Dominated by the enormous ENIAC replica. While visually impressive, it's a magnet for dust and requires meticulous cleaning to maintain its pristine appearance. The Rotunda also houses the museum's gift shop and a small cafe, both of which see their fair share of post-event debris.
