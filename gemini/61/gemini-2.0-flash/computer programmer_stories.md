Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a computer programmer:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the humid, mosquito-infested backwater town of Bayou Terrebonne, Louisiana.  It’s a place where the moss hangs heavy on ancient cypress trees, the air smells of brine and decaying vegetation, and the rhythmic drone of cicadas is the soundtrack to life.  Modernity struggles to take hold here; internet access is spotty at best, the power grid is constantly threatened by storms, and the closest thing to high-tech is the aging slot machines at the dimly lit Cajun Paradise Casino on the edge of town.  Most of the inhabitants rely on fishing, crabbing, or tourism for their livelihood, holding tightly to traditions that have been passed down for generations.  The local dialect is a thick, almost impenetrable blend of French, English, and Spanish, a linguistic gumbo that reflects the region's complex history.

**Opening:**

The humid air hung thick as soup, clinging to Elara Simone Dubois as she navigated the uneven, oyster-shell paved road. Every step was a calculated effort to avoid another ankle-twisting pothole. She cursed under her breath, swatting away a mosquito that dared to land on her already perspiring forehead. "Damn it all," she muttered, squinting against the glare bouncing off the swamp. "I should've stayed in Seattle."

Elara, a woman whose life revolved around the clean, crisp lines of code, felt utterly out of place in this verdant, decaying paradise. Her fingers, more accustomed to the smooth glide of a keyboard, were sticky with sweat. Her designer glasses constantly slid down her nose, and her minimalist, all-black wardrobe was tragically unsuitable for the swamp's oppressive heat and humidity.

She reached the ramshackle structure that served as her grandmother's house, a raised bungalow on stilts, painted a faded, almost ghostly, shade of blue. The porch sagged precariously, and the screen door hung askew. Elara had envisioned something a little more...habitable, based on her grandmother's letters. But then again, her grandmother's letters also suggested that the town had "lightning fast internet" and a "vibrant tech community."

Sighing, she pushed open the creaking gate.  Inside, the air was even heavier, thick with the scent of boiled shrimp, dust, and something vaguely floral that she couldn't quite place. "Grand-mère?" she called out, her voice barely audible above the drone of the cicadas.

A raspy voice answered from within, laced with a heavy Cajun accent, "Elara? Is that you, cherie?  Took you long enough. The gumbo's getting cold." Elara braced herself. Her mission was clear. Find the lost code that her grandmother needed, fix it if she could, and get back to Seattle before the mosquitos and the humidity drove her completely insane. But something told her this trip wasn't going to be that simple.
