## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of Tax Time Titans hummed a relentless, low-frequency thrum that vibrated through the soles of Theodore Bartholomew Finch's worn loafers. He'd become so accustomed to it, he barely registered it anymore. It was just another symptom of April. Another layer of stress on top of the mountain already threatening to bury him alive. He squinted at the screen, the pixelated glow reflecting in his thick-rimmed glasses. Another Schedule C, another self-employed electrician who seemed to think "creative accounting" was an Olympic sport. Theodore sighed, a small, defeated sound lost in the rhythmic clack of his keyboard. He longed for October, for the blessed reprieve of extension season, when the air thinned and the desperation subsided, replaced by a calmer, more manageable level of bewilderment.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in Tax Time Titans, a regional income tax preparation franchise located in the bustling, if slightly rundown, strip mall of Sunnyvale Plaza, in the sleepy suburb of Meadowbrook, Pennsylvania. The office itself is a study in beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige filing cabinets overflowing with paper mountains that threatened to topple with the slightest sneeze. Four cubicles, each equipped with a computer, a phone permanently glued to the ear, and a growing collection of coffee stains, are squeezed into the space. A communal break room, barely big enough to swing a cat (not that Theodore would ever swing a cat), houses a perpetually broken coffee maker and a microwave that smelled perpetually of burnt popcorn. Outside, the late-afternoon sun casts long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, highlighting the faded paint of the Tax Time Titans logo on the window. The scent of frying onions from the adjacent "Burger Bliss" wafts in occasionally, a constant reminder of the fleeting pleasures of the outside world, a world Theodore Bartholomew Finch hasn't truly seen in weeks.
