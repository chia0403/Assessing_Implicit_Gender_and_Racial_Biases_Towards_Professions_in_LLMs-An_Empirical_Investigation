## The Story Opening:

The humid Miami air clung to Arthur Bartholomew Finch like a second skin, doing little to soothe the simmering anxiety churning in his gut. He adjusted his tie, the silk knot already damp with sweat, and pasted on what he hoped was a winning smile. He’d rehearsed this pitch a hundred times, visualized the handshake, the contract signing, even the celebratory mojito afterwards. But all the preparation in the world couldn't quite quell the tremor in his hand as he reached for the imposing brass handle of “The Golden Sands” retirement residence. This wasn’t just any sale. This was everything. This was the culmination of a grueling quarter, the difference between keeping his job and explaining to his wife, Eleanor, why their beachside condo was about to become a distant, sun-drenched memory. He took a deep breath, the salty air doing little to calm his nerves, and pushed the door open, the jingle of the little golden bell above sounding suspiciously like a death knell.

## The Setting:

**The Golden Sands Retirement Residence**, Miami Beach, Florida. The building itself is a gaudy, five-story edifice painted a faded, almost sickly, shade of yellow, attempting to evoke the golden sands it's named after. Palm trees, strung with perpetually blinking fairy lights, line the entrance, their fronds swaying in the warm breeze. The lobby is a jarring explosion of floral prints and polished marble. A fountain gurgles incessantly in the center, spewing recycled water that smells vaguely of chlorine. Elderly residents, a kaleidoscope of brightly colored leisurewear and walkers, populate the plush velvet armchairs, watching daytime television with vacant stares. The air is thick with the scent of potpourri and despair, a strange and unsettling cocktail that clings to everything. Outside, the shimmering turquoise of the Atlantic Ocean beckons, a constant reminder of the freedom and vitality these residents have, in many ways, left behind. It's a place where dreams go to retire, and Arthur Bartholomew Finch is about to try and sell them a piece of the afterlife.
