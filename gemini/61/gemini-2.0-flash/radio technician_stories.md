## Opening:

The hum was a constant companion to Evelyn "Eve" Mallory, a low, throbbing presence that vibrated through her bones and settled in the dusty crevices of her memory. It wasn't an unpleasant hum, not exactly. More like the gentle purr of a contented beast, a reminder that the innards of WXRQ were alive and breathing, even at three in the morning. Tonight, however, the hum wasâ€¦ off. Subtly different. Higher pitched, perhaps, or maybe just vibrating at a slightly discordant frequency. Eve couldn't quite put her finger on it, but it prickled at the back of her neck, raising the tiny hairs in alarm.

She adjusted the focus on her headset, the metallic taste of anxiety coating her tongue. The city was quiet, the streets below cloaked in a pre-dawn stillness that magnified the mechanical cacophony emanating from the transmitter room. Usually, this hour was her sanctuary. Just Eve, the hum, and the lonely stretches of static she monitored, ensuring the signal remained strong, a beacon cutting through the darkness. Tonight, though, the silence outside felt pregnant with something unknown, something echoed in the unsettling shift in the machinery around her.

She tugged at the collar of her worn, "WXRQ Radio" t-shirt and took a deep breath. "Just the usual gremlins, Eve," she muttered to herself, her voice barely a whisper above the incessant drone. "Nothing you can't handle." But the unease persisted, a cold knot forming in the pit of her stomach.

## Setting:

The setting is the bustling city of New Orleans, Louisiana, but more specifically, the WXRQ radio station nestled high on the twenty-second floor of a pre-war art deco skyscraper downtown.

*   **Interior:** The transmitter room itself is a claustrophobic space packed with antiquated equipment. Vacuum tubes glow with an orange, otherworldly light, casting long, dancing shadows across the labyrinth of wires, dials, and meters. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and warm metal, a testament to years of uninterrupted operation. Exposed brick walls are adorned with faded posters of bygone radio personalities and schematic diagrams covered in Eve's meticulous annotations. The floor is a patchwork of stained linoleum and worn rubber mats, constantly vibrating with the hum of the machinery.

*   **Exterior:** Through the grimy windows, Eve can see the sprawling city stretching out below. The Mississippi River snakes its way through the urban landscape, its dark waters reflecting the faint glow of streetlights. In the distance, the French Quarter pulses with a low thrum of its own, even at this ungodly hour, hinting at the vibrant energy that sleeps just beneath the surface of the quiet city. The imposing steel girders of the building frame her view, reminding her of the sheer weight of the responsibility she carries: to keep the voice of WXRQ echoing across the airwaves.

This combination of the aging, humming technology within the isolated room, juxtaposed against the vast, potentially chaotic city outside, creates a feeling of vulnerability and heightens the tension of the story opening.
