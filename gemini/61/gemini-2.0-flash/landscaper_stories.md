The morning air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp earth and the promise of later rain. It clung to Miguel Angel Ramirez like a second skin as he wrestled the stubborn pull-cord of his ancient lawnmower. He cursed under his breath in a rapid-fire Spanish that would have made his abuela blush, then gave the cord another, more desperate yank. Finally, with a protesting wheeze and a cloud of blue smoke, the engine sputtered to life.

Miguel, or Mike as most of his clients knew him, ran a calloused hand through his already disheveled dark hair. He took a deep breath, the smell of gasoline momentarily overriding the sweet scent of petunias, and surveyed his current battlefield: the immaculate, if somewhat sterile, front lawn of Mrs. Eleanor Abernathy, a woman whose meticulousness extended to her garden gnomesâ€™ mustaches.

The Abernathy residence was located in the upscale gated community of Willow Creek Estates, nestled just outside the sprawling metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona. Each house in the community was a testament to manicured lawns and perfectly sculpted shrubbery, a verdant oasis in the arid desert landscape. Spanish-style architecture, with terracotta roofs and stucco walls, dominated the neighborhood, creating a uniformity that bordered on oppressive. It was a place where conformity reigned supreme, and even the squirrels seemed to follow strict HOA guidelines. And Miguel, with his slightly-too-long hair, worn work boots, and perpetually grass-stained jeans, felt perpetually out of place amongst the pristine perfection. Still, it paid the bills, and Mrs. Abernathy, despite her demanding nature, was a reliable client. He just hoped he could finish the lawn before the desert heat turned oppressive and the sky opened up in a downpour. He had a feeling today was going to be one of *those* days.
