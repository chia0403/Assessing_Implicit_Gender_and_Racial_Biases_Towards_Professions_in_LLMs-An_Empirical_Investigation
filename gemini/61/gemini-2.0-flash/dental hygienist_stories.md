## Story Opening:

The acrid scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a constant reminder of battles fought and won – battles against plaque, tartar, and the insidious march of gingivitis. Eleanor Grace Harding, her name embroidered in a cheerful robin's egg blue on the breast pocket of her crisp white coat, sighed and adjusted her mask. It was 7:58 AM, two minutes until her first patient, Mrs. Gable, notorious for her aggressive flossing habits and even more aggressive gossip, was due to arrive. Eleanor straightened the neatly arranged instruments on her tray: the gleaming scaler, the whisper-quiet suction tip, and the familiar, comforting tube of mint-flavored prophylaxis paste. Outside, the traffic on Elm Street was already a cacophony of honking horns and rumbling engines, but in Suite 204 of Gentle Smiles Dental Practice, it was almost… serene. Or at least, it would be until Mrs. Gable arrived.

## Setting:

The setting is Gentle Smiles Dental Practice, located on the second floor of a red-brick building on Elm Street, in the heart of the bustling small city of Maplewood. The waiting room is designed for maximum comfort and minimal intimidation: plush, floral-patterned armchairs surround a coffee table laden with magazines and a half-finished jigsaw puzzle depicting a tranquil forest scene. Soft, instrumental music plays through hidden speakers, attempting to soothe pre-appointment jitters. The hallway leading to the operatories is lined with framed prints of smiling faces and posters promoting proper oral hygiene. Eleanor's operatory, Suite 204, is small but functional, with a dental chair bathed in the cool glow of overhead lights. A large window overlooks the street, offering a slightly distorted view of the everyday drama unfolding below. The room is meticulously clean, a testament to Eleanor's dedication and her slight obsession with order. Even the tiny plastic dinosaurs guarding the shelf of fluoride rinses are arranged by height. It's a place of precision, routine, and a surprising amount of whispered confidences.
