The biting wind whipped at Dr. Alistair Humphrey Finch's wool coat as he navigated the slush-slicked streets of Whitestone. Streetlights cast a jaundiced glow on the freshly fallen snow, turning the picturesque Victorian houses into ghostly silhouettes against the inky sky. Whitestone, a small, insular town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, held onto its secrets tighter than the cold held onto the skin. Alistair, however, had always been drawn to secrets, to the unsaid and unseen, and that was precisely what had led him here three years ago, after leaving the sterile confines of a bustling Boston hospital. He'd traded cutting-edge medicine for folk remedies and a community suspicious of outsiders, hoping for a simpler life, a closer connection to the heart of healing. He wasn't sure he'd found it yet, but the silence of the mountains had a way of burying itself deep, offering a different kind of solace. Tonight, though, the silence felt heavy, pregnant with an unspoken dread that mirrored the knot tightening in his own stomach. The call from old Mrs. Gable, her voice trembling and barely audible above the static, had set him on edge. "It's Agnes, Doctor Finch," she'd whispered, her words laced with a fear that transcended the usual anxieties of old age. "Something ain't right with Agnes. Somethingâ€¦ unnatural."
