## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The small, forgotten town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood had seen better days. The coal mines had closed down twenty years ago, leaving behind a husk of boarded-up storefronts and a lingering air of quiet desperation. The mountains that ringed the town, once a source of livelihood, now seemed to loom over it like judgmental giants. The air was always thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the winters were brutal.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Havenwood Pharmacy jangled a familiar, lonely tune as Elias Thorne stepped inside, shaking the wet snow from his worn leather boots. The aroma of camphor and something vaguely floral, likely Mrs. Henderson's attempts at masking the medicinal scents with air freshener, hung in the air. Elias, whose full name was **Elias Theodore Thorne**, glanced around the sparsely populated store. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of dusty cough syrups and outdated magazines. At 38, he was the sole pharmacist in Havenwood, a responsibility he had inherited from his father and grandfather before him. He ran a hand through his thinning brown hair, pushing it back from his tired eyes. The last customer had been three hours ago â€“ old Mr. Abernathy, needing a refill on his blood pressure medication, paid for with crumpled dollar bills and a shaky hand.

He knew he should close up, but the wind howled outside, rattling the windows and painting icy patterns on the glass. The thought of venturing back into the storm, back to his empty apartment above the pharmacy, filled him with a weariness that settled deep in his bones. He leaned against the counter, the cold linoleum seeping through his jeans. Havenwood was slowly dying, and he felt like he was dying right along with it. He wondered, not for the first time, if he should just pack it all up, leave the ghost of his family's legacy behind, and find a place where the wind didn't always sound like a lament. But then, he thought of Mr. Abernathy, and Mrs. Henderson, and all the other fragile souls who depended on him, and the thought withered before it could fully bloom. He was, after all, the only pharmacist in Havenwood. And that, he knew, meant something.
