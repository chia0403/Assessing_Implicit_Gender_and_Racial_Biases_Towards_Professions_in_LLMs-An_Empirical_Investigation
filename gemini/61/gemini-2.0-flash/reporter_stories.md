The chipped ceramic mug warmed Eleanor Vance's hands, but did little to thaw the icy grip clinging to her chest. Outside, the incessant San Francisco rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of her makeshift office, a converted storage unit nestled deep within the shadow of the Bay Bridge. Inside, the air was thick with the cloying scent of stale coffee, damp newspaper, and the ever-present anxiety that clung to her like the fog rolling in off the bay.

Eleanor Vance, investigative reporter for the now-struggling "San Francisco Clarion," stared at the photograph taped to her computer monitor. It showed a smiling man, tanned and relaxed, holding a fishing rod and a string of trout the size of her arm. The caption, neatly typed beneath, read: "Daniel Blackwood - 1998 Salmon Fishing Champion."

Daniel Blackwood had vanished without a trace three weeks ago, a disappearance barely making a ripple in the city's ever-churning news cycle. A wealthy venture capitalist going missing? Happens all the time. Runaways, drug overdoses, accidental falls into the bay – the city swallowed people whole, and spat them out in headlines too brief to remember. But something about Blackwood’s disappearance felt different, a tremor beneath the surface, a silent scream echoing in the affluent silence of his Pacific Heights mansion. And Eleanor, struggling to keep the Clarion afloat amidst dwindling readership and corporate buy-out rumors, was determined to be the one to hear it.
