The buzzing of the fluorescent lights was the soundtrack to Eleanor Maeve O’Connell’s existence. She hated it, that incessant, low-grade hum, but it was also a comfort. Like the quiet thrum of a well-maintained transformer, it meant things were working, electricity was flowing, and life, of a sort, was going on.

The setting was the abandoned wing of the old St. Jude’s Hospital, a relic of a time when medicine was practiced with more heart than technology. It stood on a forgotten corner of Port Blossom, Maine, its brick facade stained with decades of salty wind and creeping ivy. The air hung thick with the ghosts of antiseptic and despair, a smell that clung to the peeling paint and the dust-covered gurneys that littered the hallways. Eleanor had been contracted by a developer to rewire the place, a prerequisite before the whole decaying structure could be condemned and leveled to make way for luxury condos.

Eleanor, perched precariously on a wobbly step ladder in what used to be a patient room, frowned. Her headlamp cast a stark, unforgiving light on the frayed ends of wires poking from a gaping hole in the ceiling. This room, Room 312, felt colder than the others, the silence more profound. She could almost hear the faint whisper of… something. Shaking her head, she attributed it to drafts and her overactive imagination. She was, after all, alone in a crumbling hospital, tasked with bringing electricity back to a place that seemed determined to remain in the dark. And she had a nagging feeling, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck, that the darkness wasn't just the absence of light.
