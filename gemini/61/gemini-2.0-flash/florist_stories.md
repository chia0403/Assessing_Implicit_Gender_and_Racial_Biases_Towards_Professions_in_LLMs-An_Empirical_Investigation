The scent of hyacinths, sharp and sweet, clung to Amelia Isabella Bloom like a second skin. It was a Tuesday morning in April, and "Bloom & Bloom," her petite flower shop nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Salem, Massachusetts, was buzzing. Not with customers, not yet, but with the low hum of the refrigerator unit and the rustle of Amelia sorting through a fresh delivery of ranunculus, their tissue-paper petals unfurling like secrets. Sunlight, dappled and filtered through the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel outside the shop, painted stripes across the worn wooden floor. It was a perfect, almost aggressively charming, New England scene. 

Amelia, dressed in her usual uniform of floral-print overalls and a slightly paint-stained t-shirt, hummed along to the Edith Piaf record crackling softly from the vintage turntable in the corner. She loved this time of day, the quiet before the storm of tourists and locals seeking bouquets for anniversaries, apologies, or simply a fleeting burst of beauty. It allowed her a moment to connect with the blooms, to appreciate the subtle variations in shade and form, the stories each flower seemed to whisper. Little did she know, the quiet was about to be shattered by a request far more bizarre and unsettling than any she'd ever encountered in her twenty years of arranging petals.
