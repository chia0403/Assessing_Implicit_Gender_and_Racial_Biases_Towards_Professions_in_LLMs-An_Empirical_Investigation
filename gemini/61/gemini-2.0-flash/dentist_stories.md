**Story Opening:**

The scream ripped through the sterile hum of the dental office, a sound so raw and unexpected it sent a jolt of adrenaline through Dr. Eleanor Maeve Harding. It wasn’t the usual whimper of a child facing a looming extraction, or the strained groan of someone gripping the chair during a root canal. This was primal, guttural, a sound that belonged in a horror film, not in the quiet, upper-middle-class suburb of Meadowbrook. Eleanor, mid-extraction with Mrs. Henderson and her troublesome wisdom tooth, froze, her gloved hand hovering, forceps still poised near the woman's jaw.

“Everything alright, dear?” Mrs. Henderson mumbled around the gauze already stuffed in her mouth, her eyes wide with a mixture of pain and confusion.

Eleanor, heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs, managed a reassuring smile, though the tremor in her fingers betrayed her unease. “Just a… a little gas leak, probably. We’ll call the maintenance people. Shouldn’t be anything to worry about.” Liar. It sounded like someone was being murdered.

The scream came again, fainter this time, but no less terrifying. It seemed to be coming from…the basement.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Maeve Harding's dental practice, "Harding Family Dentistry," occupied the ground floor of a meticulously maintained Victorian house on Elm Street in Meadowbrook, Connecticut. The building itself was a testament to Eleanor’s dedication to her profession and her meticulous nature. Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, illuminating the carefully arranged magazines in the waiting room and the gleaming surfaces of the reception desk. The walls were painted a soothing shade of mint green, adorned with framed prints of landscapes and anatomical diagrams of teeth (tastefully done, of course).

The interior was divided into three fully-equipped operatories, each with its own dental chair, X-ray machine, and array of sterilized instruments. The air, usually thick with the antiseptic scent of dental cleaners and the faint aroma of spearmint gum, was now tainted by a metallic tang that had nothing to do with oral hygiene.

The basement, usually a haven of forgotten files, dusty cleaning supplies, and a perpetually humming water heater, lay beneath the practiced tranquility of the office. It was dark, damp, and distinctly…unpleasant. And now, it was the source of a terrifying secret.
