## Story Opening:

The grimy gargoyle cast a long, skeletal shadow across the rain-slicked cobblestones, mimicking the chill that had settled deep in Corporal Silas Blackwood's bones. Another night, another endless vigil. He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his breastplate creaking in protest, and tugged his woolen hood further down, trying to ward off the biting wind that whipped off the Black Sea. The lantern swinging beside the gate sputtered, threatening to plunge him into complete darkness, a darkness that seemed to press in, hungry and watchful. Tonight felt…different. It wasn’t just the usual unsettling quiet of Old Town, the whispers carried on the wind from the abandoned docks, or the mournful cry of a stray cat echoing through the labyrinthine alleyways. No, there was a tangible tension in the air, a prickling unease that made the hairs on his arms stand on end. He gripped the hilt of his sword, the cold steel a familiar comfort in the unsettling stillness, and muttered a silent prayer to the city’s patron saint, a habit he'd picked up from his grandmother, though he'd long since lost his faith. Tonight, something was coming.

## Setting:

The city of Veridium clings to the jagged cliffs overlooking the Black Sea like a tenacious limpet. It’s a city divided, both literally and figuratively. The New City, built on the upper plateau, boasts gleaming white marble structures, opulent merchant houses, and wide, well-lit avenues patrolled by the elite Silver Guard. But below, clinging to the cliff face and spilling down towards the docks, lies Old Town – a sprawling, decaying labyrinth of crumbling stone buildings, narrow, twisting alleyways, and shadowy courtyards. Generations of merchants, sailors, and forgotten trades have left their mark on its grimy facades. Here, the air is thick with the smell of brine, rotting fish, and the ever-present hint of coal smoke from the numerous workshops. The only light comes from flickering oil lamps and the occasional lantern hung outside taverns, casting long, distorted shadows that dance and writhe like phantoms. It is in this lower district, guarding the main gate separating Old Town from the more affluent New City, that Silas Blackwood stands his watch. The gate itself is a hulking iron monstrosity, reinforced with thick oak timbers and guarded by two squat watchtowers that seem to brood over the narrow entrance like disapproving sentinels. Beyond the gate lies the promise of wealth and comfort; within, the reality of poverty and despair.
