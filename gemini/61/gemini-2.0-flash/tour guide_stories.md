The stale, floral scent of the Golden Orchid Teahouse always hit Eleanor Marie Dubois like a velvet curtain. It was a scent of dried potpourri, jasmine tea past its prime, and a faint, lingering sweetness that spoke of decades of spilled sugar. Usually, it was a comforting smell, the aroma of familiarity, but this morning it felt suffocating. Eleanor tugged at the collar of her crisp white blouse, the humidity already starting to cling like a second skin.

Outside, the Shanghai sun beat down on the Bund, turning the historic buildings into shimmering mirages. The crowds, a restless ocean of tourists and locals, were already swelling, eager to capture the perfect Instagram shot of the Bund’s colonial architecture against the futuristic Pudong skyline. It was 9:58 AM, two minutes until Eleanor was due to meet her group for the "Shanghai Through the Ages" walking tour, and a knot of anxiety was tightening in her stomach. This was her fifth tour this week, and the enthusiasm she usually projected was wearing thin. The ghosts of history felt heavy on her shoulders today, the weight of stories she’d told a thousand times threatening to crush her. She just hoped she could conjure the energy to make it sound fresh, to make the past come alive for a new set of faces, before the Shanghai heat truly kicked in.
