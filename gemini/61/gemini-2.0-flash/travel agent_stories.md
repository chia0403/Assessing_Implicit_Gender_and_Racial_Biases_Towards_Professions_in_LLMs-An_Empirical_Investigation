Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a travel agent named Clara Beatrice Ainsworth:

**Opening:**

The scent of stale airplane peanuts and disinfectant clung to the air of Ainsworth Adventures like a particularly persistent travel bug. Clara Beatrice Ainsworth, owner, operator, and chief daydream weaver, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her chipped, crimson fingernails against the keyboard. Another rejection. Another client, lured by the siren song of cheap online deals, who’d discovered that "affordable luxury" translated to a hotel room the size of a broom closet overlooking a dumpster fire. They always came crawling back, eventually. They always needed a human being to untangle the mess they'd made. But today, the crawling wasn’t happening fast enough.

Clara glanced at the dusty Eiffel Tower paperweight on her desk, a souvenir from her own long-ago Parisian adventure, and considered, not for the first time, selling the whole damn business and becoming a shepherdess in the Scottish Highlands. At least the sheep wouldn't complain about the lack of mini-bar options. The phone buzzed, jolting her from her sheep-induced reverie. She grabbed it, forcing a smile into her voice.

"Ainsworth Adventures, Clara speaking, how can I help you find your next great escape?"

**Setting:**

Ainsworth Adventures occupies a narrow storefront in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint, somewhat forgotten suburb nestled between sprawling farmland and the ever-expanding city limits of Metropolis. The office is a chaotic, yet comforting, blend of the old and new.

*   **The Building:** The building itself is a two-story brick affair, painted a cheerful (if faded) robin's egg blue. A slightly crooked, hand-painted sign hangs above the door, proclaiming "Ainsworth Adventures – Your Journey Starts Here!"

*   **Interior:** Inside, the walls are plastered with faded travel posters – images of sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins, each a promise of adventure waiting to be unlocked. A world map, meticulously marked with pins indicating Clara's own travels and her clients' destinations, dominates one wall.

*   **Clara's Desk:** Clara's desk, a large, oak roll-top inherited from her grandfather (who had also been a travel agent), is the epicenter of organized chaos. Stacks of brochures, travel guides, and half-finished itineraries are piled high, alongside coffee-stained mugs, a collection of passport-sized photos, and a well-worn copy of "Lonely Planet: The World."

*   **The Atmosphere:** The air inside is thick with the aroma of old paper, cheap coffee, and a faint undercurrent of floral potpourri – a gift from a well-meaning client who'd returned from a cruise with a suitcase full of scented sachets. It's a place that feels both familiar and slightly stuck in time, a sanctuary for those who still believe in the magic of travel. The only modern element is a recently-installed flat screen TV that perpetually shows nature documentaries on mute.
