The flickering fluorescent lights of the Oakhaven Public Library hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to a life lived between towering stacks and the hushed whispers of turning pages. Humidity, thick and cloying from the recent summer rain, clung to the air, making the old leather-bound books smell even mustier than usual. Beyond the large, arched windows, the town square of Oakhaven drowsed under the late afternoon sun, the fountain gurgling a lazy counterpoint to the library's interior hum.

Here, amidst the chaos of misplaced Dewey Decimal cards and perpetually overdue children's books, resided Eleanor Ainsworth. She wasn't a glamorous librarian, the kind you see in movies with perfectly coiffed hair and a secret love for poetry. Eleanor's hair, usually pulled back in a practical bun that was always threatening to unravel, was currently adorned with a wayward wisp escaping from its confines. Her sensible shoes, purchased for comfort more than aesthetics, squeaked slightly as she navigated the labyrinthine aisles, a half-eaten apple clutched in one hand and a tattered copy of "Wuthering Heights" tucked under her other arm. Eleanor found a certain solace in the familiar routine, the predictable rhythm of the library a comforting anchor in a world that often felt anything but. And today, that comfort was about to be shattered.
