**Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and impending doom hung thick in the air of the Westlake Probation Office. For Amelia Rose Thornton, it was just another Tuesday. She pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the headache that threatened to explode behind her eyes. This was her second interview of the day, and the young man sitting across from her fidgeted with the frayed edges of his worn denim jacket, radiating nervous energy. Amelia had seen it all before: bravado masking fear, regret simmering under a veneer of indifference. She just hoped this one wouldn't escalate into something more. Today, Amelia had a gut feeling that something was off.

**Setting:**

The Westlake Probation Office occupied a prime spot on the third floor of a drab, seven-story brick building nestled between a pawn shop and a discount tax service in a less-than-desirable part of the city. Sunlight, when it managed to pierce through the smog, struggled to reach the perpetually grimy windows. Inside, the walls were painted a sickly shade of institutional green, a color that seemed to suck the life out of the already weary occupants. The furniture was a mismatched collection of hand-me-downs and government surplus: uncomfortable vinyl chairs, scarred metal desks, and filing cabinets that groaned in protest with every opening and closing. The only attempt at decoration was a motivational poster featuring a stock photo of a soaring eagle, ironically captioned with "Reach for Your Potential!" - a sentiment that seemed particularly cruel in this environment. The constant hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sirens wailing in the city provided a constant, low-level hum of anxiety. It was a place where hope went to die, and Amelia Rose Thornton spent her days trying to resurrect it.
