The screech of rusted metal protesting its imprisonment under layers of grime and neglect was a symphony to Silas “Si” Bartholomew Finch, a symphony he often conducted with his trusty, well-worn wrench. The air in Finch's Garage, nestled deep in the forgotten heart of Oakhaven, smelled of oil, sweat, and a lingering hint of pine from the surrounding woods. Sunbeams, thick with dust motes, sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating the scattered tools, the half-disassembled engines propped up on cinder blocks, and the ever-present layer of grease coating nearly every surface. It was a controlled chaos, a testament to Si's focused, if somewhat eccentric, mind. He knew exactly where every bolt, every socket, every piece of salvaged metal resided.

Si himself, a man built like an oak tree with hands that could crush a beer can but coax a carburetor back to life, hummed along to the imagined music as he wrestled with the frozen lug nuts of a 1967 Ford Mustang. He was a creature of habit, content in his solitude and the comforting rhythm of metal on metal. This garage, inherited from his grandfather, was his sanctuary, a place where rust buckets were reborn and silence spoke volumes.
