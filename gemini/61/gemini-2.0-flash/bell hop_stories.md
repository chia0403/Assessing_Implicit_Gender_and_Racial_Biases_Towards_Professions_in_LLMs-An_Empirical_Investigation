## Story Opening:

The brass gleamed under the relentless Texas sun, a mocking shine against the peeling paint and cracked marble of the Hotel Grandiose. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins adjusted the strap of his luggage cart, the familiar weight a comfort against the hollow ache in his stomach. He watched a dust devil dance across the parched lawn, a swirling dervish of dirt and despair, much like his own life, he figured. Heâ€™d been pushing carts and carrying bags at the Grandiose since he was barely tall enough to see over the registration desk. Another sweltering Tuesday, another parade of transient faces passing through, leaving only crumpled dollar bills and echoes of lives lived somewhere else. Today, though, felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a low hum that resonated in Bart's bones. He could feel it, just under the surface, a storm brewing, and it wasn't just the Texas weather.

## Setting:

The Hotel Grandiose, nestled (or rather, crumbling) on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Texas, was once the jewel of the region. Built in the flamboyant art deco style of the 1930s, it boasted soaring ceilings, intricate ironwork, and a ballroom that could host a hundred couples waltzing. Now, however, it was a faded relic, a testament to bygone glamour. Dust devils plagued its neglected gardens, its swimming pool was perpetually empty and cracked, and the once-opulent lobby was littered with worn velvet furniture and the ghosts of grander times. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and cheap air freshener, a potent cocktail that clung to the worn carpets and whispered of forgotten scandals and broken dreams. Only a handful of guests occupied its cavernous rooms, mostly weary travelers seeking a cheap bed and a hot shower, or the occasional local down on their luck, looking for a temporary escape from their own bleak reality. The Grandiose was a place where time seemed to slow down, where the past clung to the present like a persistent shadow, and where hope, like the promised renovations, was always just out of reach.
