**Story Opening:**

The clang of the alarm ripped Elias Thorne from a dream he couldn't quite grasp, a fleeting vision of a sun-drenched beach and the murmur of the ocean. He swore under his breath, tangled in the sweat-dampened sheets. Not again. He’d barely gotten an hour of sleep. He fumbled for the bedside lamp, the harsh glare momentarily blinding, and lurched out of bed, adrenaline already starting to pump. The voice over the station's intercom crackled, the robotic tone betraying none of the urgency that Elias felt building in his chest.

"Structure fire, two-story residential, 34 Maplewood Drive. Possible entrapment. All units respond."

Elias, already halfway into his turnout gear, muttered a prayer he'd recited countless times. *Please, let everyone be alright.* He didn't dwell on the 'possible entrapment.' Dwelling never helped. Action did.

**Setting:**

Elias is a firefighter at Station 16 in the small, close-knit town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Havenwood is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and the annual apple festival is the highlight of the year. The fire station, a sturdy brick building with a towering bell tower that's been silent for decades, sits just off Main Street, a comforting presence for the community. Inside, the air always smells faintly of diesel and sweat, a testament to the hard work and camaraderie within its walls. The station is more than just a workplace; it’s a second home, a refuge shared by a motley crew of men and women who rely on each other in the face of danger. The walls are adorned with framed photographs of past fires, team snapshots, and hand-drawn pictures from local school children, a constant reminder of the lives they protect and the trust placed upon them.
