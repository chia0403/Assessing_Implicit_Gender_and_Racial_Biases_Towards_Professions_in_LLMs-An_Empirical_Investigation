The fluorescent lights of Klein, Rothstein, and Associates hummed, casting a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing stacks of documents that threatened to engulf Margaret Eleanor Davies at her desk. It was a Tuesday, meaning deposition prep for the Johnson v. Sterling case was in full swing, and Margaret, paralegal extraordinaire (or at least, that’s what she told herself on days like this), was buried in the bowels of medical records. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated only by the rhythmic clack of Margaret’s keyboard as she tirelessly cataloged every cough, ache, and pain Mr. Johnson had allegedly endured after his unfortunate encounter with Mr. Sterling’s carelessly reversed pickup truck. The office, a sprawling, beige-carpeted labyrinth on the 32nd floor of the First National Bank building in downtown Chicago, was a study in organized chaos, reflecting the frenetic energy of the lawyers who inhabited it. Outside, the city glittered with the promise of happy hour and after-work escapades, a stark contrast to the grim reality within these walls. Margaret sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. Tonight, it would be takeout and more document review. Glamour was clearly not in the job description.
