Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an editor named Eliza Jane Thornton:

**Opening:**

Eliza Jane Thornton hated Tuesdays. Not for any particularly dramatic reason, just the accumulation of a hundred small irritations that seemed to coalesce and cling to her like lint in a dark closet. Today’s irritant started with the aroma of burnt coffee emanating from the office kitchen, a scent so pervasive it seeped into her soul and made her teeth ache. Then came the discovery that someone had replaced her meticulously curated playlist of classical music with a relentless loop of 80s power ballads. And finally, to cap it all off, a manuscript titled "Chronicles of Eldoria: The Emerald Orb of Eternal Darkness," a book so riddled with clichés it made her want to weep into her chamomile tea (which, of course, was also missing).

Eliza sighed, pushing her glasses further up her nose. At least the rain had stopped.

**Setting:**

The offices of "Inkling & Quill," a small, independent publishing house specializing in fantasy and sci-fi, occupied the third floor of a creaky brick building in the heart of Portland's Alberta Arts District. Sunlight, when it bothered to peek through the perpetually overcast skies, filtered through large, dusty windows, illuminating rows of overflowing bookshelves and haphazardly arranged desks. The décor could best be described as "eclectic chaos." Posters of forgotten pulp novels shared wall space with framed rejection letters. Half-empty coffee mugs littered every surface, and a faint, ever-present odor of paper, ink, and desperation hung in the air. Eliza's own desk, located in a relatively quiet corner near a towering stack of unsolicited manuscripts, was her own small island of (relative) order. She kept a framed photo of her grumpy ginger cat, Atticus, a small succulent plant named Herbert, and a selection of her favorite editing pens neatly arranged in a ceramic mug. The walls around her were plastered with sticky notes containing story arcs, character analyses, and scribbled reminders to breathe. It was, in short, a perfectly imperfect sanctuary for a literary warrior battling the forces of mediocre prose.
