## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The lobby of "Renaissance Recreations, Inc." - a company that stages historically accurate events and reenactments for wealthy clients. Think lavish Marie Antoinette balls, swashbuckling pirate adventures, and even immersive dinosaur encounters. The lobby reflects this chaotic creativity: faux-ancient Greek columns stand next to a taxidermied velociraptor (named "Velma," of course). A tapestry depicting the Battle of Hastings hangs crookedly on one wall, partially obscured by a stack of medieval broadswords leaning against it.

**Opening:**

The insistent, high-pitched whine of the laser printer sliced through the morning's relative quiet. **Penelope Anya Dubois**, her name a ridiculous mismatch for her sensible grey sweater and perpetually flustered expression, sighed and adjusted her headset. Another error report. Just what she needed.

Outside, the California sun beat down on the palm trees lining the street. Inside, in the air-conditioned, historically-mishmash lobby of Renaissance Recreations, Inc., Penelope felt more like an archaeological dig, layers of stress and caffeine building upon each other, each new issue another layer of dirt to excavate before she could even think about her lunch break.

"Renaissance Recreations, Penelope speaking, how may I direct your call?" she chirped into the headset, forcing a smile that she knew couldn't be seen, but somehow felt obligatory.

The voice on the other end was crisp and professional, devoid of the usual frantic energy that characterized most of her callers. "Good morning. I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Alistair Beaumont. He has a meeting scheduled with Mr. Harrison regarding the… *ahem*… dinosaur excursion. He's running fifteen minutes behind."

Penelope mentally scrolled through the day's appointments. Alistair Beaumont. Dinosaur excursion. Harrison, the resident dinosaur enthusiast with a penchant for khaki shorts and theories about interdimensional raptors. This was shaping up to be a *perfect* Tuesday.

"Understood," Penelope said, her fingers already flying across the keyboard to update the schedule. "Thank you for informing me. I'll let Mr. Harrison know."

Before she could disconnect, the voice paused. "One more thing, Miss Dubois. Mr. Beaumont would like to request that Mr. Harrison refrain from discussing the 'velociraptor summoning ritual' during their meeting. He finds it… unprofessional."

Penelope choked back a laugh. *Unprofessional?* At Renaissance Recreations? That was rich. "Of course," she managed, her voice wavering slightly. "I'll pass along the message."

As she hung up, Velma, the taxidermied velociraptor, seemed to stare back at her, its glassy eyes gleaming with an unsettling knowing. Penelope sighed again. This was going to be a long day.
