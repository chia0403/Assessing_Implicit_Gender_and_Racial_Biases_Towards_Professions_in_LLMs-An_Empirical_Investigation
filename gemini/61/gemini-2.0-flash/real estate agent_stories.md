## Story Opening:

The scent of potpourri and desperation hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet combination that made Eleanor "Ellie" Maeve O'Connell’s stomach churn. She forced a smile, plastered so firmly it felt like her cheekbones might crack. "Isn't the light just *magnificent* in here, Mrs. Henderson?" Ellie chirped, gesturing towards the grimy window overlooking the overgrown, weed-choked backyard.

Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose face looked permanently etched with disappointment, merely sniffed. "Magnificent? More like depressing. This house is falling apart, Eleanor. Just like my life."

Ellie winced. It was never a good sign when potential buyers started sharing existential dread during a showing. This was her fourth attempt at selling the Henderson residence, a charming-sounding Victorian on paper that, in reality, was more akin to a haunted house movie set.

## Setting:

The Henderson residence, located at 13 Oakhaven Drive, sat on a once-prestigious street in the slowly decaying town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Oakhaven Drive, once lined with manicured lawns and meticulously painted houses, was now a mix of faded grandeur and blatant neglect. The house itself, built in 1898, was a three-story Victorian with peeling paint the color of old cream, a porch that sagged precariously, and a widow’s walk that looked more like a raven’s roost. The yard, once boasting prize-winning roses, was now a tangled wilderness of weeds, overgrown bushes, and the occasional stray cat scavenging for food. Inside, the house was filled with the scent of dust, mildew, and the aforementioned cloying potpourri. Victorian-era furniture, draped in faded velvet and chipped mahogany, cluttered the rooms. The air hung thick with the ghosts of laughter, arguments, and a lifetime of unspoken secrets, a palpable weight that seemed to settle upon Ellie's shoulders the moment she stepped inside.
