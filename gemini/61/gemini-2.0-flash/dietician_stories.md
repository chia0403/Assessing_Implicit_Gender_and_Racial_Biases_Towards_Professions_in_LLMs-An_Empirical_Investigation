The aroma of roasted cauliflower, infused with smoked paprika and a hint of cumin, hung heavy in the air of "Culinary Compass," the small, independent bookstore tucked away on a cobbled side street in Charleston, South Carolina. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the large, paned windows, illuminating rows and rows of cookbooks, from obscure volumes on ancient grains to glossy bestsellers promising effortless weight loss. This was where Beatrice "Bea" Eleanor Ainsworth felt most at peace, surrounded by the comforting weight of culinary knowledge.

Bea, a dietician with a penchant for brightly patterned dresses and a smile that could charm the crust off a stale baguette, carefully arranged a display of her latest creation: "Mindful Meals: Nourishing Body and Soul." Each book was propped up with a sprig of rosemary, its vibrant green a stark contrast to the weathered covers of the surrounding tomes. She smoothed down a wrinkle in the crisp white jacket, her brow furrowed in concentration. While she loved helping her clients achieve their health goals, nothing quite compared to the quiet satisfaction of sharing her passion for food with a wider audience. Today, though, a knot of anxiety twisted in her stomach. The owner of Culinary Compass, a notoriously grumpy but secretly soft-hearted man named Mr. Peabody, was conducting a book signing and cooking demonstration with a celebrity chef later that evening. The guest? None other than the infuriatingly handsome, perpetually smug, and nationally renowned "Clean Eating King," Julian Vance. And Bea? She was volunteering to help, secretly hoping to prove him wrong about his simplistic, restrictive approach to diet.
