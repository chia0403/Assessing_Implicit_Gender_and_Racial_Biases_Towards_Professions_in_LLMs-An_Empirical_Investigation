The aroma of toasted sugar and melting butter hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling outside. Inside "Flour Power," the small bakery nestled on the corner of Primrose Lane and Willow Street in the quaint, cobblestone town of Everglen, Elara Meadowsweet hummed along to the vintage Christmas carols crackling from the radio. She wasn't usually one for holiday cheer this early in the season, but the orders for gingerbread men and stollen were already rolling in, keeping her flour-dusted hands busy and her mind focused.

Elara Meadowsweet, a woman whose own sweetness mirrored the treats she baked, wiped a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead, leaving a faint smudge of flour on her brow. She was a baker, born and bred, her hands knowing the perfect consistency of dough before her mind even registered the recipe. Everglen knew Elara, and it loved her. From the flaky croissants she baked each morning to the elaborate wedding cakes she crafted with painstaking detail, her creations were woven into the fabric of the town's life. But today, the usual comfort of her warm bakery couldn't quite chase away the unsettling feeling that had been brewing in her stomach all morning, a feeling as cloying and unwelcome as an over-sweetened frosting.
