The salt spray tasted metallic on Daniel Alistair Finch's lips as he wrestled the recalcitrant hedge trimmer. The wind, a mischievous imp, tugged at his worn tweed cap, threatening to fling it into the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic. He braced his boots against the slick, moss-covered cobblestones that lined the perimeter of the Crofton Estate's western gardens, muttering under his breath.

The Crofton Estate, perched precariously atop the jagged cliffs of the Cornish coast, was a place of both breathtaking beauty and unrelenting hardship. Its gardens, painstakingly crafted over generations, were a testament to the resilience of life in the face of the sea's constant assault. Stone walls, weathered and pitted by centuries of salt and wind, offered meager protection from the elements, but inside, camellias bloomed defiance in the face of gales, and meticulously sculpted yews stood like silent sentinels against the horizon. 

Daniel, employed as the estate's groundskeeper for the past fifteen years, knew every nook and cranny of this place. He knew the secret language of the winds, the rhythms of the tides, and the delicate dance between the garden's flora and the unforgiving Cornish climate. He considered himself more a guardian than a groundskeeper; a silent protector of the Crofton Estate's fragile beauty. But today, even his seasoned hands were struggling to keep pace with the relentless wind, and the approaching storm promised worse. He just hoped the old oak in the rose garden would weather this one. It was already showing signs of strain. And he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that the estate – and perhaps its inhabitants – would need all the protection it could get tonight.
