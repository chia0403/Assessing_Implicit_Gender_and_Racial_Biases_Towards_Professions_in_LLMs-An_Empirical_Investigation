## Story Opening:

The scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Esmeralda Magnolia Bloom. She barely registered it anymore, just as she barely registered the endless drone of daytime television flickering on the wall-mounted screen in "Glamour & Grace Nails." A rerun of "Judge Judy" was blaring, and Esmeralda, meticulously applying a coat of "Mermaid Lagoon" glitter polish to Mrs. Henderson's surprisingly gnarled index finger, couldn't help but roll her eyes. Justice, like the perfect French tip, was rarely achieved in the real world, at least not in her experience.

"So, darling," Mrs. Henderson's voice, raspy from years of unfiltered cigarettes, cut through Judge Judy's pronouncements. "He said he was *considering* leaving his wife. Been saying it for six months now. You think he'll ever actually do it?"

Esmeralda paused, her brush hovering precariously over the nail. She'd heard this story, or variations of it, countless times. It was the unspoken tax of the trade, a therapist's co-pay wrapped up in the price of a deluxe manicure.

"Well, Mrs. Henderson," Esmeralda began, carefully choosing her words, "some men are more comfortable in the lagoon, even if the water's a little stagnant." She dipped her brush back into the glitter, hoping the shimmering distraction would steer the conversation in a less personal direction.

## Setting:

"Glamour & Grace Nails" occupied a cramped storefront on a forgotten stretch of Elm Street in Willow Creek, a small, perpetually overcast town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The exterior was a faded pastel pink, the paint peeling in places like sunburnt skin. A flickering neon sign, missing the second "a" in Glamour, buzzed sporadically, broadcasting a message of imperfect aspiration to the few passersby.

Inside, the decor was a hodgepodge of borrowed glamour and bargain-basement kitsch. Three manicure stations, each adorned with a faux-fur cushion and a ring light, were crammed together. A mismatched collection of framed prints - Audrey Hepburn, a field of lavender, a generic "Live, Laugh, Love" quote - lined the walls. Despite the efforts to create an upscale ambiance, the overall impression was one of slightly desperate optimism, a valiant attempt to inject a little sparkle into a town where sparkle was a rare commodity. The air was thick with the mingled scents of nail polish, artificial flowers, and the ever-present, underlying aroma of disappointment, a scent Esmeralda knew intimately.
