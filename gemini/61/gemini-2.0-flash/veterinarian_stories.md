Okay, here's a story opening, focusing on setting and introducing our veterinarian character:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Northumberland coast, stinging Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's cheeks as she battled her ancient Land Rover up the track towards Farmer Gilchrist's isolated stead. October had arrived with a vengeance, painting the already rugged landscape in shades of bruised purple and ochre. The sea, normally a tranquil slate grey, was a frothing monster, crashing against the craggy cliffs that defined this remote corner of England. Above, a murder of crows wheeled and cawed, their cries swallowed by the gale. This was Dunsmere, where sheep outnumbered people, and the weather dictated life more than calendars ever could.

**Opening:**

The smell hit Eleanor before she even killed the engine â€“ acrid and desperate, clinging to the damp air like a shroud. It wasn't a smell she was unfamiliar with, not after ten years practicing veterinary medicine in this windswept, unforgiving place, but it never failed to tighten her gut. "Dystocia," she muttered, wrestling with the stubborn door of the Land Rover. "And by the looks of things, not a simple one." Gilchrist's frantic call had painted a grim picture: a ewe struggling for hours, a lamb stubbornly stuck, and the farmer's growing fear of losing both mother and offspring. Eleanor adjusted her woolen scarf, pulling it tighter around her neck, and grabbed her battered veterinary bag from the back. The crows seemed to mock her efforts as she trudged towards the dimly lit barn, a small, determined figure battling against the raw, untamed power of Dunsmere.
