Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an interior decorator named:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of old money and freshly laundered linen swirled around Eleanor Grace Davenport like a comforting blanket, though this particular blanket was woven from anxieties. Her gloved hand, which felt strangely foreign and out of place, tightened around her well-worn measuring tape. Beyond the towering French doors, the Hudson River glinted under the crisp autumn sun, a picture-perfect postcard. Inside, however, the situation was far from picturesque. Mrs. Van Derlyn's drawing-room, meant to be a sanctuary of refined taste, resembled a battlefield of clashing chintzes and misguided antiques. Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space. She had three weeks, three weeks to coax this room, and Mrs. Van Derlyn's notoriously difficult clientele, into a state of blissful acceptance. If she failed, her reputation - the one she'd painstakingly built from the ground up - would crumble faster than the crumbling plaster she’d already spotted near the fireplace. Today marked the day she'd begin her designs.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional town of **Willow Creek, New York**, located along the Hudson River, approximately an hour north of New York City. The time is **late October**.

The specific location of this scene is the sprawling estate of **"Riverbend Manor,"** owned by **Mrs. Beatrice Van Derlyn**, a wealthy socialite and prominent figure in the local community. Riverbend Manor is an old, imposing, and somewhat dilapidated estate dating back to the Gilded Age, showcasing a mix of architectural styles that have been added over the centuries. Inside, the décor is a haphazard collection of inherited antiques, mismatched furniture, and questionable design choices, reflecting the Van Derlyn family's long history and perhaps a touch of neglect. The grounds are extensive, featuring manicured gardens, a crumbling boathouse, and stunning views of the Hudson. The town itself is charming and quaint, populated by a mix of old-money families and artists drawn to the area's natural beauty.
