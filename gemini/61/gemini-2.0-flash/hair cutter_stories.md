Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a hair cutter named Bernadette "Bernie" O'Malley:

**Setting:**

The air inside "Shear Bliss," Bernadette O'Malley's salon, smelled of lavender shampoo, hope, and a hint of nervous energy. Located on a slightly-worn but undeniably charming street in the coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, the salon was a haven of robin's egg blue walls, mismatched antique chairs reupholstered in bright floral prints, and the gentle hum of hair dryers. Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and reflecting off the chrome of the styling stations. A vintage record player sat in the corner, usually spinning Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday, a constant soundtrack to the transformations that unfolded within those walls.

**Opening:**

Bernadette "Bernie" O'Malley hated Tuesdays. It wasn't the day itself, particularly. Tuesdays were just…quiet. Too quiet. Today was no exception. At 10:30 AM, and already two hours into her shift, the only sound was the crackle of the old record player and the gentle hum of the refrigerator behind the reception desk. She sighed, running a hand through her own choppy, self-cut auburn bangs. Her scissors, usually singing a joyful song against the dry strands of someone's hair, lay silent and accusing on her station.

She glanced at the appointment book, its pages still depressingly empty beyond Mrs. Peterson's 3:00 PM perm. Bernie chewed on her lip, a habit she knew she needed to break, and idly rearranged the bottles of sea salt spray, each perfectly aligned, an army of hair-taming soldiers ready to be deployed in the battle against bad hair. Business had been slow for weeks, ever since… well, ever since *he* left, taking a chunk of her clientele with him and a much larger chunk of her spirit.
