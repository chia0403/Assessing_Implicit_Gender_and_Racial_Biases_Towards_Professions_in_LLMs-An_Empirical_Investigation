The fluorescent lights of Krems & Krems LLP hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that clung to Frederick Thomas Ainsworth like a cheap suit. Outside, the first real snow of the season was falling, a picturesque scene that Fred could only vaguely register through the smeared grime of the office window. He was on his third cup of lukewarm coffee, the taste bitter and metallic, a perfect mirror of his mood. Spread before him was a mountain of receipts, invoices, and bank statements, all belonging to a small, floundering pottery studio that he was desperately trying to keep afloat.

The setting was downtown Chicago, on the 37th floor of a nondescript office building that housed a warren of similarly unremarkable businesses. Inside, the office was a beige symphony of despair: beige carpets, beige walls, beige cubicles stretching out like a labyrinth. The only splashes of color came from the overflowing inboxes and the occasional wilting office plant, casualties of forgotten birthdays and neglected watering schedules. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer toner, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation that permeated every fiber of the building.

Fred, a man perpetually teetering on the edge of forty, felt the weight of it all pressing down on him. He’d envisioned a different life when he’d earned his CPA. Something...more. Something less beige. He sighed, pushing his glasses further up his nose and focusing back on the endless column of numbers. Somewhere in this mess, there had to be a solution, a loophole, anything to save "Clayful Creations" from the inevitable bankruptcy that loomed like a polar vortex.
