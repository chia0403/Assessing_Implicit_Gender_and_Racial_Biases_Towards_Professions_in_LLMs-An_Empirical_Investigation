Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and main character information you requested:

**Opening:**

The clatter of silverware hitting porcelain was a familiar symphony to Clara Beatrice Bellweather. A chaotic, demanding symphony, perhaps, but comforting nonetheless. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of roasted garlic, cheap Chianti, and the faint desperation clinging to the Friday night crowd. Outside, a biting November wind rattled the frosted windows of "Mama Rosa's Trattoria," a wind that seemed to carry the murmurs of discontent from the darkening streets.

Clara navigated the crowded tables with a practiced ease, her worn leather apron bumping against the checkered tablecloths. Her smile was automatic, a carefully crafted mask that hid the weariness etched into the corners of her eyes. She was a master of the subtle art of balancing precariously stacked plates, remembering complicated orders without writing them down, and soothing the frayed nerves of impatient customers. Tonight, however, even her well-honed skills felt inadequate against the sheer volume of hungry patrons demanding pasta and perceived perfection. Tonight, something felt… different. A nervous hum seemed to vibrate just beneath the surface of the usual Friday night frenzy, a feeling that made the tiny hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

**Setting:**

Mama Rosa's Trattoria is a small, family-owned Italian restaurant located in the heart of a working-class neighborhood in Chicago. It’s been a neighborhood fixture for over 40 years, known for its hearty portions, reasonable prices, and the perpetually harried but secretly kind owner, Rosa herself. The interior is dimly lit, with red and white checkered tablecloths, exposed brick walls adorned with faded photographs of Italy, and the constant aroma of garlic and tomato sauce permeating the air. It's cozy and comforting, but also cramped and noisy, especially on weekend nights.
