Okay, here's a story opening, focusing on setting and introducing our butcher:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of cleaver against bone was the morning hymn of Oakhaven, a rural town nestled so deep in the Appalachian foothills that it still felt like a whisper of the 18th century. It was a sound Eleanor Mae Harding had known her entire life, the percussion that punctuated the sleepy rhythm of her days. Inside Harding & Sons, the butcher shop that had been in her family for generations, the air hung thick and cool, a blend of sawdust, brine, and the metallic tang of fresh blood. Outside, the morning mist still clung to the cobbled streets, painting the clapboard houses in shades of grey. But inside, Eleanor Mae Harding was already hard at work, the pre-dawn light glinting off the steel of her well-worn cleaver as she expertly trimmed a side of beef, preparing it for the day's trade. The scent of juniper and woodsmoke drifted in from the open doorway, a promise of the breakfast her neighbor, Martha Gable, was likely cooking, but Eleanor wouldnâ€™t be joining her. Not today. Today was market day, and Oakhaven depended on Harding & Sons.
