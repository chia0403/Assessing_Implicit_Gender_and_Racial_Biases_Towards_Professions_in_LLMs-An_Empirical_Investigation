Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Kensington's pulse.  The small, dusty town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, was perpetually shrouded in a misty gloom, even on days like today when the sun dared to peek through the clouds.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a scent that always seemed to cling to Amelia, a constant reminder of her life in this isolated corner of California.  As the PA, or physician's assistant, for Dr. Elias Thorne, Amelia was the linchpin holding together the frayed edges of Havenwood's healthcare system.  The clinic itself, a converted Victorian schoolhouse, hummed with the low, rhythmic sounds of machinery and the anxious whispers of patients.  A cough, hacking and rasping, echoed from the examination room, a stark counterpoint to the incessant drumming of the rain.  Amelia knew the sound all too well. It was a sound that often preceded a diagnosis more ominous than the lingering flu that had been plaguing the town for weeks.
