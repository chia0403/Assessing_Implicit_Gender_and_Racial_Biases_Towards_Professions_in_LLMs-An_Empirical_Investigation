Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct, a relentless drumbeat mirroring the frantic rhythm in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's chest.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the interrogation room cast long, dancing shadows across the tired faces of the suspects, each one a potential key, a missing piece of the puzzle.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and fear, hung heavy in the room, clinging to the threadbare carpet and the worn, leather chairs.  Izzy, her navy blue uniform slightly stained with the grime of the night, shifted uncomfortably, her gaze darting between the sullen teenager slumped in a chair and the gaunt, middle-aged woman across from him.  This case, the murder of a respected local shopkeeper, felt different.  There were too many unanswered questions, too many inconsistencies in the initial reports.  And the weight of the community's unspoken expectations pressed down on her like the oppressive Portland sky.  The city, known for its vibrant arts scene and its independent spirit, was now gripped by a chilling silence that spoke of fear.
