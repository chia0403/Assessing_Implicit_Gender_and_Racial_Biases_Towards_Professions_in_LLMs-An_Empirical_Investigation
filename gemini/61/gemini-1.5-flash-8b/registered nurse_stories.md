The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the frantic whispers and the rhythmic beep-boop of vital signs monitors.  Rain lashed against the hospital windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Grace Blackwood, a registered nurse with five years under her belt and a heart forged in the crucible of countless crises.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Something about the palpable tension, the way the air itself seemed to crackle with unspoken anxieties, felt heavier, more… foreboding.  She stared at the young man slumped over a gurney, his eyes closed, the pale skin of his face a stark contrast to the blood staining his shirt.  The faintest tremor of fear, like a pre-dawn chill, snaked its way through her.  This wasn't just another run-of-the-mill stabbing.  This felt… wrong.

The setting was the emergency room of a bustling, yet slightly decaying, city hospital located on the edge of a sprawling industrial district.  The building itself, with its faded paint and worn linoleum floors, seemed to absorb the noise and anxiety around it.  The smell of antiseptic and fear hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional metallic tang of blood.  Outside, the city roared, a relentless symphony of sirens and distant thunder, amplifying the internal chaos of the ER.
