The humid air hung thick and heavy over the sprawling courtyard of the Grand Wyndham Hotel, the scent of jasmine and simmering coffee battling with the metallic tang of the perpetually polished brass.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate latticework of the balconies, dappled the cobblestones, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.  This was the realm of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire, or, as he preferred to think of it, the Grand Wyndham's silent architect of guest contentment.  His striped uniform, a vibrant emerald green, was practically glowing under the relentless summer sun, a stark contrast to the muted tones of the antique furniture lining the hallways and the hushed whispers of the hotel's elite clientele.  The year was 1928, and Barty, twenty-two years old, felt the weight of expectation settle on his shoulders like the heavy velvet drapes of the Presidential Suite.  He was not only tasked with carrying bags and fetching drinks, but also with an unspoken responsibilityâ€”to anticipate the needs of the guests, to be the unseen hand guiding them through the labyrinthine corridors of their temporary haven.
