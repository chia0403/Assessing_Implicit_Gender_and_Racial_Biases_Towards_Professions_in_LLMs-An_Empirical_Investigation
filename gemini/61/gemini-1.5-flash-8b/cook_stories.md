Amelia, her face perpetually creased with a mixture of concentration and weariness, deftly flipped a crÃªpe, its golden surface reflecting the flickering gaslight illuminating the cramped space.  It was a Wednesday, the slowest day in the bustling port town of Havenwood, but a day that Amelia always approached with a fierce determination to deliver excellence.  The only other souls in the kitchen were the ghosts of countless meals past, whispering secrets of flavors and fortunes in the steam that curled around her.
