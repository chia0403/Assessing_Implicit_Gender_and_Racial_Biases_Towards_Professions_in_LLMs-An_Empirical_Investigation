The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne, a landscape architect, radiating heat that shimmered off the meticulously manicured lawns he tended.  He adjusted his straw hat, the sweat stinging his eyes as he surveyed the sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth.  Ivy, trained with a precise ferocity, climbed the stone walls, creating emerald curtains around the manor house.  Roses, meticulously pruned, exploded in colour â€“ a vibrant tapestry of scarlet, blush, and gold.  Yet, even in this Eden, Elias felt a sense of unease.  The perfect wasn't natural.  Something, or someone, was subtly amiss.


The estate, nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Hampshire countryside, was a study in contrasts.  Stark, modernist architecture, showcasing sleek lines and minimal ornamentation, sat jarringly alongside the centuries-old, weathered charm of the surrounding woodlands.  A network of well-maintained paths wound through manicured gardens, leading to hidden grottoes and concealed fountains.  This incongruity was the heart of the problem.  It wasn't the beauty, but the strangeness of it all, that gnawed at Elias's composure. He felt like he was surrounded by a meticulously constructed puzzle, missing a crucial piece.
