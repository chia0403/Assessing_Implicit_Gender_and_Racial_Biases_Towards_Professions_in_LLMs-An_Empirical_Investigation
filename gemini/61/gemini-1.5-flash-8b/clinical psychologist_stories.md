Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with tired eyes and a perpetually creased cardigan, stared out the rain-streaked window of her office.  The grey London sky mirrored the muted palette of her life, a life spent navigating the fractured psyches of others while her own remained stubbornly intact, a polished but empty vase.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless percussion that echoed the insistent whispers in her head.  The office itself was a study in muted tones, a sanctuary of clinical neutralityâ€”warm beige walls, a polished oak desk, and a worn leather armchair.  Bookshelves, overflowing with volumes on trauma, anxiety, and the human condition, lined the walls, their spines catching the pale light filtering through the window.  Today, however, the usual sense of order felt brittle, teetering on the precipice of chaos.  A single, almost imperceptible, tremor ran through her, a tremor she couldn't quite place, but one that insisted on claiming her attention. A new patient was due in an hour, a man named Arthur Blackwood, whose case file had been flagged, not by any obvious diagnosis, but by an unsettlingly potent aura of something akin to ... dread. The city outside, mirrored in the window, was a chaotic symphony of rain-slicked streets and hurrying figures, each a solitary soul in their own private storm.  The storm inside Eleanor, she sensed, was only just beginning.
