The flickering neon sign of the "Cosmic Cones" ice cream parlor cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Stone's workbench.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the "Static Spark," her tiny, cluttered workshop tucked away behind the bustling market district of Zenith City.  Amelia, a radio technician with fingers as nimble as spiders' legs, meticulously adjusted a tiny potentiometer.  Her grease-stained overalls, a uniform as familiar as her own reflection, draped over her lean frame.  The scent of ozone and burnt popcorn hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the low hum of salvaged electronics.  Zenith City pulsed with a chaotic rhythm – the screech of street vendors, the rumble of cargo trains, and the ever-present static crackle that seemed to seep into every corner of the city.  It was a city built on wires and whispers, a city that relied on Amelia and her quiet expertise to keep the crackling threads of communication unbroken.  Tonight, though, a different sort of static buzzed in her ears.  A faint, rhythmic clicking, originating not from the city, but from somewhere… inside her.
