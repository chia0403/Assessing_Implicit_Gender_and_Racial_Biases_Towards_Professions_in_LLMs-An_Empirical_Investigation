The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose gravel in the bed of his pickup truck.  Dust devils danced like mischievous sprites in the late afternoon sun, swirling around the isolated stretch of highway 212.  This was Elias's domain, a ribbon of asphalt snaking through a landscape that felt as vast and indifferent as the sky above.  He was a highway maintenance worker, a quiet soul navigating a world of cracked pavement, broken guardrails, and the relentless march of time across the endless horizon.  The rhythmic click-clack of his jackhammer, a constant companion in the pre-dawn hours, was now a distant memory. The rhythmic thrum of the pickup's engine was the only sound that echoed through the emptiness, a lonely counterpoint to the vast silence.  The year was 1978.  His small, beat-up cabin, nestled amongst the pines near the highway, was a stark contrast to the open plains, a temporary haven against the harsh beauty of the untamed West.
