Dust, fine as spun moonlight, swirled around her, coating her roughspun tunic and clinging to the sculpted details of the tools strapped to her back – the meticulously honed chisel, the sturdy mallet, the miniature hammer for the intricate carvings.  High above, the granite cliffs seemed to press in, their grey faces mirroring the relentless grey of the sky.  Below, the village of Oakhaven, nestled in a verdant valley, looked like a tapestry of emerald and ochre, a stark contrast to the raw, unforgiving landscape surrounding it.  Elara, her hands hardened and calloused from years of working the stone, was a familiar figure in this desolate realm, the silent sculptor of the mountain’s heart.  Her full name, Elara Stonehand, was etched into the very fabric of Oakhaven, whispered in hushed tones among the villagers and carved into the faces of the ancient monuments she so diligently tended.  This day, however, felt different. A tremor, barely perceptible at first, ran through the mountainside, sending a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the wind.
