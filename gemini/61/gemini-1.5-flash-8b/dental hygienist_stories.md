The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic *clink* of instruments and the soft sighs of patients.  Rain hammered against the windows, a relentless percussion against the sterile white walls, mirroring the relentless rhythm of Anya Petrovaâ€™s own heart.  Anya, a dental hygienist with eyes the colour of polished obsidian and hands that moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer, meticulously polished a patient's teeth.  The rhythmic scrape of the polishing tool created a counterpoint to the muffled sounds of the city outside.  Today was a particularly difficult day.  Not a difficult patient, oh no, but a particularly difficult *situation*.  The subtle tremors in her hands betrayed the turmoil within, though her expression remained serene.  Her name, etched into the brass nameplate on her desk,  was a simple testament to a life carefully built on calm efficiency.  Anya Petrova.  But today, the calm felt strained.


The setting: The bustling, slightly run-down but nonetheless comforting dental office on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue, in the heart of a quiet, if somewhat overcast, suburban town.
