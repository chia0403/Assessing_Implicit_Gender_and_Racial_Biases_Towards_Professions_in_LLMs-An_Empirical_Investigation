The chill of the early morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, a damp, penetrating coldness that clung to the cobbled alleyway like a shroud.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered light struggling to pierce the gloom, illuminating the overflowing refuse bins lining the narrow passage.  Barty, a butcher with a weathered face etched with the lines of countless days spent cleaving meat, adjusted the worn leather straps of his apron, the familiar weight comforting in the pre-dawn silence.  He was already halfway through his ritualistic morning routine, the scent of stale beer and decaying vegetables mingling with the sharper tang of blood and freshly-ground spices wafting from the open door of his small, cramped shop, 'The Cleaving Knife'.

Setting:

The alleyway, a perpetual twilight of neglect, was a stark contrast to the bustling, market-filled heart of the city.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by generations of feet and laden with the residue of countless spilled liquids and discarded refuse, echoed the quiet rhythm of the city waking.  The shop, 'The Cleaving Knife', itself was a testament to Barty's resilience and a quiet desperation.  A small, storefront shop, nestled between a greengrocer's stall and a blacksmith's forge, it was perpetually dim, lit by a single flickering gas lamp hanging precariously above the counter.  The meat, hanging from hooks, shone faintly in the gloom, a macabre display in the still-dark hour. The scent of fresh blood mingled with the aroma of woodsmoke and the persistent, earthy smell of the cityâ€™s underbelly, a constant reminder of the life-blood that nourished the city and Barty's trade.
