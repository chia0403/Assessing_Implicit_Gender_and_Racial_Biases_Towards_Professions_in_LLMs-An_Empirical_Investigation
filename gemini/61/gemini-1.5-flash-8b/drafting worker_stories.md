The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous drone that seeped into Elara Vance's very bones.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air, mimicking the frantic scribbles of her charcoal pencil on the tracing paper.  A pile of blueprints, each one a meticulously rendered miniature of a future building, lay scattered around her, their precise lines stark against the worn, dark mahogany drafting table.
