The chipped Formica countertop, stained a dull, beige-grey from countless spilled coffees and the residue of expired sugar packets, reflected the fluorescent hum of the office.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the relentless clicking of Amelia Stone's mechanical pencil against the ledger.  Amelia Stone, 32, accountant extraordinaire (or so she told herself, with a wry smile), stared at the spreadsheet before her.  Column after column of numbers, each one representing a sale, a purchase, a meticulously documented transaction.  But something felt wrong.  Not wrong in a mathematical sense, mind you.  Wrong in a... visceral way.

The office, a small, shared space tucked between a struggling bakery and a dry cleaner, smelled faintly of stale air freshener and disappointment.  Sunlight, when it managed to penetrate the perpetually overcast London sky, cast long, distorted shadows across the desks, highlighting the piles of paperwork that had accumulated over the weeks, even months, seeming to almost suffocate the space. Amelia's worn-out, floral armchair was a temporary haven amidst this cacophony of paper and sound.  A single, flickering candle, bought in the dim corner of an antique store, sat on her desk, casting a warm, fleeting glow over the documents. It was the only hint of comfort in a world of spreadsheets.
