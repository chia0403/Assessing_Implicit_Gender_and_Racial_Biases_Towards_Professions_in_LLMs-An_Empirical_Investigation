The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the uneven cobblestones of  Old St. Jude's.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun, casting long shadows that stretched and twisted like the alleyways themselves.  This wasn't the pristine, manicured neighborhood she usually navigated in her role as a realtor for upscale properties.  This was the heart of St. Jude's underbelly, a district notorious for its crumbling architecture and whispered stories, a place where the past clung to the present like a stubborn weed.  A pungent aroma of roasted chestnuts mingled with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely floral, hinting at a hidden garden tucked away behind a decaying facade.  Amelia, her tailored suit a stark contrast to the surroundings, pressed on.  The listing was a three-story Victorian on the verge of collapse, its ornate gables shrouded in ivy, its wrought-iron balcony swaying precariously.  According to the dilapidated "for sale" sign, the asking price was a modest $150,000.  Amelia had her doubts, but a nagging curiosity, a feeling that something more than just a dilapidated house lay beneath the surface, compelled her forward.
