The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Spa" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, a fragrant counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain against the storefront.  This was the sanctuary, or at least the illusion of one, for Elara Nightingale, massage therapist extraordinaire.  Elara, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the quiet intensity of a seasoned storm, adjusted the position of a scented candle, its flickering flame mirroring the uneasy tremor in her hands.  Tonight felt different.  The usual pre-evening lull in clients was punctuated by an unnerving silence, a silence that pressed against the walls like the insistent drip of a leaky faucet.  The only other sound was the gentle hum of the ventilation system, a constant, almost oppressive whisper.  Tonight, Elara was bracing herself not for a massage, but for something much more unsettling.
