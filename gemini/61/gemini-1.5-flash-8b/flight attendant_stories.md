The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a smell Amelia Petrova usually associated with approaching storms.  She sighed, pushing a tray of miniature pastries towards a passenger who, despite the elegant floral wallpaper of the first-class cabin, seemed more interested in staring out the window than the delicate macarons.  Amelia adjusted the crisp white uniform, smoothing the wrinkles that seemed to cling to the fabric like the humidity itself.  Outside, the turquoise water of the Caribbean Sea churned beneath a sky bruised purple and grey.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the plane's engines was a constant, insistent heartbeat in the otherwise quiet cabin.

The setting:  A first-class cabin aboard the luxurious *Ocean Breeze*, a cruise liner that promised breathtaking vistas and opulent service, but tonight felt oddly tense.  A low-level electrical storm was brewing over the Caribbean, and the air vibrated with a sense of impending, unsettling calm.  Amelia, a seasoned flight attendant with five years under her belt, knew storms came with their own peculiar currents, both literal and metaphorical.  This trip, however, was different.  Something in the way passengers were whispering, in the way the captain's voice crackled with an unfamiliar urgency, made her uneasy.  The usual polite chatter and clinking of champagne glasses were replaced by a nervous anticipation. The exotic atmosphere of the ship felt subtly askew, the usual tranquility twisted.
