The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Nightingale's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whipping through the gap in the window frame of her tiny, but perfectly organised, travel agency.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Wanderlust & Whispers", a name Amelia had chosen with a mixture of poetic yearning and a desperate need to convey a sense of something more than just brochures and flight numbers.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old paper, coffee, and a faint, lingering perfume of exotic spice â€“ a relic from the countless fragrant locales Amelia had meticulously researched over the years.  Today, however, the air felt heavy with a different sort of aroma:  resignation.

Amelia, a woman with eyes that held the vastness of the world and hair the colour of sun-bleached sand, stared out at the grey cityscape.  Rain-slicked streets reflected the fluorescent lights of the nearby office buildings, casting a dreary glow over the entire scene.  Just another Tuesday.  Another day where the only exotic destinations were the ones printed on the worn corners of her meticulously filed travel brochures.  Her phone, a loyal companion in her solitary office, lay silent, a silent testament to the slow decline of her once-thriving business.
