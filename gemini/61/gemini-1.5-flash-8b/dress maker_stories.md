The clatter of shears against fabric, a symphony of snips and swishes, filled the tiny workshop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of Amelia Blackwood's attic atelier.  Cobwebs, thick as spun sugar, draped from the rafters, catching the faint scent of lavender and beeswax that hung heavy in the air.  Amelia, a woman whose fingers, long and nimble, moved with the grace of a hummingbirdâ€™s wings over silk, meticulously pinned a delicate pattern onto a shimmering swatch of midnight blue taffeta.  Her brow was furrowed in concentration, her spectacles perched precariously on the tip of her nose.  The year was 1888.  London was a city of fog and grandeur, but within the cramped confines of this attic, a world of elegant dreams was being crafted.  This was Amelia's haven, her sanctuary, her kingdom of sculpted silks and whispered secrets.
