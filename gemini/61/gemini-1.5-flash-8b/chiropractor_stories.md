The fluorescent hum of the waiting room thrummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Eleanor Vance's high heels on the linoleum.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of Apex Chiropractic, a practice tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling, yet somehow perpetually weary, city of Veridian.  Posters of smiling, impossibly pain-free individuals adorned the walls, a stark contrast to the slumped posture and furrowed brows of the patients patiently awaiting their turn.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, a familiar aroma to Eleanor, one that had become inextricably linked to the quiet anxieties and whispered aches of her clientele.

Today, however, the air held a particular tension.  The usual murmur of conversation was replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the occasional sigh of someone battling a persistent headache or the low thrum of the massage table in the adjacent treatment room.  Eleanor, a woman of thirty-five with eyes that held both sharp observation and quiet compassion, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  She knew, somehow, that this day would be different.
