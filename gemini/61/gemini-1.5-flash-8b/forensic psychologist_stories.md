Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless beat of Dr. Eleanor Vance's own heart.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and decaying machinery, clung to her like a second skin.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the cavernous space.  Broken glass littered the concrete floor, a scattering of shattered memories in a space that had once echoed with the rhythmic clang of industry. This was the scene of the latest crime, and Dr. Vance, forensic psychologist and expert in trauma-induced dissociative behaviours, was tasked with unearthing the truth buried beneath the debris.  The victim, a renowned architect named Alistair Finch, had been found slumped over a workbench, a single, oddly precise incision marking his wrist.  The immediate police assessment was suicide. But Dr. Vance, trained to see beyond the surface, smelled something fundamentally off. The meticulously arranged tools, the almost theatrical placement of the body, whispered a different story.  She felt it, deep in her gut, a narrative of manipulation and something far darker than despair.
