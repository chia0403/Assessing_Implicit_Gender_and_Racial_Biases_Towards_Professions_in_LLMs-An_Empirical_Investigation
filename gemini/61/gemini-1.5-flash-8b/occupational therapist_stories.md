The chill of the October air bit at Amelia Blackwood’s exposed cheeks as she stepped from the overflowing parking lot of the "Bright Beginnings" daycare center.  Dust motes danced in the fading afternoon sun, swirling around the vibrant murals that adorned the building's exterior—pictures of playful animals and smiling children.  Amelia, a registered occupational therapist with a practiced calm despite the constant frenetic energy that surrounded her, sighed, pulling her scarf tighter around her neck.  The scent of cinnamon and burnt sugar wafted from the nearby bakery, a stark contrast to the musty smell of used crayons and quiet desperation that clung to the daycare like a persistent fog.  Today had been particularly challenging.

Amelia, nearing thirty, was a stickler for routine, order, and a manageable level of chaos. Today, however, the usual delicate balance she'd carefully orchestrated within the children's playgroup had been shattered.  A new child, a tiny, freckled girl named Lily with eyes that held an unsettling depth, had arrived. Lily, it seemed, had a different definition of "play."  While the other children happily sculpted with clay and constructed elaborate towers of blocks, Lily relentlessly dismantled everything within reach, her tiny fingers working with a furious determination.  Amelia had tried everything – gentle redirection, structured activities, even a short and very successful intervention with a pair of colourful sensory rings – but Lily remained unfazed, her focus laser-like on the act of demolition.  The usual quiet hum of activity felt more like a cacophony, and the rhythmic ticking of the office clock was jarring, a discordant reminder of the time slipping through her fingers.
