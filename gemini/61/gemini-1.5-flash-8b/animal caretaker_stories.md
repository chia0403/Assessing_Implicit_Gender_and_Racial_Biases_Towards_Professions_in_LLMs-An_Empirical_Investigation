The chill of the dawn seeped through the gaps in the stone walls of the Whispering Woods Sanctuary, a place where the wild met the tame, and the sorrow of lost creatures mingled with the comforting scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Amelia Nightingale, Keeper of the Whispering Woods, shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the heart of the Blackwood Forest, was a haven for animals orphaned, injured, or simply displaced.  Amelia, with her weathered hands and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of the forest, was the linchpin of this fragile ecosystem.  Today, however, the quiet hum of the sanctuary felt charged with an unnerving energy.  A persistent, almost rhythmic rustling from deep within the Whispering Pines, home to the sanctuary's famed pack of wolves, had been keeping Amelia awake since the first light touched the eastern horizon.  The wolves, normally a symphony of low growls and contented sighs, were unusually agitated.  And Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that something was profoundly wrong.
