The scent of aged wood and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air of the Grand Theatre.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the deserted backstage area.  Emilia "Em"  Abernathy, her tailored suit a stark contrast to the theatrical debris around her, surveyed the scene.  Broken props lay scattered like fallen soldiers, their painted faces faded and their once-grand gestures now mere echoes.  The dressing rooms, usually vibrant with the rush of actors, were silent, save for the whisper of the wind rustling the velvet curtains.  It was the dead of winter, a time usually reserved for the theatreâ€™s annual hibernation, but Em was awake.

The Grand Theatre, a monument to a bygone era of grandeur, stood on the edge of the city, its facade etched with the swirling patterns of the last great fire that had ravaged the district.  The once-gleaming marble now wore a coat of grime, a testament to years of neglect.  Locals whispered of the haunting melodies that still drifted from its empty auditorium at night, a symphony of ghosts lamenting the loss of their stage.  Em, however, heard a different tune, the frantic rhythm of a play clawing its way to life within the decaying walls, a play she was determined to bring back to the stage.
