The biting wind, a relentless, icy hand, whipped across the parched, cracked earth of the Blackwood Valley.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of dried clay and grit, danced across the skeletal remains of last year's harvest.  Elara Blackwood, a farmer in her late 30s with hands calloused and weathered like ancient maples, squinted against the grey sky.  Her name, etched into the very fabric of this valley, carried a history as long as the twisting, gnarled oaks that clung precariously to the hillside.  She traced the deep furrows in the parched soil with a worn leather-bound journal, her breath fogging in the frigid air.  The Blackwood Valley, once a verdant tapestry of orchards and vineyards, was now a skeletal landscape of despair.  This was the year of the Great Drought, and Elara knew, with a chilling certainty, that this year's harvest would be nothing more than a cruel mockery.  The promise of sustenance, of life itself, lay buried under a blanket of barrenness.
