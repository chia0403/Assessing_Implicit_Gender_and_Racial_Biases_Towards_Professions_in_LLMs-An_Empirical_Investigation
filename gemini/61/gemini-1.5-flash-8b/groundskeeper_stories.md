The chipped paint of the gazebo, peeling like sunburnt skin, reflected the harsh midday sun.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering air, clinging to the faded floral patterns on the tapestry draped over the broken balustrade.  Amelia "Em" Worthington, groundskeeper for the prestigious Blackwood Manor, adjusted the strap of her canvas satchel, the weight of her tools pressing against her shoulder.  Another scorcher.  Even the wisteria, usually a vibrant purple canopy, hung limp and listless, its blossoms drooping like weary eyelids.

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the heart of the Sussex Downs, had always exuded an aura of quiet grandeur.  Ivy, thick as a forest, climbed the imposing stone walls, its tendrils reaching out to embrace the ancient oaks and beeches that guarded the perimeter.  The manicured lawns, normally emerald carpets, were now a patchwork of sun-baked brown and patchy green.  It was a time of relentless summer, a season that tested both the flora and the patience of its caretaker.  Em, though, was accustomed to the heat, the dryness, and the pressure to maintain the pristine fa√ßade that Blackwood Manor so meticulously projected. Today, however, there was a new, and unsettling, chill in the air, a subtle sense of something not quite right that settled deep within the quiet corridors of the estate.
