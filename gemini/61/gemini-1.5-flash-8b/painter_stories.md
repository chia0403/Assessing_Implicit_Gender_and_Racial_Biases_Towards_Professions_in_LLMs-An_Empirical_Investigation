The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign, a faded, turquoise mockery of its former glory, barely clung to the weathered wood.  Rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, ramshackle building nestled deep within the Blackwood Forest.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, a painter with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands that held brushes like extensions of herself, hunched over her easel.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the dense canopy, illuminating only the swirling colours on the canvas before her.  It was a portrait, a study in shadowed defiance, and it mirrored the turmoil within her.  The Blackwood Forest, a place of ancient whispers and tangled paths, had always been a muse, but lately, it felt more like a cage.
