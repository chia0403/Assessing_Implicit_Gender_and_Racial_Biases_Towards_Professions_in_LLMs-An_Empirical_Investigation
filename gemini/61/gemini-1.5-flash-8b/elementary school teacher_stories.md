The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Willow Creek Elementary" sign, faded a sickly yellow-green, barely reflected the grey November sky.  Rain slicked the asphalt playground, turning the usual cacophony of children's laughter into a muffled whisper.  Inside, in the brightly coloured, but undeniably worn, teacher's lounge,  Ms. Amelia "Amy"  Peterson,  a woman whose auburn hair was stubbornly refusing to cooperate with the cold, stared out at the swirling grey.  A half-eaten croissant, abandoned on a chipped ceramic plate, sat beside a stack of unread lesson plans.  The aroma of damp earth and something faintly sweet – perhaps the nearby bakery's cinnamon rolls – hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful dirge accompanying the relentless downpour.  Amy sighed, a sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the windows.  This wasn't just another dreary November day; something felt...different.  The air crackled with an unspoken anticipation.
