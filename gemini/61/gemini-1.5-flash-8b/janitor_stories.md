The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library cast long, skeletal shadows across the grimy, linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, almost mocking Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, the night janitor.  He sighed, a sound swallowed by the hushed whispers of the ancient books lining the towering shelves.  The library, a monument to knowledge and quiet contemplation, felt more like a tomb tonight.  An oppressive stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic squeak of Barty's mop and the occasional rustle of unseen pages.  Outside, the city thrummed with life, a stark contrast to the silent sanctuary within.  Barty, however, was perfectly content.  His world, at least for now, was contained within these four walls, the musty scent of aged paper and forgotten stories his only companions.
