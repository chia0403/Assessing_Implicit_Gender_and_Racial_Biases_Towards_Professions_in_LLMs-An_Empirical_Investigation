The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, rattling the ancient gables and swirling the fallen leaves into a dizzying vortex.  Elias Thorne, a carpenter of considerable renown (though often whispered about in hushed tones, as if his reputation held a secret), hunched deeper into his worn leather apron.  Oakhaven, a town nestled amongst the foothills of the Whisper Mountains, was a place of grey skies and even greyer moods.  The timber-framed houses, once vibrant with the hues of weathered wood, now leaned into the relentless onslaught of the season, their once-bright colours dulled by a layer of frost. Elias, his calloused hands perpetually stained with the rich earth-tones of various woods, worked with a quiet determination in the shadowed workshop of his little cottage, perched on the edge of the town square.  The scent of pine, a familiar comfort, mingled with the acrid tang of damp earth, the faint aroma of cinnamon, and the unmistakable smell of freshly-planed wood â€“ a constant companion in his world.
