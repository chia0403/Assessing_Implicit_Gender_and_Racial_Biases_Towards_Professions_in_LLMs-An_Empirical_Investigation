Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, blurring the already-muted hues of the late afternoon.  The scent of damp earth and something vaguely floral, possibly wilting jasmine, clung to the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, slightly antiseptic smell of the school itself.  Eleanor, a guidance counselor at Havenwood High, leaned back in her worn leather chair, the rhythmic drumming of the rain a hypnotic counterpoint to the frantic pitter-patter of thoughts in her head.  Across her polished mahogany desk, a half-eaten apple lay abandoned beside a stack of student files, each one a miniature universe of hopes, fears, and anxieties.  The quiet of the office, usually a haven of calm contemplation, felt strangely charged tonight.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows that danced with the storm's fury outside.  The city, usually vibrant and alive, was cloaked in a somber grey shroud.  A particularly insistent knock echoed through the otherwise hushed halls.
