The air, thick with the scent of brewing coffee and stale beer, hung heavy and damp, a perfect foil for the perpetual gloom that seemed to cling to the alleyways.  Inside, the Rusty Mug offered a claustrophobic respite, a smoky haven where the clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversation masked the city's restless pulse.  Behind the bar, Amelia "May" Blackwood, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, expertly poured a stout into a chipped mug.  Her brow, usually smooth and unreadable, was creased in concentration as she navigated the chaotic flow of patrons.  A chipped porcelain doll, perched precariously on a stack of empty pint glasses, seemed to watch her with unnerving intensity.  May had been the bartender at the Rusty Mug for three years, a silent observer to the dramas and whispered secrets that unfolded within its four walls. Tonight, a new story was beginning.
