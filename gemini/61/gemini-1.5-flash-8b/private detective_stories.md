The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated building, a symphony of relentless percussion that mirrored the turmoil swirling inside Amelia "Ace"  Kingston.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the smudges of ink and coffee on her worn mahogany desk.  Ace, a private investigator with a reputation as sharp as her wit, stared at the single, crumpled telegram clutched in her hand.

Setting:

Rain-lashed alleys and shadowy backstreets of the burgeoning industrial district of  Newhaven, 1898.  The city, a sprawling maze of brick and steel, stretched out beneath a brooding sky.  Steam hissed from the factory chimneys, mingling with the smells of coal smoke and freshly baked bread from nearby bakeries.   The district, while bustling with industry, held pockets of poverty and despair where desperation often masked itself in quiet resignation.  This was where Ace, operating from a small, ramshackle office near the docks, navigated the shadowy underbelly of Newhaven, solving mysteries for those who couldn't or wouldn't tackle the city's murky depths themselves.
