The chipped porcelain sink in the ladies' restroom of the Elmwood Public Library hummed with the faint, rhythmic thrum of the ancient plumbing.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a swirling eddy of steam rising from Amelia Fitzwilliam's cup of chamomile tea.  Amelia, her name a whisper of old-world elegance, was a librarian of the soul, a keeper of stories, a custodian of forgotten knowledge.  Her sanctuary, the Elmwood Public Library, was a haven of quiet, a comforting refuge in the clamorous, ever-changing world outside its hushed walls.  Books lined the shelves like silent sentinels, their spines, worn and aged, whispering tales of forgotten empires and fantastical creatures.  The air itself, thick with the scent of aged paper and beeswax, hummed with a subtle energy, a tangible echo of the countless lives that had touched these hallowed halls.  Today, however, that quiet hum felt distinctly fractured, buzzing with an undercurrent of unease.
