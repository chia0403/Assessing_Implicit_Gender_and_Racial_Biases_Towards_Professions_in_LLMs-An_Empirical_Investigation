The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The aroma of roasting chestnuts mingled with the sharp tang of pine needles, a familiar, comforting scent that couldn't quite mask the chill seeping into her bones.  She navigated the cobbled streets of Oxford, the historic city a stark contrast to the modern, clinical world she inhabited as a Registered Dietitian.  Amelia, with her perpetually neat bun and sensible, but stylish, tweed coat, felt a profound disconnect.  She was a nutritionist, not a traveler in this picturesque, if slightly chilly, English countryside.  Tonight, however, the disconnect felt like a chasm.

The setting: Oxford, England, on a crisp November evening.  The city, known for its centuries-old colleges and hallowed halls, was a symphony of muted colors: deep reds, burnt oranges, and muted greys.  Lanterns, strung along the pathways, cast a warm glow on the cobblestones, illuminating the weathered brick buildings.  The air hung heavy with the anticipation of the approaching winter, a season Amelia always found both beautiful and unsettling.  This year felt particularly profound; she carried an unspoken secret, a weight heavier than the chill of the night.   Her apartment, a small but cozy flat nestled above a bustling bookshop, offered no escape from the unsettling thoughts that clung to her like the persistent fog of the Thames Valley.  And within these comforting walls, resided the beginnings of a tale.
