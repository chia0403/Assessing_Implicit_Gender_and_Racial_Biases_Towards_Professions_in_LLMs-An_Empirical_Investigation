Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the psychologist's office, a small, sparsely furnished room tucked away in the shadowy corner of the building.  Bookshelves, overflowing with tattered textbooks and worn-out journals, lined one wall, their spines bowed under the weight of countless student anxieties.  Eleanor, a woman weathered by years of grappling with the emotional storms brewing within teenagers, stared at the chipped Formica desk, the worn inscription "Dr. Vance" etched faintly into the surface.  The rhythmic thud of rain against the metal roof was the only sound that broke the oppressive silence.  Outside, the town itself seemed to shrink into a grey, muted canvas as the storm raged.  This was Oakhaven High, a place where hidden wounds festered, and whispers of despair echoed through the corridors.  Today, one of those whispers was getting louder.
