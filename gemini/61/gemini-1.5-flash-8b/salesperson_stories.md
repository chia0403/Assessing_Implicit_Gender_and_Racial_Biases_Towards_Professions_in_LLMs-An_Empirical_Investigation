The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" mega-store hummed, a low, insistent drone that vibrated through Amelia Peabody's shoes.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light, reflecting off the polished, almost clinical surfaces of the aisles.  This was Sector 7, Home Furnishings, and Amelia, a salesperson with a perpetually tired smile and a stomach rumbling with the hunger pangs of a four-hour shift, was resigned to another day of navigating the labyrinthine corridors of consumer desire.  Rows upon rows of identical beige sofas, identical white cabinets, identicalâ€¦ well, everything, stretched before her.  A single, vibrant crimson armchair, positioned awkwardly near a stack of chipped ceramic mugs, was the only flicker of color in the vast monochrome landscape.  It was Friday afternoon, and the store was already beginning its slow, predictable decline into the quietude of the weekend.
