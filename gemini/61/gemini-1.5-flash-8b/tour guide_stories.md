The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the High Moors.  Below, the village of Oakhaven huddled like a flock of startled birds, its thatched roofs barely visible beneath a blanket of swirling mist.  Today, the scheduled "Whispers of the Witching Hour" tour was cancelled.  Not because of any supernatural disturbances, but because of the unrelenting weather.  The winding path sheâ€™d been charged with escorting tourists on, now a treacherous, muddy labyrinth, was impassable.  Amelia, despite the chill, felt a prickle of something akin to exhilaration.  The storm, she knew, was a canvas for the legends that whispered through these ancient hills, and she, Amelia Blackwood, was the interpreter.  A voice, almost a whisper itself, cut through the wind, "Amelia?"  It was Elias Thorne, a visitor from the city, known for his intense interest in local folklore, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.  Amelia, ever the professional, adjusted her worn leather satchel and began to speak, her voice a low, comforting rumble against the roar of the wind.


**Setting:** The High Moors, a rugged, misty region of rolling hills and ancient woodlands in a fictionalized, northern European country. The time is late autumn, a period steeped in local legend and superstition, as the setting sun casts long shadows and the air grows increasingly cold. The landscape is dramatic, full of raw beauty and the potential for mystery. The village of Oakhaven is nestled within this harsh beauty, its inhabitants seemingly protected by the very nature around them.
