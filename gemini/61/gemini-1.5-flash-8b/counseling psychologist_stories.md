The flickering fluorescent lights of the therapist's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Dr. Eleanor Vance's pen against the notepad.  Rain lashed against the windows of the small, third-floor office, blurring the already muted cityscape into a watercolour wash of grey.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a practiced calm etched into her features, stared at the swirling patterns in the coffee cup in front of her.  Outside, the city, a kaleidoscope of hurried souls, seemed to mirror the anxiety churning within the young man across from her.

The office, a small, sun-starved room tucked away on a quiet side street of downtown Toronto, held little aesthetic charm.  Used bookcases lined one wall, overflowing with titles on psychology, self-help, and philosophy, a stark contrast to the sleek, modern furniture in the waiting room.  A single, slightly lopsided painting of a lone oak tree against a stormy sky hung above the cluttered desk, a silent testament to the tempestuous nature of human emotions.   The scent of old paper and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting, yet slightly oppressive, aroma of her professional life.

Ethan, her client, sat hunched forward, his gaze fixed on the chipped nail polish on his fingertips, a stark contrast to the intensity in his eyes.  He was twenty-three, a recent university graduate, and his struggles to find a job seemed to echo the relentless drumbeat of the city itself.
