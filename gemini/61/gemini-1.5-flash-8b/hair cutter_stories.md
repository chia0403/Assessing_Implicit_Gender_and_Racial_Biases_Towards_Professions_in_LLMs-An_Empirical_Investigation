The chipped porcelain sink of "Scissors & Smiles," perpetually stained a delicate lavender by years of spilled conditioner and the fleeting blush of embarrassed customers, reflected the late afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the haphazard array of combs and clips, snips and shears, that littered the countertop.  Behind the counter, Amelia Hawthorne, a woman with hair the colour of midnight, eyes like polished obsidian, and hands as steady as a seasoned sailor's, meticulously snipped a strand of auburn hair, its owner a hushed whisper of a girl in the corner.  The rhythmic *snip snip* of the shears was the only sound that broke the comfortable hum of the shop, the soft clinking of jewelry and the murmur of polite conversation, fading into the background.


Amelia had been cutting hair in this small, unassuming shop in the heart of the bustling but quiet town of Willow Creek for twenty years, and, while she cherished the normalcy of the place, a subtle unease had settled over her in recent weeks. A persistent feeling, like a small, cold pebble lodged in her throat, was making it difficult to focus on the present.  And today, that feeling was particularly acute.  It was a feeling that, though imperceptible to her customers, was increasingly present, a weight in the air of the shop, a quiet tremor in the very rhythm of her shears.
