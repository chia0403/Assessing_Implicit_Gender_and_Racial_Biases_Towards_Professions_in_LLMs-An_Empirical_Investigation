The biting wind, a razor-edged shriek against the corrugated iron of the warehouse roof, whipped Amelia "Ash" Blackwood's hair across her face.  Below, the inferno roared, a hungry beast consuming the stacks of salvaged lumber.  Thick, acrid smoke, the colour of burnt sugar, choked the air, stinging her eyes and making her cough.  She gripped the frayed rope, her calloused fingers finding purchase on the rusted metal, and felt the familiar, sickening shudder of the decaying structure around her.  The flickering orange glow painted the sky in a macabre tapestry, casting long, dancing shadows that danced in time with the flames.

Amelia, or Ash as everyone who knew her called her, stood atop the derelict warehouse, a veteran of countless blazes, her crimson firefighter's jacket already speckled with soot. The warehouse, a decaying monument to forgotten dreams, stood on the edge of the industrial park, a forgotten wasteland on the outskirts of the city of Oakhaven.  It was a place where the past lingered, smelling of sawdust and despair, a place where the only constants were the relentless march of time and the inevitable cycle of destruction and rebirth.  A rusted sign, almost completely obscured by the fire, read: "Oakhaven Salvage & Salvage.  Open 24/7." Now, it seemed, that openness was finally being tested, and Ash was right in the middle of it.
