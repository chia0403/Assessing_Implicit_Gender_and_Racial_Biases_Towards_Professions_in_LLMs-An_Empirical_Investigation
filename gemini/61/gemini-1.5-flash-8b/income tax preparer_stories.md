The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Ready Tigers" office hummed, a constant, monotonous drone that seeped into Amelia Stoneâ€™s bones.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air, a familiar perfume in the pre-tax season frenzy.  Amelia, a meticulous income tax preparer with a perpetually tired smile and a sharp eye for discrepancies, meticulously organized a stack of tax forms, each a miniature universe of income, deductions, and the ever-present anxieties of her clients.  The small office, crammed into a corner of a bustling downtown plaza, was a testament to the hours she'd poured in; stacks of papers overflowed from filing cabinets, and the air buzzed with the clicking of keyboards and the hushed whispers of financial worries.  The city outside, vibrant with life and commerce, felt a million miles away.  Amelia felt, as always, like she was stuck in the middle of a financial hurricane, her only shield a well-honed pencil and a deep well of patience.
