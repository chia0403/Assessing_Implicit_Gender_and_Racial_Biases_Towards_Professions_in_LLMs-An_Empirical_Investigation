The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous drone that seemed to seep into Amelia Katherine Finch's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a kaleidoscope of crayon drawings plastered haphazardly onto the walls – dinosaurs with rainbow scales, houses with spiky roofs, and a rather alarmingly realistic depiction of a grumpy-looking banana.  Amelia, perched precariously on a wobbly stool in the staff room, stared at the swirling vortex of sticky notes tacked to the corkboard.  Each one held a child's name and a single, anxious detail – "needs more cuddles," "lost tooth," "fussy eater," "scared of the vacuum."

The daycare, nestled in the shadow of the city's towering skyscrapers, felt less like a haven and more like a miniature, slightly chaotic, version of the adult world Amelia was trying to navigate.  The recycled plastic toys, the ubiquitous scent of baby food and desperation, the incessant babble of toddlers and the low grumbles of their parents all blended into a symphony of noise that, despite her practiced calm, still reverberated deep within her soul.
