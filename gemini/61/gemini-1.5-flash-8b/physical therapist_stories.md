Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic pace of Amelia “Amy”  Everett's thoughts.  The small, almost claustrophobic physiotherapy office in the dilapidated building on the edge of the industrial park felt even more cramped today.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the chipped paint and faded posters promoting back-friendly ergonomic chairs.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the damp earth, a familiar, if slightly unsettling, aroma that clung to the air like a shroud. Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously adjusted the weights on the exercise machine, her movements precise and focused.  The hum of the equipment was the only sound besides the drumming rain.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of machinery from the nearby factory intensified the sense of isolation. Today, she had a new patient: a young woman, barely out of her teens, who had suffered a serious sports injury. The case file, resting on the worn wooden desk, held a stark, impersonal description of the accident. The weight of the unknown pressed down on Amy.  How could she help this girl rebuild her life, one careful exercise at a time, when she herself felt her own strength waning?
