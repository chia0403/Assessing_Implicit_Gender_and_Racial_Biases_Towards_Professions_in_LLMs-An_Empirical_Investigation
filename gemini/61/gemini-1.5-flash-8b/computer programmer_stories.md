The fluorescent hum of the server room was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  He’d been a child in this space, a miniature figure perched on his father’s lap, tracing patterns on the flickering monitor screens with a fingertip.

Sweat beaded on his forehead, not from the humidity, but from the relentless pressure to deliver.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the metallic tang of soldering flux. Outside, the sun beat down on the concrete canyons of Neo-Kyoto, a city of towering skyscrapers and neon-drenched alleyways, oblivious to the digital storm brewing within.  Elias, hunched over his keyboard, was the only one truly aware.  His name, etched into the system's core, was inextricably linked to the fate of the new code, and with it, perhaps, the financial future of millions.
