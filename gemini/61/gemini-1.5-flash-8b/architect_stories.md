The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Cavendish's thoughts.  Her sketchbook, filled with crumpled sketches and scribbled calculations, lay open on a wobbly table littered with discarded coffee cups and half-eaten sandwiches.  Amelia Cavendish, architect extraordinaire, or perhaps more accurately, architect-in-desperation, stared out at the churning grey sky.  The year was 1938.  London, a city cloaked in the pre-war anxieties of a looming conflict, pulsed with a nervous energy.  Amelia, perched atop a rickety stool in her tiny, cluttered workshop nestled within the labyrinthine alleyways behind Brick Lane, felt utterly overwhelmed.


Setting:

A cramped, dimly lit workshop nestled within the narrow, labyrinthine alleyways behind Brick Lane, London, 1938.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp brick, linseed oil, and brewing coffee.  Stacks of blueprints,  some yellowed with age, overflowed from every available surface.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering gaslight.  The sounds of the bustling city, the clang of metal on metal, the hawkers' cries, and the distant rumble of traffic, all mingled with the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the corrugated iron roof.  This was Amelia's sanctuary and her battleground, a microcosm of the city itself: chaotic, resourceful, and fiercely independent.
