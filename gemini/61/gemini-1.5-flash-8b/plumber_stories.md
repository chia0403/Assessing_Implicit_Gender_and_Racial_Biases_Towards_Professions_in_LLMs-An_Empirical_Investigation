The flickering neon sign of "The Leaky Faucet" cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his grease-stained overalls clinging to him like a second skin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the tiny, ramshackle plumbing shop, a symphony of relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of Barty's thoughts.  He was late.  Again.  Mrs. Higgins, a formidable woman with a voice like a foghorn and a temper to match, was waiting.  Her leaky bathtub, a notorious problem for the entire neighbourhood, and her unwavering, if slightly unreasonable, expectation for instantaneous repairs were the reason Barty was running late, soaked, and thoroughly stressed.

The shop itself was a testament to the capricious nature of plumbing and the inevitable messiness of Barty's profession.  Tools, pipes, and various bits of plumbing debris were scattered across the tiny space, a chaotic jumble hinting at the intricate systems he was often called upon to fix.  Rusty buckets overflowed with a murky brown liquid, the smell of mildew and copper clinging to the air.  An antique cast-iron bathtub, rescued from a demolished mansion, sat precariously beside a pile of discarded washing machines, their innards a graveyard of broken components and forgotten dreams of clean laundry.  A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting long, dancing shadows on the already cluttered space.  The faint, persistent drip-drip-drip of a leaky pipe added a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of the small town.
