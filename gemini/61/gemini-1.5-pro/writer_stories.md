Rain lashed against the attic windows of Mireille Dubois's cottage, a furious counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her typewriter keys.  Perched on the windswept Isle of Skye, off the western coast of Scotland, the cottage clung precariously to a cliff overlooking the turbulent sea. The only sounds besides the storm and Mireille's writing were the occasional mournful cry of a gull and the rhythmic creak of the old house as the wind buffeted it.  Inside, amidst stacks of manuscripts, overflowing bookshelves, and the comforting aroma of peat burning in the hearth, Mireille, clad in a thick wool sweater and fingerless gloves, battled her writer’s block with grim determination. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in a crumbling Scottish manor, was due to her publisher in two weeks, but the words seemed to have dried up like the ink in her ancient typewriter ribbon.  Outside, the sky was the colour of a bruised plum, and the swirling mist obscured the usually breathtaking view of the jagged Cuillin mountains.  It was the perfect setting for a murder… if only she could figure out how to write one.
