Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the persistent ache in his own lower back.  The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center," its optimistic green lettering barely visible through the downpour, stood solitary on the edge of Harmony Creek, Oregon, a town more known for its dilapidated lumber mill than its holistic health scene.  The rhythmic thump of the old neon "Open" sign provided the only counterpoint to the drumming rain and the occasional mournful groan of the wind. Inside, the waiting room, usually filled with the scent of lavender and the soft murmur of Enya, was empty.  Elias, a tall man with tired eyes and hands that could coax a subluxated vertebra back into place with surprising gentleness, stared out at the deserted main street. 5:57 PM. Three minutes until he could lock up and escape the oppressive greyness that had settled over Harmony Creek like a damp blanket. He just hoped the pain in his back wouldn't flare up on the drive home.
