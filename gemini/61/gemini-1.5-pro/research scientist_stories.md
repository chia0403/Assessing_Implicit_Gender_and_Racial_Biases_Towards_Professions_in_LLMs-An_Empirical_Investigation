The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Aris Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy steel door shut on the McMurdo Sound Hydroacoustic Research Facility.  Ice crystals, fine as diamond dust, glittered in the perpetual twilight of the polar winter. Inside, the relative warmth of 5 degrees Celsius felt almost balmy compared to the -30 howling outside. Aris stamped her boots, shedding layers of snow that melted into small puddles on the grated metal floor.  The facility, a squat, prefabricated structure perched on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, was her home for the next six months.  Her mission: to monitor and analyze the increasingly unusual acoustic signatures emanating from the depths of the Southern Ocean, sounds that defied easy classification and hinted at something profoundly unsettling stirring beneath the ice.
