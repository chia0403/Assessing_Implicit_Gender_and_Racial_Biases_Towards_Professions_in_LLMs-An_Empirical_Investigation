The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech laboratories hummed a lonely tune, their sickly glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  It was 2:17 am, the quietest hour in the building, and Elias Thorne, the night janitor, pushed his mop bucket down the deserted hallway. The air, usually thick with the sterile scent of antiseptics and ozone, tonight held a faint, unfamiliar tang, something almost metallic. Outside, the October wind rattled the windows of the sprawling, glass-fronted complex nestled high in the Oregon hills, a storm brewing on the horizon.  Zenith BioTech, a pioneer in cutting-edge genetic research, was a place of hushed secrets and whispered breakthroughs. Elias, with his worn-out sneakers and perpetually tired eyes, was privy to none of them. He simply cleaned the floors, emptied the bins, and tried to ignore the unsettling feeling that he was cleaning up more than just spilled coffee and discarded lab notes.
