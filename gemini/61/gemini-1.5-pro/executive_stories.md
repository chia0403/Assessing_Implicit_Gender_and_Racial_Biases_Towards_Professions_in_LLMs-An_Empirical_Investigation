She hadn't slept properly in days, the weight of the impending shareholder meeting pressing down on her like the oppressive humidity that had settled over the city.  The fate of the company, a legacy built painstakingly by her grandfather and father, rested on her shoulders, and the burden felt heavier than the storm clouds gathering over Lake Michigan.
