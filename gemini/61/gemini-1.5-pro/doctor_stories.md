The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and carrying with it the faint, metallic tang of salt and something else, something unsettlingly organic.  The small fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled precariously between the unforgiving cliffs of the Yorkshire coast and the churning grey expanse of the ocean, was usually a picture of weathered charm.  But today, a thick, unnatural fog pressed down, clinging to the cobbled streets and obscuring the bobbing lights of the trawlers in the harbour.  It muted the usual cries of gulls and the rhythmic clang of boat repairs, replacing them with a pervasive silence that prickled the skin.  Inside his cluttered office, overlooking the churning sea, Dr. Thorne sat hunched over a worn medical text, the lamplight casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames in the hearth.  He rubbed his tired eyes, a persistent ache settling in his temples.  The fog, he thought, was getting to him. It was getting to everyone.
