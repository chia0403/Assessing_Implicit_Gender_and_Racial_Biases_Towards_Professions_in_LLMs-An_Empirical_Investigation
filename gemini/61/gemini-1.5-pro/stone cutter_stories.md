The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of salt and the mournful cry of gulls.  Grey cliffs, scarred with veins of white quartz, loomed over the small, huddled village of Port Blossom, clinging precariously to the Yorkshire coast.  Here, nestled amongst the weather-beaten cottages and the clatter of fishing boats, Silas Finchley, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the stone he worked, chipped away at a block of granite. His workshop, little more than a lean-to built against the cliff face, offered minimal protection from the elements, but it provided him with the solitude he craved and a breathtaking view of the churning, unforgiving sea that had shaped his life and the lives of generations of Finchleys before him.  The chisel danced in Silas's calloused grip, each strike a testament to his patience and skill, slowly revealing the form of a majestic griffin, destined to adorn the lintel of the newly built church overlooking the harbour.  The year was 1888, and a shadow, deeper than the gathering dusk, was beginning to fall over Port Blossom.
