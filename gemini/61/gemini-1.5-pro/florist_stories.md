The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the drumming rain outside.  Inside, the air hung thick and sweet with the scent of lilies, damp earth, and the faintest whisper of cinnamon from the pot simmering on a small burner in the back.  Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the neon glow of O’Malley’s pub across the street into a hazy emerald smear.  Elara Juniper Wilde, her fingers stained green from re-potting a fussy maidenhair fern, glanced up, expecting to see Mrs. Henderson in for her usual Friday afternoon bouquet. Instead, a man she’d never seen before stood dripping on the worn welcome mat, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  He held a single, perfect white rose, its stem wrapped in black velvet ribbon.  Elara, her heart giving a curious little flutter, wiped her hands on her apron and offered a tentative smile. "Good afternoon.  What can I do for you?"
