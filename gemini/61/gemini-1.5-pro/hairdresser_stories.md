The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lurid, electric green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, amidst the chemical perfume of perms and the hum of hairdryers, Beatrice "Bea" Florence Cartwright sighed, wiping a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead.  It was a Tuesday evening in late November in the small, perpetually overcast town of Dullsville, Oregon, and the salon was quieter than a graveyard. The only sound other than the rhythmic drip from a leaky pipe was the gentle snores of Mrs. Higgins, a regular, whose weekly blue rinse had lulled her into a deep slumber under the dryer. Bea glanced at the clock â€“ 7:48 pm. Two more minutes until she could lock up and escape the oppressive quiet for the equally oppressive quiet of her own apartment.  Dullsville, as its name unashamedly declared, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and Bea often dreamt of swapping her shears for a ticket to somewhere, anywhere, else.
