The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill outside her classroom, roused Eleanor Vance from her reverie.  Sunlight, fractured by the prism dangling in the window, splashed rainbow shards across the miniature tables and brightly coloured alphabet rug. The air, still cool with the remnants of a crisp October morning, held the faint, sweet scent of Elmer's glue and the slightly less pleasant tang of old crayons.  Mrs. Vance's kindergarten classroom at Maplewood Elementary, a small brick building nestled amongst towering oaks on the edge of the sleepy town of Havenwood, was her sanctuary.  It was a place of vibrant chaos, boundless imagination, and the occasional glitter explosion.  This morning, however, something feltâ€¦different. A quiet hum of anticipation, an almost electric energy, thrummed beneath the usual pre-school buzz.  Eleanor couldn't quite place it, but she knew, with the unshakeable certainty that only a seasoned kindergarten teacher could possess, that today was going to be anything but ordinary.
