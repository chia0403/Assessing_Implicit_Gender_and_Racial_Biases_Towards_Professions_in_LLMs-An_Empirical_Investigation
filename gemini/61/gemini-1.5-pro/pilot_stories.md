The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Petrova's parka as she prepped her Cessna 208 Caravan for takeoff.  The sky above the small, snow-dusted airstrip of Talkeetna was a bruise-colored canvas streaked with faint pre-dawn light.  Mountains, jagged and imposing, loomed in every direction, their peaks shrouded in a swirling mist that promised snow.  Ace, her breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, secured the cargo netting over a pile of supplies destined for a remote geological survey camp nestled deep in the Denali wilderness.  It was a routine run for Ace, a veteran bush pilot who knew these treacherous skies like the back of her hand. But something in the stillness, a prickling sense of unease beneath the howl of the wind, told her this flight might be different.
