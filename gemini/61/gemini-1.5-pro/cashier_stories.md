The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed psychic parlor in the drowsy town of Harmony Creek, hummed a monotonous tune.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless drizzle that had plagued Harmony Creek for the past week.

Amelia sighed, pushing a loose strand of her dark, choppy hair behind her ear. Another slow night, another graveyard shift stretching out before her like a vast, empty highway.  She wondered, not for the first time, if becoming a certified taxidermist would have been a more exciting career choice.
