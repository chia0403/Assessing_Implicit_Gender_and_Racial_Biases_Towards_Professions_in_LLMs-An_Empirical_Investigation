Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Anya Sharma's Ford Focus, blurring the already fading neon glow of the "Lucky Clover Motel" sign.  The flickering green shamrock, missing a leaf, seemed to mock her optimism about tonight's visit. Anya Sharma, a seasoned probation officer with the King County Department of Corrections, adjusted the collar of her trench coat, a futile attempt to ward off the damp chill that permeated even the inside of her car.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet asphalt and stale cigarette smoke, a familiar perfume in this part of Seattle.  She checked her watch – 10:17 pm.  Curtis "Ice" Johnson was already two hours late for his scheduled check-in, and Anya had a sinking feeling this wasn’t going to be a friendly catch-up.  The Lucky Clover, notorious for its transient residents and its proximity to one of the city's busiest drug corridors, was the last place she expected to find someone trying to stay clean.
