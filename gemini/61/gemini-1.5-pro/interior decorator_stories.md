The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, sending strands of her auburn hair escaping from beneath her perfectly positioned beret.  She clutched her oversized portfolio tighter, its sharp corners digging into her gloved hand.  The cobbled streets of Notting Hill, usually vibrant with colour, seemed muted beneath a steely grey sky.  Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold.
