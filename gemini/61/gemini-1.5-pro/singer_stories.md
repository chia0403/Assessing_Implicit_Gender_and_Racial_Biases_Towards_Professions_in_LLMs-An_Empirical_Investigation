The flickering gaslight painted Esme Aurelia Nightingale’s dressing room in hues of sepia and gold, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Perfume bottles glittered on her vanity, jostling for space amongst scattered sheet music and half-eaten boxes of chocolates. Outside, the November wind howled down the narrow cobbled lanes of Prague, rattling the windows of the dilapidated Theatre of Whispers. Tonight was the premiere of Esme’s newest opera, "The Clockwork Heart," a fantastical tale of love and loss set in a world powered by steam and magic. Her stomach churned with a mixture of excitement and terror. The theatre, though once grand, had fallen into disrepair, its velvet curtains frayed and its ornate carvings chipped.  Yet, it possessed a certain charm, a melancholic beauty that resonated with Esme's soul.  Tonight, she would pour every ounce of herself into her performance, hoping to breathe life back into this forgotten corner of the city and, perhaps, into her own flagging career.
