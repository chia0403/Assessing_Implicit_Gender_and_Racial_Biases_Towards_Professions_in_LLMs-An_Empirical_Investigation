The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried across Wall Street, the sharp scent of roasted chestnuts vying with the ever-present aroma of exhaust fumes.  His Burberry overcoat, normally a symbol of success and composure, flapped uselessly around him, offering little respite from the chill that seemed to have settled deep in his bones.  Elias clutched his leather briefcase tighter, the weight of the day's anxieties – the plummeting tech stocks, the increasingly frantic calls from his high-net-worth clients, the ominous whispers of a looming recession – pressing down on him like a physical burden.  The gothic arches of Trinity Church loomed ahead, a stark contrast to the gleaming glass and steel canyons of the Financial District, offering a fleeting reminder of something older, something more permanent than the volatile world Elias inhabited.  It was 5:57 pm, three minutes before the closing bell, and every second felt like an eternity. He had a crucial call scheduled with Mrs. Albright, a client whose portfolio was hemorrhaging money faster than a punctured artery, and whose patience, Elias suspected, was even thinner than his dwindling commission checks.
