The bell above the door of "Nailed It," jingled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the churning anxiety in Seraphina "Sera" Dubois' stomach.  It was a Tuesday, typically slow, the kind of day when the dusty, rose-scented air hung heavy with unspoken gossip and the hum of the UV lamps was the loudest sound. Nailed It occupied a sliver of a storefront on Bleecker Street in Manhattan’s West Village, squeezed between a perpetually-closed antique shop and a bustling falafel joint. Its single window, artfully decorated with hand-painted nail designs, offered a glimpse into the brightly lit, albeit cramped, interior.  Sera, perched on her rolling stool behind a manicure table cluttered with bottles of glitter, polishes, and tiny brushes, forced a welcoming smile as Mrs. Rosenblatt, her regular Tuesday afternoon appointment, shuffled in, complaining about the humidity.  Outside, the July sun beat down on the cracked pavement, baking the city in a thick, shimmering haze.  This was Sera's world, a world of perfectly sculpted acrylics, intricate nail art, and the constant, low hum of the electric file – a world that was about to be irrevocably shattered.
