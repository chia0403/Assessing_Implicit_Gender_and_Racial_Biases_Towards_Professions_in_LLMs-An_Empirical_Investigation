The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez as she navigated the cobbled alleyway, the scent of stale beer and damp brick clinging to her wool coat.  Above, the skeletal scaffolding of the derelict Grand Majestic Theatre clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  Built in 1903, it had once been the jewel of Port Blossom, Maine, its ornate fa√ßade a beacon for traveling vaudeville acts and glittering silent films. Now, chipped paint peeled from the walls like sunburnt skin, and pigeons roosted in the gaping holes where stained glass windows once depicted scenes of theatrical grandeur. Esme paused at the stage door, its rusty hinges groaning in protest as she pushed it open, revealing a cavernous darkness within.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through a crack in the boarded-up ceiling, illuminating a space choked with forgotten props and the ghosts of forgotten dreams. This was where Esme, a director renowned for breathing life back into forgotten plays, planned her most ambitious resurrection yet.
