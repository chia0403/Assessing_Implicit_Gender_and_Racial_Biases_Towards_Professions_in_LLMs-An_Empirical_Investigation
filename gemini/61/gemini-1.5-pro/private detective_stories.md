The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Clover Casino across the street cast a lurid, intermittent glow across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Elias Drake Thorne, Private Investigator, sat hunched over his battered oak desk, the cheap whiskey in his glass untouched. His office, nestled above a laundromat in the heart of Los Angeles's less glamorous Echo Park neighborhood, wasn't much, but it was his.

The rhythmic thump of the washing machines below provided a monotonous soundtrack to his brooding. It was a Tuesday night, the kind that usually brought nothing more exciting than a stray cat fight outside his window. But tonight, the air crackled with a different kind of tension, a premonition that clung to Elias like the damp wool of his overcoat.
