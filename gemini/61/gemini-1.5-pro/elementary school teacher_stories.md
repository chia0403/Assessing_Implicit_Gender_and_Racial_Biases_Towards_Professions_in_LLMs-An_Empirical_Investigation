The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom door, a cheerful sunflower yellow that had faded to a sickly buttercream, perfectly mirrored the state of her optimism on this, the last Friday before winter break.  Pine Ridge Elementary, nestled deep in the snow-dusted foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, hummed with the chaotic energy of children anticipating two weeks of freedom.  Paper snowflakes, painstakingly crafted with varying degrees of success, clung precariously to the bulletin boards, interspersed with slightly lopsided construction paper reindeer.  Outside, a grey sky threatened more snow, and the wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the old brick building.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, surveyed the scene with a weariness that belied her thirty-two years.  Thirty tiny humans, hopped up on sugar and the promise of holiday magic, were her sole responsibility for the next three hours. Three hours that felt, in that moment, like an eternity.
