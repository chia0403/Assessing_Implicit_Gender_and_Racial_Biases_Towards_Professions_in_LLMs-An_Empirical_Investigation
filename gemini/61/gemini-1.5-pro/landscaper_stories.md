Frost crunched under her worn work boots, the sound a stark counterpoint to the rustle of dried oak leaves skittering across the manicured lawns of the Oakhaven Estate.  Iron gates, tipped with menacing spikes, framed the entrance to the sprawling property, and beyond them, the Tudor-style mansion loomed, its many windows gleaming like obsidian eyes in the fading afternoon light.  Oakhaven was the crown jewel of Amy's landscaping business, her most prestigious and, frankly, most unnerving client.  Something about the place, with its perfect symmetry and oppressive silence, always set her teeth on edge. Today, that feeling was amplified tenfold.  A thick fog, unusual for this time of year, was rolling in from the nearby woods, swallowing the neatly trimmed hedges and creeping toward the house like a spectral tide.  Amy shivered, pulling her fleece tighter, and told herself it was just the cold.
