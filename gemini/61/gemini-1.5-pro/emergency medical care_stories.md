The siren screamed, a two-toned wail slicing through the thick, humid New Orleans night.  Rain lashed against the windshield of Ambulance 6, blurring the already hazy glow of streetlights reflecting off the flooded streets. Inside,  paramedic Evangeline "Evie" LaRue clutched a lukewarm coffee, her knuckles white against the chipped ceramic mug. The caffeine did little to chase away the clinging exhaustion after a twelve-hour shift that felt more like twenty-four.  Dispatch crackled over the radio, a harried voice cutting through the static: "Ambulance 6, we have a 10-50, possible GSW, victim down in the French Quarter. Intersection of Bourbon and St. Peter.  Police are en route but advise caution, possible suspect still at large."  Evie exchanged a weary look with her partner, Leo Maxwell, his face grim in the flickering red and blue light. This was going to be a long night.
