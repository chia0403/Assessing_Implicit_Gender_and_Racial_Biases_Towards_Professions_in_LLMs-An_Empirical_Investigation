Rain lashed against the ornate, arched windows of Amelia Grace Holloway's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in Edinburgh.  The rhythmic drumming of water against glass was punctuated by the staccato click of Amelia’s keyboard as she entered the final figures for the McTavish Distillery’s quarterly report. Her office, perched high on the fifth floor of a converted warehouse overlooking the Firth of Forth, normally offered a breathtaking view of the choppy, steel-grey water and the distant Fife coastline. Today, however, the vista was swallowed by swirling mist and sheets of horizontal rain.  A single Anglepoise lamp cast a warm pool of light onto her mahogany desk, illuminating stacks of meticulously organized files and a chipped porcelain mug that read "World's Okayest Accountant."  The rest of the room, filled with antique filing cabinets and leather-bound ledgers, was lost in the encroaching gloom, giving it the air of a forgotten library.  The only other sound, aside from the storm and Amelia’s typing, was the faint tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hallway, measuring out the seconds until she could finally escape the tyranny of spreadsheets and embrace the warmth of a peat fire and a good book.
