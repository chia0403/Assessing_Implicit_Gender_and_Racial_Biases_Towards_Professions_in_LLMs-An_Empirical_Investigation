The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed a tired, blueish light onto the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amidst the aroma of coconut shampoo and the faint whir of a ceiling fan, Clementine "Cleo" Beauregard swept up clipped ends of auburn hair, the remnants of Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s weekly trim. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  Port Blossom, nestled between the rugged Oregon coast and the dense, whispering Siuslaw National Forest, was a town perpetually shrouded in a soft mist, a damp embrace that Cleo, after twenty-two years, had come to accept as a constant companion.  She loved the quiet rhythm of the town, the familiar faces, the predictable ebb and flow of gossip that circulated with the morning coffee at the diner across the street.  But beneath the surface of this tranquil existence, a storm was brewing, and Cleo, with her sharp scissors and even sharper intuition, was about to find herself right in the eye of it.
