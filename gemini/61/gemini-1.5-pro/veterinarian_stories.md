The biting wind whipped off the Northumberland moors, rattling the windows of Dr. Elspeth Ainsworth's veterinary clinic. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon. Inside, the air smelled of antiseptic and damp dog fur, a comforting aroma Elspeth had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years in the remote village of Cragside.  The clinic, a converted stone cottage nestled between a brooding crag and the churning North Sea, was her haven, a place where the predictable chaos of animal ailments offered a welcome distraction from the less predictable storms brewing in her own life.  A chipped mug of lukewarm tea sat beside her on the examining table, forgotten amidst a flurry of paperwork detailing the latest outbreak of sheep scab in the valley.  The insistent trill of the phone cut through the quiet, a jarring sound that foreshadowed some new disruption to the fragile peace she had carved out for herself in this isolated corner of the world.
