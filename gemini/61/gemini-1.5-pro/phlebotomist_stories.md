Inside, Amelia, in her crisp, cornflower blue scrubs, methodically arranged her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, butterfly needles, alcohol swabs – the tools of her trade.  This morning, however, a low thrum of unease vibrated beneath her usual calm efficiency. It wasn't just the early hour, or the lingering chill in the air.  Something felt… different.
