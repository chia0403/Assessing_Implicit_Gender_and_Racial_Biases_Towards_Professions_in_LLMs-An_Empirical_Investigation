The clatter of trams and the scent of frying onions mingled in the crisp autumn air of Prague, 1938.  Inside his small, warmly lit shop on Nerudova Street,  Elias Karel Novak meticulously stitched the sleeve of a gentleman's coat.  His shop, "Novak's Needles," wasn't grand, but it was his.  Sunlight, filtered through the large front window, glinted off spools of silk thread organized by colour like a miniature rainbow against the back wall.  Elias, a man of quiet dignity with hands as nimble as a pianist's, hummed a melancholic Czech folk tune as he worked, the rhythmic click of his needle a counterpoint to the street noises outside. The radio, perched on a high shelf, crackled with news of rising tensions in Europe, but Elias preferred the quiet symphony of his craft, a world of precise measurements and meticulous detail where he could, for a few precious hours, shut out the encroaching storm.
