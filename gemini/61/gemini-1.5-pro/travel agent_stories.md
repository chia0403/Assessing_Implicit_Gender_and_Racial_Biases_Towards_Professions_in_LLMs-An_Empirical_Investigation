The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere within the overflowing hibiscus bush outside her window, was the soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday morning.  Humidity hung thick in the air, a damp blanket clinging to the brightly painted buildings of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Amelia, her dark curls pulled back in a messy bun, sat at her desk in "Island Escapes Travel," a tiny but vibrant agency she'd painstakingly built over the past five years.  Travel brochures boasting turquoise waters and white sand beaches lay scattered across the worn wooden surface, interspersed with sticky notes reminding her of flight confirmations and hotel bookings. The aroma of strong Puerto Rican coffee, brewing in the tiny kitchenette in the corner, mingled with the salty tang of the nearby ocean.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a trolley bell signaled the start of another day in Old San Juan, a day Amelia hoped would be less chaotic than the last. A stack of passport applications teetered precariously on the edge of her desk, a testament to the sudden surge in post-pandemic travel that threatened to engulf her small business in a tidal wave of wanderlust.
