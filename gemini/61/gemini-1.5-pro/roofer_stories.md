The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, releasing a pungent, almost sweet aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the back of his hand leaving a dark streak across his already grime-covered forehead.  Below him, the terracotta rooftops of Lisbon shimmered in the heat, a chaotic mosaic stretching down to the glittering Tagus River.  Elias adjusted his footing on the steeply pitched roof of the Igreja de São Roque, a 16th-century Jesuit church whose ornate facade belied the crumbling state of its upper reaches.  A single, ominous gargoyle perched precariously close to his work area, its weathered stone face seemingly mocking his precarious position. The air hummed with the distant sounds of the city – the rumble of trams, the cries of vendors, and the melancholic strains of fado music drifting from a nearby cafe. But up here, high above the bustling streets, Elias felt a sense of solitude, a quiet communion with the ancient city spread out beneath his worn boots.
