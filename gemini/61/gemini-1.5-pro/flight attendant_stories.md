The recycled air hummed a monotonous C-sharp as Amelia "Amy" Reyes smoothed down the wrinkles of her navy blue uniform skirt. Outside, the Chicago O'Hare tarmac glittered beneath the harsh sodium lights, reflecting in the rain-slicked fuselage of the 787 Dreamliner.  It was 3:17 am, a time of day that smelled of stale coffee and jet fuel, a time when most sane people were tucked away in their beds, dreaming of destinations far more exotic than Gate K14. Amy, however, was wide awake, her senses heightened by the familiar pre-flight jitters. Tonight's red-eye was to Reykjavik, Iceland, a place she'd only ever seen in brochures, depicted in a swirl of Northern Lights and steaming geothermal pools. The thought of the otherworldly landscape, a stark contrast to the gritty reality of O'Hare, was the only thing keeping her going through this particularly brutal winter storm. The wind howled against the jet bridge, a mournful sound that mirrored the churning in Amy's stomach. This wasn't just pre-flight nerves; something feltâ€¦off.
