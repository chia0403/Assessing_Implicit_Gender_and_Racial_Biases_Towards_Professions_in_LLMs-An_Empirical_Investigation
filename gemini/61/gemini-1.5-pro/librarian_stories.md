The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, Virginia, a town so small the only traffic signal blinked a sleepy yellow in perpetuity.  Inside the Hearth and Home Library, nestled between Mrs. Peabody's perpetually-closed antique shop and a barbershop smelling eternally of bay rum, Eleanor Ainsworth Cavendish meticulously straightened a stack of biographies.  The radiator hissed in protest against the encroaching cold, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump* of Eleanor’s sensible shoes on the worn oak floor. Sunlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows, cast long shadows across the Dewey Decimal System, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet air.  Eleanor, with her hair the color of faded cinnamon and spectacles perched precariously on her nose, paused, her hand hovering over a biography of Queen Victoria.  She sensed, rather than heard, the library door creak open, and a distinct chill, far colder than November’s breath, slithered into the room.
