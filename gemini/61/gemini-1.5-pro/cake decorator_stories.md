The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the usual vanilla and almond that permeated Buttercup Bake Shop.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braids escaping their haphazard bun, swore under her breath, scraping the charred remnants of a caramel cage from the bottom of her copper pot.
