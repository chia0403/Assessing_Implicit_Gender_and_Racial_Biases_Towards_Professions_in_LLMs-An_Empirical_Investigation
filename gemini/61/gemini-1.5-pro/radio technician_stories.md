The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks as she wrestled with the recalcitrant antenna.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, swirling red dirt against the backdrop of a bruised, twilight sky.  Amy, perched precariously atop a rickety wooden ladder, muttered curses under her breath, her breath clouding in the frigid air. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the Joshua trees, making the isolated Mojave Desert Research Station, a cluster of low-slung prefabricated buildings surrounded by chain-link fence, look even more forlorn than usual.  The radio tower, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, groaned ominously with each gust of wind, a metallic counterpoint to the lonely howl of a coyote in the distance.  The vital satellite uplink, Amy’s responsibility and current headache, stubbornly refused to cooperate.  Communication with the outside world, already tenuous, had been completely severed for the past twelve hours. And in the Mojave, silence could be deadly.
