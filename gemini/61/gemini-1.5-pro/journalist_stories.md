The salty tang of the North Sea mingled with the stale scent of beer and desperation clinging to the pub's threadbare carpets.  Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne, investigative journalist for the Grimsby Gazette, shivered, pulling her worn tweed coat tighter around her. Her notebook lay open on the sticky table, its pages filled with scribbled notes and a half-finished sketch of a trawler named the 'Northern Star'.  It was the Northern Star, and its mysteriously vanished crew, that had brought Millie to this windswept corner of England, far from the bustling London newsrooms she was used to.  The only other occupant of the pub, a wizened old fisherman with eyes like chips of sea glass, took a long drag from his pipe and muttered something about a curse and the whispering tide.  Millie raised an eyebrow, intrigued, but before she could question him, the pub door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure silhouetted against the grey afternoon light.
