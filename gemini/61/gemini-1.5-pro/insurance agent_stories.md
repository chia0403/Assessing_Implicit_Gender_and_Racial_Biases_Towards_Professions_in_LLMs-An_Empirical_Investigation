The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Clover Diner cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street.  Inside, Beatrice "Bea" Agatha Higgins, insurance agent extraordinaire for the ironically named "Fortuna Life & Casualty," stirred two sugars into her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring her mood.  Ashfall, Ohio, population 3,248 (and dwindling), wasn't exactly a hotbed of excitement, and Bea's Tuesday evening was proving to be as thrilling as watching paint dry. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the diner's windows like skeletal fingers tapping for entry.  Bea had just closed her file on Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning poodle's pet insurance claim (a surprisingly complex affair involving a runaway shopping cart and a rogue chihuahua) when the bell above the diner's door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Bea, expecting it to be old man Hemlock in for his nightly slice of apple pie, barely glanced up.  She was wrong.
