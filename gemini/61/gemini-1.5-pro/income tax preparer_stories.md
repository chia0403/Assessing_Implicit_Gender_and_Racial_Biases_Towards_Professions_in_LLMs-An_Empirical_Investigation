Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Holloway's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing in her gut. Tax season was officially upon the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, and Amelia's usually organized world was drowning in a sea of receipts, W-2s, and 1099s.  Her office, tucked away above Mrs. Higgins' perpetually fragrant bakery, was a cozy chaos of overflowing file cabinets and the faint, lingering aroma of cinnamon rolls. Port Blossom, usually a picture postcard of charming New England life, was currently gripped by a collective anxiety, its citizens united in their dread of the impending April 15th deadline.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a faint smudge of ink on her cheek, was their lighthouse in this stormy financial sea.
