The biting November wind howled around the eaves of Blackwood Manor, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their frames.  Inside, the air was still, heavy with the scent of beeswax and old money.  Agnes Periwinkle, her hands chapped raw despite the thick woolen gloves she wore, meticulously polished the mahogany banister, her movements as rhythmic and predictable as the grandfather clock in the hall.
