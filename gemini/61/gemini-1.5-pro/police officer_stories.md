The biting wind whipped off the Narragansett Bay, carrying the salty tang of the ocean and the less appealing aroma of low tide.  Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, her dark hair plastered to her face, hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket.  The flashing blue and red lights of her cruiser painted the crumbling brick facade of the abandoned textile mill in a macabre strobe effect. Providence, Rhode Island, usually wore its faded industrial grandeur with a certain melancholic charm, but tonight, under the oppressive November sky, the city felt desolate and menacing. The mill, looming like a skeletal giant, seemed to exhale a breath of cold dread.  A single, flickering bulb in a second-story window was the only sign of life within its cavernous interior.  Izzy adjusted the grip on her flashlight, the cold metal a stark contrast to the nervous sweat prickling her palms.  This was her third call to this location in as many weeks, each one escalating in its unsettling nature. Tonight, it was a reported break-in.  But Izzy knew, deep in her gut, that this was more than just kids looking for a thrill.
