The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a rust-bucket ferry chugging its way from the mainland to Ailsa Craig, a volcanic plug jutting dramatically from the Firth of Clyde.  Amelia, a reclusive author of gothic romances known for her intricate plots and melancholic prose, hadn't left her crumbling Victorian manor in Whitby for nearly five years. The invitation to the Ailsa Craig Literary Festival, an event so obscure she suspected it was a hoax, had initially been tossed onto the ever-growing pile of unopened mail. But something about the stark image on the brochure, a solitary lighthouse perched atop the craggy island, had tugged at her imagination, drawing her out of her self-imposed exile. The wind whipped Amelia's auburn braid across her face, carrying with it the sharp scent of brine and a faint, unsettling melody that seemed to emanate from the island itself.  Ailsa Craig, shrouded in mist and legend, loomed larger with every churn of the ferry's propeller, promising either inspiration or madness â€“ or perhaps, Amelia thought with a shiver of anticipation, a bit of both.
