The generator, the sole source of power for the remote research outpost he was tasked with electrifying, sputtered and coughed, refusing to cooperate.  He was miles from civilization, the closest town a speck on the horizon he could barely make out in the gathering darkness, and the sun was sinking fast.  His toolbox lay open at his feet, a gleaming assortment of pliers, wire strippers, and voltmeters, silent witnesses to his growing frustration.  He had a sinking feeling this was going to be a long night.
