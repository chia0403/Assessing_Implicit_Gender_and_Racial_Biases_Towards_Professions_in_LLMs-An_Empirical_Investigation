Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Reed's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The rhythmic drumming of water against glass usually soothed her, a metronome keeping time with her thoughts. But tonight, it only amplified the gnawing unease in her gut.  Her office, nestled within the brick and ivy-clad walls of the prestigious Blackwood Institute for Criminal Psychology in upstate New York, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that tonight carried a faint metallic tang she couldn't quite place. Evelyn, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, tapped a pen against the polished mahogany of her desk, her gaze fixed on the file in front of her.  It contained the chilling details of the "Nightingale Killer's" latest victim, the third in as many months.  Each murder was meticulously staged, each victim posed with a single white nightingale feather clutched in their hand. The local police were baffled, and the pressure on Evelyn, the Institute's leading expert in criminal profiling, was mounting with each passing storm cloud.
