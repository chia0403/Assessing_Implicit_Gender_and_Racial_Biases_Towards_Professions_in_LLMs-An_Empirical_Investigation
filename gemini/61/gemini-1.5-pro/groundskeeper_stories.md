The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor, tugging at the brim of Elias Thorne's worn tweed cap. Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots as he made his rounds, the pre-dawn sky a bruised purple above the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  Eventide, nestled deep in the Derbyshire Dales, was a place of shadows even in daylight, its gothic facade a brooding presence against the rolling green hills. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every inch of the estate â€“ from the manicured rose gardens, bursting with improbable colour even in late autumn, to the tangled wilderness of the bordering woods where secrets, he suspected, lay buried deeper than any root.  This morning, however, held a different kind of chill. It wasn't just the frost that made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle; it was the unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic crunch of his boots, a silence that felt heavy with anticipation.
