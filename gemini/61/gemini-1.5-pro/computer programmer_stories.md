Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Anya Sharma's apartment, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey.  Thirty-two stories above the neon-drenched streets of Neo-Kyoto, the rhythmic drumming of the downpour was the only sound competing with the hum of Anya's custom-built server rack.  Cables snaked across the polished concrete floor like metallic vines, connecting various monitors displaying cascading lines of code, intricate network diagrams, and the occasional flickering image of a security camera feed from the Kaito Corporation building downtown.  Anya, clad in an oversized hoodie and fingerless gloves, tapped furiously at her keyboard, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Tonight was the night.  After months of meticulous planning and countless all-nighters fueled by instant ramen and black coffee, she was finally ready to execute her plan.  A plan that, if successful, would expose the deepest, darkest secrets of Kaito Corp and change the city forever. But if it failed... well, Anya didn't like to dwell on that.
