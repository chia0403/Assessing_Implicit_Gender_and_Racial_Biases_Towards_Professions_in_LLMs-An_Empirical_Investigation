The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the plains of eastern Montana, biting at the exposed skin of Jedediah "Jed" Callahan.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, hung low over the Callahan Ranch, the rolling acres blanketed in a thin layer of frost that crunched under the hooves of Jed's horse, a sturdy Appaloosa mare named Bess. The ranch house, a sturdy two-story structure built of weathered wood and stone, stood against the gathering gloom, a single light flickering in the kitchen window like a beacon in the vast, darkening landscape.  November had arrived with a vengeance, and with it, the first real threat of winter's icy grip.  Jed, his weathered face creased with concern, squinted at the horizon, a knot tightening in his stomach.  The cattle, several hundred head of Hereford, were still out on the north pasture, and if this storm hit hard, they'd be at risk.
