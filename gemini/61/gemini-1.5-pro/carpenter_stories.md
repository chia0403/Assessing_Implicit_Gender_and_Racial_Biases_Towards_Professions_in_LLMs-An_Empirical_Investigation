The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal frame of the barn, snatching at the edges of Elias Thorne's oilskin coat. He tugged his knit cap lower, the wool scratching against his stubbled jaw.  Sawdust, fine as powdered sugar, danced in the air, illuminated by the weak, watery sunlight filtering through the gaps in the half-finished walls.  Around him, the rolling hills of the Derbyshire Peak District were a patchwork of muted browns and greens, the stark grey stone walls dividing the fields like veins on weathered skin. Elias's breath puffed out in white clouds, each one quickly snatched away by the restless wind.  He surveyed his work, the sweet scent of pine mingling with the sharper tang of the approaching winter.  This barn, rising slowly but surely on the edge of the Weatherfield estate, was to be his masterpiece, a testament to the skill he'd honed over twenty years. But today, a sense of unease, sharper than any winter gale, gnawed at him. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right, something beyond the usual challenges of a build in the bleak heart of the Peaks.
