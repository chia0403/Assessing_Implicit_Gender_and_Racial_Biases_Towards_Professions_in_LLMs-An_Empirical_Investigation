The air in the Caterpillar Room buzzed with the chaotic energy only a dozen toddlers could generate.  Blocks clattered, tiny voices shrieked with laughter and frustration, and the faint smell of apple juice and disinfectant hung in the air.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, crouched amongst the miniature furniture, patiently coaxed two-year-old Leo to share the bright red dump truck with a tearful Maya.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, hazy shadows across the playground of Little Wonders Daycare, a converted Victorian house nestled on a leafy street in the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. The sea breeze, carrying the distant cries of gulls, drifted through the open windows, a momentary whisper of calm in the otherwise boisterous symphony of toddlerdom.
