The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s auburn braid across her face as she hurried across the courtyard of Ashwood Elementary.  Dead leaves, brittle and brown, skittered around her ankles like nervous mice.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow. Ashwood, a squat brick building surrounded by a chain-link fence and stubbornly clinging patches of browning grass, looked particularly bleak under the oppressive sky. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Eleanor had come to associate with the anxieties and triumphs, the small tragedies and quiet joys of elementary school life. Today, however, the hum seemed to vibrate with an unusual tension.  Mrs. Peterson, the school secretary, had called her just as Eleanor was leaving her previous appointment, her voice strained. "Dr. Vance, we need you in Mr. Henderson's class...immediately."  Mr. Henderson's class was the fourth grade, and  Eleanor knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that whatever had prompted this urgent summons wouldn't be a simple case of playground squabbles.
