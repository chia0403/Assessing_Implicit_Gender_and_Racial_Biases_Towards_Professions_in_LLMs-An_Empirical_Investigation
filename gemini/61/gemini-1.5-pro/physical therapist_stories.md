The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his clinic, Thorne Physical Therapy, nestled between a bustling laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront on Bleecker Street.  The neon "Open" sign flickered and buzzed, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked pavement. Elias tugged his scarf tighter around his neck, the damp chill seeping into his bones despite the thick wool. It had been a long day of coaxing stiff joints and strained muscles back to life, the usual litany of frozen shoulders and post-surgical knees. He longed for the warmth of his small apartment above the bakery across the street, the promise of a hot cup of tea and the comforting crackle of the fireplace he'd painstakingly restored last spring.  But tonight, the familiar route felt different.  A prickling unease settled in the pit of his stomach, a sensation he usually associated with the onset of a migraine, but tonight, it feltâ€¦ominous. The streetlights, usually a reassuring beacon in the encroaching darkness, flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist with a life of their own.
