The clatter of aluminum trays and the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil formed the soundtrack to Tuesday morning at "Le Petit Pois," a bistro nestled in the heart of cobblestoned Montmartre. Rain streaked the windowpanes, blurring the already hazy view of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica perched atop the hill. Inside, Elodie Augustine Dufour, her chestnut braid swinging with each decisive movement, surveyed her domain.  Her apron, starched white against her black chef's jacket, was already dusted with flour, a testament to the croissant dough she’d been wrestling with since dawn.  The scent of yeast and butter mingled with the richer aroma of the lamb daube simmering on the stove, a preview of the evening's special.  Elodie hummed a tuneless melody, her hazel eyes sharp and focused as she considered the day ahead.  Little did she know, this particular Tuesday held more than just the usual rush of lunch service and the quiet satisfaction of a perfectly executed soufflé.
