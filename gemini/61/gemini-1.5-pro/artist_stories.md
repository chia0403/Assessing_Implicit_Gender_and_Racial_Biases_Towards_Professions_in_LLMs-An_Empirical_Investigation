The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face as she leaned precariously over the edge of the cliff, her worn leather sketchbook flapping in the wind.  Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock formations of Santorini, Greece. Whitewashed houses, clinging to the cliffside like barnacles, tumbled down towards the caldera, their blue domes gleaming under the relentless midday sun. Amy, a splash of vibrant color amidst the stark landscape, perched on a crumbling stone wall, a kaleidoscope of oil pastels scattered around her like fallen confetti.  The air thrummed with the cicadas' insistent drone, a soundtrack to the shimmering heat haze that danced above the bleached earth. She squinted, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to capture the impossible blues and whites of the scene before her, the wind whipping strands of her fiery red hair across her face.  This was her third day on the island, and already, Santorini had woven its spell around her, a siren song of light and color she couldn't resist.  But there was something else drawing her here, something beyond the breathtaking beauty.  A mystery hidden amidst the labyrinthine streets and sun-drenched squares, a mystery connected to a forgotten artist and a canvas lost to time.
