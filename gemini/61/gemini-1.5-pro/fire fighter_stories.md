The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s dark hair across her face as she stood on the roof of the St. Jude’s Community Center, the icy spray from the hose numbing her already frozen fingers. Below her, orange flames licked at the boarded-up windows, spitting out plumes of acrid smoke that painted the pre-dawn sky a sickly grey-orange.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling roar of the inferno. The abandoned community center, a hulking brick behemoth in the heart of Chicago's South Side Englewood neighborhood, had become a haven for squatters and, unfortunately, a frequent target for arsonists.  Tonight, however, the fire felt…different.  The intensity, the speed at which it spread, suggested something more sinister than a carelessly discarded cigarette. The hairs on the back of Mia’s neck prickled, a familiar premonition of something deeply wrong.
