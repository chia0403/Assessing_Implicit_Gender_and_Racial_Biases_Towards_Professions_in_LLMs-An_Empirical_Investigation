The relentless Miami sun, even at 7:00 am, beat down on the turquoise yoga mats spread across the white sand of South Beach.  A gentle sea breeze, scented with salt and sunscreen, did little to temper the rising heat.  Alana Reyes-Rodriguez, her dark hair pulled back in a high ponytail that swayed with her every movement, surveyed her class with a bright smile.  Her voice, amplified by a small, portable speaker, cut through the gentle roar of the ocean.  "Alright, my sun salutations! Let's greet this beautiful day with open hearts and strong bodies!"  Her tanned arms, toned from years of dedicated practice, extended towards the brightening sky as she flowed into the first pose, her vibrant energy radiating outwards like the sun itself.  The class, a mix of tourists and locals, mirrored her movements, their breaths synchronizing with the rhythmic crash of the waves. But Alana's smile held a secret, a tightness in her chest that had nothing to do with the challenging asanas. This morning, the familiar ritual of sun salutations held a different meaning.  She was saying goodbye.
