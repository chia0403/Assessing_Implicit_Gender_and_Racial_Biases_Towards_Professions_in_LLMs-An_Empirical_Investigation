The insistent beep of a heart monitor pulsed through the stale, antiseptic air of Room 304, a rhythm counterpoint to the rhythmic swoosh of the ventilator beside Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of St. Jude’s Memorial Hospital, blurring the already fading light of a late November evening in Boston. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her starched white uniform, pushed a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear and peered at the monitor, her brow furrowed in concentration. The patient, a Mr. Henderson, hadn’t stirred in hours, his face pale against the stark white pillow.  A knot of unease tightened in Amelia’s stomach; it wasn't just the storm brewing outside, but a more visceral sense of foreboding, a premonition she’d learned to trust over her ten years as a registered nurse.  Something felt…off.
