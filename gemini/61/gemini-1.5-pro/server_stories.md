The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Busy Bee Diner, a rhythm that usually soothed Amelia Rose Holloway, but tonight, it grated on her nerves like a rusty saw.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the red vinyl booths and checkered linoleum floor.  It was a Tuesday night in October in Harmony Creek, Oregon, a town so small its only claim to fame was being halfway between two slightly larger, equally unremarkable towns.  The Busy Bee was usually bustling with locals at this hour, fueling up on coffee and gossip, but tonight, Amelia was the only one present besides Mrs. Higgins, a permanent fixture in booth number three, slowly working her way through a slice of apple pie and a never-ending cup of decaf. The bell above the door chimed, a welcome interruption to the oppressive silence, but Amelia's hopeful glance towards the entrance revealed only the wind and a swirl of dead leaves.  She sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, and resumed wiping down the already spotless counter.  Tonight, even the predictable monotony of the Busy Bee felt unsettling.
