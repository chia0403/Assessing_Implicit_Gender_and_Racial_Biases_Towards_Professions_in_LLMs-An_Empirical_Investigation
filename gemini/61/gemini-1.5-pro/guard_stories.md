The biting wind howled down from the Greytooth Mountains, whipping Amelia “Mia” Corvus’s cloak around her like a frantic raven.  Ice crunched under her worn leather boots as she patrolled the eastern ramparts of Castle Blackwood.  Built into the sheer cliff face, the castle was a formidable fortress, a jagged claw of dark stone against the bruised purple sky.  Below, the churning waters of the Shadowfen Sea crashed against the rocks, sending plumes of spray high into the air.  Tonight, the sea mirrored Mia’s unease.  Three nights now, the ravens had been restless, their caws sharp and agitated, a stark contrast to the usual hushed stillness of the pre-dawn hours.  Something was wrong.  She could feel it in the icy air, taste it on the salty wind.  Tonight, the walls of Castle Blackwood held more than just secrets. They held a premonition of danger.
