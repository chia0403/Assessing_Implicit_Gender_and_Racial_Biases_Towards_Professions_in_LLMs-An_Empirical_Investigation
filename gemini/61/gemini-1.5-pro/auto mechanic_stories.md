The rusty aroma of brake dust and old engine oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet, sickly tang of antifreeze leaking from a battered Ford pickup.  Grease stained the concrete floor of "Buck's Bodyshop and Repairs" in a Jackson Pollock-esque pattern, a testament to years of dedicated, if somewhat messy, work.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, the sound echoing through the cavernous garage like a mournful drum solo.  Inside, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from a rafter, Eleanor "Ellie" Vasquez, her hands calloused and blackened by years of wrenching, leaned over the open hood of a cherry-red 1967 Mustang, a frown etched deep in her grease-smudged face.  The engine, usually a purring symphony of meticulously maintained horsepower, stubbornly refused to turn over.  This wasn't just any Mustang; it was her baby, her escape, her weekend warrior. And she had a race to win on Sunday.
