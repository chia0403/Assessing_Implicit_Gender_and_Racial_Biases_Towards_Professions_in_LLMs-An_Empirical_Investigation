Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a stark contrast to the icy breath of December clinging to the outside world.  Elias, his spectacles perched low on his nose, meticulously stropped his straight razor against the worn leather strop.  The only other sound in the small, warmly lit space was the gentle hiss of the gas heater struggling to hold back the encroaching chill.  Shadows danced across the checkered tile floor, cast by the flickering gaslight illuminating a single vacant barber chair.  Elias Thorne's Barbershop, a fixture on Bleecker for over fifty years, was unusually quiet this late Tuesday afternoon, a peculiar stillness that settled uneasily in Elias's gut.
