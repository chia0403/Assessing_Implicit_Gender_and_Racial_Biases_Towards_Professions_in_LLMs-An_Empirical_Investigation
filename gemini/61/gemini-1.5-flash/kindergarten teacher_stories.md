The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom!" sign flaked a little more each day, mirroring the slow, inexorable decay of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s patience.  It was Tuesday, a day traditionally reserved for the dreaded “arts and crafts” period – a euphemism, if ever there was one, for the chaotic explosion of glitter, glue, and generally questionable artistic choices that invariably ensued.  Sunlight, weak and watery from the November drizzle clinging to the windows of Maplewood Elementary, barely pierced the gloom of the kindergarten classroom. The air, thick with the scent of crayons, damp wool, and something vaguely resembling overripe bananas, hung heavy and expectant.  A kaleidoscope of tiny, brightly-coloured boots lay abandoned near the door, a silent testament to the miniature tornadoes that had recently swept through.  Eleanor Vance, her usually neat bun slightly askew, sighed, the sound lost in the muffled din of twenty-five five-year-olds already engaged in a pre-craft-related squabble over a particularly coveted sparkly purple pom-pom.
