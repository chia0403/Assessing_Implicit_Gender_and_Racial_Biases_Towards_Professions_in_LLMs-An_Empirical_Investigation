The chipped mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the pre-dawn chill clinging to the air in her Brooklyn brownstone.  Rain lashed against the tall, narrow windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour smudge of grey and black.  Inside, the only light came from the single lamp illuminating her cluttered desk, a battlefield of crumpled manuscripts, overflowing in-trays, and half-empty coffee cups – a testament to her relentless pursuit of the perfect sentence.

This was her sanctuary, her war room, the editorial lair of Mia Holloway, where dreams were dissected, polished, and sometimes, sadly, discarded.
