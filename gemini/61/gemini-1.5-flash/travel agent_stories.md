The scent of old paper and distant lands hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume to Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne, travel agent extraordinaire.  Her tiny shop, "Wanderlust & Co.", nestled between a dusty antique store and a perpetually-empty bakery on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was a chaotic masterpiece.  Maps, faded and vibrant, spilled from overflowing drawers and draped across walls, their creases telling tales of countless journeys.  Miniature Eiffel Towers jostled with miniature Taj Mahals on shelves crammed with trinkets from far-flung corners of the globe.  The air thrummed with the low hum of a vintage globe spinning lazily on its axis, a soundtrack to Mia’s carefully curated chaos.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of adventure contained within her four walls.  This was her kingdom, her sanctuary, and today, a particularly peculiar request was about to shatter its tranquil calm.
