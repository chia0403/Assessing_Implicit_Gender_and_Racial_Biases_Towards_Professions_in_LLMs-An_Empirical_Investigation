The relentless Florida sun beat down on Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s shoulders, turning the already humid air into a thick, shimmering haze.  Sweat beaded on her brow, clinging to the fine strands of her auburn hair as she navigated the chaotic labyrinth of the Orlando Farmers Market. The air vibrated with a cacophony of sounds: the rhythmic thud of a melon being slapped to test its ripeness, the boisterous haggling of vendors, the cheerful chatter of tourists, and the incessant buzzing of flies drawn to the overflowing baskets of ripe mangoes.  Evelyn, however, barely registered any of it. Her focus was laser-sharp, her eyes scanning the vibrant array of produce with the discerning eye of a seasoned nutritionist.  Today was crucial; she needed the freshest, most organic ingredients for her upcoming workshop on gut health, and the Orlando Farmers Market was her promised land.
