The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bonanza" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's meticulously constructed world of discounted dreams.  Amelia, or Amy as most customers – and a few of her less-than-enthusiastic colleagues – called her, adjusted the jaunty red bow tie perched precariously atop her crisp white blouse.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener and the faint, metallic tang of desperation, a scent as familiar to her as her own breath.  This wasn't just any department store; Bargain Bonanza was a battlefield, a sprawling labyrinth of reduced-price temptations, where the spoils went to the most persuasive, the most resilient, and the most relentlessly cheerful.  And today, Amy was ready to conquer.  The monthly sales targets loomed, a fearsome beast she planned to slay with a smile and a well-placed discount coupon.
