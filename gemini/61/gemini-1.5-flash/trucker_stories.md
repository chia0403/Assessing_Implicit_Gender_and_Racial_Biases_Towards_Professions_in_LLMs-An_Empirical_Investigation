The diesel engine coughed, a phlegmy rumble that vibrated through the worn steel of Earl "Big Earl" Thompson's cab.  Rain lashed against the windshield of his eighteen-wheeler, blurring the already indistinct lines of the Nevada desert highway into streaks of grey and brown.  The wipers fought a losing battle, each swipe only momentarily clearing a postage-stamp sized view of the desolate landscape before the deluge returned, turning the world outside into an impressionistic painting of mud and misery.  Big Earl, a mountain of a man with a beard like tangled barbed wire and eyes the color of faded denim, squinted through the downpour, his knuckles white as he gripped the steering wheel. The air inside the cab smelled of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering scent of cherry air freshener – a futile attempt to mask the pervasive grit of the road.  His rig, a battered but trusty Kenworth he'd christened "Betsy," groaned under the weight of its cargo – a load of oversized mining equipment destined for a ghost town somewhere near Ely. The radio crackled with static, a fitting soundtrack to the bleakness of the night.
