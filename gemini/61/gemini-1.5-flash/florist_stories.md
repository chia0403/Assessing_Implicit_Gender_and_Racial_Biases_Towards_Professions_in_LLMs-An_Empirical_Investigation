The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of jasmine and lilies, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Rue de la Fleur.  A lone gas lamp flickered, casting long, skeletal shadows across the window of "Fleur de Lis," a tiny, overflowing shop crammed with blooms of every imaginable hue.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour and fragrance, Aurelia Genevieve Dubois meticulously arranged a bouquet of deep crimson roses, her nimble fingers working with the practiced ease of a seasoned artist.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a customer, but Aurelia, lost in her floral creation, didn't immediately look up.  The rain hammered against the glass, a steady rhythm accompanying the soft rustle of silk ribbons and the delicate snap of flower stems.
