The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the damp strands of hair clinging to Amelia “Mia” Fitzpatrick’s apron.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Shear Bliss," a tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled alleyway in the heart of Prague’s Old Town.  The only illumination came from a flickering neon sign above the door – a faded, chipped depiction of a pair of scissors – and the single, bare bulb hanging precariously over Mia's workstation.  Outside, the Charles Bridge groaned under the weight of the storm, its ancient stones slick with water.  Inside, the air was thick with the comforting hum of her clippers and the low thrum of classical music barely audible over the tempest raging beyond the glass.  Mia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, expertly snipped at a client’s unruly curls, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip was a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of the storm.
