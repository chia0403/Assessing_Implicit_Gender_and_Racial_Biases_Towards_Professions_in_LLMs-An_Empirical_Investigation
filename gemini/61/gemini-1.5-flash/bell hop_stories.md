The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, a stark contrast to the grime clinging to the edges of the ornate Persian rug.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, expensive perfume, and something faintlyâ€¦rotten.  It was the kind of smell that clung to the shadowed corners of opulent places, a testament to the secrets whispered behind closed doors.  Twenty-year-old Archibald "Archie" Fitzwilliam, bell hop extraordinaire (or at least, that's what he told himself), expertly maneuvered a laden luggage trolley through the throng of elegantly dressed guests.  The weight of three steamer trunks, a hatbox the size of a small dog, and a suspiciously heavy violin case didn't faze him; years spent dodging the impatient feet of the hotel's elite had honed his reflexes to a razor's edge.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of wealthy discontent felt different, laced with a tension so palpable, Archie could practically taste it.  A storm was brewing in the Grand Majestic, and Archie, despite himself, felt strangely drawn to its eye.
