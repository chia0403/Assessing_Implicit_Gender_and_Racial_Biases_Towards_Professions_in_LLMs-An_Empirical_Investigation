The air in Serenity Nails hung thick with the cloying sweetness of lilac polish and the faint, acrid tang of acetone.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the humid air above the rows of perfectly aligned pedicure chairs.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week for Anya Petrova, and the only sound louder than the rhythmic whir of the electric file was the frantic tap-tap-tapping of her own restless fingers against the Formica countertop.  Anya, whose nimble hands could coax breathtaking nail art from the most unassuming tips, was currently wrestling with a particularly stubborn bottle of emerald green lacquer, its cap seemingly welded shut by a spiteful, miniature goblin.  The small salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in Hoboken, New Jersey, offered little in the way of excitement, but today, even the usual tranquility felt oppressive.  Something was brewing, a tension so palpable Anya could almost taste it on her tongue â€“ a bitter metallic tang, nothing like the sugary sweetness of her favorite raspberry tea.
