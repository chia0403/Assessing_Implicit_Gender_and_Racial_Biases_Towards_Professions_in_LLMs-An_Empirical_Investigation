The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted school parking lot.  Dead leaves, brittle and brown, crunched under her worn leather boots, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of her own heartbeat.

The last vestiges of sunset painted the sky in angry streaks of orange and grey, mirroring the turmoil churning in Amelia’s stomach.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, she faced the school board, a panel of stern, unyielding faces she’d already begun to see in her nightmares, and the fate of her teaching career hung precariously in the balance.  The air smelled of damp earth and the faint, lingering scent of woodsmoke from the nearby football field, where practice had ended hours ago, leaving behind only the ghosts of cheers and shouts.
