The chipped paint of the lighthouse keeper's cottage flaked onto the worn, wooden floorboards like a slow, melancholic snowfall.  Rain lashed against the thick glass windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood, author of the bestselling "Whispers of the Sea" trilogy.  The dramatic, wind-whipped Atlantic roared just beyond the cottage’s tiny, storm-battered garden, a constant, relentless companion to the isolation Amelia had deliberately sought on this remote, windswept isle of Inisheer.  She hadn’t come for inspiration, not this time. She'd come to escape it.  The success of her novels, once a dream realized, now felt like a gilded cage, its bars forged from the relentless expectations of her publisher, her readers, and, perhaps most cruelly, herself.
