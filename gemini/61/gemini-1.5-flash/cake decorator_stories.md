The scent of almond extract hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clung to the floral wallpaper and the worn velvet cushions of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s armchair.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of her tiny, cluttered shop, “Sugarplum Delights.”  Amelia, her flour-dusted apron stained with a kaleidoscope of icing colours, meticulously piped delicate forget-me-nots onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  Outside, the relentless London rain lashed against the glass, a stark contrast to the pristine, sugary landscape she was creating.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Notting Hill, was a haven of sugary chaos – jars overflowing with sprinkles, tins brimming with fondant, and half-finished cakes perched precariously on every available surface.  It was a world away from the elegant, high-society clientele who commissioned her breathtaking creations.
