The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind rattling the windowpanes of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier.  Evangeline, her fingers stained a delicate amethyst from years spent coaxing colour from silk, meticulously stitched a seam on a gown of midnight blue velvet. The atelier itself was a testament to her life’s work: a chaotic yet charming jumble of bolts of fabric in every imaginable hue, spools of thread gleaming like jewels, and half-finished creations draped artfully over dress forms, their expressions ranging from demure elegance to flamboyant extravagance.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of 1888 Paris whispered secrets under a sky the colour of bruised plums, but inside, Evangeline’s world was a sanctuary of shimmering fabrics and quiet concentration, a haven she fiercely protected from the harsh realities of the city.
