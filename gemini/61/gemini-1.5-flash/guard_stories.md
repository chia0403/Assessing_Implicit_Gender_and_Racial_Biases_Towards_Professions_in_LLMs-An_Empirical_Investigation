The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and something else… something metallic and faintly acrid that clung to the back of Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s throat.  He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter, the rough fabric scratching against his worn leather jerkin.  The patrol lantern, swinging from his belt, cast long, dancing shadows across the snow-covered ramparts of Fort Aloria, its flickering light barely piercing the pre-dawn gloom.  Below, the chasm yawned, a seemingly bottomless abyss swallowed by the encroaching darkness, its depths hinting at secrets best left undisturbed.  Valerius, however, knew better.  The secrets of the Dragon's Teeth seldom remained buried for long.
