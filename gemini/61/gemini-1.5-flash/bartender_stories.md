The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elara Genevieve Blackwood’s fingertips, a welcome contrast to the humid July air clinging to the dimly lit interior of The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, each gust rattling the already precarious collection of mismatched mugs hanging above the bar.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, almost imperceptible sweetness of Elara’s lavender-scented hand soap – a small rebellion against the pervasive grit of her workplace. Outside, the neon sign sputtering above the bar cast a sickly yellow glow onto the rain-slicked street, illuminating the occasional hurried figure disappearing into the downpour.  Inside, only the rhythmic clinking of ice and the low hum of conversation broke the quiet tension that always seemed to settle over The Rusty Mug just before the late-night crowd arrived.
