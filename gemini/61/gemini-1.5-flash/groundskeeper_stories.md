The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves clinging to life with the tenacity of a drowning man.  Elias, a groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, knew the ancient grounds like the back of his calloused hand.  He knew the precise angle the sun hit the rose garden at noon, the hidden path that led to the whispering willow by the abandoned folly, and the grumpy badger who resided under the gnarled roots of the ancient yew.  But even Elias, with his intimate knowledge of Blackwood’s sprawling acres, felt a prickle of unease as he surveyed the estate that day. A thick, unnatural fog clung low to the ground, blurring the already fading light and swallowing the usual comforting sounds of the countryside in a suffocating silence. The air tasted of damp earth and something else… something metallic and faintly sweet, like blood and overripe plums.
