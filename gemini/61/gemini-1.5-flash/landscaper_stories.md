The relentless Texas sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s neck, already slick with sweat despite the early hour.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth of the sprawling, neglected estate.  Thorne Landscaping, his battered pickup truck proclaimed in faded lettering, sat idling in the long driveway, a lonely sentinel against the backdrop of overgrown bougainvillea and cypress trees clawing at the Spanish-style mansion.  Elias, a man built like a seasoned oak himself – broad-shouldered, sun-weathered, with hands that spoke volumes of hard work – adjusted his worn straw hat, the brim casting a shadow over eyes that held a mixture of weariness and quiet determination.  This wasn't just another overgrown lawn; this was the Blackwood estate, a place steeped in local legend, and Elias felt a prickle of unease even before he’d stepped foot onto the property.
