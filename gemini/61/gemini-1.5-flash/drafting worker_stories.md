The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hernandez's pencil on the mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above her meticulously organized desk.  Amelia, a woman whose precision extended beyond her drafting board and into every facet of her life, meticulously traced the lines of a proposed skyscraper, its skeletal form slowly emerging from the pristine white sheet.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the sharp, slightly acrid scent of drafting ink â€“ a smell that, despite its intensity, had become oddly comforting after fifteen years at Peterson & Sons Architects. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad, a stark contrast to the quiet concentration within the firm's hushed drafting room.  The city's relentless energy, usually a source of inspiration, felt today like a distant rumble, muted by the walls of her carefully constructed world.
