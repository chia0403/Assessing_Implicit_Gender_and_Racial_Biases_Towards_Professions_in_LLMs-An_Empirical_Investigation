The salt spray stung Aurelia "Rel" Blackwood's face as she wrestled her easel onto the wind-whipped clifftop.  Rel, a painter whose palette was as vibrant and unpredictable as the Cornish coastline itself, had sought refuge in this remote corner of Land's End.  The jagged rocks, sculpted by centuries of relentless sea and storm, clawed at the churning grey ocean below.  A fierce wind, smelling of brine and seaweed, howled a constant, mournful symphony around her, whipping strands of her fiery red hair across her face.  Today, though, the wind wasn't just a distraction; it was the subject.  The canvas, still pristine white, awaited the furious dance of colour that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of this tempestuous landscape.
