The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the incessant whirring of the refrigerator units packed tight with lukewarm soda and suspiciously-colored energy drinks.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener, a desperate attempt to mask the underlying aroma of stale coffee and desperation.  Behind the chipped Formica counter, twenty-two-year-old Elara Vance stared blankly at the price scanner, her reflection shimmering faintly in the dusty plexiglass.  Another slow Tuesday night at the Quick Stop, another night spent counting down the minutes until the blessed chime of the closing bell.  The only sound besides the hum and the whir was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the countertop â€“ a nervous tic she hadn't managed to break in her three months of employment.
