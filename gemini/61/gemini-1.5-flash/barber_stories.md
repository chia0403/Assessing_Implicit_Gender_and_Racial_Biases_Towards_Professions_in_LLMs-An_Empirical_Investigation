The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood, owner and sole proprietor of Blackwood's Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpanes of his 1920s-era shop, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the worn leather of his barber chair, its springs groaning a silent protest with every shift in weight.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of New York City – a cacophony of honking taxis, distant sirens, and the ever-present murmur of a million conversations – faded into a muffled hum against the thick, soundproof walls.  Inside, Silas worked, his deft hands moving with practiced ease as he shaped the unruly mop of hair atop Mr. Henderson’s head, a silent testament to years spent honing his craft.  The only other sound was the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears, a counterpoint to the steady tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging in an unwavering cadence against the chaos just beyond the glass.
