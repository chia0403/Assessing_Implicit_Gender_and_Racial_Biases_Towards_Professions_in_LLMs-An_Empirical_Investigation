The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the city of Prague sprawling beneath her like a meticulously crafted diorama.

Tonight, under the inky cloak of the Prague night, she was about to unveil the culmination of three years of painstaking work – a design that promised to reconcile the tower's controversial past with a sustainable future.
