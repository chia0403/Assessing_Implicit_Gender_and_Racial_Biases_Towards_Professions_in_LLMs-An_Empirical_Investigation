The salt spray stung Evelyn Reed's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas tarp off the inflatable rescue raft.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee, threatened to rip the flimsy thing from her grasp, tossing it into the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic.  Below, the rocky, wind-battered coastline of the Outer Hebrides clawed at the churning sea, a tapestry of jagged black cliffs and frothing white water.  Evelyn, a Physician's Assistant with the Stornoway Coastguard, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The emergency call had been cryptic â€“ a single, garbled transmission reporting a "serious incident" aboard a fishing trawler, the *Saoirse*, somewhere out beyond the Flannan Isles.  The air crackled with the urgency of the situation, a stark contrast to the desolate beauty of the landscape.  The *Saoirse*'s location was approximate at best, leaving Evelyn and her team facing a perilous race against the mounting storm and the ticking clock of a possibly fatal injury.
