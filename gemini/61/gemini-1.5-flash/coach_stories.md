The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she surveyed the sodden football field.  Floodlights cut through the swirling rain, illuminating a scene of utter desolation:  a deserted playing area slick with mud, the goalposts bowed like weary giants, and the bleachers empty save for a scattering of damp leaves.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet grass and the lingering, metallic tang of blood – a grim souvenir from the brutal scrimmage that had just concluded.  Amy shivered, pulling her worn, navy blue windbreaker tighter around her.  This wasn't the idyllic autumnal setting she'd envisioned when she'd taken on the job as head coach of the St. Jude's Saints, but then again, nothing about this season had gone according to plan.
