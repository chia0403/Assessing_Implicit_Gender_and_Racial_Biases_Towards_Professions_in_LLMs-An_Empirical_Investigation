The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Auri” Davenport.  Auri, owner and sole operator of “Shear Bliss” salon, perched on a worn velvet stool behind the shampoo bowl, meticulously cleaning a stray hair from the porcelain basin.  Outside, the relentless New Orleans sun beat down on Frenchmen Street, turning the already vibrant hues of the Creole architecture into a shimmering kaleidoscope.  The rhythmic thrum of jazz bled through the open window, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears from the previous client.  It was a Tuesday, slow but steady, the kind of day Auri usually appreciated.  But today, a nervous energy prickled beneath her usually calm demeanor.  A new client, a notoriously elusive musician, was scheduled for a consultation in an hour, and Auri couldn’t shake the feeling that this appointment was anything but ordinary.
