The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne's face as the ferry shuddered, groaning against the violent churn of the North Sea.  Rain, thick and relentless, hammered against the grimy windows of the small passenger cabin, blurring the already indistinct outline of the Shetland Islands rising from the tumultuous grey water.  Ava, her thick, dark braid plastered to her collar, pulled her worn leather jacket tighter, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers beneath.  The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel, brine, and something elseâ€¦ something faintly metallic, that pricked at the edge of her awareness, a scent that spoke of blood and impending trouble.  This wasn't just another transfer to a sleepy island outpost; she could feel it in the marrow of her bones.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, a fitting soundtrack to the grim task that awaited her on the windswept shores of Unst.
