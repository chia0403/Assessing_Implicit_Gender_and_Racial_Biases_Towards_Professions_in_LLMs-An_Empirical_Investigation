The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher through the churning snowdrift.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and something vaguely metallic, stung her lungs.  The flickering sodium-vapor streetlights cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling snow, transforming the familiar streets of downtown Providence into a bleak, almost otherworldly landscape.  Ambulance sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful chorus echoing the urgency thrumming beneath Amy’s ribs.  Tonight, like most nights, felt less like a job and more like a desperate race against the clock, a frantic ballet performed amidst the city's indifferent, frozen heart.  The emergency lights of her own ambulance pulsed rhythmically, casting a frantic strobe effect on the faces of the two paramedics already struggling with their patient – a young man, unconscious and bleeding, his face pale against the crimson stain spreading across his shirt.  Amy, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician with five years under her belt at Providence General, knew this night was going to be long.
