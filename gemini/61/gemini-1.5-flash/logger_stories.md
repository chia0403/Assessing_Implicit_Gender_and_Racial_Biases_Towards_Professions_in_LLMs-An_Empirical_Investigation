The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne’s beard across his frost-chapped cheeks, each icy strand a tiny needle pricking his skin.  He hunched deeper into his worn, sheepskin-lined coat, the collar pulled high to shield his face from the relentless assault of the January gale.  Around him, the ancient Sitka spruce forest of the Alaskan Panhandle groaned under the weight of snow, a mournful symphony echoing through the towering trees.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, held the sharp, clean tang of impending snow, a promise of more hardship to come.  Elias, his calloused hands gripping the axe handle with a practiced ease born from decades spent wrestling with the wilderness, surveyed his domain – a swathe of virgin timber that whispered of centuries past, and whispered louder still of the perilous future it held for him and his small logging crew.  The biting wind threatened to tear the very heart out of the forest, and tonight, Elias felt it might just succeed in doing the same to him.
