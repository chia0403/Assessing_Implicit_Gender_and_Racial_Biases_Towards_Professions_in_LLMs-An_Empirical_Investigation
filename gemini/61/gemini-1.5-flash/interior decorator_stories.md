The scent of old varnish and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume clinging to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane.  Amelia Hawthorne, her name as crisp and elegant as the tailored linen suit she wore, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  This wasn't the charming, slightly dilapidated Victorian she'd been promised; this was a mausoleum.  A mausoleum filled with chipped porcelain dolls, moth-eaten velvet drapes, and the lingering odour of something vaguely floral, yet undeniably…rotten.  The grand, decaying mansion, Blackwood Manor, loomed around her, a testament to forgotten grandeur and the slow, insidious creep of neglect.  Its once-proud façade, now scarred with time and weather, hinted at a history both opulent and unsettling, a history Amelia was about to unravel, one dusty, forgotten room at a time.
