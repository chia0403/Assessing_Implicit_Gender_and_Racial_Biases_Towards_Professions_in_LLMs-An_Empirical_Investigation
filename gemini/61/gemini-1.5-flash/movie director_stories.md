The air hung thick and humid, a clinging blanket woven from the scent of diesel fumes and frying plantains.  Cicadas shrieked their relentless chorus from the mango trees lining the dusty road, their song a jarring counterpoint to the low hum of the generator powering the ramshackle film set.  Sweat beaded on Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez's brow, not from the heat alone, but from the sheer, mounting pressure.  Her meticulously planned shot – a sweeping vista of the Haitian countryside bathed in the golden light of the setting sun – was being threatened by a rogue flock of squawking parrots, determined to steal the show. Izzy, renowned for her gritty, independent films and even grittier temperament, muttered a string of Spanish curses under her breath, her director's chair creaking under her weight as she wrestled with a growing sense of unease that went far beyond a flock of feathered interlopers. This wasn't just another challenging shoot; this was *her* film, her masterpiece, and everything was at stake.
