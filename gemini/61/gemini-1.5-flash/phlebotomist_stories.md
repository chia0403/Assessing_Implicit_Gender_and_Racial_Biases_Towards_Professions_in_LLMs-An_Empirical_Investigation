The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; Amelia, a phlebotomist with seven years under her belt, had seen it all – from the terrified toddlers clinging to their mothers to the stoic veterans who barely flinched at the needle.  No, this wasn't nerves.  This was a feeling far colder, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach that had nothing to do with the overflowing requisition bins or the endless stream of patients waiting to have their blood drawn. This morning, something felt…off. The sterile scent of antiseptic couldn't quite mask the metallic tang hanging in the air, a scent that spoke less of blood and more of something…else.  The usual chaotic symphony of the lab – the clatter of test tubes, the hushed conversations of nurses, the beeping of machines – felt muted, almost expectant.  Amelia adjusted her lab coat, the crisp white fabric a stark contrast to the unsettling stillness that had settled over Mercy General.
