The chipped paint of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's writing desk flaked onto the worn Persian rug, a miniature snowstorm mirroring the blizzard raging outside her cottage window.  The wind, a banshee wailing against the ancient timbers of the Croft House, howled like a tormented beast, rattling the panes and threatening to tear the ivy from the walls.  Inside, however, a comforting warmth emanated from the crackling fire in the hearth, its flames dancing in a hypnotic rhythm that Amelia found strangely soothing despite the tempestuous weather.  The only illumination came from the firelight and the single lamp illuminating her manuscript, its pages filled with a spidery script that chronicled a tale of dark magic and forbidden love â€“ a stark contrast to the cozy, if slightly dilapidated, haven Amelia had found in the remote Cornish village of Portwenn.
