The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled with the stubborn fishing net, its thick twine chafing against her already raw hands.  The wind, a relentless, icy hand from the North Atlantic, whipped her hair across her eyes, blurring the already hazy view of the craggy coastline.  She hunched deeper into her worn, waterproof jacket, the damp chill seeping through despite its valiant efforts. The tiny island of Inishmaan, a mere speck of emerald green clinging to the edge of the world, was beautiful, undeniably so, but its beauty was harsh, unforgiving, a mirror to the stubborn resilience of its inhabitants – and the challenges that faced her as a physical therapist in this remote corner of Ireland.  The smell of brine and peat hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the sea's powerful presence and the land's tenacious grip.  This wasn't some sterile, modern clinic; this was a battle waged against the elements, and today, Eleanor's patient was a battle-scarred fisherman named Seamus O'Malley, whose leg, entangled in that very net, was the latest casualty of the unforgiving ocean.
