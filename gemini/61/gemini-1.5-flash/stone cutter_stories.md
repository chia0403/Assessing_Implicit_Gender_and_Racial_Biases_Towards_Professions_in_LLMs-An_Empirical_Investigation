The wind, a rasping, gritty thing, whipped across the desolate plains of Alora, carrying with it the scent of sun-baked earth and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and rust, danced across the cracked landscape, their swirling forms mirroring the turmoil in Elias Thorne's heart. Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the granite he shaped, sat perched precariously on a crumbling outcrop, his gaze fixed on the horizon.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, their peaks a bruised purple against the fiery sky.  Before him, half-finished and abandoned, lay his latest commission: a colossal statue of the long-dead King Alaric, its once-proud face now marred by a network of cracks, mirroring the fracturing of Eliasâ€™s own spirit.  The quarry, a gaping maw in the earth, lay silent except for the occasional mournful cry of a distant hawk.  This desolate beauty, usually a source of inspiration, offered him no solace today.  The weight of his failure pressed down upon him like the heavy stones he usually hewed with such practiced ease.
