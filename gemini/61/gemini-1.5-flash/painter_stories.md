The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched on the wind-battered cliffs of Cornwall, the raw, untamed beauty a stark contrast to the delicate watercolour washes she was attempting to capture.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn hair across her face, blurring the already indistinct line between the crashing waves and the churning grey sky.  Below, the jagged rocks, slick with sea foam, looked like the teeth of some slumbering beast, a fitting subject for her next masterpiece, though capturing their essence proved a formidable challenge.  Her easel, a sturdy, battered oak thing, threatened to topple with every gust, its legs digging precariously into the uneven ground.  The scent of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, a heady perfume for an artist who found inspiration in the untamed heart of the ocean.
