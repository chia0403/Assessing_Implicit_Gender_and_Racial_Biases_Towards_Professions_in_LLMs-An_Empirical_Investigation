The fluorescent lights of Pruitt & Pruitt hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Evelyn Beatrice Ainsworth's perfectly manicured fingernails against the polished mahogany of her desk.  Evelyn, at the ripe age of thirty-two, possessed a secretarial skillset that bordered on the preternatural – her filing system was a marvel of efficiency, her shorthand could transcribe the ramblings of a caffeinated CEO with unnerving accuracy, and her ability to anticipate the needs of Mr. Pruitt before he even voiced them was the stuff of legend within the firm.  But today, the usual comforting rhythm of her workday was fractured.  A thick, ominous manila envelope, addressed simply to "E. Ainsworth," sat on her blotter, its weight unsettling, its contents unknown. The air conditioning, usually a crisp and efficient 72 degrees, felt suddenly, oppressively cold.  This wasn't just another Tuesday at Pruitt & Pruitt; something felt…wrong.  The city of Chicago, a concrete jungle usually vibrant with life even at this late hour, felt eerily still outside the panoramic window of her office on the 27th floor.
