The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic clatter of her keyboard.  Outside, the late-March wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the sycamore tree that scraped against the window of her small, cluttered office on the second floor of a faded brick building in the heart of Millbridge, Ohio.  The air inside, however, smelled less of springtime and more of stale coffee, desperation, and the faintly acrid scent of fear â€“ a familiar aroma during tax season.  Mildred McMillan, CPA, adjusted her glasses, a tiny sigh escaping her lips.  Another mountain of 1040s awaited her, each one a potential minefield of deductions, credits, and the ever-present possibility of an audit.  This year, however, felt different; a weight heavier than the usual April pressure pressed down on her, a premonition as sharp as the smell of the lemon-scented cleaner she used to wipe down her perpetually sticky desk.
