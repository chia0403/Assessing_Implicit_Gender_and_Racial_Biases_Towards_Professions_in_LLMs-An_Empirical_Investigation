The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Veterinary Clinic open.  The scent of antiseptic and something faintly…musky, hit her immediately, a familiar cocktail she’d come to associate with the unpredictable rhythm of rural veterinary practice.  Alder Creek itself, nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was a town clinging precariously to the mountainside, its wooden houses huddled together like frightened sheep against the relentless grey sky.  The clinic, a converted barn with mismatched windows and a paint job that had seen better decades, reflected the town’s rugged charm – functional, slightly dilapidated, and undeniably full of character.  Inside, the warmth of the wood-burning stove fought a losing battle against the encroaching chill, and the usual pre-winter chaos reigned:  a half-eaten bag of dog biscuits lay abandoned on the floor next to a discarded pair of rubber gloves, and a cat, with a distinctly disgruntled expression, perched atop a stack of veterinary journals.  Eleanor sighed. Another day, another adventure in the heart of the wild.
