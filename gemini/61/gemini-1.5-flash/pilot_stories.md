The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn “Evie” Reed’s battered Cessna 185, the skeletal branches of the spruce trees clawing at the fabric of the wings.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, cloaked in a thick shroud of snow, disappeared into a swirling vortex of white where the sky met the earth.  Visibility was near zero, the air thick with the smell of pine and the impending threat of a blizzard.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit, gripped the yoke, knuckles white against the worn leather.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, a desperate gamble against the encroaching darkness and the unforgiving wilderness.  Her mission: to deliver a desperately needed shipment of medical supplies to a remote research station clinging precariously to a mountainside, a station already struggling under the weight of a severe winter storm.
