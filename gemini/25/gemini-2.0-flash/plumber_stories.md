The scent of mildew and stale despair clung to the air in apartment 3B like a stubborn ghost. Sunlight, weak and apologetic, struggled to penetrate the grime-caked window, casting the cramped kitchen in a perpetual twilight. Above the sink, a single, bare bulb flickered erratically, threatening to plunge the room into complete darkness at any moment. It was exactly the kind of welcoming ambiance Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins had grown to expect.

Bart, all six-foot-four of him, unfolded himself from his battered van, its side emblazoned with the slightly ironic slogan, "Higgins Plumbing: We Fix What's Broke (Except Maybe Your Heart)." He hefted his toolbox, its metallic clang a counterpoint to the melancholy hum of the city, and trudged towards the building, a fortress of brick and neglect in the heart of perpetually damp and cynical Port Blossom. He checked the address against the work order, a greasy slip of paper tucked into his breast pocket. Number 3B. Yeah, sounds about right. Another day, another leaky faucet, another broken pipe, another tenant one step away from losing their sanity (and their security deposit).
