The insistent chirp of a robin clawed its way through Miss Eleanor Abigail Ainsworth's closed bedroom window, a tiny, feathered reveille against the heavy velvet of sleep. Ellie groaned, burying her head deeper into her pillow, a faded floral print inherited from her grandmother. 5:45 AM. Still too early. Much, much too early.

Ellie knew perfectly well that the sun wouldn't truly bother her for another hour, and that she could, in theory, squeeze in another forty-five minutes of blessed unconsciousness. But experience, forged in the crucible of nine years of teaching third grade at Maplewood Elementary, had taught her that resistance was futile. Once the robins started, the day had begun, whether she liked it or not.

Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, almost aggressively quaint town of Havenwood, Vermont, was exactly the kind of school you'd picture on a postcard. A two-story brick building, perpetually adorned with student artwork and seasonal decorations, it boasted a sprawling playground, a surprisingly robust (and slightly intimidating) parent-teacher association, and a staff who, for the most part, genuinely cared about the well-being of their students. Its charm, however, could occasionally border on suffocating, the very air thick with maple syrup-scented good intentions and the faint, lingering aroma of floor wax and crayons. And right now, Ellie knew that aroma, and those good intentions, were waiting for her.
