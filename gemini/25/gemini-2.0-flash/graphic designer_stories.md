## Story Opening:

The incessant buzzing of the office fluorescent lights drilled into Amelia Grace Davies' skull, a relentless counterpoint to the throbbing behind her eyes. She squinted at her monitor, the glow reflecting off the rim of her oversized, purple-framed glasses. Another rejected design. Another email from Mr. Henderson, brimming with passive-aggressive feedback that basically translated to, "This is terrible, but I can't tell you *why*."

Amelia sighed, the sound like air leaking from a punctured balloon. Outside, the early evening rain was a soft, whispering curtain against the grimy window, blurring the cityscape into a hazy watercolor of grays and muted reds. She felt a familiar prickle of resentment. The deadline for the Peterson Pharmaceutical rebrand was looming, and the client, bless their pharmaceutical hearts, seemed to be allergic to anything even vaguely resembling creativity. They wanted bland. They wanted safe. They wanted… beige. Amelia, on the other hand, wanted to inject a little soul, a little *life*, into the world of blood pressure pills and cholesterol-lowering medication. 

She pushed back from her desk, the ergonomic chair groaning in protest, and rubbed her temples. Another late night loomed. Another battle with the Beige Brigade. Another reminder that sometimes, graphic design was less about art and more about glorified PowerPoint presentations.

## Setting:

The "Innovative Solutions" office was located on the 27th floor of a nondescript glass and steel tower in the heart of downtown Chicago. Despite its ambitious name, the agency was decidedly uninspired, its grey cubicles stretching in a monotonous grid across the open-plan office. The walls were adorned with motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling faces and platitudes like "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work" and "Think Outside the Box" – ironic, considering the box-like conformity that reigned supreme within its walls.

Amelia's cubicle was a small, cluttered haven amidst the corporate wasteland. Scattered across her desk were sketches, swatches of color, and half-empty mugs of herbal tea. A small, brightly colored Frida Kahlo figurine stood guard on the corner of her monitor, a silent symbol of artistic rebellion in the face of corporate blandness. A worn copy of "Meggs' History of Graphic Design" sat precariously on the edge of her overflowing bookshelf, threatening to topple and bury her alive. It was a small, imperfect space, but it was hers. And within its confines, Amelia Grace Davies fought the good fight against the tyranny of beige, one rejected design at a time.
