The humid August air hung heavy over Harmony Creek Elementary, thick with the scent of freshly mowed grass and the faint, metallic tang of anticipation. Even a seasoned professional like Dr. Eleanor Abigail Thorne felt a familiar flutter in her stomach as she navigated the deserted hallways. Empty classrooms, still smelling faintly of summer cleaner, echoed with the ghosts of laughter and learning.

Harmony Creek was a quaint, almost storybook school nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a small town in upstate New York that prided itself on its apple orchards and tight-knit community. The kind of place where everyone knew everyone, and secrets were a luxury no one could afford. It was Eleanor's second year as the school psychologist, and while she appreciated the bucolic charm of Willow Creek, she'd quickly learned that idyllic facades often concealed messy, complicated realities. Realities she was now tasked with helping navigate, starting in exactly one week when the bell would ring and the halls would explode with the cacophony of another school year.

Eleanor paused outside her office, a small, brightly-colored haven tucked between the nurse's station and the principal's office. A cheerful sign bearing her name and title was carefully taped to the door. Inside, sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. It was a clean slate, a blank canvas ready to be filled with the stories of the children of Harmony Creek. And she, Eleanor Abigail Thorne, was ready to listen.
