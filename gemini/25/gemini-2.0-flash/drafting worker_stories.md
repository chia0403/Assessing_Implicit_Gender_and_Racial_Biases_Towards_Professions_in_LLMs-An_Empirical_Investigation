Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1937. The place is the sprawling, soot-stained city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The air hangs thick with the smell of coal smoke and iron. The city is a testament to the industrial age, a network of steel mills, factories, and foundries that hum day and night. The Depression has loosened its grip somewhat, but the scars are still visible in the faces of the working class, etched with worry and hardship. The focus of this particular story is the design office of the prestigious 'Allegheny Bridge & Ironworks' company. It is a cavernous room, dimly lit by harsh fluorescent lights and large windows that look out over the steel mills. Long rows of drafting tables stretch across the room, each cluttered with blueprints, T-squares, pencils, compasses, and erasers. The sound of the rhythmic scratching of graphite on paper fills the air, punctuated by the occasional clatter of a tool falling to the wooden floor and the mumbled conversations between draftsmen.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and sharpened pencils filled the air as Theodore "Teddy" Maxwell adjusted his glasses and peered at the intricate blueprint spread across his drafting table. At 27, he was one of the youngest draftsmen at Allegheny Bridge & Ironworks, but his meticulous nature and knack for detail had already earned him a quiet respect among his older colleagues. The sprawling design before him depicted a new section of elevated railway intended to ease congestion in the city's bustling South Side. It was a challenging project, riddled with complex angles and weight distribution calculations.

Teddy traced the lines of the proposed support beams with his finger, a faint furrow creasing his brow. Something about the placement of the central pylon in relation to the riverbed didn't quite sit right. He chewed on the end of his pencil, a nervous habit he'd had since his days at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The chief engineer, a gruff, barrel-chested man named Mr. O'Malley, had personally assigned him to this portion of the design, emphasizing the importance of its accuracy. Teddy couldn't afford to make a mistake. Not with the rumors swirling about potential layoffs and the ever-present pressure to prove his worth. He hunched further over the blueprint, determined to find the flaw that gnawed at the back of his mind, oblivious to the shadows lengthening outside the office windows.

**Notes:**

*   **Character introduction:** We meet Teddy, understand his role, and get a sense of his personality (meticulous, nervous, driven).
*   **Setting established:** We get a vivid picture of the time, place, and atmosphere.
*   **Conflict hinted at:** The challenging project, the pressure to perform, and the rumors of layoffs create immediate tension.
*   **Intrigue established:** The "something" that doesn't sit right with the design is a hook to keep the reader engaged.

I hope this is a good starting point for your story! Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any aspect.
