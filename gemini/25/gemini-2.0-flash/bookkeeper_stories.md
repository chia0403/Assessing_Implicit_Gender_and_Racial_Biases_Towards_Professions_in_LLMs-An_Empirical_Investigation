The fluorescent lights of Reliable Retail's back office hummed a monotonous drone, a sound Amelia Isabelle Finch had grown to both rely on and resent. It was a sound that spoke of order, of neat columns of numbers, of the satisfying click of a calculator button confirming a balance. And right now, surrounded by stacks of invoices taller than her teacup, that order felt miles away.

Amelia Isabelle Finch, bookkeeper extraordinaire (at least in her own, slightly-delusional opinion), sat hunched over her desk, the rim of her spectacles digging into the bridge of her nose. A stray strand of auburn hair, usually neatly tucked into a low bun, had escaped and tickled her cheek, adding to the general feeling of disarray. The setting was a cramped, windowless office, tucked behind the bustling sales floor of Reliable Retail, a regional chain specializing in discounted home goods and garden supplies. The walls were painted a shade of beige so bland it was practically offensive. On one wall hung a motivational poster featuring a sunset over a mountain range with the caption, "Reach for the Peak!" Amelia often wondered if the person who chose it had ever actually *climbed* anything steeper than a flight of stairs.

The scent of cheap furniture polish and dust motes hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faintest, sweetest smell of honeysuckle wafting in from the small ceramic pot on her desk. It was her one attempt to personalize the sterile environment, a tiny rebellion against the overwhelming beige. It was also a potent reminder of her grandmother's garden, a far cry from the chaos currently threatening to engulf her. Because right now, the numbers weren't adding up. And Amelia Isabelle Finch, a woman who lived for the perfect balance sheet, was starting to panic.
