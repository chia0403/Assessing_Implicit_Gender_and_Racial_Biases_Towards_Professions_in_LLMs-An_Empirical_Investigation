## Story Opening:

The dust devil danced across the barren expanse, a whirling dervish against the bruised purple of the late afternoon sky. Jedediah Ezekiel "Jed" Miller squinted, his weathered face creased with the familiarity of the sight. Another day drawing to a close on the unforgiving plains, and another day that felt like it had wrung him out like an old dish rag. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the parched earth, the brown liquid disappearing almost instantly. He could taste the grit between his teeth, a constant reminder of the land's relentless dryness. It had been three months since the last decent rainfall, and the worry gnawed at him, a persistent ache in his gut. He needed rain. The cattle needed rain. And Jedediah Ezekiel Miller needed a damn good miracle.

## Setting:

Jedediah Ezekiel Miller's ranch, "Dust Devil's Kiss," sprawled across a thousand acres of hardscrabble land in the southeastern corner of Montana, bordering Wyoming. The terrain was mostly flat, punctuated by the occasional low butte and scattered clumps of sagebrush and hardy grasses. The main house, a single-story affair built of weathered wood and patched with tin, sat near a dry creek bed, a testament to the unpredictable nature of the local climate. A dilapidated barn, its roof sagging in places, stood a short distance away, along with a collection of rusting machinery and corrals that groaned under the constant pressure of the cattle. The air was usually dry and hot in the summer, biting and unforgiving in the winter, and always, always filled with dust. The closest town, Harmony, Montana, was a dusty speck on the map, offering little in the way of solace or supplies beyond the bare necessities. This was a land where survival was a constant battle, a place that tested the resilience of both man and beast.
