Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a character named:

**Main Character:** Genevieve Marie Dubois

**Setting:** A bustling, humid afternoon in New Orleans, inside "Nailah's Noir," a small, brightly colored nail salon nestled on a side street just off Frenchmen Street.

**Story Opening:**

The low hum of the electric nail files was almost drowned out by the brass band spilling from the doorway of the Spotted Cat Music Club next door. Genevieve Marie Dubois, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously buffed the glossy scarlet lacquer on Mrs. Eldridge’s perfectly manicured nails. The woman, draped in what Genevieve suspected was an actual mink stole (in *this* weather, mind you!), was rambling on about the scandalous behavior of her nephew at Mardi Gras. Genevieve usually loved the gossip, lapping it up like a café au lait, but today, her mind was a hummingbird, flitting from one panicked thought to the next. The rent was due. The glitter shipment hadn't arrived. And she was *absolutely sure* she'd accidentally chipped Mrs. Eldridge’s other ring finger five minutes ago and somehow miraculously smoothed it over without the woman noticing. New Orleans was a city of magic, after all, wasn't it?

Genevieve gripped the woman’s hand a little tighter, forcing a polite smile. “Oh, that *is* dreadful, Mrs. Eldridge. Just…dreadful.” She hoped her voice sounded convincing. In reality, the only thing dreadful was the growing knot of anxiety tightening in her chest, a familiar unwelcome guest that always seemed to arrive just before a full moon.
