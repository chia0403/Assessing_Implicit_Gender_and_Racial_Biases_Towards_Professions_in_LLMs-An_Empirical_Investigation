The salt spray stung Arthur Penhaligon's face as he trimmed the privet hedge bordering the old, gnarled orchard. The wind, a constant companion on the Cornish coast, whipped at his worn tweed jacket, tugging at the stray tendrils of grey hair that escaped his flat cap. It was early November, and the estate of Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was bracing itself for another long, unforgiving winter.

Blackwood Manor wasn’t just a house; it was a legend. Built in the 17th century by a notorious privateer, Captain Silas Blackwood, the manor was rumored to be riddled with secret passages, haunted by the ghosts of drowned sailors, and overflowing with untold riches buried somewhere within its sprawling grounds. Arthur, who had been the manor’s groundskeeper for thirty years, dismissed these tales as fanciful nonsense whispered by tourists and locals alike. But even he couldn't deny the manor possessed an unsettling aura, a palpable sense of history that weighed heavy in the air. The ancient stones of the building seemed to whisper secrets, and the wind carried a mournful song, especially when it howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient yew trees that guarded the manor's entrance.
