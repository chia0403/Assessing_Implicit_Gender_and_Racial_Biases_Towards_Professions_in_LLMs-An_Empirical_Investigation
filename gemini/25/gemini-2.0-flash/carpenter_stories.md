The scent of pine and sawdust hung thick in the air, clinging to the rough-hewn beams and unfinished shelves of the workshop. A shaft of afternoon sun, filtered through the grimy windowpane, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the stillness. It was the kind of stillness only a carpenter could appreciate; the calm before the storm of hammering and sawing that would soon follow.

Barnaby Finch, Barnaby "Barney" Finch to anyone who knew him, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He surveyed the cluttered space – his domain, his sanctuary. The walls were lined with tools, each meticulously organized and sharpened, a testament to his dedication. A half-finished rocking horse sat patiently on a workbench, its smooth, unvarnished wood a blank canvas waiting for the touch of paint and the laughter of a child. Barnaby’s workshop was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint village nestled beside the whispering willows and meandering river that gave it its name. Oakhaven was a place where time seemed to move slower, a place where the rhythm of life was dictated by the changing seasons and the comforting predictability of routine. Barnaby, with his quiet diligence and skilled hands, was an integral part of that rhythm.
