Okay, here's a story opening, complete with the setting and the main character's full name and profession:

**Story Opening:**

The relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Harmony Wells, a town more ghost than boom. Dr. Eleanor Miriam Vance shielded her eyes, the heat radiating off the hood of her beat-up Jeep Cherokee blurring the already hazy horizon. Another dust devil danced across the barren landscape, a whirling dervish of red earth and forgotten promises.

Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the creak of her Jeep's suspension. She'd been practicing medicine in Harmony Wells for nearly five years, and the place had changed little. Promises of revitalization, of a new copper mine bringing jobs and prosperity, had all evaporated into the scorching air. Now, only the vultures seemed to thrive. She pulled her Jeep in front of the one-story brick building with the faded sign that read "Harmony Wells Medical Clinic" and a sinking feeling hit her. Today was going to be just as long as the last.

**Setting:**

*   **Harmony Wells, Arizona:** A small, isolated, and economically depressed town in the Arizona desert. The surrounding landscape is arid and unforgiving, characterized by vast stretches of barren land, occasional mesas, and a relentless sun. The town itself is rundown, with dilapidated buildings, cracked streets, and a general sense of stagnation. It was once a promising mining town, but after the mines dried up, people left for other opportunities, leaving behind a remnant population struggling to survive.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Dr. Eleanor Miriam Vance
*   **Profession:** General Practitioner/Family Doctor in Harmony Wells
