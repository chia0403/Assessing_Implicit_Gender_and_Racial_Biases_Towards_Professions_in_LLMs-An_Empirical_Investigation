## Story Opening:

The aroma of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air of the Blackwood Theatre like a forgotten stage prop. Theodore Alexander Finch, Director Extraordinaire (at least, that's what he still told himself), chewed nervously on his bottom lip, his eyes scanning the dishearteningly empty auditorium. Sunlight, thin and weak, sliced through the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the faded grandeur of the red velvet seats. He had two weeks. Two weeks to transform a motley crew of community theatre enthusiasts and a script that seemed to have been written by a particularly verbose pigeon, into something resembling, well, anything remotely resembling a play. Theodore sighed, the sound echoing in the cavernous space. He loved the theatre, loved the chaos, the collaborative magic… he just wasn’t so sure he loved *this* particular theatre, or *this* particular play, or, increasingly, *this* particular life.

## Setting:

**The Blackwood Theatre**, nestled on the wrong side of the tracks in the sleepy, post-industrial town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania. The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, a once-glorious picture palace that had slowly decayed into a slightly-less-than-glorious community theatre. The peeling paint on its ornate facade hinted at its former splendor, while the mismatched lettering of "THE BLACKWOOD - HOME OF OAKHAVEN PLAYERS" above the entrance screamed of its current, struggling reality. Inside, the theatre was a patchwork of faded elegance and stark functionality. The stage was large and imposing, but the lighting rig was held together with duct tape and good intentions. The dressing rooms were cramped and smelled vaguely of mildew, and the prop room was a chaotic jumble of forgotten dreams and discarded illusions. Despite its obvious flaws, the Blackwood held a certain charm, a tangible history that whispered of past performances and the unwavering dedication of the Oakhaven Players. It was a place where passion, however misguided, still flickered in the darkness.
