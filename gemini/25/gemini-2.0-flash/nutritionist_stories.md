Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, filtered through a riot of potted herbs, painted stripes across the worn wooden floor of "The Vitality Pantry," Amelia Hawthorne’s nutrition practice and small retail space in the heart of Havenwood, Vermont. Havenwood was a picture-postcard town, perpetually blanketed in either snow or foliage depending on the season. The kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, and where organic kale smoothies were almost as ubiquitous as maple syrup.

**Story Opening:**

Amelia Hawthorne, her auburn braid pulled loosely over her shoulder, winced as Mrs. Higgins' voice, amplified by the vintage tin ceiling, ricocheted around the small shop. "But *dear*," Mrs. Higgins was saying, her tone oscillating between bewildered and mildly offended, "you're telling me I can't have any more of those blueberry muffins? They're practically the only thing that gets me through the garden club meetings!"

Amelia plastered on her most reassuring smile, the one she'd perfected over years of gently nudging Havenwood residents away from processed pastries and towards more nutritionally sound choices. "Mrs. Higgins, those muffins are lovely, I'm sure, but all that white flour and sugar might be contributing to the…er…inflammation we discussed?" She gestured vaguely towards the pamphlets stacked neatly beside the cash register – "Gut Health for Gardeners" and "Inflammation: Friend or Foe?"

Mrs. Higgins' blue eyes narrowed. "Inflammation? Nonsense. It's just the petunias. They're awfully demanding this year."

Amelia sighed inwardly. This was going to be a long afternoon. Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amelia glanced up, hoping for a less demanding client, and froze. Standing in the doorway, silhouetted against the golden sunlight, was a man she hadn't seen in nearly a decade, a man whose name she hadn't dared to speak aloud in almost as long. He was taller, broader, and infinitely more rugged than she remembered.

"Well, hello Amelia," he said, his voice a low rumble that sent an unwelcome shiver down her spine. "Long time, no see."
