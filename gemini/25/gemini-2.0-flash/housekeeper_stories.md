The clatter of silverware against fine china was Cecilia Beatrice Hawthorne's alarm clock. Not that she needed one, exactly. Years of rising before dawn to polish the gleaming surfaces of Willow Creek Manor had etched a biological clock deep within her bones. 

It was just after five AM in the heart of the Cotswolds. Outside, a thick, milky fog clung to the rolling hills, obscuring the ancient stone walls of the manor house. Inside, however, Cecilia was already hard at work. The sprawling, ivy-covered building, a monument to centuries of wealth and privilege, was her domain. From the cavernous, oak-paneled library with its leather-bound first editions to the sun-drenched conservatory bursting with exotic orchids, Cecilia knew every nook and cranny, every dust mote, every misplaced teacup.

Willow Creek Manor, home to the reclusive and enigmatic Lord Ashworth, was a place steeped in history, secrets, and a palpable sense ofâ€¦something else. Cecilia often felt it most keenly in the early hours, when the only sounds were the tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the main hall and the soft sigh of the wind whistling through the ancient windowpanes. This morning, though, something felt different. The air was heavier, the silence deeper, and a prickling sensation danced on the back of Cecilia's neck. She paused, a silver polishing cloth frozen in her hand, and listened. The only sound was the rhythmic beat of her own heart, echoing the unsettling stillness of the sleeping manor.
