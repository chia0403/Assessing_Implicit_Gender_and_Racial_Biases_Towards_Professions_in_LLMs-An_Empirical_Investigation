Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Arthur Stanley Bottomley:

**Setting:**

The grand, yet slightly faded, Hotel Majestic in San Francisco. Think velvet ropes worn thin in places, chandeliers with a few missing crystals, and a lingering aroma of old money and forgotten dreams. The lobby is vast, with marble floors that echo every footstep and a towering mahogany reception desk manned by a woman with perpetually arched eyebrows. Outside, the city’s fog presses against the windows, softening the harsh lines of the surrounding buildings and lending an air of mystery to everything. It is a Tuesday morning in late October, the peak season winding down, but still busy enough to keep the staff on their toes.

**Opening:**

Arthur Stanley Bottomley hated Tuesdays. It wasn't just the mid-week slump, or the fact that the Majestic's breakfast buffet always seemed to offer reheated scrambled eggs and suspiciously pale bacon on Tuesdays. It was the sheer, unrelenting *volume* of luggage. And this Tuesday was no different. As a bellhop, Arthur's entire existence revolved around hauling suitcases, golf clubs, and the occasional eccentric collection of taxidermied squirrels (yes, that had actually happened last year). He tugged at the slightly-too-tight collar of his maroon uniform, the Majestic’s gold crest scratching against his neck. Across the lobby, Mrs. Abernathy from Suite 602 was already gesturing wildly at him, demanding assistance with a particularly unwieldy hatbox. Arthur sighed. Today was going to be a long one.
