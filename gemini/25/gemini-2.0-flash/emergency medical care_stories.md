## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The shrill, insistent beeping clawed its way into Evelyn Grace Carter's consciousness, pulling her from the shallow depths of a pre-dawn dream. It was the relentless song of her pager, a siren song she both dreaded and thrived on. Groaning, she fumbled for it on the nightstand, the illuminated numbers cutting harsh lines across her sleep-blurred vision. "Vehicle accident, Highway 17, mile marker 42. Multiple casualties. ETA requested." Her heart, still sluggish from sleep, lurched awake. Mile marker 42. That was deep into the Redwood National Park. This wasn't just a fender-bender; this was going to be messy.

**Setting:**

The year is 2024. The story begins in Crescent City, a small coastal town nestled in the heart of Northern California. Evelyn lives in a modest, two-bedroom bungalow just a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. The salty air, thick with the scent of redwood and kelp, is a constant companion. The town is a mix of grizzled fishermen, park rangers, and a burgeoning tourist population drawn to the majestic redwood forests and rugged coastline.

Evelyn works for the "Del Norte County Emergency Medical Services," a tightly-knit team of paramedics and EMTs responsible for covering a vast and often unforgiving territory. Their ambulances, affectionately nicknamed "Redwoods Rockets" by the locals, are equipped to handle everything from minor scrapes to life-threatening trauma. They are often the first, and sometimes only, line of defense between life and death in the remote areas of the county. The Redwood National Park, with its towering trees, winding roads, and unpredictable weather, is a frequent and challenging location for calls. The landscape is both breathtakingly beautiful and inherently dangerous, a duality that constantly keeps Evelyn on edge.
