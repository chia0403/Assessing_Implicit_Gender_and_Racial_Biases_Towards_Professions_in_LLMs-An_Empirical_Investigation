Okay, here's a story opening with the details you requested:

**Opening:**

The sickly-sweet smell of synthetic pine air freshener clung to the air in the waiting room, doing little to mask the underlying aroma of desperation and stale coffee. Theodore Bartholomew Finch drummed his fingers against the faux-wood armrest of the chair, a nervous tic that always intensified when his quota loomed large and unattainable. He smoothed the lapel of his navy blue suit, a suit that had seen better days and, frankly, better sales. The fabric shone faintly under the fluorescent lights, reflecting his own anxious face back at him. He checked his watch â€“ 10:58 AM. Two minutes to showtime. Two minutes to either close a deal that could save his quarter, or sink deeper into the quicksand of impending unemployment.

**Setting:**

The setting is the waiting room of "Apex Solutions," a medium-sized company specializing in cloud-based data management and security. The room is small and utilitarian, furnished with mismatched chairs and a coffee table littered with outdated magazines. A faded company logo hangs crookedly on the wall, and a small, artificial ficus tree struggles valiantly in the corner. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, antiseptic corporate anxiety. Outside the window, a grey, overcast sky hints at a possible downpour, mirroring Theodore's own internal weather pattern.
