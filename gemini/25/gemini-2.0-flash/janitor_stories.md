## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The year is 2147. The opulent "Celestial Towers" complex dominates the skyline of Neo-Kyoto, a gleaming monument to the technological advancements of the Neo-Kyoto Corporation. Holographic cherry blossoms dance perpetually in the air currents between the towers, a stark contrast to the gritty, cybernetically-enhanced reality of the lives that power the city below. The Towers themselves house the upper echelons of Neo-Kyoto society: tech moguls, bio-engineers, and those who inherited their way to the top.

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the cleaning bot was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne. He ignored it, just as he ignored the echoing chimes of the corporate messaging system that seemed to bleed from the very walls of Celestial Towers. He knelt, his worn, synthetic-fiber gloves slick with cleaning solution, scrubbing at a smear of something unidentifiable on the polished titanium floor of the Executive Wellness Center. Elias Thorne had seen a lot of… *things*... smeared on the floors of this place. He didn’t ask questions. He didn’t *want* to know.

He paused, the rhythmic scrub of his brush faltering. The smear wasn't coming off. It was almost like… *paint*? He usually dealt with protein-rich smoothie spills, the unfortunate byproducts of over-eager bio-hacking sessions, or the occasional metallic residue from a malfunctioning cybernetic implant. But this, this felt… different.

Elias sighed, a puff of condensation forming in the recycled air. Another five hours until his shift ended. Five more hours of polishing the gilded cages of the elite, five more hours of being invisible. He reached for the industrial-strength solvent, a gnawing feeling in his gut telling him that tonight, his usual invisibility might just be about to be compromised. This wasn't just another smear. This felt like the start of something messy. And in Celestial Towers, messy was never a good thing.
