Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Eleanor Beaumont:

**Setting:**

The story begins in the opulent lobby of The Grand Azure, a hotel perched precariously on the cliffs of Cinque Terre, Italy. Sunlight streams through massive, arched windows, illuminating hand-painted frescoes depicting scenes of Roman gods cavorting along the coastline. The air hums with the gentle murmur of Italian being spoken, mingled with the crisp rustle of silk scarves and the subtle clinking of champagne flutes. Polished marble floors reflect the light, and the scent of jasmine and sea salt permeates the air. Outside, the turquoise waters of the Ligurian Sea crash against the rocky shore, a constant, dramatic counterpoint to the hushed elegance within. The lobby is a carefully curated experience, designed to instantly immerse guests in a world of luxury and relaxation.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Beaumont smoothed the lapel of her impeccably tailored navy blue suit, a subtle tremor running through her usually steady hands. From her position behind the concierge desk, carved from a single piece of Carrara marble, she watched as a sleek black speedboat cut through the azure water below. A chill, sharper than the coastal breeze, ran down her spine. The speedboat wasn't unusual; wealthy guests frequently arrived in such a manner. It was the man standing on the bow, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, that unsettled her. Something about his posture, the way he held himself, radiated a cold, calculated energy that sent a prickle of unease across her skin. He was expected, of course. The reservation had been made weeks in advance, under the name "Signor Rossi." But Eleanor Beaumont had learned, over her twenty years as concierge at The Grand Azure, that names were merely masks, and true identities were often hidden just beneath the surface. She took a deep breath, reminding herself of the hotel's motto: *Il cliente ha sempre ragione* - the customer is always right. Even when they made her feel like she was standing on the edge of a cliff.
