The perpetually cheerful chime of the travel agency's doorbell was a jarring contrast to the gale howling outside. Eleanor Ainsworth, proprietor of "Ainsworth's Adventures, Your Gateway to Elsewhere," barely registered it as she wrestled with the stubbornly uncooperative printer. Ink smears bloomed across her pristine white blouse, mirroring the frustrated grimace plastered on her face. The little bells were designed to evoke wanderlust, to hint at exotic bazaars and bustling markets, but at the moment, they sounded more like the prelude to an oncoming headache.

Ainsworth's Adventures occupied a cozy corner shop on Elm Street in the quaint, if perpetually rain-soaked, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. The walls were a calming shade of seafoam green, adorned with vintage travel posters depicting sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains. Shelves overflowed with guidebooks, brochures showcasing everything from camel treks in Morocco to husky sledding in Alaska, and brightly colored globes of all sizes. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a daily ritual designed to combat the dreary weather, hung in the air, mingling with the faintest scent of sandalwood incense. It was a haven of escapism, a tiny portal to the world, nestled in the heart of a town that rarely saw a break in the clouds.
