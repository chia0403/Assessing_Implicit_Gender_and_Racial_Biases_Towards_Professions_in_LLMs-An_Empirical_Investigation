Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, a counseling psychologist:

**Opening:**

The muted hum of the air purifier did little to soothe Dr. Eleanor Vance’s own frayed nerves. She smoothed the non-existent wrinkles from her tailored tweed jacket, a nervous habit she’d consciously tried to break ever since her mentor, Dr. Albright, had gently pointed it out years ago. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful song, rattling the old windows of her office building like skeletal fingers. The weather mirrored her mood perfectly. In five minutes, she would be face-to-face with Daniel Blackwood, a man whose name had become synonymous with a tragedy that had gripped the city for months. A tragedy Eleanor now had the impossible task of helping him navigate. She took a deep breath, tasting the faint metallic tang of anxiety on her tongue, and reminded herself: *He’s just a person. A hurting person.*  But deep down, she knew Daniel Blackwood was so much more complicated than that.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office is located on the 14th floor of a pre-war building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. The exterior is classic Chicago: red brick, ornate cornices, and a perpetually damp cobblestone entrance. Inside, Eleanor has tried to create a space that is both professional and inviting. The walls are painted a calming shade of sage green, and large windows offer a (slightly obscured) view of Lake Michigan in the distance. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair sits opposite a plush, neutral-toned sofa. A Persian rug, carefully chosen for its soothing pattern, covers the hardwood floor. Bookshelves lined with psychology texts and carefully curated art books flank a small fireplace (currently unlit, despite the persistent chill). The overall effect is one of warmth and understated elegance, a sanctuary designed to encourage vulnerability and trust. There's always a faint aroma of lavender and chamomile tea hanging in the air, a scent Eleanor hopes will provide a measure of comfort to her often-distressed clients. A small, antique writing desk sits in the corner, cluttered (though organized) with notes, patient files, and a half-finished cup of Earl Grey tea.
