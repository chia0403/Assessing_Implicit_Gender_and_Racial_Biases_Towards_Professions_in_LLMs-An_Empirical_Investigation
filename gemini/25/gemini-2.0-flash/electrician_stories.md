**Story Opening:**

The crackle was a promise, a low, insidious hum that vibrated through Abigail Rosewood’s work boots and up her spine. It wasn't the familiar hum of a transformer powering up, not the predictable buzz of a faulty fluorescent bulb. This was different. This was *hungry*. Abigail, perched precariously on a rickety ladder, her headlamp casting a stark white beam across the cavernous, dust-choked space, swore she could almost taste the metallic tang of ozone in the air.

She double-checked her multimeter, its digital display flashing a frantic dance of numbers that made no sense. The wiring here was ancient, a spaghetti of cloth-covered cables and corroded junction boxes that looked like something Dr. Frankenstein had cobbled together. Usually, she could diagnose a problem just by the smell of it, by the feel of the insulation, by the way the light played off the worn copper. But this… this was beyond her. It felt wrong, like the electrical current itself was…aware.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolded in the forgotten attic of the Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched on the bluffs overlooking the churning, grey waters of the Pacific. The manor, once a symbol of opulent wealth and influence, had fallen into disrepair after the mysterious disappearance of the Blackwood family decades ago. Now, owned by a trust, it was being painstakingly restored, room by dusty room, to its former glory. Abigail Rosewood, contracted by the restoration company, was tasked with the unenviable job of rewiring the entire estate, a task that involved navigating treacherous floorboards, battling armies of cobwebs, and deciphering the cryptic, almost malevolent electrical system that seemed determined to keep the Blackwood secrets locked away. The attic, the highest point of the house, was the most daunting space of all, a labyrinth of forgotten artifacts, unsettling portraits, and a tangible sense of oppressive history. The salt-laced wind howled through the broken panes of the attic's single, arched window, adding its mournful voice to the unsettling chorus that seemed to emanate from the very walls.
