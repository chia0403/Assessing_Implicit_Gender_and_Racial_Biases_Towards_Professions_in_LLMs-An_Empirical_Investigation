## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting Chicago wind whipped off Lake Michigan, clawing at the exposed brick facades of the River North warehouse district. It was late November, just after Thanksgiving, and the city was already choked with premature Christmas cheer – garish lights strung across lampposts, Salvation Army Santas shivering outside discount stores, and the relentless drone of Mariah Carey bleeding from every storefront.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth traced the sharp line of the window mullion with a gloved fingertip, her breath fogging the glass. Outside, the skeletal branches of a struggling maple tree scratched against the newly-installed panes of her latest project: the conversion of a derelict meatpacking plant into luxury loft apartments. The "Ainsworth Residences," she'd christened them, though the name felt heavy, burdened with the weight of expectation and the legacy of her family's architectural firm.

She shivered, not entirely from the cold. There was always a point in every project, right before the grand unveiling, when doubt crept in like the creeping ivy she’d stubbornly refused to incorporate into the building's design. Doubt whispered that she hadn't done enough, that the vision she held so fiercely in her mind hadn't translated to the cold, hard reality of steel and concrete. This building, this transformation, wasn't just about bricks and mortar; it was about proving herself, about stepping out of the shadow of her renowned father, Thomas Ainsworth. And tonight, with the opening gala looming just days away, the shadow felt particularly long.
