**Opening:**

The rain hammered against the panoramic window of the penthouse, mimicking the frantic drumming in Eleanor Vance’s chest. Forty-two floors below, the city of Chicago glimmered, a chaotic tapestry of lights blurred by the downpour. But Eleanor wasn't admiring the view. She was staring, wide-eyed and panicked, at the blood slowly blooming across the pristine white carpet, radiating outwards from the inert form of Councilman Robert Mallory. The air, thick with the metallic tang of iron, clung to her throat like a shroud.

**Setting:**

The penthouse apartment of Councilman Robert Mallory, situated atop the prestigious 'Stratosphere' building in downtown Chicago. The decor screams 'new money': sleek, minimalist, and aggressively expensive. The living room is vast, dominated by a floor-to-ceiling window offering breathtaking views of the city skyline and Lake Michigan. Art, modern and abstract, hangs on the stark white walls. The furniture is low-slung and upholstered in shades of grey and cream. Evidence of a recent party - scattered glasses, half-eaten canapés, and crumpled napkins - litters the glass coffee table. The oppressive silence, broken only by the drumming rain and Eleanor's ragged breathing, amplifies the horror of the scene. The atmosphere is one of opulent luxury shattered by sudden, brutal violence.
