## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The OR hummed, a sterile symphony of whirring machines and hushed voices. Fluorescent lights glared down on the pale green drapes framing the patientâ€™s exposed abdomen. The air, purified and cooled, smelled faintly of antiseptic and apprehension. Outside, the storm raging over Chicago howled its fury against the panoramic windows, but here, inside St. Jude's Memorial Hospital, the world was muted, focused, and entirely dependent on the steady hands wielding the scalpel.

**Story Opening:** Dr. Evelyn Grace Chen wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her surgical glove, leaving a faint smear on the blue fabric.

This was the surgery that would either solidify her reputation as a groundbreaking surgeon or break her entirely. She glanced up at the monitor displaying the patient's vital signs. Still stable, for now. "Suction," she commanded, her voice calm and steady despite the frantic thumping of her heart. The scrub nurse, Sarah, responded instantly, the slender metal tube appearing in Evelyn's hand with practiced efficiency. Evelyn peered into the surgical field, the intricate web of blood vessels and delicate tissue spread before her like a macabre tapestry. Taking a deep breath, she steadied her hand. "Let's see if we can find this son of a bitch."
