## Story Opening:

The hum of the aging fluorescent tubes in "The Butcher's Block" was the first sound Alistair Leopold Heard woke to, even before the insistent yapping of his ancient Jack Russell, Pickles, demanding breakfast.  He lay still for a moment, the scent of sawdust, cured meats, and a faint lingering metallic tang clinging to the air - a perfume that both repelled and comforted him.  Alistair had lived above the shop his entire life, the sounds and smells woven into the very fabric of his being.  He groaned, a sound that resonated through the floorboards and likely disturbed Mrs. Higgins in the flat below. He knew she'd be tutting and shaking her head, muttering about "that poor, unmarried man, still chasing his father's ghost." He ignored the thought.  Ghosts were a luxury he couldn't afford.  He had sausages to grind.
## Setting:

"The Butcher's Block" was a relic, a defiant holdout in a street increasingly populated with trendy cafes and artisanal bakeries.  The exterior, painted a once-proud emerald green, was now faded and chipped, revealing glimpses of the aged wood beneath.  A hand-painted sign, its lettering cracked and peeling, proclaimed the establishment's name in a gothic script.  Inside, the walls were lined with gleaming white tiles, stained here and there with the stubborn ghosts of past cuts.  A massive, scarred butcher's block dominated the center of the room, its surface worn smooth by generations of blades.  Hanging from hooks in the back, a selection of cured hams and sausages swayed gently in the faint draft.  The glass-fronted display cases, cooled by a temperamental compressor that sputtered and wheezed like an old man, showcased neat rows of meticulously arranged cuts of meat: rosy pork chops, marbled steaks, and plump, glistening poultry.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that squeezed through the grimy window, illuminating the years of hard work and tradition etched into every corner of the shop.  It was a place that smelled of history, of honest toil, and, above all else, of meat. And Alistair Leopold Heard was its keeper.
