Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and main character:

**Opening:**

The stale, saltwater smell clung to the air in the tunnels beneath Fort Moultrie like a damp ghost. Even after ten years leading tours through its historical bowels, Evangeline "Evie" Dubois still had to swallow down a little shiver every time she descended the spiral staircase. Today was particularly bad; a low fog had rolled in off the Atlantic, blanketing Sullivan's Island in an unsettling shroud and seeping into every crack and crevice of the fort.

Evie adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, its battery already complaining with a faint whine. "Alright, folks, welcome to the dimly lit, occasionally drippy, and hopefully not haunted underbelly of Fort Moultrie!" she boomed, forcing a cheerfulness she didn't quite feel. The twenty or so faces in front of her, a motley crew of sunburned tourists and history buffs clutching maps and water bottles, gave her back a hesitant mix of smiles and wary glances. Hopefully, they wouldn't notice how much colder it was down here, or worse, mistake the dripping condensation for something more spectral. Today, Evie needed a smooth, uneventful tour.
