Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing a stone cutter named Silas Blackwood:

**Setting:**

The village of Harrow's End clung to the foot of the jagged peaks of the Serpent's Tooth Mountains like a stubborn weed to barren rock. Generations of hardy folk had scratched a living from the thin, stony soil, supplementing their meager harvests with the bounty of the mountains - timber, ore, and most importantly, stone. The houses themselves were built of grey, lichen-covered blocks, their roofs heavy with slate, testaments to the unforgiving landscape and the skill required to tame it. The wind, a perpetual resident of Harrow's End, howled through the narrow streets, carrying the scent of pine and the constant, rhythmic *thwack* of hammer against chisel.

**Opening:**

Silas Blackwood, his face etched with the same lines as the mountains he studied, squinted against the harsh morning light. Dust, fine as powdered bone, coated his beard and clung to the leather apron he wore. Before him lay a block of Serpent's Tooth granite, a monster of a thing, already bearing the marks of his labor: the deep, clean gashes that would, with patience and skill, become the keystone for the new bridge spanning the Raging River Gorge. He spat, clearing the dust from his mouth, and adjusted the spectacles perched precariously on his nose. They were a recent addition, a concession to the creeping blindness that threatened to steal the only life he knew. Silas ran a calloused hand over the cold, unyielding surface of the stone. It was a conversation he'd been having his entire life, a silent dialogue between man and mountain, a struggle to wrest beauty from the heart of the earth. But today, the stone seemed particularly resistant, its silence more profound, its secrets more closely guarded. A knot of unease tightened in Silas's chest. It wasn't just the dimming of his vision; it was a feeling, a low hum of disquiet that resonated deep within him, echoing the ancient power held captive within the stone itself.
