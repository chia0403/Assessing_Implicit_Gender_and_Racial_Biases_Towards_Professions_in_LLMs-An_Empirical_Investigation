## Story Opening and Setting:

The biting Chicago wind howled a mournful song against the towering glass windows of the Harrison & Sterling building, mirroring the gnawing anxiety in Cassandra Elaine Moreau's stomach. Sixty-two floors below, the city pulsed with pre-holiday frenzy â€“ shoppers scrambling for last-minute gifts, taxis weaving through congested streets, the faint scent of roasted chestnuts mingling with exhaust fumes. Up here, in her sleek, minimalist office, all that felt distant, muted.

Cassandra stared at the email shimmering on her monitor, the words "Urgent Restructuring Proposal" emblazoned across the subject line like a neon sign of impending doom. Her reflection in the darkened screen, usually sharp and composed, looked tired, her meticulously applied lipstick just a shade too bright against the shadows under her eyes.

She'd built this, this life, piece by piece, clawing her way up the corporate ladder, sacrificing sleep, relationships, and weekends to become the youngest Vice President of Marketing in Harrison & Sterling's history. And now, with a single click, a single email, it all felt precarious, threatened. The restructuring proposal. It meant layoffs. It meant potential office closures. It meant that she, Cassandra Elaine Moreau, might be next.
