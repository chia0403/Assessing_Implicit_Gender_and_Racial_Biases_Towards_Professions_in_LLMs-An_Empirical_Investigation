The salt spray stung Angelica Bellweatherâ€™s face as she battled her easel against the relentless wind. Goose Cove, Maine, was living up to its reputation. A raw, untamed beauty, it clutched at the edge of the world, a place where the sea ruled and the land dared to resist. The small cottage Angelica had rented for the summer clung precariously to a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, its white paint peeling in defiant strips, mirroring her own frayed patience.

She tightened her grip on the easel, bracing her legs against the uneven ground. Her latest canvas, a half-finished depiction of the cove at dawn, threatened to become airborne, a swirling vortex of blues and greys destined for a watery grave. Damn the wind. Damn the seagulls mocking her from the jagged rocks below. Damn the entire tempestuous landscape that seemed intent on thwarting her artistic ambitions.

Angelica Bellweather, thirty-two years old and armed with a stubborn spirit and a set of well-worn brushes, was determined to capture the essence of this place. She needed it. Needed the bite of the cold air, the constant roar of the waves, the stark, unforgiving beauty, to shake her from the creative stagnation that had plagued her for far too long. The vibrant, confident colours that had once flowed so freely from her fingertips had dried up, leaving her with a palette of muted anxieties. Goose Cove, she hoped, would be the cure. It would be a brutal, beautiful baptism, washing away the doubts and fears that had settled like barnacles on her artistic soul.
