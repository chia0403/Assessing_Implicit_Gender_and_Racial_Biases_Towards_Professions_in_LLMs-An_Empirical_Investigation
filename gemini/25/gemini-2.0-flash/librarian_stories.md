The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the panes of the St. Jude's Library like skeletal fingers. Amelia Beatrice Blackwood, Head Librarian and keeper of its dusty secrets, shivered despite the thick, hand-knitted cardigan draped over her tweed skirt. She adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose, and peered out the window. The churning grey waves seemed to swallow the faint light struggling to pierce the perpetually overcast sky of Grimhaven, a town that had earned its name long before Amelia ever set foot within its moss-covered walls.

St. Jude's wasn't just a library; it was Grimhaven's history, its refuge, and, some whispered, its prison. Built in 1788 by the notoriously reclusive Lord Ashford, it housed a collection of books ranging from the mundane to the truly bizarre. Rumours swirled around the library like the ever-present sea mist â€“ whispers of forbidden knowledge, hidden passageways, and a cursed grimoire locked away in the deepest, darkest corner of the archives.

Amelia, however, paid little heed to the local folklore. She was a librarian, a custodian of stories, not a believer in them. Or at least, she *hadn't* been, until the arrival of a package addressed to the library, containing a book bound in human skin, and a note written in blood that simply read: "The past is not dead. It is waiting."
