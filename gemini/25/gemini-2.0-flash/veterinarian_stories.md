## Story Opening and Setting:

The biting wind, smelling of snow and damp earth, whipped around Dr. Eleanor Astrid Finch as she wrestled open the heavy gate to the Oakhaven Livestock Auction. Dust devils, stirred up by the relentless gusts, danced across the cracked asphalt, momentarily obscuring the faded sign: "Oakhaven: Your Partner in Profit." Eleanor scoffed, the irony thick enough to choke on. Profit, maybe, for the auctioneers and the brokers, but rarely for the animals that passed through these gates.

Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York, was a sprawling, ramshackle affair. The air thrummed with the nervous energy of hundreds of animals crammed into overcrowded pens. The cacophony of bleating sheep, mooing cows, and the occasional panicked squeal of a pig was a constant, unsettling soundtrack. The main auction barn, a cavernous structure built from corrugated metal and rotting wood, was the centerpiece of the chaos. Rows of bleachers, stained with years of spilled coffee and tobacco juice, faced a raised platform where the auctioneer, a man with a voice that could shatter glass, held court.

Eleanor pulled her worn leather bag higher on her shoulder, the weight of her stethoscope and syringes a familiar comfort. The auctioneer hadn't called her in, not officially. He preferred to ignore potential health problems and keep the animals moving. But Eleanor had learned to trust her gut, and today, her gut was screaming. Something feltâ€¦off. She could feel it in the tense air, see it in the skittish movements of the animals. Today, she was here to be a silent, unwelcome guardian, hoping to catch any suffering that fell through the cracks of this cold, profit-driven machine. Today, she was a shepherd in a slaughterhouse, and she knew, with a sinking feeling, that she was about to find something very wrong.
