The August sun was a hammer, beating down on Elias Thorneâ€™s back as he hauled another bundle of asphalt shingles up the rickety ladder. He paused on the third rung, the weight digging into his shoulder, and squinted at the scene below. Elm Street sprawled out like a tired, faded quilt, the leaves on the namesake trees drooping with the heat. He could see Mrs. Higgins tending her roses, a flash of crimson amidst the muted green, and young Billy Henderson practicing his skateboarding, a constant *thwack* echoing across the quiet afternoon.

Elias adjusted his worn leather gloves and took another step. This was the Simms residence, a grand, Victorian monstrosity with more gables and dormers than Elias cared to count. Mrs. Simms, a frail woman with a voice like spun sugar, had commissioned him to replace the aging roof after a particularly nasty hailstorm left it looking like it had been attacked by a giant, angry pigeon.

He finally reached the top, the familiar ache settling into his muscles. The view was better up here, cooler too, a slight breeze whispering through the eaves. From this vantage point, Elias could see the distant shimmer of Lake Erie, a tantalizing promise of relief from the stifling heat. He sighed, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, and surveyed his domain: the jagged, uneven roof, waiting to be tamed. Another day, another roof, another step closer to getting his own little place, far away from Elm Street.
