The clang of metal on metal was a symphony to Arthur Reginald Peterson, a discordant but familiar tune that vibrated in his bones. He inhaled deeply, the sharp scent of WD-40 and burnt rubber filling his lungs. It was a perfume he found oddly comforting, far preferable to the cloying sweetness of the floral air freshener his wife, Beatrice, insisted on using in their home. 

Arthur straightened, wiping a streak of grease from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smudge that only added to his already lived-in appearance. He was surrounded by the controlled chaos that was Peterson's Garage, his sanctuary and his livelihood. Sunlight streamed through the grimy, oversized windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above a half-disassembled Ford pickup truck. Tools lay scattered across a workbench, a testament to the frenzied surgery Arthur had been performing on its balky engine.

The garage itself was a relic, a brick building that had stood on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue for over sixty years. Its paint was peeling, a faded blue that hinted at a brighter, more hopeful past. A rusty, hand-painted sign above the door proclaimed, in slightly crooked lettering: "Peterson's Garage - Honest Work, Fair Price." Inside, the floor was stained with the ghosts of countless oil spills and the lingering scent of gasoline. A calendar from 1998, featuring a pin-up model perched precariously on the hood of a classic Corvette, hung askew on the wall. This was Arthur's kingdom, his domain, a place where he could speak the language of engines and coax life back into machines that had been declared dead. And on this particular Tuesday morning, the kingdom felt a little less...alive.
