The sickly sweet scent of honeysuckle and impending doom hung thick in the Louisiana air. Humidity clung to everything – clothes, skin, even the worn, leather-bound copy of "The Maltese Falcon" propped open on Jasper "Jack" Beaumont's desk. Outside, the lazy drone of cicadas provided a monotonous soundtrack to the simmering tension that always seemed to permeate New Orleans.

Jack, a man whose face was a roadmap of late nights, stale bourbon, and cases gone cold, leaned back in his creaky oak chair. He was a study in comfortable disarray: his rumpled linen suit, the ever-present stubble that hinted at a perpetually missed shave, and the disheveled stack of files threatening to topple from his overflowing "in" tray. His office, a single room above a voodoo supply shop on Rampart Street, was less than glamorous, but it was home. The walls, painted a faded turquoise that was peeling faster than a tourist's sunburn, were adorned with a mismatched collection of framed awards (mostly "Best Neighborhood Watch Dog" certificates from grateful clients, and one, rather ironically, "Most Likely to Succeed" from his high school graduating class).

Jack took a long drag from his Lucky Strike, the smoke curling towards the ceiling, momentarily obscuring the flickering neon sign of "Mama Leona's Charms & Potions" visible through his dusty window. He needed a case, something to break the suffocating humidity and the creeping boredom that threatened to consume him. Preferably something that paid better than a bag of beignets and a promise. And as if summoned by his very thoughts, a knock echoed from the hallway, a polite but persistent rapping that held the promise of trouble – and maybe, just maybe, salvation.
