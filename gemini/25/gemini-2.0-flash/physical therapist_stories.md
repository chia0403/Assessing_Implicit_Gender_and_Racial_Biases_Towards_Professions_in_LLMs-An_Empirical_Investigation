The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Evelyn Marie Hawthorne. Through the plate glass window of Hawthorne Physical Therapy, rain lashed sideways against the bustling cityscape of Seattle, blurring the Space Needle into a hazy, futuristic spire. Inside, the rhythmic whir of the elliptical trainer competed with the soothing instrumental music piped through the speakers, a carefully curated soundtrack designed to mask the groans and grunts that often accompanied Evelyn's patients' exercises.

The setting was her own practice, a carefully cultivated oasis of recovery and resilience. Pale, calming blues and greens painted the walls, accented by framed prints of anatomical illustrations and motivational posters. Resistance bands hung neatly from hooks, next to a rack of varying sized weights. Each piece of equipment, from the parallel bars to the wobble boards, held the promise of restored mobility and a return to normalcy.

Evelyn, with her bright, empathetic eyes framed by her practical, chin-length brown hair, was already prepping for her next patient. Her long fingers, nimble and strong, adjusted the height of a treatment table, a quiet anticipation humming beneath her calm exterior. The door chimed, announcing the arrival, and Evelyn straightened, a genuine smile already gracing her lips, ready to face whatever challenges the day held.
