## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The first sign was the birds. Not their absence, mind you, but their frantic, agitated song. Dr. Eleanor Vance paused on the gravel path leading to her office, the morning sun painting the leaves of the ancient oaks a shimmering gold. She usually found the symphony of nature therapeutic, a welcome contrast to the cacophony of anxieties and traumas she faced within those four walls. But today, the birdsong felt…off. Desperate. Like a warning she couldn’t decipher. A premonition, perhaps, which, given her profession, she’d normally dismiss as rampant projection.

She shivered, though the morning was mild. Maybe she just needed more coffee.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, historic town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood Clinic, where Dr. Eleanor Vance practices, is a stately, two-story Victorian house, converted into a mental health facility. The house is painted a faded, almost ethereal, white, with a wraparound porch adorned with intricate latticework. The grounds are meticulously maintained, featuring a sprawling lawn, a tranquil herb garden, and a gurgling fountain, all intended to create a calming atmosphere for patients.

Havenwood itself is a town steeped in local folklore and tradition. The residents are a close-knit community, often wary of outsiders, and fiercely protective of their history. The surrounding mountains are dense and unforgiving, rumored to be home to forgotten trails, hidden caves, and whispers of strange occurrences. The air carries the scent of pine and damp earth, and a tangible sense of something ancient and unknowable hangs heavy in the atmosphere.
