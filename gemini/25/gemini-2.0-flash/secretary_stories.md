**Opening:**

The insistent chirping of the office phone sliced through Mildred Abigail Butterfield's concentration like a poorly sharpened paperknife. Mildred, perched precariously on her swivel chair, had been meticulously alphabetizing expense reports for the last hour, a task that demanded a level of focus usually reserved for nuclear physicists or, perhaps, very organized squirrels. She sighed, carefully capping her highlighter – a vibrant shade of "sunset coral" – and reached for the offending instrument. Before she could even lift the receiver, the chirp evolved into a shrill ring, laced with the unmistakable impatience of her boss, Mr. Archibald P. Featherstonehaugh, III.

**Setting:**

The office of Featherstonehaugh Investments occupied the entire 27th floor of the prestigious Sterling Tower, a monolithic skyscraper that dominated the skyline of New Birmingham. The décor could be described as "aggressively beige," a calculated attempt to project an image of stability and gravitas, though Mildred secretly suspected it was just cheaper that way. The walls were painted a shade of off-white that reminded her of old teeth, and the thick, plush carpet muffled footsteps with an almost sinister efficiency.

Mr. Featherstonehaugh’s corner office, a mahogany-paneled sanctum overlooking the city, was rumored to contain a secret scotch collection and a signed portrait of Ronald Reagan. Mildred’s own workspace, a much humbler affair, was located in the outer office, strategically positioned to act as a buffer between Mr. Featherstonehaugh and the outside world. It consisted of a worn oak desk, piled high with paperwork; a temperamental computer that frequently threatened to crash mid-sentence; and a view of a fire escape that offered a glimpse of pigeons and the occasional discarded cigarette butt. Despite the less-than-glamorous surroundings, Mildred had managed to personalize her space with a small, thriving cactus named Bartholomew and a framed photograph of her prize-winning persimmon jam from the county fair. These small touches, she believed, were essential for maintaining her sanity in the face of the daily grind.
