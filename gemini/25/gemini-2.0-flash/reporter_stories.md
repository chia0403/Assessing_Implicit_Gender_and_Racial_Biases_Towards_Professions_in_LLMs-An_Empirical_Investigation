The midday sun beat down on New Orleans, turning the air thick and sticky as the gumbo sold on street corners. Beatrix "Bea" Dubois wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead, the smear of humidity threatening to dissolve the carefully applied lipstick she’d put on that morning. The chipped paint of the old shotgun house across the street seemed to glisten under the oppressive heat, and the rhythmic clang of a streetcar echoed in the distance, a familiar soundtrack to her life.

Bea, a staff reporter for the *New Orleans Clarion*, had been stationed outside this particular house for three hours now, perched on a wobbly milk crate she’d liberated from a nearby grocery store. Her notebook lay open on her lap, filled with more sketches of squirrels than actual observations. Usually, she was fueled by ambition and a need to uncover injustice, but today, the stifling heat and the sheer ordinariness of the house were conspiring to defeat her. The address – 31 Rue Dauphine – was where the story was supposedly hiding, a story that her editor, Mr. Henderson, had hinted was "bigger than Hurricane Katrina and twice as messy."

The only problem was, nothing had happened. Not a single notable occurrence. No frantic phone calls, no mysterious packages, no shadowy figures lurking in the alleyway. Just a faded blue house with a meticulously tended garden filled with vibrant bougainvillea and the unsettling feeling that Bea Dubois was wasting her time.
