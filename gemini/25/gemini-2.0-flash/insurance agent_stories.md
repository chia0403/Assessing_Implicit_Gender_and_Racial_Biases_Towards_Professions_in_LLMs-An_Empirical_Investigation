The chipped Formica of his desk felt cold beneath Martin Alexander Davies' fingertips as he stared blankly at the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The hum was a constant, maddening drone that perfectly mirrored the buzzing anxiety in his chest. Outside, rain lashed against the window of Davies & Davies Insurance, a family business that had seen better days – and significantly less rain. The office, located above a perpetually struggling laundromat in the equally struggling coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, reeked faintly of bleach and unfulfilled dreams. A faded calendar, featuring a picture of a smiling golden retriever frolicking on a perfectly manicured lawn, hung crookedly on the wall, its message of idyllic suburban bliss a cruel joke in this desolate corner of New England. Today, the calendar announced it was the 17th of October, a date etched in Martin’s mind as the anniversary of his father’s disastrous attempt to deep-fry a turkey, a Thanksgiving tradition that ended in a minor house fire and a significantly higher insurance premium for the Davies family. He sighed, a puff of warm air fogging the condensation on the windowpane. Another day, another deluge, another potential flood claim looming on the horizon. He just hoped this one wouldn't involve a deep-fried bird.
