The fluorescent lights of the hospital buzzed, a low, insistent hum that seemed to vibrate in the very fillings of Dr. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne's teeth. Another Tuesday, another marathon of consults, another mountain of dietary restrictions to navigate. Eleanor sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. The scent of antiseptic and institutional coffee clung to her like a second skin, a constant reminder of the sterile, life-and-death stakes she dealt with daily.

The setting was the sprawling, multi-story University General Hospital, a concrete and glass behemoth that dominated the skyline of the otherwise charming college town of Crestwood. Eleanor’s small, windowless office, tucked away in a labyrinthine corridor on the third floor of the West Wing, was her sanctuary. Or, at least, as much of a sanctuary as a room filled with laminated food pyramids and dog-eared cookbooks could be. She had tried to personalize it – a small, potted basil plant sat precariously on her overflowing desk, its leaves bravely reaching for the anemic light, and a framed photograph of her grinning niece, covered in strawberry jam, perched on the shelf above her computer. These small touches were a fragile bulwark against the overwhelming sense of being just another cog in the giant, well-oiled machine of healthcare.
