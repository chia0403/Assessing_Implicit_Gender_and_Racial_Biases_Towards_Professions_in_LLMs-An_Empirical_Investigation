## Story Opening:

The morning air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven with the scent of blooming honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Amelia Grace Hawthorne squinted against the rising sun, its golden rays already promising another scorcher. Her back already ached, a familiar protest against the day to come. She took a long swig of lukewarm coffee from her thermos, the bitter liquid a necessary jumpstart to her weary limbs. Today's project: the dreaded Abernathy estate.

## Setting:

The Abernathy estate loomed behind Amelia, a hulking Victorian mansion that seemed to exhale an air of disdain. Gnarled wisteria vines, thick as pythons, strangled the crumbling stone columns of the wraparound porch. Overgrown rose bushes, their thorny arms reaching out like grasping claws, guarded the entrance. The once meticulously manicured lawns were now a riot of weeds and untamed grasses, a testament to years of neglect. Even the stately oaks lining the property looked weary, their leaves dusted with a layer of grime from the nearby highway. This wasn't just landscaping; this was architectural archaeology, digging through layers of neglect to unearth the beauty that once was.
