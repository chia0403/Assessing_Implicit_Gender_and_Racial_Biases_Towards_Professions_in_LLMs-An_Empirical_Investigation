The salt spray stung Amelia "Ace" Riley's face as she wrestled the Cessna 172 Skyhawk through the churning winds. Luminescent green, almost alien, waves crashed against the volcanic black sand beaches of Vik i Myrdal, swallowing the already limited visibility in a misty haze. Iceland, in all its brooding, basalt glory, wasn't for the faint of heart, and today, it was testing Amelia's mettle. The wind roared a defiant song against the thin metal skin of the aircraft, making her teeth ache and every control input a fight for mastery. She was on a mercy run, her single-engine plane laden with medical supplies for a remote sheep farm nestled deep within the highlands. The farmer, Old Bjorn, had sent a frantic radio message earlier that morning; his wife, Astrid, had fallen ill, and the nearest hospital was a grueling, days-long trek by foot, even in good weather. Amelia had been the only pilot crazy enough, or perhaps compassionate enough, to take the job.

Amelia glanced at the vintage Breitling Navitimer strapped to her wrist, a gift from her late grandfather, a World War II flying ace himself. The time was ticking by, each second precious. Up ahead, shrouded in the swirling fog, loomed the jagged peaks of the Vatnaj√∂kull glacier, a silent, unforgiving giant that held the key to Bjorn's farm. Getting past it in these conditions would be a prayer, but Astrid's life depended on it. Amelia tightened her grip on the yoke, her knuckles white, and muttered a silent promise to the howling wind: "Not today."
