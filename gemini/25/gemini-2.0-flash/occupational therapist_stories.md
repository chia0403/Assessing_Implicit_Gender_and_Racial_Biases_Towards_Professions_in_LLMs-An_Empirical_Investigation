Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of lavender and floor cleaner hung heavy in the air, a strange, clinical perfume that clung to everything at Meadowbrook Assisted Living. Elara Francesca Rossi sighed, adjusting the strap of her tote bag against her shoulder. Another Monday, another marathon of assessments, modifications, and pep talks. She glanced at the nameplate outside Room 214: *Mrs. Beatrice Albright.* Taking a deep breath, Elara smoothed a wrinkle from her cerulean blue cardigan and knocked. A frail voice, laced with a surprising amount of vinegar, called out, "Enter, if you must."

**Setting:**

The immediate setting is **Meadowbrook Assisted Living**, a privately owned facility located in the quiet, affluent suburb of Oakwood Springs, Pennsylvania. While outwardly charming with its manicured lawns and rocking chairs on the porch, Meadowbrook hides a multitude of anxieties within its pastel walls. Some residents thrived in the structured environment, enjoying the bingo nights and catered meals. Others, like Mrs. Albright, clung fiercely to their independence, resentful of the loss of control and the ever-present reminder of their waning abilities.

Inside Mrs. Albright's room (Room 214), the setting is cluttered but meticulously organized. The walls are covered with framed photographs, depicting Mrs. Albright at various stages of her life: a radiant young bride, a proud mother, a seasoned traveler. A collection of porcelain dolls sits on a shelf, each one dressed in a different historical costume. The room is small, dominated by a single hospital bed, a worn armchair, and a small writing desk overflowing with letters and postcards. The overall impression is of a life well-lived, now confined to the four walls of a room that feels far too small for the memories it contains.
