## Story Opening:

The roar of the Kenworth’s engine, a primal bellow that vibrated through the floorboards, was the only sound that truly soothed Harold “Hal” Edison these days. The headache, a constant companion since the divorce papers arrived, throbbed in time with the rumble. He squinted against the glare of the setting Nevada sun, painting the scrubland a fiery orange, and gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel, knuckles white. Another hundred miles to go before he reached Reno, another hundred miles to avoid thinking about it. He’d been hauling frozen chicken from Salt Lake City, a job as glamorous as it sounded, for the last eight hours, and the stench of thawing poultry was starting to seep into his dreams, or rather, the lack thereof.

## Setting:

The year is 2024. Harold “Hal” Edison's eighteen-wheeler, affectionately nicknamed “The Iron Horse,” is currently cruising along Interstate 80, heading west towards Reno, Nevada. The landscape is a desolate stretch of arid desert, punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree and the skeletal remains of abandoned homesteads. Dust devils dance in the distance, swirling like restless spirits. The setting sun casts long, dramatic shadows, highlighting the stark beauty and unforgiving nature of the Nevada terrain. The interior of the cab is a testament to Hal’s nomadic lifestyle: a well-worn leather driver’s seat, a scattering of crumpled maps, a half-empty thermos of lukewarm coffee, and a dashboard adorned with faded photographs of a life that used to be. The air smells faintly of diesel, old leather, and the aforementioned thawing chicken, a grim olfactory cocktail that defines Hal’s current reality. Outside, the CB radio crackles with the voices of fellow truckers, their conversations a lifeline in the vast emptiness, a reminder that he's not entirely alone out here on the long, lonely road.
