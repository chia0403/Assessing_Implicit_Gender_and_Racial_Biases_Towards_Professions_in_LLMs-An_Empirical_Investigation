**Opening:**

The insistent bleating of the alarm clock ripped Mr. Alistair Bartholomew Penhaligon from the shallow end of sleep, a sleep populated by grammar quizzes and the smirks of particularly irritating sophomores. He groaned, burying his face in the pillow already imprinted with the faint ghost of his glasses. Another Monday. Another day of battling apathy, teenage angst, and the enduring mystery of why anyone voluntarily wore socks with sandals.

**Setting:**

Alistair lived in a small, perpetually overcast town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains called Willow Creek. His apartment, above a dusty antique shop that specialized in porcelain dolls and moth-eaten tapestries, was a testament to comfortable bachelorhood. Stacks of books threatened to topple from every surface, vying for space with half-finished cups of tea, grading rubrics, and a collection of antique fountain pens he treated with more reverence than he did his own appearance. A worn armchair, strategically positioned beneath a single, overly bright reading lamp, served as his command center. Sunlight rarely penetrated the gloom, lending the apartment an air of perpetual twilight, a perfect atmosphere for a high school English teacher who secretly believed he was living in a gothic novel.
