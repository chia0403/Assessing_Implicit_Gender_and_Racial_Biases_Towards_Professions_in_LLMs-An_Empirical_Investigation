## The Rustle of Scales

**Setting:** The humid, perpetually-twilight reptile house of the Greenhaven Zoological Gardens. Sunlight rarely penetrated the thick foliage and strategically placed heating lamps, creating an atmosphere of perpetual twilight. The air hung thick and heavy, a cocktail of warm earth, damp leaves, and the faint, musky scent of unseen predators. Condensation perpetually beaded on the glass enclosures, blurring the inhabitants into abstract shapes of green, brown, and vibrant color.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth adjusted her headlamp, the beam cutting through the humid gloom. A chorus of chirps and croaks echoed around her, a daily soundtrack to her life. Sweat beaded on her brow beneath the thick bandana holding back her unruly, auburn curls. She took a deep breath, the earthy smell strangely comforting after ten years working in this sweltering environment. Today's task: a thorough check on the critically endangered Guatemalan Beaded Lizard, a creature as beautiful as it was venomous. Eleanor, or Ellie as everyone called her, preferred the lizards. They were honest. You knew exactly where you stood with a lizard. Unlike some of the primates she sometimes had to cover for.
