Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a phlebotomist:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune in the bustling blood draw station of St. Jude's Regional Hospital.  It was the Tuesday morning rush, the air thick with the scent of antiseptic wipes and the quiet anxiety of patients facing needles. Three phlebotomists worked tirelessly in their partitioned cubicles, drawing blood, labeling vials, and sending them whizzing along the pneumatic tube system to the lab.  Posters promoting flu shots and healthy heart month adorned the pale green walls, doing little to alleviate the clinical atmosphere. The click-clack of keyboards and the murmur of conversations were a constant, low-level din that became background noise to anyone working there regularly. A faded Christmas decoration, a sparkly snowflake slightly askew, still clung stubbornly to the edge of one of the computer monitors, a relic from a holiday long past.

**Opening:**

Imani Elena Rodriguez adjusted her mask, the elastic digging slightly into the back of her ears. Another name flashed on her computer screen: "Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, CBC, CMP, Lipid Panel." She sighed inwardly. Another complicated stick, no doubt. Mr. Penhaligon, if her memory served, had veins that rolled faster than a barrel down a hill.  She took a deep breath, reminding herself of the importance of patience. Phlebotomy wasn't just about drawing blood; it was about easing fears, building trust in a brief but vital encounter.  She grabbed a fresh butterfly needle, her hands already anticipating the delicate dance she was about to perform, and called out, "Mr. Penhaligon? Imani Rodriguez. I'm ready for you now."
