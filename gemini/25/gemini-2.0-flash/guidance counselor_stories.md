Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guidance counselor named Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth:

**Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and impending teenage crises hung heavier than usual in the air of Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth’s office. It was Tuesday, the day after Monday, which meant the emotional fallout from weekend escapades was just beginning to bloom. Eleanor, a woman who believed in the power of a well-placed comma and the restorative properties of chamomile tea, sat ramrod straight behind her desk, the fluorescent lights of Northwood High glinting off her sensible glasses. She straightened the stack of college brochures, a pointless exercise she performed at least five times a day, and waited. The clock on the wall ticked with the urgency of a hummingbird's heart, counting down the minutes until her next appointment: a certain young man named Damien with a penchant for black nail polish and existential angst. Today, she suspected, the angst would be winning. She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself to navigate the turbulent waters of teenage dreams and shattered expectations.

**Setting:**

Eleanor's office was a small, boxy room located on the second floor of Northwood High School, tucked between the nurse’s station and the perpetually buzzing computer lab. It was a haven of muted colors and carefully curated calm amidst the chaotic energy of the school. The walls were painted a soothing shade of pale green, and adorned with inspirational posters featuring smiling students accomplishing vaguely defined goals. A framed picture of Eleanor's prize-winning roses (Grandiflora, "Love's Promise") sat on her desk, next to a ceramic mug proclaiming "Guidance Counselor: Part-Time Miracle Worker." A comfortable, yet slightly worn, armchair faced her desk, offering a semblance of relaxation for the students who sought her counsel. Bookshelves crammed with college guides, scholarship applications, and self-help manuals lined one wall, a testament to Eleanor's dedication to her profession. The overall effect was… well, it was trying. Trying to be a place of solace and wisdom, a beacon of hope in the often-stormy sea of adolescence. Whether it succeeded was a question for each student who dared to cross its threshold.
