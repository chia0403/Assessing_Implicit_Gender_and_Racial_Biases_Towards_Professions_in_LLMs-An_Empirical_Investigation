The steam rising from Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi’s chipped ceramic mug fogged the pre-dawn chill clinging to the inside of her patrol car. Outside, the city of New Haven, Connecticut, was just beginning to stir. The oppressive, gothic architecture of Yale University hulked in the distance, casting long, skeletal shadows across the quiet streets of East Rock. Streetlights, stubbornly clinging to the night, cast a jaundiced glow on the cobblestone intersections, illuminating damp patches and discarded pizza boxes. Izzy shivered, pulled her collar higher, and took another scalding sip of the lukewarm coffee. She preferred black, no sugar, a habit formed in the academy, meant to keep her sharp. But this morning, even the bitterness wasn’t enough to chase away the lingering taste of stale dread. Tonight, October 31st, Halloween, promised to be a long one.
