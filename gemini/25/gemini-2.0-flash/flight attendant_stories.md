## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The sudden lurch of the plane threw Amelia Rose Cartwright against the galley wall, scattering the miniature bottles of Bombay Sapphire like glittering blue jewels across the floor. Amelia cursed under her breath, grabbing the counter for purchase. This wasn't just turbulence; this was the kind of turbulence that made seasoned flight attendants whisper silent prayers to whichever deity they vaguely remembered from Sunday school.  Outside, the sky had dissolved into a swirling canvas of charcoal and bruised purple.  She just hoped, for the sake of the 287 souls behind her, that Captain Olsen had a steady hand and a better radar than the one that suggested clear skies just thirty minutes ago. Because right now, it felt like they were hurtling through the guts of a very angry god.

**Setting:**

The story opens on board a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, specifically the "Emerald Dawn," belonging to Trans-Pacific Airways.  The plane is approximately five hours into its twelve-hour flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Sydney Airport (SYD).  The interior is meticulously maintained, despite the looming chaos.  The cabin boasts mood lighting, currently flickering intermittently due to the turbulence, and the plush seating in Premium Economy is upholstered in a deep teal fabric.  The galley, where Amelia is currently wrestling with the rogue bottles of gin, is a compact but efficient space, stocked with everything from microwavable meals to blankets and first-aid supplies.  Outside, the aircraft is flying somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, miles from any landmass, amidst a violent and unexpected storm.
