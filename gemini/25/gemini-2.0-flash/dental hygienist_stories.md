The oppressive Florida heat clung to Delia Mae Johnson like a damp shroud, even inside the air-conditioned sanctuary of "Sunshine Smiles Family Dentistry." Delia sighed, the scent of minty toothpaste and antiseptic doing little to soothe her growing unease. Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the palm trees lining the parking lot, shimmering off the chrome bumpers of the SUVs. Inside, the cheerful beach-themed wallpaper and the Muzak rendition of "Under the Sea" felt like a thin, flimsy disguise over the creeping anxiety that had been gnawing at her all morning.

Sunshine Smiles Family Dentistry was nestled in the heart of Harmony Grove, a master-planned community designed to exude a sense of idyllic, small-town charm. Each pastel-painted house sported a perfectly manicured lawn, and the sidewalks were always swept clean. Everything was…perfect. Almost unsettlingly so. Delia, with her genuine smile and down-to-earth demeanor, sometimes felt like an outsider in this land of carefully curated happiness. She liked helping people, she truly did, but lately, the smiles she saw felt a little too wide, the teeth a little too perfect, the eyes a little too vacant. And she had a feeling today was going to be…different. She could taste it in the stale, recirculated air.
