## Story Opening:

The air in Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office, usually a calming blend of eucalyptus and lavender, hung thick with the stale scent of desperation. Rain lashed against the panoramic window overlooking the Puget Sound, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her. She stared, unseeing, at the grey expanse, a half-eaten apple – destined for her forgotten lunch – growing brown on the edge of her mahogany desk.

The phone on her desk, usually a source of comfort and connection, felt like a live wire, humming with potential bad news. Her answering machine, a cheerful robot with a synthesized voice, was undoubtedly overflowing with frantic messages, all echoing the same desperate plea: "Please, Dr. Hawthorne, is there anything you can do?"

She knew the answer, and that was the problem.

## Setting:

Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's chiropractic practice, "Hawthorne Health & Wellness," occupied the entire top floor of a newly constructed building in Ballard, a vibrant, eclectic neighborhood in Seattle. The waiting area was designed to soothe, with comfortable armchairs upholstered in muted blues and greens, a bubbling water feature, and a curated selection of nature photography adorning the walls. Her treatment room was minimalist but functional, equipped with the latest chiropractic equipment, including a state-of-the-art adjustment table and a digital X-ray machine. The overall aesthetic was modern and clean, reflecting Amelia's commitment to both traditional healing and cutting-edge medical technology. The building’s large windows offered breathtaking views of the Puget Sound, with the Olympic Mountains looming majestically in the distance on a clear day. Today, however, the mountains were hidden behind a curtain of rain, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.
