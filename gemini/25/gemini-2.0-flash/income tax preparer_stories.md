## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum of the office lights seemed to amplify the frantic energy thrumming through Priscilla Abernathy's veins. April 14th. Tax Day Eve. The Mount Everest of fiscal deadlines. She swiveled in her worn, ergonomic chair, its lumbar support a pathetic joke at this point, and took a long, fortifying swig of lukewarm coffee. Outside, the rain lashed against the window of her storefront office, mirroring the deluge of receipts, W-2s, and 1099 forms that threatened to bury her alive. Another ring of the archaic rotary phone she stubbornly refused to replace sliced through the air, each ring a nail hammering into the coffin of her sanity. Priscilla groaned and reached for the receiver, knowing, with a bone-deep certainty, that it wouldn't be good news.

## Setting:

Priscilla Abernathy's small income tax preparation business, "Abernathy Accounting & Accurate Advice," was situated in the heart of the perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon. The office occupied a ground-floor unit in a faded brick building, nestled between a bakery known for its suspiciously orange frosting and a pawn shop displaying a collection of dusty guitars and tarnished silver. Inside, the space was cramped but meticulously organized, reflecting Priscilla's unwavering dedication to order. Filing cabinets, bulging with manila folders, lined the walls. A large, outdated computer sat on a desk littered with calculators, highlighters, and a perpetually overflowing inbox. The scent of old paper mingled with the faint aroma of printer ink, creating a uniquely bureaucratic perfume. A framed picture of Priscilla, grinning awkwardly at her high school graduation, hung on the wall behind her desk, a reminder of a simpler time before she was knee-deep in deductions and dealing with the annual existential dread of her clients. The overall aesthetic was somewhere between cozy and cluttered, reflecting both Priscilla's practical nature and her inability to throw anything away that *might* be important later.
