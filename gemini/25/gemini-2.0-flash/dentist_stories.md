## The Story Opening:

The hum of the ultrasonic scaler was a low, predictable thrum that usually soothed Dr. Eleanor Vivian Sterling. Tonight, however, it was a jarring counterpoint to the chaos swirling in her head. She stared intently at Mrs. Gable's molars, trying to focus on the task at hand â€“ scraping away the tenacious calculus clinging to the gumline. Mrs. Gable, bless her, was humming along to some unheard melody, oblivious to the internal tempest brewing within Eleanor. 

"Almost done here, Mrs. Gable," Eleanor said, her voice a carefully modulated calm. She adjusted the overhead light, catching a flash of reflected light that danced across the sterile white walls. It looked, she thought grimly, like tiny, mocking bursts of hope. Hope she hadn't felt in weeks. 

She finished the scaling, rinsed Mrs. Gable's mouth, and watched with a practiced smile as the older woman gurgled and spat into the suction tube. "Excellent! Just a quick polish and you'll be good to go."

As Eleanor prepped the polishing brush, Mrs. Gable removed her bib and looked directly at her. "You know, Dr. Sterling," she said, her voice surprisingly clear, "a smile can hide a multitude of sins, but it can also reveal a heart full of sorrow. I hope you're taking care of yourself behind that professional grin of yours."

Eleanor felt her carefully constructed facade crack. She blinked, the bright overhead light suddenly blurring. "I... I'm fine, Mrs. Gable. Just a little tired."

Mrs. Gable patted her hand, a gesture both comforting and unsettling. "We all get tired, dear. Just remember to brush those sorrows away, just like you brush away the plaque. Good hygiene, both inside and out, is the key to a healthy life."

And with that cryptic advice, Mrs. Gable left, leaving Eleanor alone with the buzzing of the polisher, the sterile smell of fluoride, and the heavy weight of unspoken grief.

## The Setting:

The story is primarily set in **Sterling Dental,** a modest but well-maintained dental practice located in the heart of **Ashwood, a small, affluent suburb nestled just outside Portland, Oregon.** The building itself is a renovated two-story Victorian house, painted a calming shade of sage green. The waiting room is decorated with comfortable, overstuffed chairs, nature-themed artwork, and a perpetually playing fish tank filled with brightly colored tetras.

Inside, the examination rooms are state-of-the-art, equipped with the latest dental technology. Eleanor, a stickler for cleanliness and organization, maintains a meticulously tidy workspace. The air is always subtly scented with a combination of mint and disinfectant. Large windows offer a view of the leafy, tree-lined street outside, providing a touch of nature to the clinical environment.

Beyond the practice, the story may also occasionally venture into Eleanor's personal life, which primarily takes place in her cozy, albeit somewhat cluttered, bungalow a few blocks from the office, and the occasional visit to the nearby hiking trails of the Columbia River Gorge, where she seeks solace and escape.
