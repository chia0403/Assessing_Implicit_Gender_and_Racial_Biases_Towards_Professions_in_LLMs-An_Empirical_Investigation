The aroma of glitter glue and stale graham crackers hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that both comforted and suffocated Miss Penelope Poppyseed, kindergarten teacher extraordinaire. Outside, the October wind rattled the windowpanes of Room 12, shaking loose a few crayon drawings taped precariously to the glass. Inside, the organized chaos of the "Pumpkin Patch Pals" kindergarten class at Sunny Acres Elementary school was in full swing. Penelope, with her bright orange cardigan and even brighter smile, navigated the sea of tiny, paint-smeared hands and enthusiastic voices, feeling the familiar tug of both joy and exhaustion. Today was supposed to be simple: pumpkin painting, followed by a story about sharing. But simple, as Penelope Poppyseed knew all too well, was rarely an option when you were responsible for twenty-two five-year-olds wielding googly eyes and tempera paint. And judging by the way little Timmy Henderson was eyeing the tube of iridescent purple glitter, she suspected things were about to get a whole lot less simple, very quickly.
