## Story Opening:

The first chord echoed through the empty auditorium, a lonely D minor hanging in the air like a question. Aurora Skye Beaumont swallowed hard, the familiar knot of nerves tightening in her throat. This wasn't the glitter and roar of a sold-out stadium, no screaming fans holding up lighters. This was… silence. A cavernous, expectant silence punctuated only by the faint hum of the stage lights.

Aurora ran a hand through her impossibly blonde hair, its usual cascade of perfect waves pulled back into a messy bun that screamed, "I'm trying to be serious." She wasn’t just trying. She *was* serious. This comeback, this reinvention… it had to work. The world had written her off, labelled her a washed-up pop princess clinging to the fringes of relevance. But Aurora knew she had more to give, a deeper story to tell. The music was there, raw and vulnerable, pulsing beneath her skin. All she needed was the courage to let it out.

She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and let her fingers dance across the ivory keys. This was it. This was her chance.

## Setting:

The story opens in the **abandoned Avalon Theater in Port Townsend, Washington**. The once-grand theater, a relic of the roaring twenties, now stood as a shadow of its former glory. Peeling paint clung to the ornate plasterwork, and dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through cracks in the boarded-up windows. The plush velvet seats, faded and ripped, stood in silent rows, ghosts of audiences past.

The Avalon Theater was a hidden gem, a forgotten haven on the sleepy Olympic Peninsula. Aurora had stumbled upon it during a frantic, almost desperate, road trip away from the relentless scrutiny of Los Angeles. Drawn to its melancholic charm and echoing acoustics, she'd rented the dilapidated space, promising the eccentric owner, Mrs. Elsie Whitlock, to bring the theater back to life, even if only for a little while. Now, surrounded by the ghosts of forgotten melodies and whispered secrets, Aurora was trying to do just that: breathe life back into herself and, perhaps, into the old theater itself.
