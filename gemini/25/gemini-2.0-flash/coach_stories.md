## Opening:

The whistle was a shrill, metallic shriek that bounced off the aging brick walls of the gymnasium, echoing the hollowness in Coach Beatrice “Bea” Bellweather’s stomach. The rhythmic squeak of sneakers against the varnished hardwood floor, usually a comforting symphony to her ears, now felt like a taunt. It was the first day of tryouts for the Northwood High Lady Leopards basketball team, and Beatrice wasn't just nervous; she was terrified. Last year’s devastating loss at the state championships, a loss she still replayed in her head like a broken record, clung to her like a shroud. This year, she knew, was make or break. Not just for the team, but for her.

## Setting:

The setting is Northwood High School Gymnasium, located in the small, blue-collar town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The gym itself is a relic of a bygone era. Built in the 1950s, it boasts high, arched ceilings, exposed brick walls painted a faded, institutional green, and bleachers that creak and groan with the weight of memory. Banners commemorating past victories, some tattered and yellowed with age, hang haphazardly from the rafters. The air is thick with the scent of old wood, sweat, and anticipation. Outside, the late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The surrounding neighborhood is a mix of modest, well-kept houses and older, slightly dilapidated structures, a reflection of the town’s struggling economy. Harmony Creek is a place where dreams are often tempered by reality, and where high school basketball holds a significance far beyond just a game. It's a place where hope and disappointment intertwine, a place Beatrice Bellweather knows all too well.
