The rain was a relentless curtain, blurring the neon glow of "O'Malley's Irish Pub" across the street and drumming a frantic rhythm against the awning of "Evergreen Pharmacy." Inside, the air hummed with the quiet efficiency of fluorescent lights and the faint, medicinal scent of alcohol and lemon-scented cleaner. Eleanor Mae Prescott, her reading glasses perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, carefully counted out twenty-one capsules of amoxicillin onto a small, white tray.

Evergreen Pharmacy wasn't much to look at. Tucked away on Elm Street in the small, perpetually damp town of Hemlock Hollow, Oregon, it was a fixture more than a destination. The kind of place where the floor tiles were slightly worn, the magazines in the waiting area were always a year out of date, and the only music came from the quiet whir of the refrigerator containing vaccines and insulin. Eleanor, however, found a strange solace within its walls. Hemlock Hollow was her hometown, and Evergreen Pharmacy, inherited from her father, was her sanctuary. It was a place where she could make a tangible difference, dispensing not just medication, but also a kind word, a knowing glance, and the reassuring promise of better days.

Outside, the wind howled, rattling the windows and promising a long, dreary night. Eleanor, finishing up the amoxicillin and carefully labeling the bottle, couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease. Tonight, the silence of Evergreen Pharmacy felt heavier than usual, almostâ€¦ expectant.
