The chipped porcelain of the mortar felt cool beneath Dr. Elara Vance's fingertips, a stark contrast to the humid Louisiana air clinging to her skin.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, drowsy symphony outside the faded green walls of Vance Pharmacy, a symphony that mirrored the oppressive weight of the August afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom of the apothecary, illuminating the shelves stacked high with remedies both ancient and modern – bottles of potent tinctures whispering promises of healing alongside sleek rows of blister packs containing the latest pharmaceutical breakthroughs.  The air itself smelled of chamomile, sandalwood, and the faint, underlying scent of decay, a familiar perfume in this historic building nestled on the edge of New Orleans' French Quarter.  Elara sighed, the sound lost in the insistent drone of the insects.  Another slow day in the oldest pharmacy in the city – or so she'd always been told.  But today felt different.  A strange stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual summer humidity, a premonition clinging to her like the scent of jasmine after a rain shower.
