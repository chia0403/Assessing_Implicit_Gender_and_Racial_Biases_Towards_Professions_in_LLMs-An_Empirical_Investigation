The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Rel” Blackwood could conjure.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," wasn't your typical upscale establishment.  Nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually-empty storefront that smelled faintly of mildew, it was a vibrant splash of turquoise paint in a faded grey neighbourhood.  Rain lashed against the large, slightly misaligned windows, blurring the already indistinct view of cobbled streets and gas lamps flickering in the twilight. Inside, Rel, with her riotous curls escaping the confines of a haphazard bun, snipped with practiced precision at a client's unruly auburn mane, the rhythmic snip-snip a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  The only other sound was the low hum of the vintage hairdryer, a relic from a bygone era, as reliable as Rel herself.
