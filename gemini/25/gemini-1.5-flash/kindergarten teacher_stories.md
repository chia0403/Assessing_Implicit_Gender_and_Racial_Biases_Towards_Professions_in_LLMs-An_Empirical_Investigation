The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky floor like a gentle, colourful snow.  It was a fitting metaphor for the day, Ms. Eleanor Vance thought, sighing as she surveyed the chaos of her kindergarten classroom.  Crayon shavings littered the carpet like fallen confetti after a particularly exuberant party, a lone plastic dinosaur lay on its side amidst a sea of discarded building blocks, and the air hummed with a cacophony of excited shrieks, tiny arguments, and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of tiny feet racing across the brightly coloured rug.  Sunlight streamed through the large, slightly dusty windows of Sunnyside Elementary, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden beams and highlighting the chaotic beauty of a typical Tuesday morning in her kingdom of miniature humans.
