The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into her worn trench coat.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for days, plastered her already damp newspaper to her chest, the ink threatening to bleed onto her borrowed tweed skirt.  She stood on the precipice of the crumbling cobblestone quay in the forgotten fishing village of Port Blossom, the salty air thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed.  The village, clinging precariously to the cliff face, looked like a watercolour painting left out in the storm, its pastel-coloured houses blurring into a melancholic wash of grey and green.  Amelia shivered, less from the cold and more from a premonition, a prickling unease that clung to her like the damp mist rolling in from the turbulent North Sea.  Her assignment – a seemingly innocuous piece on the village's dwindling fishing industry – felt suddenly, unsettlingly wrong.
