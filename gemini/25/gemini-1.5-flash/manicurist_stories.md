The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Dubois.  It clung to her, a subtle second skin acquired over fifteen years of tending to the nails of the wealthy and restless women of Charleston, South Carolina.  Sera’s salon, “Lacquer & Lace,” nestled on the cobbled corner of Meeting and Queen Streets, was a small haven of pastel pinks and shimmering golds, a stark contrast to the looming, historic grandeur of the antebellum mansions that surrounded it.  Outside, the Charleston sun beat down on the ancient brick streets, turning the air thick and shimmering, while inside, Sera’s tiny kingdom hummed with the quiet murmur of conversation and the gentle whir of the electric nail file.  Today, however, the usual tranquility was fractured.  A storm, both literal and figurative, was brewing, and its first ominous rumble arrived in the form of a frantic phone call.
