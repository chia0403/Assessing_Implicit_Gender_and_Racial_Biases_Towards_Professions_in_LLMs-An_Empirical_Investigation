The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, steady decay of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s optimism.  It was the third week of September, a time that should have buzzed with the vibrant chaos of a newly-minted third grade, but instead, a thick, suffocating silence hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient clock on the wall, each second a tiny hammer blow against her dwindling hope.  The air in Oakwood Elementary, usually thick with the scent of glue sticks and impending recess, was today heavy with the smell of stale coffee and… something else.  Something vaguely metallic, clinging to the back of her throat like the lingering taste of disappointment.  Outside, the usually cheerful autumn leaves swirled in a desolate, grey wind, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.
