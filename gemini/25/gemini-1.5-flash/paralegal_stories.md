The flickering neon sign of "Benny's Burgers" cast a lurid orange glow on the rain-slicked streets of Chicago's West Loop.  The air hung thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and frying onions, a familiar perfume to Amelia Katherine "Amy" Hayes, as she hunched deeper into her threadbare coat, the collar pulled high against the November chill.  Amy, a paralegal at the notoriously cutthroat firm of Sterling & Steele,  wasn't usually out this late, especially not in this part of town.  But tonight, a crumpled, anonymous note tucked into her overflowing briefcase had sent a shiver down her spine, a shiver that had nothing to do with the biting wind. The note, written in a spidery hand on a scrap of what looked like a court summons, simply read:  "The truth lies buried.  Meet me at Benny's. Midnight."
