The scent of bay rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, proprietor of Higgins' Hair Emporium.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of his shop, illuminating the faded red velvet barber chair and the chipped porcelain sink.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a Seattle November plastered the city in a grey, watery shroud.  Barty, hunched over a worn copy of "Moby Dick," barely registered the rhythmic *plink-plink-plink* of rain against the windowpane; he was lost in the swirling prose of Captain Ahab's obsessive quest.  His small shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street, felt a world away from the frenetic energy of the city that surged just beyond its damp, brick walls.
