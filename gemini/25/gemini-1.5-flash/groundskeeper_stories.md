The first frost of autumn had kissed the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, transforming the emerald blades into a tapestry of russet and gold.  A thin veil of mist clung to the ancient oaks, their skeletal branches clawing at the pewter sky.  Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out in small, white clouds, adjusted the worn leather straps of his wheelbarrow, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves heavy in the air.  He pushed the laden barrow across the dew-slicked gravel path, the rhythmic squeak of the wheels a counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the gothic spires of the manor itself.  Blackwood Manor, they said, was haunted. Elias Thorne, groundskeeper for the past twenty years, had yet to see any evidence of that, though the shadows did seem to deepen a little earlier here than anywhere else he'd ever worked.
