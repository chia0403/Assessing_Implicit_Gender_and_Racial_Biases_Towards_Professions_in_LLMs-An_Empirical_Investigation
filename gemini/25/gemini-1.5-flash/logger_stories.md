He stood perched precariously on the edge of a logging road carved deep into the mountainside, the freshly fallen snow a pristine white blanket obscuring the treacherous drop below.  Below him, nestled in the valley, the twinkling lights of the small logging town of Timberline offered a faint, inviting promise of warmth and respite, a stark contrast to the raw, unforgiving beauty of the wilderness that surrounded him.
