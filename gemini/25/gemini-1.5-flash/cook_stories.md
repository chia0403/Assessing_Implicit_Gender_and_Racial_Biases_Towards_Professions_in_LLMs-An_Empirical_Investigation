The salt spray kissed Amelia Hernandez's face as she hauled the last crate of glistening, ice-packed scallops onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The air hung thick with the smells of brine, diesel, and the faint, sweet tang of seaweed clinging to the hull. Amelia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, wiped a hand across her brow, the salty moisture mingling with the flour dusting her already grime-stained apron.  The small fishing trawler pitched gently in the choppy waters of the North Pacific, a backdrop of brooding grey skies and churning waves mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  This was it â€“ her chance to finally open *Amelia's Kitchen*, a restaurant she'd dreamed of since she was a child, perched on a stool in her grandmother's cramped but vibrant kitchen in the heart of Astoria, Oregon. But the success of her dream hinged entirely on this haul, on the quality of these scallops, the very essence of her signature dish, the Pan-Seared Scallops with Lemon-Butter Sauce.
