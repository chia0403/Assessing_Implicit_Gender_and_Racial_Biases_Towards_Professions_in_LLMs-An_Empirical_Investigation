The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Seraphina “Sera” Nightingale’s elbows as she stared into its murky depths, the reflection of her face a smudged watercolour of exhaustion.  Steam, thick and fragrant with burnt coffee and desperation, curled around her head, a halo of failure in the cramped, damp bathroom of the Nightingale Arms – a pub that served more stale beer than good fortune, and doubled as her current, and decidedly temporary, residence.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked windowpane, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the anxieties drumming inside her chest.  The gas fire sputtered intermittently, casting flickering shadows that danced across the peeling wallpaper depicting a ludicrously cheerful hunting scene – a stark contrast to the desolate landscape of Sera’s prospects.  Tonight, the local open mic night at The Rusty Mug was her last chance.  Lose this one, and the dream she'd clung to since she was a girl, the dream that sang louder than the rain against the windowpane, would finally drown.
