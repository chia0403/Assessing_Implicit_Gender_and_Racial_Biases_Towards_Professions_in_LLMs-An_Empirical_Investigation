The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room seemed to mirror the cracks in Elias Thorne’s carefully constructed composure.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the building, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent anxiety gnawing at him.

Elias, a man whose weary eyes hinted at years spent navigating the murky waters of human fallibility, steepled his fingers, the weight of his worn leather briefcase a physical manifestation of the burden he carried.  He was a probation officer for the City of Oakhaven, a job that demanded equal parts empathy and steely resolve, a precarious balance Elias often found himself teetering on the edge of.

The rain outside intensified, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elias Thorne.
