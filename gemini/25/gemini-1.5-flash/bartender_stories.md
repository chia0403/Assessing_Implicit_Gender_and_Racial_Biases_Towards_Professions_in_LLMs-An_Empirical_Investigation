The chipped Formica of the bar top felt cold beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips as she meticulously polished a snifter.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window of “The Rusty Mug,” blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley into a hazy, crimson smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, damp wool, and the faint, lingering sweetness of cheap bourbon – a familiar aroma that clung to Elara like a second skin after fifteen years behind this very bar.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the loose windowpane and echoing the emptiness that had settled deep in her bones, a familiar ache she usually drowned in a double shot of rye. Tonight, however, even that felt insufficient. Tonight, something felt… different.  The usual Friday night bustle was absent, replaced by a heavy, expectant silence that pressed down on her like the approaching storm.
