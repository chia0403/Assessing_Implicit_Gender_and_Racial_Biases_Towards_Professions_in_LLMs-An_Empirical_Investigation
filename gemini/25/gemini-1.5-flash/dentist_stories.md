The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the snow-dusted street of Havenwood, her breath puffing out in frosty clouds.  Havenwood, nestled deep within the craggy embrace of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was a picturesque town, postcard-perfect in its autumnal glory, but tonight, under the bruised purple sky, it felt eerily isolated.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic crunch of her worn leather boots on the icy pavement.  Ahead, the single, flickering lamplight of her dental practice, "Vance & Vance Family Dentistry," offered a fragile beacon in the gathering gloom.  Inside, the comforting scent of clove and antiseptic usually waited, a stark contrast to the raw, biting chill that permeated the mountain air tonight.  But tonight, a different kind of chill settled deep in Eleanor's bones, a premonition colder than any November wind.
