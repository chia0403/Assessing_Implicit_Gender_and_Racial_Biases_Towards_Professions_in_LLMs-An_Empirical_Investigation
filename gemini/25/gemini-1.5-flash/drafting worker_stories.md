The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of graphite and stale coffee in the drafting room of Peterson & Sons Architectural Designs.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the stagnant air above the meticulously organized rows of drafting tables.  Each table was a miniature universe of precision and order: T-squares, triangles, compasses, and rolls of tracing paper lay neatly arranged alongside stacks of blueprints marked with cryptic notations.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously shaded a section of a proposed suburban development on her drafting board.  The faint whirring of the ancient blueprint machine in the corner provided a monotonous soundtrack to her work, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of her pencil.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, a stark contrast to the quiet intensity within the drafting room.
