The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Isabella "Izzy" Moreau truly appreciated.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of the dilapidated rehearsal space.  It wasn't much – a cavernous former warehouse in the grittier side of Prague, its peeling paint a faded mural of theatrical history – but to Izzy, it was a sanctuary.  Cracked plaster walls whispered forgotten lines from countless forgotten plays, the ghostly echoes of past triumphs and catastrophic failures a constant, comforting hum.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, a suffocating blanket woven from the anxieties of a premiere looming only three days hence.  Izzy Moreau, director of the ambitious and wildly experimental production of *The Golem's Lament*, stared out at the empty stage, the gnawing uncertainty a physical weight in her chest. The air crackled not with the energy of creative chaos, but with the chilling stillness of impending doom.
