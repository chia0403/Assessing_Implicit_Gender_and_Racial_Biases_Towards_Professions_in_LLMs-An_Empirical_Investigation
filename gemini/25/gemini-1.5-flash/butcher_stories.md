The air hung thick and cloying with the scent of blood, sawdust, and something subtly sweet – perhaps the lingering aroma of yesterday’s plum pudding.  A thin layer of frost clung to the windowpanes of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's butcher shop, a stark contrast to the crimson rivers that periodically flowed across the worn, slate floor.  Barty, his hands stained a permanent shade of carmine, expertly honed his cleaver, the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* a familiar soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of Oakhaven village.  The shop itself, a small, stone edifice nestled beside the village well, had seen generations of Butterfields ply their trade.  Its walls, thick and ancient, seemed to whisper tales of countless carcasses butchered and countless sausages strung.  Outside, the first tentative rays of the winter sun struggled to pierce the swirling mist clinging to the cobbled street.  This morning, however, felt different. Even the familiar chill in the air held a sharper edge, a premonition of something unsettling about to unfold in Oakhaven.
