The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's Wednesday evening.  Elara, a name that felt both too elegant and too plain for her life behind the chipped Formica counter, sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless whir of the refrigerator units in the back.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  The air hung heavy with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener, battling the underlying scent of stale coffee and desperation that permeated the small convenience store. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, promising a night of restless sleep for anyone unlucky enough to live within earshot.  Inside, Elara was already bracing herself for the unpredictable parade of customers that would fill the remaining hours until closing.
