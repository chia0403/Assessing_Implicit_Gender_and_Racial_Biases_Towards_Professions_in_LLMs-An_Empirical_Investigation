The rasp of gravel under Dale “Mac” McArthur’s boots was a familiar lullaby.  Dawn, a bruised purple clinging to the eastern horizon, painted the asphalt of Highway 17 a shimmering black.  Mac, his breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, leaned on his shovel, the metal cold against his calloused palm.
