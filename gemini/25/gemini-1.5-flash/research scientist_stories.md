The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorneâ€™s research station, a relentless chorus that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in his gut.  Ice, sculpted into monstrous, shifting forms by millennia of glacial forces, stretched to the horizon, a blinding white wasteland under the bruised purple sky.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of seawater.  Aris, bundled in layers of thermal gear that did little to combat the penetrating cold, adjusted the thick goggles shielding his eyes from the relentless glare reflecting off the endless expanse of snow and ice.  His breath plumed out before him, a fleeting white ghost in the vast, desolate landscape. This wasn't the picturesque postcard Antarctica; this was a place that tested the limits of human endurance, and tonight, it felt poised to test the limits of his sanity. The erratic readings from the seismic monitor in his hand pulsed with a silent, insistent dread, a harbinger of something profoundly wrong, something far beneath the frozen surface.
