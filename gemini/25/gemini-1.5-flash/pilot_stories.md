The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song, tearing at Amelia Grace Hathaway's parka as she wrestled the stubborn Cessna 185 onto the ice runway.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and frozen seawater, stung her lungs with each ragged breath.  Below, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Chugach Mountains shimmered an ethereal, almost menacing, blue under the pale winter sun.  The snow, undisturbed except for the recent tire tracks leading to the tiny, ramshackle airstrip at the edge of Glacier Bay, crunched underfoot with a sound like shattered glass.  Amelia checked her instruments one last time, the flickering glow of the panel illuminating her determined face.  Today's flight wasn't just another charter; it was a lifeline, carrying a desperately needed shipment of medical supplies to a remote research station clinging precariously to the mountainside.  The stakes, as always in these parts, were high.
