The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the frantic thrumming in her chest.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Edinburgh.  Below, the Royal Mile, usually a vibrant tapestry of tourists and tartan, was a sodden, deserted ghost under the relentless downpour.

This wasn't the idyllic life she'd envisioned when she'd hung her shingle just six months ago.  Tonight, however, the storm raging outside was nothing compared to the one brewing inside.
