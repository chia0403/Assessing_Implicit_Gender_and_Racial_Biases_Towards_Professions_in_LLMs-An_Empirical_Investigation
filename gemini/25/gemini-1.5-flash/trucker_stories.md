The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, "The Wandering Star," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple of a pre-dawn sky.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar perfume of the Pacific Northwest that clung to the towering Douglas firs lining Highway 101. Rain, a constant companion on this stretch of road, plastered Zeke's dark hair to his forehead, the droplets blurring the already fading taillights of the vehicle ahead.  He was somewhere between Forks and Port Angeles, the miles indistinguishable in the pre-dawn gloom,  lost in the rhythm of the road and the hum of the engine â€“ a rhythm that had been his solace and his curse for the past twenty years.
