The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a rhythm that mirrored the relentless drumming in his head.  Jack, a man whose trench coat was as much a part of him as his perpetually cynical expression, sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the weak light from a single bare bulb barely illuminating the overflowing ashtray and the half-empty bottle of rye whiskey beside it.  His office, a cramped space above a failing laundromat in the grimy underbelly of San Francisco's Chinatown, smelled of stale cigarettes, cheap coffee, and the lingering scent of desperation â€“ a perfume he'd grown accustomed to over the twenty years he'd spent navigating the city's shadowed alleys and morally dubious corners.  The only decoration was a faded photograph of a smiling woman, tucked into the cracked frame of a mirror reflecting his weary face.  Tonight, the rain seemed determined to wash away even the memories she held.
