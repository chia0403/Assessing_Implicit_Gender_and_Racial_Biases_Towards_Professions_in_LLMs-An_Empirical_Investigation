The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless Pacific beast, howled off the churning grey expanse of the ocean, threatening to rip the whole ramshackle building – a converted fishing shack perched precariously on the cliff edge of Port Blossom, Oregon – right into the churning waves below.  The aroma of brine and decaying seaweed mingled with the faint, earthy scent of pine from the stunted trees clinging to the cliff face behind her.  This wasn't exactly the idyllic coastal practice she'd envisioned after leaving the sterile, impersonal confines of her city practice, but then again, Port Blossom, with its quirky inhabitants and breathtaking, unforgiving beauty, had a charm all its own.  Inside, the clinic was small, but cozy, the scent of essential oils a feeble counterpoint to the wild, untamed energy of the outside world.  Today, however, even the lavender couldn't quite mask the underlying tang of salt and impending storm.
