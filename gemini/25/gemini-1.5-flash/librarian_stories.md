The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grandchester Public Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting afternoon sun filtering through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, her name whispered on the wind of turning pages by those who knew her, sat at her usual desk, a fortress of organized chaos built from towering stacks of books, each carefully categorized and cataloged in her meticulous, looping script.  The desk, itself a relic from a bygone era of mahogany and brass, groaned under the weight of her current project:  the reclassification of the library's entire Victorian fiction collection, a task she'd undertaken with the quiet determination of a seasoned scholar preparing for battle.  Outside, the autumn wind howled a mournful song, rattling the ancient panes of glass, a counterpoint to the hushed serenity within the hallowed halls of Grandchester's literary sanctuary.
