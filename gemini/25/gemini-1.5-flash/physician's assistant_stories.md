The biting Alaskan wind whipped Amelia Katherine Davies's dark braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas door of the clinic open.  It groaned a protest, the sound swallowed instantly by the howling gale that threatened to tear the small, prefabricated building from its moorings.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and woodsmoke â€“ a peculiar but familiar fragrance in the remote village of Knik Arm, where the only pharmacy was a shelf in the back of Dr. Albright's cluttered office, and the nearest proper hospital was a harrowing three-hour boat ride away.  The fluorescent lights flickered intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows across the peeling paint of the walls, a fitting backdrop to the raw, untamed beauty of the Alaskan wilderness that pressed against the clinic's flimsy exterior.  Amelia shivered, pulling her parka tighter, not entirely from the cold.  The emergency radio crackled to life, its static a harbinger of the long, arduous night that lay ahead.
