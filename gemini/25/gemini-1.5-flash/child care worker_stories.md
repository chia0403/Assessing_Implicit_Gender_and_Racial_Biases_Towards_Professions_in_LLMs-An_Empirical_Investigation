The chipped paint of the "Little Rascals Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overflowing flowerpots lining the porch, mirroring the way Elara Jeannette Mallory's patience sometimes threatened to crumble.  It was a humid Tuesday morning in the sleepy coastal town of Seabrook, Oregon, the kind of morning where the air hung heavy and thick, promising a day of sticky fingers and even stickier situations. The salty tang of the nearby Pacific Ocean battled with the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle climbing the weathered clapboard siding of the daycare building.  Inside, the cacophony of children's voices – a symphony of squeals, giggles, and the occasional wail – was already in full swing, a familiar soundtrack to Elara's life.  She sighed, the scent of coffee and impending chaos swirling around her as she pushed open the heavy oak door, ready to face another day in the whirlwind that was Little Rascals.
