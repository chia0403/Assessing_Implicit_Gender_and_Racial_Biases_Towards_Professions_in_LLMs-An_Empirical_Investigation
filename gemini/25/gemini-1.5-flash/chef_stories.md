The air hung thick and humid, a miasma of frying garlic and simmering ginger that clung to the worn brick walls of the "Golden Wok" like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of Chef Amelia "Mia" Hernandez as she expertly tossed a sizzling wok of Kung Pao chicken, the flames licking at the edges of the pan like playful, hungry spirits.  The Golden Wok, nestled in the heart of Chinatown's bustling night market in San Francisco, was a symphony of chaotic energy â€“ a cacophony of sizzling woks, chattering customers, and the rhythmic chop-chop-chop of cleavers echoing off the narrow alleyways. The scent of a thousand different spices battled for dominance, a fragrant war waged on the palates of hungry passersby.  Tonight, however, the usual vibrant hum was muted, a nervous quiet hanging heavy in the air, punctuated only by the insistent clatter of Mia's own movements.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
