Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, turning the city lights into blurry, shimmering jewels. Inside, the opulent lobby, with its marble floors and cascading crystal chandeliers, hummed with a quiet energy.  A fire crackled merrily in the immense hearth, casting flickering shadows across the plush velvet furniture.  This was the domain of  Beatrice “Bea” Aurelia Cartwright, the night concierge.  Bea, in her impeccably tailored navy uniform, stood behind the polished mahogany desk, her auburn hair pulled back in a sleek chignon. The scent of lilies, strategically placed throughout the lobby, mingled with the subtle aroma of aged leather and expensive cologne. It was a typical Thursday night at the Grand Majestic - a quiet symphony of hushed conversations, the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, and the soft tap-tap-tap of Bea's fingers on her antique keyboard. Until, that is, a frantic knock echoed from the staff entrance, shattering the tranquil facade.
