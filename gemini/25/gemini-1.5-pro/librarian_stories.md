The scent of aging paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Eleanor Vance Holloway had come to associate with sanctuary.  The Silas Blackwood Memorial Library, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty storefront on Oakhaven's High Street, was her domain.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows, illuminated swirling dust motes dancing above the polished oak tables.  It was a Tuesday morning in late October, the kind where the air held a crisp bite that hinted at the coming winter, and the usually vibrant maple tree outside had begun to shed its crimson leaves, carpeting the sidewalk in a fiery blanket. Eleanor, perched behind her large, mahogany desk, meticulously stamped due dates into a stack of returned novels, her dark braid hanging like a thick rope over her shoulder. The only sound, aside from the rhythmic thud of the stamp, was the gentle ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady pulse in the otherwise quiet heart of the library.  It was a typical morning, peaceful and predictable, the sort Eleanor cherished.  She had no inkling that in just a few short hours, the tranquility would be shattered, and the quiet life sheâ€™d so carefully curated would be turned upside down.
