The wind, sharp and cold as a chisel, whipped across the desolate moorland, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Thorne. Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the sky, casting a bleak pall over the already somber landscape.  Elias, his calloused hands tucked deep into the pockets of his thick wool coat, stood at the edge of the quarry, the air thick with the scent of granite and the damp earth. The quarry itself was a jagged wound in the earth, a testament to generations of Thorne men who had wrestled their living from the unyielding stone. Generations of stone cutters, beginning long before Elias Thorne the Third had first drawn breath in the shadow of these very cliffs.  The village of Grimstone, a collection of grey stone houses huddled together against the elements, nestled at the foot of the quarry, its lights twinkling faintly in the gathering gloom.  A raven, perched on a jagged outcrop of rock, croaked a mournful greeting, its black feathers ruffled by the wind.  This was Elias's world, a world of stone and sky, of wind and silence, a world where beauty was carved from hardship, and life itself was as unforgiving as the granite beneath his feet.
