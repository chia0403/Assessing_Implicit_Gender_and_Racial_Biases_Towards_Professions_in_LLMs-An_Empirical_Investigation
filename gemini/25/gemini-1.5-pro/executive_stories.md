Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's office, blurring the already fading lights of the Hong Kong skyline.  Twenty-seven stories below, the relentless thrum of Victoria Harbour traffic was a muted drone against the storm's fury.  Cassie, Chief Operating Officer of  Aether Technologies, tapped a manicured nail against her sleek, obsidian desk. The rhythmic clicking was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony outside. Her penthouse office, usually a temple of minimalist elegance, was strewn with documents – financial reports, market analyses, and the dreaded acquisition proposal from OmniCorp, each page a potential harbinger of a future she was desperately trying to avoid. The air was thick with the scent of jasmine tea, long gone cold in its delicate porcelain cup.  The storm mirrored the tempest brewing within her. OmniCorp's offer was generous, bordering on obscene, but accepting it meant surrendering the company she’d poured her life into, a legacy built brick by digital brick.  And Cassie Moreau wasn't a woman who surrendered easily.
