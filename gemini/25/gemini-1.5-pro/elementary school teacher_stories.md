The biting November wind whipped around Miss Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's School playground.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt caramel and rusted pennies, swirled around her ankles. The grey stone building of St. Jude's, a squat, imposing structure that had stood for nearly a century, loomed over her.

Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  The old oak tree at the edge of the playground, its branches usually teeming with squirrels, stood eerily still, its bare limbs clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers.  Something felt wrong.
