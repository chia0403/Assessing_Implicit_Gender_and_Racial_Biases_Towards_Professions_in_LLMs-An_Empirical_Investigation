The brass-plated doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel groaned open, releasing a gust of chilled, perfume-laden air onto the bustling Chicago street. Rain hammered the sidewalk, turning the city lights into shimmering halos.  Inside, beneath a cascading crystal chandelier the size of a small car, eighteen-year-old Elias Finch shivered, not from the cold, but from the sheer opulent weight of the place. He tugged at the starched collar of his maroon uniform, the Grand Majestic’s logo – a roaring lion clutching a key – glinting on his lapel. He was three hours into his first shift as a bellhop, and the sheer volume of marble, velvet, and impossibly wealthy guests was enough to make his head spin. The lobby bustled with activity: a string quartet played a melancholic melody in the corner, while elegantly dressed couples sipped champagne and whispered secrets. Elias, amidst the whirlwind of luxury, felt utterly and wonderfully out of place. This wasn't the south side he knew, this was another world entirely, and tonight, it was his stage.
