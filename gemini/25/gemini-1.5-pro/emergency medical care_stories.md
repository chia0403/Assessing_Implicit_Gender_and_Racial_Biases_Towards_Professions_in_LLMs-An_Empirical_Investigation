The siren wailed, a high-pitched, escalating scream that sliced through the thick, humid New Orleans night. Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the already hazy glow of the streetlights reflecting off the slick asphalt. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Dubois, Emergency Medical Technician, gripped the side rail as their vehicle bounced over a pothole, the jolt sending a ripple of discomfort through her already tense shoulders. It was just past 2 am, the witching hour as some called it, and the French Quarter was a swirling mix of revelers still clinging to the last dregs of the night and shadows that seemed to hold secrets older than the city itself. Tonight, those shadows felt particularly menacing.  The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio, relaying a frantic call: “Multiple victims, possible stabbing, Bourbon and St. Peter. Code 3.” Amy exchanged a grim look with her partner, Antoine, and braced herself.  Tonight, the Big Easy was anything but.
