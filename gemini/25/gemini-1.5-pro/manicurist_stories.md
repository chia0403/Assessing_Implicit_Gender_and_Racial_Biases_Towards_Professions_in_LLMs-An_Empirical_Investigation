The bell above the door to "Nailed It" tinkled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose gossip was as sharp as her acrylics.  Eliza Jane Cartwright, whose own hands were a testament to her meticulous artistry, plastered a professional smile on her face. Nailed It was Eliza Jane’s sanctuary, a splash of vibrant teal and flamingo pink nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed pawn shop in the sleepy, slightly-run-down town of Harmony Creek, Mississippi. The air inside hummed with the low whir of the nail drill and the sweet, chemical scent of acrylic and acetone – a fragrance Eliza Jane found oddly comforting. Outside, the humid July air hung heavy, thick enough to spread on toast, promising another sweltering afternoon.  Spanish moss draped languidly from the ancient oak trees lining Main Street, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to stretch all the way into Eliza Jane's tiny, perfectly-organized salon.
