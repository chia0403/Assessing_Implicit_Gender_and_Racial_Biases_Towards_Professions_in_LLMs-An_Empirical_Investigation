The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick tweed jacket as he surveyed his domain.  Wysteria Hall, all gothic arches and brooding gargoyles, loomed behind him, its countless windows reflecting the bruised twilight sky.  Elias, his weathered face framed by unruly salt-and-pepper hair, pulled his cap lower and exhaled, a puff of white vanishing into the gathering gloom.

Fallen leaves, the colour of rust and old gold, carpeted the manicured lawns, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the sky like gnarled fingers.  Tonight, there was a peculiar stillness in the air, a heavy silence that pressed against Elias like a physical weight, a silence that spoke of secrets hidden beneath the frost-kissed earth.
