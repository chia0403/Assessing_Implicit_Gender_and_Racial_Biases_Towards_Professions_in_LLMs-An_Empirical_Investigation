The rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Greasy Spoon Diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear of pink. Inside, the air hung thick and heavy with the smell of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced flick of her wrist.  It was 7:00 am on a Tuesday in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon, and the only customer was a man in a rumpled trench coat nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring out at the downpour as though it held the answers to all his problems. The diner, a relic of the 1950s, hadn't seen a renovation since probably that decade, and the worn red vinyl booths and checkered floor seemed to sigh under the weight of years of spilled coffee and whispered secrets. Amy sighed too, pushing a loose strand of her dark hair behind her ear. It was going to be a long day.
