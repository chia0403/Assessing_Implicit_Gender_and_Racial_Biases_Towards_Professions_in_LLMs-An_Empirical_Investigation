The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack perpetually at odds with the vibrant posters proclaiming "Reach for the Stars!" and "The Future is Yours!" that plastered the cinderblock walls.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in October at Northwood High, the crisp autumn air battling valiantly, but ultimately losing, against the stale recirculated air of the building. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the view of the football field where a lone figure in a bright yellow raincoat practiced kicking field goals with grim determination.  Eleanor, her chin resting on a steepled hand, watched him for a moment, a familiar pang of empathy tightening her chest.  She knew that feeling of fighting against the odds, of striving for something just out of reach.  The phone buzzed, jarring her back to the present. The digital display flashed: "Principal Thompson."  Eleanor sighed. This couldn't be good.
