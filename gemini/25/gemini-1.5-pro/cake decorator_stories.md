The scent of caramelizing sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of brewing coffee.  Rain lashed against the large front window of Buttercup Blooms, obscuring the normally vibrant view of the bustling Charleston marketplace. Inside, Amelia "Millie" Rose Hawthorne hummed a jaunty tune as she meticulously piped buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, each delicate petal a testament to her years of dedicated practice.  The small bakery, nestled between a vintage bookstore and an antique shop, was Millie's sanctuary, a world of flour, sugar, and endless creative possibility. This particular cake, a cascade of ivory and blush, was destined for the grand ballroom of the historic Drayton Hall Plantation, and Millie, despite the grey skies outside, felt a bubble of excitement rising within her.  This wasn't just any wedding; it was the social event of the season, and her cake was the centerpiece.
