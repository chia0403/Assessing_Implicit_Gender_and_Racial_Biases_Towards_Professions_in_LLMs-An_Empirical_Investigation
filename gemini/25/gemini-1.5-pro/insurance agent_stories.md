Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image for Elias Thorne’s current predicament.  He sat hunched over a chipped Formica table in the dimly lit back booth of Rosie’s Diner, the greasy spoon aroma of frying onions battling the cloying sweetness of stale coffee.  Elias, full name Elias Walker Thorne, adjusted his tie, the knot feeling like a hangman's noose.  Ashfall, Pennsylvania, population 3,214 and shrinking, wasn’t exactly a goldmine for an insurance agent, especially one whose last three clients had been a taxidermist, a purveyor of prepper supplies, and a woman who claimed her house was haunted by a poltergeist with a penchant for pilfered silverware.  Tonight, however, Elias had an appointment that could change everything.  A lead, whispered to him by old Mrs. Petrov, about a reclusive millionaire rumored to have moved into the dilapidated Blackwood Manor on the outskirts of town.  A millionaire who, according to Mrs. Petrov, needed to insure a collection of… peculiarities.  Elias checked his watch. 7:58 pm. Two minutes until his potential salvation, or perhaps, his damnation.
