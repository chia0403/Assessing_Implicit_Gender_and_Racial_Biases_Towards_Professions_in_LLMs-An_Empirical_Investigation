The rusted weathervane atop St. Jude's, a mournful-looking rooster, creaked in the wind, its complaint echoing down to Elias "Eli" Blackwood where he perched precariously on the church's slate roof.  The October air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at the exposed skin around Eli's neck. Below him, the small town of Havenwood, Massachusetts, stretched out like a patchwork quilt, its neat houses and twisting lanes dusted with a light frost.  The sun, a pale disc in the hazy sky, offered little warmth.  This was Eli's favorite time of year – the quiet before the true bite of winter set in, when the world held its breath, anticipating the coming snow.  But this particular morning, a different kind of chill settled in Eli's bones, one that had nothing to do with the weather. He’d received a phone call just before dawn, a call that had sent him scrambling up here, to the highest point in Havenwood, seeking solace and a clear view of the house at the edge of town – the house where his past resided.
