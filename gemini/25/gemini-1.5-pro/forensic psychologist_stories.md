The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he stepped out of the black unmarked car.  Salt spray hung in the air, coating everything with a fine, gritty film, including the grim tableau before him.  Two police constables stood guard at the edge of the chalk cliffs, their fluorescent jackets a stark contrast against the muted greys and blues of the late November afternoon.  Below them, a crumpled figure lay sprawled on the jagged rocks, a splash of crimson staining the white chalk.  Seagulls circled overhead, their cries echoing the desolate emptiness of the scene.  Dr. Thorne, bundled in a thick wool coat and scarf, pulled on his gloves, the leather creaking in the cold.  This desolate stretch of the Yorkshire coast, just outside the small fishing village of Ravenscar, was far from his usual London practice.  He’d been summoned by Detective Inspector Davies, an old acquaintance from his days at the Met, who’d hinted at something…unusual…about this apparent suicide.
