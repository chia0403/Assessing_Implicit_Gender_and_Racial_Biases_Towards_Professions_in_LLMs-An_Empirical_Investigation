Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the Seattle skyline into a hazy watercolor of grey and neon.  The rhythmic tapping against the glass mirrored the persistent click-clack of his mechanical keyboard.  Elias, clad in a faded Nirvana t-shirt and worn-out jeans, hunched over his workstation, the glow of three monitors illuminating his pale face.  Empty coffee cups littered the surface of his desk, casualties of a coding marathon that had stretched into its third day.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale pizza and the faint hum of his custom-built computer, a Frankensteinian creation of flashing lights and whirring fans.  He was on the verge of a breakthrough, he could feel it.  For months, Elias had been wrestling with the code for Project Chimera, an ambitious AI program designed to learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate.  Tonight, he believed he was finally close to cracking the code that would unlock its true potential.  Outside, the wind howled, a fitting soundtrack to the storm brewing both inside his apartment and within the lines of code flickering across his screens.
