The biting wind whipped off the Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of frozen algae and pine needles through the open window of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic.  Snow dusted the sill, a stark contrast to the vibrant yellow walls of "Thorne Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation."  Elias, bundled in a thick, navy cable-knit sweater over his usual crisp white button-down, watched the flurries accumulate, his breath fogging the glass. The clinic, nestled in the quaint, snow-globe-esque town of North Haven, Michigan, was usually a haven of warmth and healing. This morning, however, an unusual chill hung in the air, mirroring the unsettling feeling in Elias’s gut.  The appointment scheduled for 9:00 a.m. was with a new patient, a Mrs. Agatha Blackwood, and something about the terse phone call his receptionist had described made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle.  He glanced at the antique clock ticking steadily on the wall – 8:57.  The quiet before the storm, he thought, bracing himself.
