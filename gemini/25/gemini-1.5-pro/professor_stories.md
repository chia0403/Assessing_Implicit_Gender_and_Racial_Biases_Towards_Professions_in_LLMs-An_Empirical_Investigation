The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed coat as he hurried across the quad of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-colored stone buildings, their expressions mocking the futile attempts of students and faculty alike to shield themselves from the encroaching cold.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and ochre, skittered across the cobblestones, a rustling chorus accompanying Alistair's brisk pace.  The imposing Radcliffe Camera loomed in the distance, its circular form a stark contrast to the gothic spires surrounding it.  The air smelled of woodsmoke and damp earth, a familiar scent that Alistair, despite his twenty years at St. Jude's, still found comforting.  He was on his way to the Bodleian Library, a place he considered a second home, to examine a newly acquired manuscript that promised to shed light on a particularly obscure period of Anglo-Saxon history.  A period that, to Alistair, held the key to understanding everything.
