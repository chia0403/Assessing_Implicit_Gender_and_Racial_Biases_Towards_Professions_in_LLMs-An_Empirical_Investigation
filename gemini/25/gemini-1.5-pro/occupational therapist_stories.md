The crisp November air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Elara Grace Holloway's cheeks as she pulled her battered Subaru Forester into the driveway of Eventide Manor.  The grand Victorian house, once a vibrant summer home for a wealthy Boston family, now served as a residential care facility for elderly patients with varying degrees of cognitive and physical decline.  Its paint, a faded shade of butter yellow, was peeling in places, revealing the dark wood beneath.  Wisteria vines, bare and skeletal now, clung to the elaborate gingerbread trim, their summer glory a distant memory.  Eventide sat perched on a small hill overlooking the sleepy town of Port Blossom, Maine, where the relentless rhythm of the ocean waves against the rocky shore provided a constant, if melancholic, soundtrack. Elara, bundled in a thick wool coat and fingerless gloves, grabbed her satchel, a worn leather bag overflowing with therapy tools and paperwork, and stepped out into the biting wind, bracing herself for another day of gentle encouragement, stubborn resistance, and fleeting moments of pure, unadulterated joy.
