The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal frame of the barn, rattling the half-nailed boards and stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  Sawdust, fine as snow, danced around him, clinging to his thick woolen sweater and the brim of his worn leather cap.  Perched precariously on a scaffold twenty feet above the frozen ground, Elias surveyed his work.  The barn, rising slowly from the ochre earth of the Derbyshire dales, was his most ambitious project yet. Below him, the rolling hills of the Peak District stretched out like a rumpled green blanket, punctuated by drystone walls and the occasional plume of smoke from a distant farmhouse chimney. The air was sharp and clean, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. This was Elias's world, a world of wood and wind, of precise measurements and patient craftsmanship. A world he knew as intimately as the lines on his calloused hands.
