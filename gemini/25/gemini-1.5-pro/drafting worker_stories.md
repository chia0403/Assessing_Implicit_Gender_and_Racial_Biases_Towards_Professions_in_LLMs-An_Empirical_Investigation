A smudge of graphite on her cheek mirrored the faint grey circles beneath her eyes â€“ testaments to the long hours she'd poured into this project, a project that held the promise of a promotion, and the hope of finally escaping the cramped apartment she shared with her two younger sisters. The air in the drafting room was thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, sweet scent of the erasing fluid she used liberally, a smell that, to Amelia, signified possibility and precision.  This wasn't just a building she was drawing; it was a future she was meticulously crafting, one careful line at a time.
