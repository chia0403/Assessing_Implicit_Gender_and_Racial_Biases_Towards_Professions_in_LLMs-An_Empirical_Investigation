The recycled air hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's practiced smile.  Fluorescent lights glinted off the polished silver of the beverage cart as she navigated the narrow aisle of Flight 743, a red-eye from JFK to Heathrow. Outside, the ink-black canvas of the Atlantic was pricked by the distant, cold glitter of stars. Inside, the cabin was a dim aquarium of slumbering passengers, their faces illuminated by the ghostly glow of in-flight entertainment screens. The air crackled with a static tension, the kind that only comes from being thirty thousand feet above the ground, suspended between two continents, in the fragile metal belly of a jumbo jet. Amelia felt it too, a familiar thrum beneath the veneer of professional calm. Tonight, however, it was different.  A prickle of unease danced on the back of her neck, a premonition as sharp and cold as the ice clinking in the plastic cups she carried.  Something was off.
