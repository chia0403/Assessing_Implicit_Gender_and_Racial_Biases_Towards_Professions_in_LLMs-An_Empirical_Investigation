The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she leaned precariously over the edge of the crumbling cliff. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea gnawed at the volcanic rock, sending plumes of white foam spiralling skyward.  The tiny, whitewashed village of Oia, perched on the caldera rim of Santorini, shimmered in the afternoon sun, a cascade of cubic houses clinging to the cliff face like a handful of sugar cubes.  Elara, her auburn braid whipping in the wind, squinted at the dramatic landscape, the vibrant blues and whites etching themselves into her mind.  Her worn leather satchel, bulging with charcoal sticks, watercolour paints, and a well-used sketchbook, lay at her feet, a silent testament to her purpose. This was her third year on the island, drawn by its raw beauty and the melancholy whisper of ancient stories woven into the very fabric of the land. This year, she swore, she would finally capture its soul on canvas.
