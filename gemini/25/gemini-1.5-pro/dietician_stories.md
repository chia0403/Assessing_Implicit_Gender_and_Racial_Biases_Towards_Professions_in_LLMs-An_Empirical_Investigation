The insistent drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of the "Healthy Habits Cafe" mirrored the persistent thrum of anxiety in Amelia Grace Hawthorne's chest.  Nestled between a bustling laundromat and a perpetually gloomy antique shop in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, the cafe was Amelia's dream, a beacon of nutritional enlightenment in a town seemingly addicted to fried clams and lobster rolls.  The sea air, usually a salty, invigorating balm, felt heavy and oppressive this Tuesday morning, clinging to the brightly painted clapboard buildings like a damp shroud. Inside, the aroma of freshly brewed organic coffee mingled with the faint scent of mildew creeping in from the leaky eaves.  Amelia, her fiery red hair pulled back in a practical bun, stared out the misted window, a frown etched between her vibrant green eyes. The grand opening was just three days away, and the promised sunshine, crucial to her outdoor seating plans, seemed to have taken an extended vacation.
