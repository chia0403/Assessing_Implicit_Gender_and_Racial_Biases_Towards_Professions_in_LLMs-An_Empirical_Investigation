The biting wind whipped down Cobblestone Alley, carrying the metallic tang of blood and the sweet, earthy scent of sawdust.  It plastered Elias Thorne's thick apron against his stout frame, tugging at the brim of his greasy cap. The cobblestones, slick with a mixture of rain and offal, gleamed under the anemic light of a gas lamp that hissed and sputtered above Thorne's Butcher Shop & Provisions.  The shop itself, nestled between a pawnbroker and a dimly lit tavern, was a small, single-story affair built of dark wood, its windows frosted with condensation. Inside, hanging from iron hooks, freshly slaughtered carcasses swung gently, their shadows dancing on the tiled floor.  The air within was thick, heavy with the perfume of cured meats and the almost musical *thwack-thwack* of Elias's cleaver against the worn wooden chopping block.
