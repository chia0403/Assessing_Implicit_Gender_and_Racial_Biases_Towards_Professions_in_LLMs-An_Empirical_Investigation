The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Hawthorneâ€™s shears. Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, a shimmering haze rising from the cobblestones. Inside, the shop was a cool oasis, bursting with the fragrant promise of lilies, roses, and jasmine. Sunlight, filtered through the emerald green awning, dappled the worn wooden floor, illuminating buckets overflowing with vibrant blooms. Eliza Jane, a wisp of a woman with dirt under her fingernails and a twinkle in her eye, was crafting a cascading bouquet of white orchids, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The scent of the exotic flowers mingled with the earthy aroma of damp moss and the sweet perfume of hyacinths, creating a heady concoction that was uniquely Petal & Stem. This Tuesday morning, however, held a different kind of promise, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of Eliza Jane's life, all thanks to the unexpected delivery of a single, perfect black rose.
