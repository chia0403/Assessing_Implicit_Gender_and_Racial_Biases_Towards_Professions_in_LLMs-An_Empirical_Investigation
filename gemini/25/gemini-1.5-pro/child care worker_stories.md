The air in the Bumble Bee Room buzzed with the chaotic energy of a dozen toddlers released from naptime.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating a kaleidoscope of scattered toys and miniature plastic furniture.  A half-eaten banana lay smeared across the pastel-coloured carpet, a silent testament to the joys of unsupervised snack time.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a childcare worker with the patience of a saint and the stamina of an Olympic athlete, knelt amidst the chaos, attempting to mediate a dispute over a particularly coveted red dump truck.  Her curly auburn hair, usually tied back in a neat bun, had escaped its confines and now framed her freckled face in a halo of unruly tendrils.  The Bumble Bee Room, located in the brightly painted, slightly ramshackle "Happy Hearts Daycare" nestled in the heart of the sleepy seaside town of Seabrook, was Ameliaâ€™s domain, and despite the daily chaos, it was a place she genuinely loved.
