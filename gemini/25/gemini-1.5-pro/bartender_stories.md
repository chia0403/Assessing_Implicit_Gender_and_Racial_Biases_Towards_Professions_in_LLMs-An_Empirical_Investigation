Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Griffin & Gargoyle, depicting a mythical beast mid-swoop, claws outstretched. Inside, the warm glow of gas lamps fought against the gloom of the encroaching November evening.  Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne, her chestnut braid draped over her shoulder like a thick rope, polished the mahogany bar top with a practiced hand, the rhythmic motion a counterpoint to the howling wind.  The Griffin & Gargoyle, nestled in the heart of the fog-shrouded alleyways of Port Blossom, was usually bustling with sailors, dockworkers, and the odd whispering academic from the nearby university. Tonight, however, only two patrons occupied the dimly lit corners – a hunched figure nursing a half-empty bottle of whiskey and a young woman with eyes like storm clouds, tracing patterns on her coaster with a trembling finger. The air hung thick with the scent of salt, damp wool, and Amy's signature spiced cider, a comforting aroma that couldn't quite mask the unsettling stillness that had settled over the pub.
