Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a staccato note in the symphony of the city. Neon signs reflected in the slick streets of downtown Los Angeles, painting the asphalt with lurid hues of pink and green.  A single, bare bulb illuminated Thorne's cramped space, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering light.  Cigarette smoke, thick and stale, hung in the air like a shroud, clinging to the worn leather of his chair and the stacks of case files threatening to topple from his desk.  Elias Thorne, his full name rarely spoken aloud, rubbed his tired eyes, the lines around them etched deep by years of late nights and too much cheap whiskey.  The relentless drumming of the rain mirrored the dull ache in his temples.  He was staring at a crumpled photograph of a smiling woman with fiery red hair, a woman he hadn't seen in five years.  Tonight, the rain felt like a lament, and the city, a mausoleum.
