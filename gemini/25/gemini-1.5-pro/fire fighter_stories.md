The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of Dawson's Peak. Below her, the once-lush valley floor was choked with smoke, the flames of the wildfire painting the twilight sky in a terrifying, flickering orange.  Pine trees, centuries old, crackled and roared like tortured beasts, their burning branches reaching towards the starless heavens. The air was thick with the smell of burning pine needles and the acrid tang of fear. Mia, a five-year veteran of the Redwood National Forest Fire Service, tightened her grip on her Pulaski axe, her heart pounding a rhythm as relentless as the fire's advance.  This wasn't just another wildfire; this was a monster, fueled by a record-breaking drought and driven by relentless winds. This was the kind of fire they told stories about â€“ the kind that could swallow a town whole. And Dawson's Creek, nestled at the foot of the mountain, was directly in its path.
