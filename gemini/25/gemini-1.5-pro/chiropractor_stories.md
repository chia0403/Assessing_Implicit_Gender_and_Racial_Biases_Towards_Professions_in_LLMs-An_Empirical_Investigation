The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the mournful wail of the wind whistling through the gaps in the window frames.  Elias, his full name Elias Vance Thorne, a man whose hands knew the intimate secrets of the spine, sighed, the sound barely audible above the storm. His clinic, nestled in the forgotten corner of Harmony Creek, Oregon, a town more boarded-up shops than bustling businesses, wasn't exactly thriving.  The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Thorne Chiropractic - Spine Aligned, Life Realigned," offered a promise that felt increasingly hollow in the face of dwindling patients and mounting bills.  The single waiting room chair, upholstered in a faded floral pattern, sat empty, a silent testament to the town's dwindling faith in both miracles and spinal adjustments.  The scent of pine-scented cleaning spray mingled with the musty odor of damp wood, creating a peculiar aroma that Elias had come to associate with quiet desperation.
