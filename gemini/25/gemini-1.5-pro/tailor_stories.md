The clatter of trams on cobbled streets, the scent of roasting chestnuts from a nearby vendor, and the ever-present drizzle that seemed to cling to Prague like a second skin – these were the constants of Elias Volek’s world. His tailor shop, nestled between a bakery overflowing with rye bread and a dimly lit apothecary, was a haven of quiet amidst the bustle of Malá Strana.  Sunlight, when it managed to pierce the perpetually overcast sky, filtered through the large, grime-streaked window, illuminating the chaotic yet ordered space within.  Threads of every imaginable colour spilled from overflowing baskets, half-finished garments draped over dressmaker's dummies, and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elias’s shears punctuated the gentle murmur of conversation filtering in from the street.  Elias, a man of precise movements and a perpetually furrowed brow, was hunched over a length of emerald green silk, the fabric shimmering like a captured mermaid's tail. He was a master of his craft, known throughout the neighbourhood for his impeccable stitching and his ability to transform even the most mundane fabric into something extraordinary. But Elias harboured a secret, one as carefully guarded as the antique sewing machine he’d inherited from his grandfather – a secret that threatened to unravel the very fabric of his carefully constructed life.
