The insistent Vermont wind rattled the leaded glass panes of Dr. Finch’s Family Dentistry, mirroring the nervous flutter in Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s stomach.  It was her first day at the practice, nestled amidst the quaint brick buildings and vibrant fall foliage of Maple Creek, a town so idyllic it looked like it had been lifted straight from a Norman Rockwell painting.  Amelia, still clutching her thermos of chamomile tea, took a deep breath, the crisp air filled with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  Inside, the waiting room was warm and inviting, with a crackling fireplace, plush armchairs, and the faint, sterile tang of antiseptic.  Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  She hoped the patients of Maple Creek would be as charming as their town.  After six years in a bustling, impersonal city practice, Amelia yearned for a slower pace, a sense of community, and the chance to finally use her newly acquired certification in holistic dental hygiene.  She just prayed this new beginning wouldn't be another chipped tooth in the porcelain veneer of her career.
