The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Wyoming plains, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Vance Holloway.  He squinted, his weathered face creased further by the effort, as he surveyed the rolling expanse of the Broken Spur Ranch.  Fifty thousand acres of unforgiving beauty stretched before him, painted in the muted hues of late autumn.  The dry grass, once vibrant green, now resembled a sea of bleached gold, rippling under the restless sky.  A scattering of Hereford cattle, their breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, huddled together near a stand of gnarled cottonwoods, seeking a meager shelter from the wind's relentless assault.  The distant peaks of the Absaroka Range, capped with early snow, loomed like silent sentinels, guarding the secrets of the high country.  Winter was coming to the Broken Spur, and with it, a season of hardship Elias knew all too well.
