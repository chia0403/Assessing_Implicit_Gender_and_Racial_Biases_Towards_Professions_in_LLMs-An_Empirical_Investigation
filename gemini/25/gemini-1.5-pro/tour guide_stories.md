The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of plumeria and impending rain.  Elara Vivienne Holloway adjusted the microphone clipped to her coral linen shirt, the fabric already clinging to her in the oppressive humidity. Around her, a gaggle of tourists, resplendent in their brightly coloured Hawaiian shirts and ill-advised sandals, fanned themselves with paper maps of Oahu. They stood clustered beneath the sprawling branches of a banyan tree in Iolani Palace’s courtyard, its aerial roots dangling like the tangled beard of a sleeping giant.  Elara smiled, a practiced, welcoming curve of her lips that didn’t quite reach the weariness in her hazel eyes.  This was her fourth tour of the day, and the unrelenting Hawaiian sun had sapped her energy more effectively than any kava drink ever could.  "Aloha, everyone," she began, her voice projecting with practiced ease, "and welcome to Iolani Palace, the only official residence of royalty in the United States..."  Thunder rumbled in the distance, a low growl that promised a deluge.  Elara hoped it would hold off until she’d at least gotten them inside.  This group looked particularly susceptible to melting.
