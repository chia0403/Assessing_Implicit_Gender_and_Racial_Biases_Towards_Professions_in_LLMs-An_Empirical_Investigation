The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the scene before her.  Perched precariously on a folding stool at the edge of Widow Finnigan's pumpkin patch, Amelia clutched her palette, the oils already thickening in the frigid air.  Before her, the rolling hills of the Connemara Gaeltacht blazed in autumnal glory.  Russet bracken carpeted the slopes, punctuated by the dark emerald of wind-battered pines, while in the valley below, the slate-grey roofs of Roundstone village huddled against the encroaching dusk.  The sky, a bruised canvas of purple and gunmetal grey, threatened snow.  This wild, untamed landscape, a place where the Irish language still danced on the wind, was Amelia's muse, her sanctuary, and the source of both her greatest joy and deepest despair.
