Bea had arrived in the desolate town of Harmony Springs, Oklahoma, two days ahead of schedule, desperate to close a deal with the notoriously fickle owner of the Harmony Diner before her rival, “Smiling” Sammy Sykes, got wind of her presence.  The diner, rumored to serve the best chicken-fried steak west of the Mississippi, represented her last chance to make quota this quarter. And Bea desperately needed this commission. Not for a fancy vacation or a new car, but to keep the lights on back home.
