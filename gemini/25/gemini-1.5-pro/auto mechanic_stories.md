The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of O’Malley’s Auto Repair, sending a shiver down Eliza Jane O’Malley’s spine as she wrestled with a rusted exhaust pipe.  Grease smudged her cheekbone, a testament to the hours she'd already spent coaxing life back into a sputtering '67 Ford Mustang.  O’Malley's, nestled between a boarded-up diner and a perpetually flickering neon sign advertising “Lucky’s Liquors,” was a small island of industry in the otherwise desolate landscape of Dustbowl, Nevada. The town, once a bustling hub thanks to a nearby silver mine, now clung to life by a thread, its glory days as faded and cracked as the paint on most of the vehicles Eliza serviced. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the rusted hulks scattered across the yard, each a silent witness to Dustbowl’s slow decline. The air hung heavy with the scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and the faint, metallic tang of desert dust.
