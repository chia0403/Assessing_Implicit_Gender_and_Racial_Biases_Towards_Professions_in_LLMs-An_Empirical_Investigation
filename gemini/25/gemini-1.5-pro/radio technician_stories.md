The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, whistling through the rusted guy-wires of the colossal radio telescope.  Amelia Reyes, her breath clouding the frigid air, hunched deeper into her thick parka.  Above her, the dish, a behemoth of steel and precision engineering, pointed towards the inky black canvas speckled with a million indifferent stars. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, ALMA for short, was Amelia's domain.  Tonight, however, the usually humming, buzzing symphony of interstellar communication was eerily silent.  The control room, nestled in a prefabricated building a hundred yards from the dish, was bathed in the sickly green glow of emergency lights, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering fluorescent tubes above.  Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and Amelia, the sole technician on duty, was alone to face it.
