The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny explosion against the leaded glass.  The rhythmic drumming was a counterpoint to the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady, almost hypnotic beat that usually soothed Elias. Not tonight. Tonight, the relentless downpour felt oppressive, mirroring the knot of unease tightening in his stomach. His office, normally a sanctuary of warm oak furniture, Persian rugs, and the comforting scent of old books, felt close, almost suffocating. Located on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic district of Ashworth, Massachusetts, the room usually exuded a timeless elegance. But the storm raging outside, shrouding the gaslit streets in an eerie half-light, had seeped into the very walls, imbuing the space with a disquieting chill.  Elias pushed a stray lock of dark hair from his forehead and tapped a pen nervously against the leather-bound notepad on his desk.  His last patient of the day, a new referral, was late.  Very late.
