Rain lashed against the attic window of Anya Sharma's studio, a frantic tattoo against the glass that mirrored the frenetic energy buzzing in her chest.  Located in the eaves of a converted Victorian warehouse in the heart of Shoreditch, London, the space was usually a haven of organised chaos. Tonight, however, it felt claustrophobic.  Scattered across her oversized oak desk were printouts of logo iterations for "Serpentine Cycles," a new high-end bicycle company.  Each design, meticulously crafted in a symphony of swirling lines and bold typography, feltâ€¦wrong.  The deadline was looming, the client demanding, and Anya, usually brimming with creative solutions, was drawing a frustrating blank.  The only illumination besides the glow of her iMac came from a string of fairy lights haphazardly draped around a vintage drafting table, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swirling anxiety in her gut.  The air hung thick with the scent of printer ink, stale coffee, and the faint, sweet aroma of the jasmine tea Anya had long forgotten she'd brewed.
