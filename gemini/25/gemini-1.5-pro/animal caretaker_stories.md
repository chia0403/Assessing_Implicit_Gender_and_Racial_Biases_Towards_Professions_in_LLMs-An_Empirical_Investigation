The biting wind whipped Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s thick braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and icy blues over the sprawling grounds of the Aisling Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Redwood National Park of Northern California.  The ancient trees loomed like silent giants, their snow-laden branches bowing in reverence to the biting wind.  The Sanctuary, a haven for rescued and rehabilitated animals, hummed with a low, pre-dawn symphony of rustling leaves, distant howls, and the rhythmic creak of Millie’s heavy boots on the packed snow.  This morning, the air crackled with an unusual tension, a palpable unease that sent shivers down Millie’s spine, unrelated to the cold.  It centered, she knew, around the new arrival – a  nervously skittish Sumatran orangutan named Raja, who had arrived just the week before and refused to leave his transport crate.
