The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled a mournful tune as Elias Finch unlocked it, the sound swallowed by the damp chill of a November morning in Port Blossom, Oregon.  Fog clung to the quaint, clapboard buildings lining Main Street, blurring the edges of the antique shop across the way and the bakery two doors down where the scent of cinnamon rolls, usually a comforting beacon, was barely perceptible.  Elias, his breath misting in the air, switched on the single bare bulb that illuminated the small, wood-paneled barbershop. The light glinted off the chrome and leather of the antique barber chairs, their stillness a stark contrast to the usual bustling chatter and snip of scissors that filled the space.  Today, however, the only sound was the rhythmic drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere in the back, a metronome keeping time for Elias's unease.  He hadn't had a customer in three days, and in a town as small as Port Blossom, that meant something.
