Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail beneath a faded baseball cap, slammed the truck's tailgate shut.  The clanging echoed in the pre-dawn quiet of Cypress Creek, a small town where the Spanish moss draped heavier than the secrets everyone seemed to keep.  Amy, still bleary-eyed from a 3 a.m. call to unclog Mrs. Henderson’s perpetually overflowing toilet, hefted her toolbox, the familiar weight a comfort against the gnawing unease settling in her gut.  Something felt off.  It wasn't just the oppressive humidity or the way the cicadas seemed to be buzzing with a frantic energy. It was a prickle at the back of her neck, a sense of wrongness that had clung to her since that strange call last night… a call to a vacant house out on the edge of the Everglades.
