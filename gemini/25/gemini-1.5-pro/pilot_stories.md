The salt-laced wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's flight suit as she climbed down from the cockpit of her beat-up Cessna.  The setting sun painted the Alaskan sky in violent streaks of orange and purple, reflecting off the choppy waters of Prince William Sound.  Chugach Mountains, jagged and snow-capped even in late spring, loomed like slumbering giants around the tiny gravel airstrip carved into the edge of Montague Island.  Mia's destination, the isolated cannery town of Port Chalmers, clung precariously to the rocky shoreline, its handful of weather-beaten buildings huddled together against the elements.  The air thrummed with the fading drone of the Cessna's engine and the cries of gulls wheeling overhead.  This was Mia's life: delivering essential supplies to remote communities scattered across the vast, unforgiving Alaskan wilderness.  Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease crawled down her spine, a feeling she couldn't quite shake, like the silence before a storm.
