The wind, a biting November gale laced with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat as he surveyed his fields.  Frost, delicate and lethal, clung to the browning stalks of his winter wheat, a shimmering shroud under the bruised twilight sky.  Elias’s farm, nestled in the valley carved by the whispering Black Creek, was a patchwork of browns and greys, a muted tapestry woven with the threads of a season’s ending.  Crows, black specks against the iron sky, cawed raucously from the bare branches of an ancient oak that marked the western border of his property, their cries a stark counterpoint to the rustling whispers of the wind-swept corn stubble. This was Thorne’s Hollow, a place of quiet beauty and harsh realities, where the cycle of life and death played out in the rhythms of the seasons. And Elias, its sole steward, felt the chill of winter not just in his bones, but in his soul.
