The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the salt flats, stinging Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's exposed cheeks.  Crystalline shards of ice crunched under the heavy tread of her boots as she approached the scene, the flashing blue and red lights of her patrol car painting grotesque shadows across the stark landscape.  The air, usually thick with the briny tang of the nearby Great Salt Lake, was tonight laced with something else, something metallic and faintly acrid â€“ the smell of blood.  A lone figure, hunched and motionless, lay sprawled near a rusting, abandoned oil derrick, the only interruption in the otherwise pristine white expanse.  The vast, indifferent sky above, peppered with a million icy stars, offered no comfort, only a silent testament to the isolation and unforgiving nature of the Bonneville Salt Flats.  Izzy adjusted her thick wool beanie, a grim expression settling on her face. This was going to be a long night.
