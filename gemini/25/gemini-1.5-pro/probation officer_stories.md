The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s dark hair across her face as she trudged up the cracked concrete steps of the dilapidated three-story apartment building.  Number 3B.  This was it. The peeling paint, the rusted railing, the pervasive smell of stale cigarettes and despair – it was all so familiar.  Amy tucked a loose strand behind her ear and adjusted the strap of her worn leather messenger bag, the weight of case files a constant reminder of the lives she navigated daily.  This particular case, however, felt different. Marcus “The Hammer” Hamilton, a former enforcer for the notorious Southside Serpents gang, was fresh out of prison and under Amy's supervision. He’d promised the judge, and more importantly, Amy, a clean slate.  But the whispers on the street suggested otherwise.  The air in the Kingston neighborhood of Philadelphia, usually thick with the sounds of city life, hung heavy with an uneasy silence, the kind that preceded a storm. Amy took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever lay behind the chipped, faded green door of apartment 3B.
