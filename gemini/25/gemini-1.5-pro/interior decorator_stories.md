Sunlight, filtered through the vibrant crimson and gold canopy of the ancient maples lining Hawthorne Lane, glinted off the brass handles, momentarily blinding her.  Blink Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Vermont Green Mountains, was picturesque to a fault, all covered bridges and babbling brooks, the kind of place city folk paid exorbitant prices to escape to for a weekend of faux-rustic charm. For Amelia, however, it was simply home – and the location of her latest project: transforming the dilapidated Victorian mansion known locally as Whispering Pines into a cozy bed and breakfast for the eccentric, but undeniably wealthy, Mrs. Agatha Thistlewick.
