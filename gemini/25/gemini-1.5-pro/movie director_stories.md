The biting February wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Valencia as she stood on the precipice of Dunnoch Cliff, the slate-grey sea churning far below. Her crimson wool coat, usually a vibrant splash of colour against the muted tones of London, seemed swallowed by the vastness of the Scottish Highlands.  A crumpled shooting schedule clutched in her gloved hand, Esme squinted against the horizontal sleet, picturing the scene.  This was it. The climactic confrontation of her latest film, "The Whispers of Glencairn", a gothic thriller steeped in Highland folklore and long-held secrets. Dunnoch Castle, a crumbling behemoth perched precariously on the cliff edge behind her, would serve as the backdrop, its shadowy windows like empty eyes staring out at the turbulent North Sea. The air was thick with the tang of salt and something else, something older, wilder, that prickled the hairs on the back of Esmeâ€™s neck. This was more than just a beautiful location; it felt like stepping into the heart of her story, a place where myth and reality blurred.
