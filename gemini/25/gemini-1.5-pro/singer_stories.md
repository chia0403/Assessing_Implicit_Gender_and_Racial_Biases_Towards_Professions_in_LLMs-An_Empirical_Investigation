The crimson velvet curtains of the Moulin Rouge quivered, a silent tremor before the storm of applause that would inevitably follow.  A single spotlight, sharp as a shard of glass, cut through the hazy Parisian night air, illuminating a spattering of sequins on the stage floor.  The scent of absinthe and anticipation hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of rain that had slicked the cobblestone streets outside.  This was Montmartre, 1899, a breeding ground for bohemians, dreamers, and the desperately ambitious.  And tonight, it belonged to Céleste Moreau.  Her full name, rarely uttered beyond the confines of her cramped dressing room, was Geneviève Céleste Moreau, but for the patrons of the Moulin Rouge, she was simply Céleste, the Nightingale of Montmartre.  They came for her voice, a smoky contralto that could purr like a kitten or soar like a hawk, weaving tales of love, loss, and the intoxicating allure of the city.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A tremor of unease, as palpable as the trembling curtains, danced beneath the surface of her carefully crafted stage persona.
