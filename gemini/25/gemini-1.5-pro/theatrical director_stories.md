The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Cartwright, tugging at the edges of her oversized scarf as she hurried down the cobbled lane. Gas lamps flickered against the slick, rain-washed stones of Theatre Row in the heart of Victorian London, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the frantic energy swirling within her.  The grand façade of the Bradbury Theatre loomed ahead, its ornate carvings momentarily obscured by a thick plume of fog that rolled in from the nearby Thames. Tonight was the premiere of her audacious reimagining of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," set not in a whimsical forest, but amidst the smoky factories and grimy alleyways of the industrial revolution.  Esme’s gloved hand tightened around the silver head of her walking stick, a mixture of exhilaration and terror thrumming through her veins.  Years of work, of battling skeptical producers and temperamental actors, had led to this very moment.  The air crackled with anticipation, the faint murmur of the gathering crowd filtering through the thick wooden doors of the theatre. Tonight, Esme would either solidify her reputation as a visionary director or be branded a theatrical madwoman.
