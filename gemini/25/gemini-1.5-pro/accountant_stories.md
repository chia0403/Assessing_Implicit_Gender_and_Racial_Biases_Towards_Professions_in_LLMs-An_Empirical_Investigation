The damp chill of a London November seeped through the ill-fitting window frame, settling onto Amelia Grace Holloway's shoulders like a shroud.  Her small flat, tucked away above a bustling Indian takeaway on Brick Lane, usually vibrated with the comforting aroma of cardamom and cumin.  Tonight, however, the spices were overpowered by the scent of stale cigarette smoke clinging to the threadbare curtains, a legacy of the previous tenant. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, tapped away at her second-hand laptop, the glow of the screen illuminating the stacks of invoices and receipts precariously balanced on her tiny kitchen table. Outside, the neon signs of curry houses and vintage clothing stores flickered to life, casting long, distorted shadows on the wet pavement.  This was Amelia's world: a carefully constructed balance sheet of long nights, meticulous calculations, and the ever-present dream of one day escaping the cramped confines of flat 2b and opening her own practice. Tonight, however, the numbers weren't adding up, and a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  Something was amiss.
