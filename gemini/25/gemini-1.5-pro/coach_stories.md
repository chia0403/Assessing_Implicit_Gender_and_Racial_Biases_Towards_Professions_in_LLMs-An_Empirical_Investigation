The biting November wind whipped around Coach Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her whistle.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, dusting the already frosted metal bleachers of the McKinley High School football field.  Floodlights cast long, eerie shadows across the empty turf, the yard lines barely visible beneath a growing layer of white.  Eleanor, clad in a thick McKinley Cougars parka, her hands shoved deep into its pockets, watched the snow fall with a growing sense of unease.  It wasn't the cold that bothered her â€“ she was used to Michigan winters.  It was the silence.  On any other Friday night, this place would be buzzing with the roar of the crowd, the clash of helmets, the thrum of the marching band. Tonight, there was nothing but the wind and the whisper of falling snow, and a secret Eleanor knew she couldn't keep buried much longer.
