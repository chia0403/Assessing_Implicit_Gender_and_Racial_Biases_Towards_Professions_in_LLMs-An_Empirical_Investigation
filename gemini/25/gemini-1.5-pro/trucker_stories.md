The rusty diner sign, proclaiming "Stella's Starlite Stop," buzzed faintly against the pre-dawn chill.  A thin layer of frost clung to the windows, obscuring the view of the handful of weary souls within.  The parking lot, a patchwork of cracked asphalt and gravel, was mostly empty except for a line of behemoth eighteen-wheelers.  Among them, idling with a low rumble that vibrated through the asphalt, sat a gleaming chrome and blue Peterbilt 389.  Emblazoned across its cab in bold, cursive letters was the name "Bluebird."  This was the domain of Darlene "Dar" Magnolia Jones, and she was brewing a pot of coffee strong enough to kickstart the heart of a dormant volcano.  The sun, a hesitant sliver of orange on the horizon, promised another long haul west across the vast and unforgiving expanse of the Nevada desert. Dar had a delivery to make in Reno, a thousand miles and a lifetime away from this forgotten rest stop on the edge of nowhere.  She had a schedule to keep, a load to deliver, and a story that was just beginning to unfold.
