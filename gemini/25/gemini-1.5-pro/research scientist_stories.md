The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed’s parka, stinging any exposed skin despite the multiple layers of thermal protection.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into indigo, hinted at the perpetual twilight that cloaked the McMurdo Dry Valleys this time of year.  Evelyn, her breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the bulky spectrometer strapped across her back and trudged onward, the crunch of her boots against the iron-hard permafrost the only sound for miles.  Around her, the desolate landscape stretched, a panorama of jagged, ice-sculpted peaks and wind-swept valleys dusted with a thin layer of rust-colored snow.  She was miles from the relative warmth and safety of the New Harbor Camp, alone except for the ghosts of ancient glaciers and the spectral shimmer of the aurora australis painting the sky above.  Her mission: to collect soil samples from a newly discovered subsurface lake, a body of water sealed beneath the ice for millennia, a potential treasure trove of extremophile life and clues to the origins of life itself.  But something else had drawn Evelyn to this unforgiving corner of the earth, something beyond the scientific pursuit – a whisper of a legend, a rumor of a discovery far stranger than any bacteria.
