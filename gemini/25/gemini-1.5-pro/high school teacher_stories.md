The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was still shrouded in the inky pre-sunrise darkness.  October had arrived, painting the leaves outside his window in fiery hues of crimson and gold, but inside, Room 214 of Harmony Creek High was a sterile landscape of beige cinderblock and scuffed linoleum. Elias, a man whose neatly trimmed beard and tweed jacket suggested a penchant for order, surveyed the rows of empty desks with a mixture of weariness and anticipation. This was his tenth year teaching English Literature, and while the curriculum remained largely unchanged – Shakespeare, Austen, Dickinson – the faces that filled these desks were a constantly shifting tide.  This year, however, felt different. A strange tension hung in the air of Harmony Creek, a subtle unease that Elias couldn't quite put his finger on. It manifested in whispered conversations in the faculty lounge, in the anxious glances exchanged between students in the hallways, and in the unsettlingly vivid dreams that had been plaguing Elias's sleep.
