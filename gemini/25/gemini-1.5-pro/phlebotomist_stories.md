The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Reyes’s trolley wheels.  It was 6:00 AM, and the pre-dawn gloom clung to the long, sterile corridors of the Hematology ward. Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white coat, pushed her phlebotomy cart with practiced ease, the vials and needles clinking softly within.  Outside, the Chicago sky was beginning to bleed into a bruised purple, hinting at the winter sunrise struggling to break through the heavy clouds. The air within the ward, however, was thick with the metallic tang of antiseptic and the low murmur of hushed conversations – the quiet prelude to another day of hope and heartbreak.  Today, Amelia’s first draw was in room 312, a new patient whose file hinted at a difficult case.  She adjusted her glasses, took a deep breath, and plastered on her most reassuring smile.  Behind the door lay a story waiting to be told, one vein at a time.
