The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry.  The quaint brick building, nestled between Mrs. Higgins' perpetually blooming rose garden and O'Malley's perpetually failing hardware store, cast a long shadow across Maple Street in the drowsy town of Havenwood, Vermont.  Elias adjusted his tweed jacket, the familiar weight comforting against the sudden chill.  Inside his pockets, his fingers brushed against the smooth, cool metal of his dental tools, a habit he'd never quite broken, even after thirty years.  He loved the quiet hum of Havenwood after the workday rush subsided, a tranquility that starkly contrasted with the whirring drills and anxious chatter that filled his days.  But tonight, the silence felt different, heavier, punctuated by a strange unease that prickled the back of his neck.  He dismissed it as fatigue, the result of a particularly challenging root canal earlier that afternoon, and turned to walk towards his Victorian home just two blocks away, unaware that the tranquility of Havenwood was about to be shattered.
