The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried along the cobbled streets of Wick, his worn leather bag slapping against his hip. The late afternoon sun, already low in the sky even for early November, cast long, skeletal shadows from the tightly packed stone houses that lined the harbor. The tang of salt and fish hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that Elias usually found comforting, but today, it did little to soothe the knot of unease tightening in his stomach.  A telegram had summoned him back from a rare visit to his sister in Inverness, a terse message hinting at a mysterious illness spreading through the small, isolated fishing community.  The telegram hadn't named names, but the urgency in its tone had been enough to make Elias cut his visit short and board the first southbound train.  Now, as he approached the flickering gaslight that marked the entrance to his surgery, a chilling premonition settled upon him â€“ something far more sinister than a seasonal flu had come to Wick.
