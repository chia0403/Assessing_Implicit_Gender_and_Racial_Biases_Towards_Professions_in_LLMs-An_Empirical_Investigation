Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the frantic drumming of her fingers against the worn wooden desk.  Loose pages of a manuscript titled "Whispers of the Wyrmwood" swirled around her like agitated autumn leaves. Her apartment, nestled under the eaves of a centuries-old building on London’s cobbled Flask Walk, usually served as a comforting sanctuary. Tonight, however, it felt less like a haven and more like a cage, each tick of the grandfather clock in the corner a hammer blow against the dwindling hours before her deadline.  The air, thick with the scent of old books and brewing Earl Grey, crackled with Amelia’s nervous energy. Outside, the gaslights of Hampstead flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked streets.  The manuscript, a debut fantasy novel brimming with potential but riddled with inconsistencies, was due at the publisher’s first thing in the morning.  And Amelia, despite her reputation as one of London's most meticulous editors, was nowhere near finished.
