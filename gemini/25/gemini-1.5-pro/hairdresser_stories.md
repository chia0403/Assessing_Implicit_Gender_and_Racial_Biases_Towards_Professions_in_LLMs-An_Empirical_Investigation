The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed a tired, lavender glow onto the rain-slicked streets of Abernathy, Pennsylvania. Inside, amidst the chemical scent of perm solution and hairspray, Beatrice Ophelia Higgins sighed, snipping the frayed ends of Mrs. Periwinkle's blue-rinsed bob.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  Beatrice, Bea to her regulars, glanced at the clock â€“ 5:57 pm. Three more minutes until she could lock the door, pull down the blinds, and escape the endless chatter of small-town gossip and the oppressive humidity generated by the ancient, wheezing hairdryer in the corner.  Abernathy might have been picturesque on a postcard, nestled as it was between the Allegheny Mountains, but to Bea, it felt more like a gilded cage.  She yearned for the bright lights and anonymous bustle of a city far, far away, a place where nobody knew her middle name was Ophelia, and where a girl could dream bigger than just the next blue rinse.
