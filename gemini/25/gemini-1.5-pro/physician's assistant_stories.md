The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her breath clouding the air as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  The ancient stone buildings, a patchwork of grey and brown, hunched against the slate-grey sky above the small coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt spray hung in the air, a constant reminder of the restless Atlantic just beyond the hospital walls. Amy clutched her steaming travel mug, its warmth a small comfort against the chill that seemed to seep into her very bones.  The cheerful yellow of the daffodils bravely blooming in window boxes offered a splash of colour against the otherwise monochrome landscape.  Inside, the warmth and the ever-present antiseptic scent awaited, a familiar embrace after the harsh beauty of the Maine coast.  Tonight was Amy's first overnight shift in the ER, and a nervous flutter danced in her stomach, a mix of anticipation and apprehension.  Port Blossom, for all its picturesque charm, held secrets beneath its placid surface, secrets that often found their way through the double doors of St. Jude's emergency room.
