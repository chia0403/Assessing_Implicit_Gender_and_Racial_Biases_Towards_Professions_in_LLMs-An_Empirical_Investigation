The aroma of Elmer's glue and stale Goldfish crackers hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Miss Amelia Periwinkle had come to associate with the cusp of autumn.  Sunshine streamed through the large, rainbow-splattered windows of Room 3B, illuminating the chaos within.  Tiny handprints, some smeared with glittery paint, decorated almost every surface, even the ceiling fan where a particularly ambitious student had, with the help of a juice box straw, managed to lodge a construction paper butterfly.  Outside, the wind rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over the playground of Maplewood Elementary, hinting at the cooler days to come.  Amelia, however, felt a warmth spread through her chest as twenty miniature Picassos, clad in paint-splattered smocks, shrieked with delight while attempting to glue googly eyes onto their paper plate pumpkins.  This was her kingdom, her happy chaos, and she wouldn't trade it for the world.
