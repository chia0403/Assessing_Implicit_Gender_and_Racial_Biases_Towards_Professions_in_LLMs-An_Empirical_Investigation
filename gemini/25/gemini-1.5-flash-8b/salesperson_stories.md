The chipped Formica counter gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Everything for the Backyard" superstore.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic rhythm in Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's chest.  She adjusted the tie-dye hammock strung precariously across her neck, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the beige and brown uniformity of the store.  Today was the day.  Today, Amy, a dedicated, if slightly frazzled, salesperson at the "Beyond the Fence" section, was going to close the deal on the "Ultimate Backyard Oasis" package â€“ a sprawling combination of inflatable dinosaurs, a pre-fab tiki bar, and a surprisingly realistic-looking fake waterfall.  The customer, Mr. Henderson, was due any minute.
