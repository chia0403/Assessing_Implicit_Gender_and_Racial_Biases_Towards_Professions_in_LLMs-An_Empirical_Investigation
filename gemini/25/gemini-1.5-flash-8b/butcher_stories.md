The chill of the November air, sharp and biting, sliced through the worn leather of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's apron.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering gas lamp hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the gloom of "Grimshaw's Good Cuts," a butcher shop nestled on the cobbled alleyway between the Grand Market and the Weaver's Quarter.  The scent of aged cheese and roasting meat mingled with the sharp tang of blood, a familiar symphony that punctuated the otherwise quiet hum of the city.  Barty, his face weathered and etched with the stories of countless slaughtered animals, meticulously trimmed a sirloin, his keen knife humming a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of metal on metal.  Every cut was precise, every slice a testament to years of dedication and honed skill.  Tonight, however, the usual murmur of the city seemed muted, the low thrum of the unseen, almost imperceptible.
