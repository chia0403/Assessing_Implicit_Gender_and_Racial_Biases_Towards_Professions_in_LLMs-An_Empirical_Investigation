The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a relentless, buzzing soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Vance's life, thrummed around her.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and cheap coffee, hung heavy in the small, unassuming office tucked away on a side street of bustling Anytown, a town that seemed to exist solely to provide the backdrop for lives lived largely on autopilot.  Eleanor, a chiropractor with a name that echoed the quiet dignity of her practice, adjusted her glasses, the thin metal frames digging slightly into the bridge of her nose.  Each creak of the worn vinyl chairs and the muted sighs that punctuated the room's stillness felt like a tiny, insistent pressure, a reminder of the physical burdens carried by the people who sought her help.  Today, it was a man named Mr. Henderson, a wiry, stooped figure whose posture spoke volumes about the years spent hunched over a desk, who sat waiting. The subtle, almost imperceptible shift of his shoulders under his faded suit jacket, a small, involuntary tremor, caught her eye.  She felt it too, in the way the world pressed down, a subtle but insistent weight on her own shoulders.  This was her life, a quiet symphony of adjustments, a delicate dance with pain and healing.
