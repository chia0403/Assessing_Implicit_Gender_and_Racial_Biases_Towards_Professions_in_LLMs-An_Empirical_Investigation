The fluorescent lights of the high school cafeteria hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the clatter of trays and the low murmur of teenage voices.  Dust motes danced in the harsh, overhead glare, illuminating the swirling chaos of chipped paint, spilled juice, and the lingering scent of cheap coffee.  This was the usual Tuesday at the bustling halls of Northwood High, and for Amelia Blackwood, guidance counselor extraordinaire, it was just another day in the trenches of adolescent angst.  A half-eaten sandwich sat untouched on her tray, a testament to the endless stream of student concerns that had already flooded her morning.  Her mind was already compiling a mental list of issues: the impending college applications, the social drama simmering under the surface of polite smiles, the whispered rumors about a potential altercation involving the football team.  Amelia sighed, the familiar weight of responsibility settling heavily upon her shoulders.  She knew the answer to none of the pressing issues would be easily found.  This was just another day in the life of a guidance counselor.
