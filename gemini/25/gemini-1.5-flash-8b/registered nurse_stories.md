The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Hawthorne's bones.  The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood and the faint, acrid smell of something burning.  A rhythmic clatter of medical equipment punctuated the low murmur of worried voices, all swirling around her like a tempest.  Amelia, a Registered Nurse with a practiced calm that masked a simmering anxiety, worked the ER at St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling institution that seemed to swallow the city's ills whole.  The walls, painted a pale, almost ghostly white, reflected the frenetic energy of the night shift.  It was the kind of night where every gurney was a ticking time bomb, each patient a silent plea for help. Tonight, it was more intense than usual.  The city was experiencing an unusual number of heat stroke cases, a phenomenon that had baffled the medical professionals.  As the night wore on, the weight of the situation pressed down on Amelia. This wasn't just a collection of cases; it felt like the city's very pulse was in danger of overheating, mirroring the escalating anxieties of the individuals in her care.
