The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige-grey from years of lukewarm water and forgotten dishes, reflected Elara Blackwoodâ€™s weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of the grand manor, illuminating the dust bunnies clinging to the worn Persian rug like miniature, ghostly creatures.  The air, thick with the scent of old books and faded floral wallpaper, hung heavy and still.  Elara, her name echoing faintly in the echoing halls, sighed, the sound swallowed by the silent grandeur of Blackwood Manor.

Setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic-style estate nestled deep within the whispering woods bordering the secluded village of Oakhaven.  Built generations ago by a reclusive industrialist, the manor now stood, a monument to both opulence and neglect.  Its vast, shadowy rooms, filled with antique furniture and ornate tapestries, hinted at a life lived in extravagant comfort, a life now slowly being swallowed by the creeping silence of time and decay.  The grounds, once meticulously manicured, were now overgrown, the towering oaks and ancient pines reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers, guarding the secrets of the manor. A constant, ethereal mist clung to the forest floor, lending an unsettling atmosphere to the already imposing structure.
