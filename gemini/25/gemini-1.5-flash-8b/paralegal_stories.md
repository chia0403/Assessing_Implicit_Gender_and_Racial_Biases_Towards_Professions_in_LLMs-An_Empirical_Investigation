The flickering fluorescent lights of the law firm hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hayes's fingers on the keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the swirling chaos of legal documents piled high on her desk.  Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Sterling, specialised in corporate mergers and acquisitions, a world of complex jargon and even more complex personalities.  Today, however, her usually organised world was tilting precariously.  Not only was she drowning in a mountain of paperwork for the impending acquisition of "Acme Industries," but also she was wrestling with a growing sense of unease, a feeling that something – or someone – was deeply amiss.  The air in the office, usually thick with the scent of stale coffee and legal pads, felt heavy, almost suffocating. Outside, the city thrummed with a frantic energy that seemed to mimic the frenetic pace within the walls of the towering skyscraper.


Setting:  A bustling, glass-fronted skyscraper in the heart of a major metropolis.  The interior of Sterling & Sterling, a high-powered law firm, is a stark contrast to the city's vibrant exterior.  The imposing architecture and opulent decor, designed to inspire confidence and power, ironically juxtaposes with the relentless pressure and frenetic pace of daily life, and the atmosphere of the firm, while appearing impressive, is actually tense and filled with unspoken anxieties.
