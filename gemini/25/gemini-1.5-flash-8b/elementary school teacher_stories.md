The chipped paint on the classroom walls, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to hum with the restless energy of the thirty first-graders.  Amelia "Amy"  Fitzgerald, a young elementary school teacher with a perpetually smudged eyeliner and a heart full of fervent enthusiasm, surveyed the chaos.  Crayon shavings littered the floor, discarded like fallen confetti.  Paper airplanes, miniature works of art in their own right, zipped through the air, narrowly missing heads and overflowing trashcans.  This was Tuesday, and the children had unleashed their creative storm, ready to conquer the day, or at least, the remaining half-hour until recess.  Amy, a whirlwind of organized chaos in her own right, loved it, but also understood the subtle symphony of quiet screams and whispers that needed to be managed, orchestrated, and finally, harmonized.


The setting:  Room 212, a sun-drenched corner classroom at Oakhaven Elementary, a public school nestled in the heart of a small, but rapidly growing, suburban town.  The year is 2024.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, painting shifting patterns across the colourful posters that adorned the walls:  "Kindness is Contagious," "Believe in Yourself," and a particularly vibrant "Love Reading."  A faint aroma of cinnamon and something vaguely floral drifted in from the nearby cafeteria, a siren song to the rumbling tummies of her eager students.
