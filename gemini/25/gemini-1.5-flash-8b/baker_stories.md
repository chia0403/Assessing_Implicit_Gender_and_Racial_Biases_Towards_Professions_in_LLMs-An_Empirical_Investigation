Today, however, a new secret, unwelcome and threatening, was stirring in the warmth of the oven, ready to burst forth.  The bakery, usually a haven of quiet comfort, felt strangely charged, and Amelia knew, with a shiver that had nothing to do with the autumnal chill, that something was about to change.
