The aroma of stale coffee and burnt bacon hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sharp scent of antiseptic that clung to the remnants of the spilled whiskey on the counter.  Ace, a private investigator with a reputation as sharp as her tailored trench coat, stared out the grimy window at the deserted street.  The flickering neon sign of the "Silent Siren" burlesque club cast a lurid glow on the puddles, reflecting the disquiet in her eyes.  This was the heart of Blackwood, a town steeped in secrets and whispered histories, and tonight, one of them was about to explode.

The setting: Blackwood, a small, forgotten town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia, clinging to the remnants of its industrial past.  Abandoned factories and rusted mining equipment dotted the landscape like skeletal remains, mirroring the desolate atmosphere of the town itself.  The "Rusty Mug" diner, a greasy spoon hub of the townâ€™s quiet life, was the place to be if you wanted to catch the gossip, the whispers, and the shadows.  A flickering gaslight hung precariously over the diner, illuminating the grime of the counter, the chipped paint of the booths, and the faces of the locals gathered within. Tonight, the shadows were exceptionally thick.
