The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she navigated the narrow, cobbled streets of the Spitalfields district.  London, usually a symphony of bustling activity, felt muted under a relentless gray sky.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and coal smoke, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist, clutched her worn leather satchel, its contents a collection of colourful fabric swatches, brightly-coloured playdough, and the familiar weight of her worn-out but still comforting notepad.

Spitalfields, a once-vibrant tapestry of textile workshops and bustling marketplaces, now bore the marks of industrial decline.  Empty shopfronts stared out at the street, their windows reflecting the bleakness of the season.  The occasional flicker of candlelight from a nearby pub cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the encroaching darkness.  Amelia knew this area well;  the dilapidated tenements housed a population of the elderly and newly disabled, many struggling with the consequences of the Great Depression and the ongoing war that cast a long shadow over Britain. It was here, amongst the crumbling brick facades, that she found her true calling, amidst the quiet desperation and quiet resilience of the city's forgotten corners.
