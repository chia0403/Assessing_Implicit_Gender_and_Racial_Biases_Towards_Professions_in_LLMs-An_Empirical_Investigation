The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Rusty Mug" cast long, distorted shadows across the worn Formica tabletop.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's heart.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug, a dive bar tucked away on the backstreets of  Newhaven, was unusually crowded.  A pre-Christmas rush, she'd surmised, amplified by the lingering chill in the air and a rumour circulating about a local band having a 'secret' gig upstairs.  Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a smile that felt more plastered than genuine, navigated the maze of patrons.  Her uniform, a faded crimson polo shirt, felt like a second skin, stiff against the sweat that clung to her back.  Every clinking glass, every muttered conversation, every request for "another double, and make it a fast one" echoed in the chaotic symphony of the night.  This was her life, this was her rhythm. This, Amy knew, was also a stage, albeit a small one. And tonight, she was hoping for a different script.
