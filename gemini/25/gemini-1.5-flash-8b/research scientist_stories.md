The fluorescent lights of the lab hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Eleanor Vance's boots on the polished concrete floor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated window of the subterranean bio-engineering lab.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, focused intently on the swirling broth in the petri dish.  Around her, rows upon rows of identical tanks pulsed with a soft, ethereal glow.  This wasnâ€™t your typical research facility.  This was the  "Project Chimera" lab, tucked away beneath the sprawling campus of the University of Nova Terra.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and something faintly metallic,  whispered of secrets held deep within the complex.  Eleanor traced the intricate patterns of microscopic filaments within the dish, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Each tiny, pulsating structure held the potential to rewrite the very definition of life. Tonight, she hoped, it held the key to the next breakthrough.
