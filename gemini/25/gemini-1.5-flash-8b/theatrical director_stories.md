Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated "Phoenix Theatre," a building swallowed by the creeping vines of a neglected city park.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom from a broken skylight, illuminating the chipped paint and faded posters advertising long-forgotten plays.  This was the domain of Isolde "Izzy" Blackwood, a theatrical director whose passion burned as fiercely as the flickering gas lamps illuminating the street outside.  Izzy, with her unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping its haphazard braid, surveyed the backstage chaos.  Empty, battered props lay scattered like fallen soldiers, and the air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and forgotten dreams.  The theatre, once a vibrant hub of community, had fallen silent, choked by the indifference of time and the apathy of the city council. Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, Izzy was determined to bring the phoenix back to life.
