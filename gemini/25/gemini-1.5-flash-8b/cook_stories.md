The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey from years of lukewarm water and spilled flour, reflected Elara Nightingale's worried face.  The faint scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a cruel parody of the comforting vanilla custard she'd been meticulously crafting for Lady Ashworth's upcoming tea party.  Elara, a cook for the aristocratic Nightingale household for the past ten years, knew the scent of burnt sugar meant disaster.  Not just a burnt dessert, but a damaged reputation.  And Lady Ashworth, notoriously unforgiving, was known to wield a sharper tongue than any kitchen knife.

The grand hall of Blackwood Manor, where the party was to be held, stretched before Elara in a hazy impression through the grimy window.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the ornate mahogany furniture and tapestries depicting long-dead knights.  A symphony of clinking silverware and hushed voices drifted from within, a world Elara only glimpsed through the kitchen door, a world she now feared entering with her blackened custard.  The aroma of roasting pheasant, rosemary sprigs tucked into the bubbling gravy, mingled with the acrid burnt sugar, creating a disconcerting olfactory conflict.  Elara knew the scent of success and the scent of failure, and tonight, the latter was far too dominant.
