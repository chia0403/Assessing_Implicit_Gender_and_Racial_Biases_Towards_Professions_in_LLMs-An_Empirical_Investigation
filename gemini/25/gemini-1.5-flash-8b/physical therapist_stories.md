Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The small, unassuming physiotherapy practice, nestled in the shadow of the towering, grey Victorian spire of St. Jude's Church, seemed to vibrate with the storm's energy.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth. Amelia, a physical therapist with a cascade of dark hair escaping her well-worn scrubs, hunched over a patient’s chart, the flickering fluorescent lights casting long, dancing shadows across the room.  The wind howled outside, a mournful dirge that seemed to echo the patient’s own silent pain.  Amelia traced the precise notations of the patient's file, their name –  Elias Thorne – etched in sharp, italic script – a name that, for reasons she couldn't quite articulate, resonated a chilling familiarity.
