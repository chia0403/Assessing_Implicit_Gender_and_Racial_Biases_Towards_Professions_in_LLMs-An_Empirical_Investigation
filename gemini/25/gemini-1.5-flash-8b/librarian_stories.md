The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air.  Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting a celestial tapestry, painted intricate patterns on the polished oak floor of the library.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the towering shelves that reached almost to the vaulted ceiling, holding within their embrace the silent stories of centuries. Amelia, a librarian with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a smile that crinkled the corners of her face, traced a finger along the spine of a leather-bound volume titled "Chronicles of the Whispering Woods."  It was a book she’d been drawn to inexplicably, a book she knew held a secret she was meant to uncover.  The library, the heart of Oakhaven, hummed with a quiet energy, a symphony of rustling pages and the soft click of the revolving catalogue. But today, a different kind of hum filled the air, a low, almost imperceptible thrumming that resonated deep within the very stones of the building. Something was stirring.  This wasn’t just another day in Oakhaven, nestled between whispering pines and a forgotten river winding its way through the heart of the forest. This day, something ancient and powerful was stirring from its slumber.
