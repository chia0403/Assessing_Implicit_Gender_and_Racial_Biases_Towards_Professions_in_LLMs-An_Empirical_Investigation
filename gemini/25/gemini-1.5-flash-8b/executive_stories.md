The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation boardroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Hawthorne’s high heels on the polished mahogany floor.  Amelia, Vice President of Global Logistics for Zenith, adjusted her perfectly tailored suit jacket, a subtle tremor of anxiety running through her.  Today was the day.  Today, the future of the company, and perhaps her own career, hung precariously in the balance.  The tension in the room, palpable even through the heavy glass walls, mirrored the weight pressing down on her chest.

The boardroom, a cavernous space bathed in the sterile white light, was a stark contrast to the bustling, vibrant city outside its massive windows.  Sleek, modern furniture, upholstered in cool grays and blacks, emphasized the formality of the occasion.  A long, polished table stretched the length of the room, its surface reflecting the faces of Zenith's board members—a formidable group of seasoned executives, each with their own agenda, their own unspoken calculations.  A small, discreet display screen, hidden behind a meticulously arranged vase of lilies, flickered with the projected holographic image of a global shipping network, a complex web of routes and ports that represented the very lifeblood of Zenith.  The air, thick with the scent of expensive cologne and fear, hung heavy, suffocating even within the spacious confines of the room.
