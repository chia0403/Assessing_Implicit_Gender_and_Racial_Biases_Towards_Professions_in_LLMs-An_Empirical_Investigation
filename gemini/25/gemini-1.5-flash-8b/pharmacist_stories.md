The fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the gentle clinking of Amelia Blackwood's stirring spoon.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and antiseptic, swirled around her, carrying the faintest whisper of something else â€“ something faintly metallic, like old, polished silver.  Amelia, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of warm honey and hands surprisingly steady despite the frenetic rhythm of the evening rush, meticulously measured out a dose of chamomile tea extract.  It was a routine Tuesday night at the small, family-run pharmacy nestled on the edge of Blackwood's Hollow, a town clinging to the shadows of the surrounding forest.  The town itself felt like a forgotten relic of a bygone era, its cobbled streets echoing with the ghosts of whispered secrets and the rustling leaves of ancient oaks. The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the synthetic perfumes of the modern world that drifted in on the rare passing car.  Outside, the moon hung like a silver coin in the inky sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the neatly-manicured lawns.
