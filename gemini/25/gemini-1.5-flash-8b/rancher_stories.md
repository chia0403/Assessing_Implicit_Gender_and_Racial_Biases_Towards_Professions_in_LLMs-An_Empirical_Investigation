The wind, a relentless prairie rasp, whipped across the parched earth, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust devils, the color of burnt umber, danced across the vast expanse of the Blackwood Ranch, their swirling shadows mocking the dwindling light of the late afternoon sun.

The Blackwood Ranch, a sprawling domain of weathered corrals, creaking barns, and rusted fences, felt desolate, even empty, despite the undeniable presence of her loyal herd, scattered like specks of ebony and brown against the endless expanse of ochre and grey.  Today, however, their usual lowing and bleating were drowned out by a growing unease, a whispering dread that seemed to seep from the very earth beneath her boots.  The air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and something elseâ€¦ something metallic and acrid, hung heavy, pressing in on her like a physical weight. This was not the familiar, lonely silence of the high plains; this was a silence pregnant with secrets.
