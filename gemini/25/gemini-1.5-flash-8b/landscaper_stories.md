The midday sun beat down on Alistair Finch-Featherstonehaugh, a name as meticulously crafted as the meticulously pruned boxwood hedges he tended.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, clinging to the fine linen of his shirt, despite the constant hum of the air conditioning unit tucked discreetly into the gazebo.  The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and damp earth, hung heavy over the sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth, a man whose wealth seemed to rival the grandeur of the meticulously manicured gardens he controlled.  Alistair, however, felt a different kind of weight â€“ a knot of unease tightening in his stomach, a feeling as unnatural as a stray dandelion poking up through a meticulously crafted lawn.

Setting:  Ashworth Manor, nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.  The sprawling estate, an architectural marvel of stone and slate, commanded the landscape.  The formal gardens, a testament to generations of meticulous upkeep, showcased a kaleidoscope of colour and form.  Hidden amongst the meticulously crafted flowerbeds and topiary, however, lay shadowed corners and forgotten pathways, hinting at a history both elaborate and potentially unsettling.
