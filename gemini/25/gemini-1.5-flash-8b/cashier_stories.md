The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Nothing You Don't" supermarket hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's life.  She'd been a cashier there for seven years, her existence a carefully calibrated dance between pre-packaged cereal boxes and the weary sighs of elderly shoppers.  Today, however, the symphony was slightly off-key.  A persistent buzz, not of the fluorescent lights, but of something else, a low, almost imperceptible tremor, thrummed beneath her feet.

The store itself was a sprawling cavern of beige and fluorescent yellow.  Aisles snaked through mountains of processed food, each one a miniature, silent testament to consumerist society.  Canned goods lined the walls, their labels, slick and vibrant, promising culinary adventures nobody ever quite fulfilled.  Overhead, a flickering security light cast long, dancing shadows over the shelves, highlighting the dust motes that drifted in the stale air.  The aroma of stale bread and disinfectant hung heavy, a constant reminder of the mundane.  The only splash of colour came from the plastic flowers in the floral display, their plastic petals perpetually drooping, mirroring the wilted energy of the shoppers.
