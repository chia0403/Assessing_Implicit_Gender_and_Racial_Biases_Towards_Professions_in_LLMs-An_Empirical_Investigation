The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet counterpoint to the faint scent of jasmine drifting in from the neighbour's balcony.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Sugar Rush," a tiny bakery tucked away on a side street of the bustling, historic district of Old Southwark.  Inside, Amelia "Amy"  Butterworth, her apron stained a delicate shade of burnt caramel, glared at the blackened remains of a planned masterpiece: a three-tiered wedding cake destined for the lavish celebration of Lord Ashworth's daughter.  A single, shimmering shard of sugared rose, nestled precariously on the debris, was the only testament to her earlier, meticulous artistry.

The setting: 1888.  Old Southwark, a maze of narrow cobbled streets, overflowing with the smells of roasting meat, brewing porter, and the rich perfume of exotic spices. Gaslights flickered erratically, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the afternoon drizzle.  Crowds bustled along the main thoroughfare, their chatter and laughter a constant, albeit indistinct, hum.  Amy, perched on a wobbly stool at her small, cluttered worktable, felt the weight of disappointment pressing down on her as heavy as the storm clouds gathering above.  Not just disappointment in the ruined cake, but a deeper, more insidious feeling of being ill-prepared, an unsettling feeling that she was not quite good enough.  The pressure to deliver excellence, to craft perfect edible art for the elite, was a constant, often crushing, weight.
