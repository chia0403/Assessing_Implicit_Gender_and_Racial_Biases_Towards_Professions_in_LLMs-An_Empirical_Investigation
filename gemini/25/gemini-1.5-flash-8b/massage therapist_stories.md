The aroma of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a fragrant veil obscuring the chipped paint of the walls and the faded floral wallpaper.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Spa, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle hum of the massage table beneath Amelia Nightingale.  Amelia, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as they were delicate, was in the midst of a particularly tense session.  Her client, a woman named Eleanor Vance, who had been a regular for years, was clenching her jaw with a force that mirrored the storm outside.

Setting: Serenity Spa, a small, somewhat dilapidated massage parlor tucked away on a rain-slicked side street of the bustling city of Oakhaven.  The city's energy, a constant thrumming of traffic and sirens, is muted only by the tranquil, albeit slightly worn, ambiance within the spa.  The scent of rain-soaked earth mixes with the therapeutic oils and the faint echoes of a distant, melancholic melody played on a battered gramophone.
