The biting wind whipped at Amelia Blackwood's worn jacket, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the frozen expanse of the hockey rink.  A thin layer of frost clung to the worn boards, mirroring the icy grip tightening around her heart.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending winter, carried the faint, almost forgotten, echo of laughter from the nearby town square.  It was a stark contrast to the silence that pressed in around the half-empty arena, a silence that reflected the agonizing reality of the season.  Tonight's game, the final one of the season, was a must-win for the  'Northern Lights' â€“ but the players seemed more like ghosts, their usual electric energy replaced by a muted apprehension.  Amelia,  Head Coach of the Northern Lights youth hockey team, knew this feeling. It wasn't just the players she had to motivate, it was her own depleted spirit, too.  She had poured her heart and soul into this team for three long years, yet the team's record was still wavering, a fragile blossom in the teeth of a cruel winter storm.
