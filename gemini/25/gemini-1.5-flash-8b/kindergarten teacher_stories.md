The chipped paint on the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded shade of robin's egg blue, seemed to whisper secrets of countless past afternoons.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty window panes, painted fractured patterns across the floor where Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, a kindergarten teacher with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of a thousand tiny anxieties, knelt beside a small, shivering figure.  The child, Leo Vance, was clutching a broken wooden train engine, his lip trembling.

The year was 1982.  The air, thick with the scent of crayons and forgotten glue, hung heavy in the small, prefabricated building nestled in the quiet cul-de-sac of Oakhaven, a suburb perpetually caught between the hum of industry and the hushed whispers of childhood dreams.  The rhythmic clatter of the nearby construction site, a relentless, jarring counterpoint to the gentle rhythm of the classroom, was a familiar soundtrack to Amy's life.  She knew the sound as well as the faces of the thirty little ones who filled her room each day.  Each of their struggles, their triumphs, were etched into the very fabric of this particular Tuesday.
