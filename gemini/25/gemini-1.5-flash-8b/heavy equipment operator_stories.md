The biting wind whipped across the exposed plains of the Dakotas, stinging Amelia "Amy"  Harding's cheeks as she checked the gauges on the massive bulldozer.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling like miniature tornadoes around the hulking machine, a testament to the relentless summer heat baking the landscape.

The horizon, a hazy line of burnt orange and fading violet, blurred the distinction between the earth and the sky.  Scattered, dilapidated farmhouses, ghostly sentinels against the relentless sun, stood as silent reminders of a vanished agrarian era.
