The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Coil" cast a sickly yellow glow over Elias Thorne's greasy apron, highlighting the grime that clung to his work-worn hands.  The air hung thick with the smell of solder, burnt popcorn, and the faint, metallic tang of ozone.  He was alone in the cramped workshop, the only sound the rhythmic hiss of the ancient vacuum tubes in the radio receiver he was meticulously dismantling.  Elias Thorne, a radio technician of no particular renown, but possessed of a fierce dedication to the arcane art of crackling signals, hunched over the antique equipment.

The workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the sprawling, industrial city of Aethelgard, was a testament to bygone eras.  Stacks of dusty crates overflowed with parts, each a whisper of forgotten broadcasts and whispered secrets. Cobwebs draped like ghostly shrouds from the exposed rafters, their sticky threads snagging the faintest glimmer of light filtering through the grime-coated windows.  A single, bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows on the tools scattered across the workbenches.  The city outside, a symphony of honking taxis and the rhythmic clang of factory machinery, faded into a muted hum beyond the thick walls of the workshop.  Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis steeped in industrial history, pulsed with a restless energy, but here, within the confines of the Rusty Coil, time seemed to stand still.
