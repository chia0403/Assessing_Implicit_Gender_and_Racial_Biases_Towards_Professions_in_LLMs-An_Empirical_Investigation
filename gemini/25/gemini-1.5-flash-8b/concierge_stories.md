The scent of jasmine, thick and sweet, clung to the air in the opulent lobby of the Astor Grand Hotel.  Rain hammered against the enormous plate-glass windows, blurring the already-faint cityscape into a swirling grey.

Eleanor, with her perpetually poised posture and unwavering composure, was a study in quiet efficiency. Tonight, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. The air, heavy with anticipation, vibrated with a silent hum of unspoken anxieties, a prelude to the storm brewing beyond the polished floor.  A sudden, sharp chime from the hotel's grand entrance echoed through the space, momentarily silencing the relentless rhythm of the rain.  A new guest.  And Eleanor, the silent guardian of the Astor's secrets, felt the weight of her responsibilities pressing down upon her.
