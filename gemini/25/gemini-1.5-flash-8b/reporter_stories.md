The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's reporter's notebook into a frenzy, rattling against the metal frame of her battered, olive-green backpack.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of salt and the acrid smell of burning plastic, hung heavy over the deserted docks of Port Veridian.  Rain, the consistency of gritty gravel, hammered against the corrugated iron sheds, each thud echoing through the silent expanse.  

Port Veridian, a once-bustling fishing village nestled on the windswept coast of the Isle of Alder, was now a ghost town.  The fishing fleet, the backbone of the community, had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only the skeletal remains of their boats and the haunting silence of a town left to rot.  Amy, a tenacious young reporter for the *Alder Islander Gazette*, had arrived three days ago, driven by the whispers circulating through the remaining residents: a missing fleet, an unexplained silence, and a strange luminescence emanating from the sea at night.

The only sign of life beyond the relentless downpour was a flickering lantern, casting long shadows across the muddy ground.  Inside the dilapidated captain's house, a lone figure huddled by a sputtering fire, stirring a pot of something that smelled suspiciously like burnt seaweed.  This was old Captain Silas Blackwood, the last remaining member of the once-thriving fishing community.  Amy knew her investigation had only just begun.
