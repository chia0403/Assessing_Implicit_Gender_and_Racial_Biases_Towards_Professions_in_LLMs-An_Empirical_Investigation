The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow where spilled coffee had long ago met its demise, reflected the fluorescent hum of the accounting office.  Dust motes danced in the meager light, illuminated by the lonely flicker of a single overhead bulb.  Agnes Periwinkle, bookkeeper extraordinaire (or, at least, that's what her meticulously organized filing system implied), hunched over her ancient laptop, the screen displaying rows upon rows of figures that seemed to writhe and twist before her eyes.  The year was 1998.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, acrid tang of desperation, hung heavy in the small, cramped office nestled in the back of a dilapidated warehouse complex on the outskirts of Metropolis.  Empty cardboard boxes, remnants of a recent office reorganization, lay scattered like forgotten soldiers on the floor.
