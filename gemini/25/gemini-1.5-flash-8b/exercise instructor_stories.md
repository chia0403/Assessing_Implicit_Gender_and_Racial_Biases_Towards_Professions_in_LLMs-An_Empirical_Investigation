Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Sweat Equity" gym, a rhythmic counterpoint to the thump-thump-thump of Amelia Nightingale's heart.  The fluorescent lights, flickering erratically, cast long, dancing shadows across the splattered concrete floor.  Amelia, a woman whose sculpted arms and toned legs belied her 32 years,  wiped sweat from her brow, her dark hair plastered to her temples.  Today's spin class was a particularly challenging one, the instructor pushing the boundaries beyond what even the most dedicated of her regulars could handle.  The scent of ozone, mingled with the metallic tang of blood and desperation, hung heavy in the air. Sweat Equity, nestled in the heart of the industrial wasteland that had once been the city's bustling downtown, was not your typical fitness haven.  It was a refuge, a sanctuary built on sweat and grit, and a place where pushing your limits was not just encouraged, but celebrated.
