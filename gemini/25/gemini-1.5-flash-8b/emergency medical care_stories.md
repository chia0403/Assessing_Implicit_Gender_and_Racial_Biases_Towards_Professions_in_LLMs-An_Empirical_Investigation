Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude's Clinic, mimicking the frantic drumming in Dr. Elara Vance's chest.  The small, overcrowded clinic, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, smelled faintly of antiseptic and simmering chai.  Dusty, brightly-coloured prayer flags fluttered from the surrounding rock faces, a stark contrast to the grim reality unfolding within.  Fluorescent lights flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows on the worn linoleum floor.  The air, usually thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, was now charged with the metallic tang of blood.  Outside, the ceaseless rain obscured the already treacherous mountain path, isolating the clinic from the rest of the world.  Tonight, that isolation felt like a trap.
