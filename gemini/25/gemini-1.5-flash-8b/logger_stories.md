The biting wind, a serrated knife slicing through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, whipped at Elias Blackwood's face.  He pulled his worn leather cap tighter, the brim obscuring half his weathered features.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, clung to him, clinging to the raw wood of the axe he gripped, a familiar weight in his calloused hand.  He stood on the precipice of the towering, glacier-carved peaks of the Copper Ridge, a place where the sky seemed to scrape the earth.  The jagged peaks, often shrouded in swirling grey clouds, mirrored the turmoil brewing within Elias.

Setting: The Copper Ridge, a remote and rugged mountain range in the northern reaches of the Cascadian Mountains.  Deep within the wilderness, the forest is a dense, almost impenetrable labyrinth of towering evergreens, rushing streams, and ancient, mossy boulders.  Hidden valleys, choked with dense undergrowth and blanketed in perpetual twilight, are home to secretive creatures and whispering legends. The harsh beauty of the mountains reflects the solitary life of the logger, Elias Blackwood. The rugged terrain and unpredictable weather test the strength of both man and nature.  Elias and his small crew, isolated from the outside world, navigate this unforgiving environment, carving out a living from the heart of the wilderness.  Each felled tree tells a story of their struggle and resilience, each path etched with the price of their ambition.
