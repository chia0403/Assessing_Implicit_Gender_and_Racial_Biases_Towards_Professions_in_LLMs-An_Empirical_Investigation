The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded lavender from years of lukewarm water and the inevitable drips, reflected Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes of his tiny shop, "The Clipper's Cut."  Cobwebs, thick as spun sugar, draped like ghostly shrouds from the faded floral wallpaper, clinging to the faded portraits of local dignitaries, their smiles frozen in expressions of stiff-necked propriety.  The air, thick with the scent of barbershop balm and stale cigarette smoke, hung heavy over the cluttered shelves overflowing with razors, combs, and forgotten bottles of hair tonic.  Barty, a man whose own once-vibrant auburn hair was now a streaked tapestry of greys and browns, sighed, running a calloused hand through his thinning locks.  Today was Tuesday, the slowest day of the week.  Another Tuesday bled into another, mirroring the slow, measured rhythm of the town itself, a town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, clinging to the whispers of yesterday while desperately searching for tomorrow.  The rhythmic clack of the old-fashioned barber's chair, a fixture of the shop for over half a century, echoed the persistent beat of his own weary heart.
