The chipped paint of the "Artist's Haven" sign, a faded, ochre-yellow against the slate grey of the corrugated iron roof, seemed to mock Elara Nightingale.  Rain hammered relentlessly against the corrugated metal, mirroring the relentless drumming in her head. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of linseed oil and despair.  Elara, her name echoing the fragile beauty of a rare bird, hunched over her easel, the canvas a blank, unforgiving expanse of white.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the little studio.

This wasn't the vibrant, sun-drenched atelier of her dreams.  The Artist's Haven, tucked away on the outskirts of the town of Ashwood, was a cramped space, more a haven of neglect than inspiration.  Cobwebs, like ghostly filaments, clung to the corners of the high-ceilinged room, and the worn wooden floorboards groaned under her weight.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, as if mourning the death of her latest painting, a stillborn masterpiece. Ashwood itself, with its grey skies and melancholic river winding through the valley, seemed to share the weight of her disappointment. The town's inhabitants were a muted collection of souls, their lives as grey and unchanging as the endless drizzle. Elara felt an uncanny kinship with the fog that clung to the valley, a sense of being both utterly alone and irrevocably bound to this place.
