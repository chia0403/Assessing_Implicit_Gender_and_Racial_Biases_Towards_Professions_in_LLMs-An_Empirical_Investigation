The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em"  Rosewater's lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of the Northwood Community Clinic.  The fluorescent lights of the building, a stark rectangle against the bruised twilight sky, seemed to mock the chill seeping into her bones.  It was a Tuesday, a day usually filled with the low hum of medical chatter and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards, but tonight, the clinic was eerily silent, save for the mournful howl of a distant coyote.  Em, a physician's assistant at the clinic, knew this eerie quiet. It was the kind that clung to the air like a shroud, promising trouble.

Emâ€™s boots crunched on the icy gravel.  The clinic, nestled between a sprawling housing development and a dense forest, stood as a silent sentinel, its windows dark except for one, a single, warm amber glow on the third floor. That glow held the only trace of human presence in the deepening cold.  It was the office of Dr. Aris Thorne, her supervising physician, the enigmatic figure who, for the past year, had been the heartbeat of the clinic, and the only person Em knew who felt as deeply entrenched in the quiet desperation of the Northwood community.
