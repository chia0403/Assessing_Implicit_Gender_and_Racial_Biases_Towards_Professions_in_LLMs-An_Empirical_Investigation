The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the village of Oakhaven.  Rain, the consistency of fine gravel, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorneâ€™s workshop, a space more battered than most of the weathered houses lining the cobbled streets.  Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands calloused and stained the deep ochre of redwood, hunched over a workbench overflowing with half-finished projects.  A chipped mug of lukewarm ale warmed his numb fingers, barely deflecting the chill that seemed to seep into the very marrow of his bones.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the gloom settling over Oakhaven, a village clinging stubbornly to life on the windswept edge of the whispering moor.  His workshop, a testament to years of quiet craftsmanship, was a sanctuary of wood and sawdust, but tonight, even the comforting scent of pine couldn't quell the deepening despair.  He'd been struggling to find work for weeks, the villagers' coffers as empty as the harvest moon, and the silence, broken only by the relentless drumming of rain, felt heavier than any storm.
