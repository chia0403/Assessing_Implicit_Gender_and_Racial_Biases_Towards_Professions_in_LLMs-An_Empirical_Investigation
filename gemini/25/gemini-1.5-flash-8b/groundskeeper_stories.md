The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Em" Blackwood's thin jacket around her as she surveyed the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor.  Dust devils, kicked up by unseen gusts, danced across the meticulously manicured lawns, mirroring the turbulence churning within her.  The once vibrant emerald greens were now muted, the golds and russets of autumn leaves scattered like fallen confetti.  Em, groundskeeper for the Blackwood family for the past fifteen years, felt a familiar pang of melancholy.  This wasn't just a shift in season; it was a shift in the very fabric of the manor.  The whispers had begun, faint rustling noises in the hallways of the estate, but tonight they were louder, sharper, and Em felt them seeping into the earth beneath her boots.  The grand oak trees, sentinels of the property for centuries, seemed to lean in, their gnarled branches groaning with a silent foreboding.  The air hung heavy with unspoken secrets and the scent of impending change.
