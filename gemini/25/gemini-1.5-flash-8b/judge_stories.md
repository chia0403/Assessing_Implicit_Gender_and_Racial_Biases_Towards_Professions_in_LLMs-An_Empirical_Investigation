The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the courtroom, highlighting the dust motes suspended in the air like tiny, spectral demons.  Rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of the Old Bailey, a relentless percussion mirroring the relentless accusations echoing through the stone walls.  Judge Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, QC, a man whose sharp intellect was often mistaken for glacial indifference, adjusted his spectacles, the lenses catching the faint glow.  He surveyed the hushed, expectant faces in the packed courtroom: the defendant, a young woman named Elara Thorne, with eyes that seemed to hold the weight of a thousand unspoken secrets; the prosecution's stern-faced barrister; and the jury, their expressions a blank canvas upon which the drama of the trial was yet to be painted.  The air itself seemed thick with the scent of old leather and the damp earth outside.  The year was 1888, London.
