The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Petrova's hair across her face as she scanned the desolate, windswept plains of the Mongolian steppe.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes, danced across the ochre earth, obscuring the vast horizon.  Anya, her name a whispered tribute to the vibrant, almost mythical quality of the land, adjusted her worn leather jacket.

Her tour group, a small contingent of eager but slightly apprehensive tourists, huddled closer to her, their cameras clicking intermittently as they struggled to capture the stark beauty of the landscape.  Anya, however, wasn't just observing the scene; she felt it, the raw pulse of history beating beneath her feet.
