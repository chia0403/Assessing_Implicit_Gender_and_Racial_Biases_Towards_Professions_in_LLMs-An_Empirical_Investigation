Professor Eleanor Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed to absorb the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun, adjusted her spectacles and peered through the arched window of her office at the sprawling university campus.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of burnt orange and crimson, swirled around the ancient oak trees that lined the gravel paths, their rustling whispers a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic clack of her typewriter.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke from the nearby cottages, held a palpable stillness.  It was a stillness that, for Eleanor, often preceded the storm.  Today, though, it felt…different.  A sense of anticipation, almost palpable, clung to the air, a hush that whispered secrets on the wind.  Her office, nestled within the gothic architecture of Blackwood University’s oldest building, was a study in quiet chaos.  Books overflowed from shelves, overflowing into stacks on the floor.  A half-eaten bowl of granola sat next to a meticulously organized collection of dried botanical specimens.  Eleanor, a renowned botanist specializing in rare desert flora, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  The quiet before the storm was always a prelude to a new discovery, and this one, she sensed, was unlike any she'd encountered before.
