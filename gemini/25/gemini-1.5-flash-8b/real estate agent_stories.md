The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the desolate street, turning the faded beige stucco of the houses into shimmering heat haze.  Dust motes danced in the air, swirling around Amelia "Amy" Carmichael as she navigated the narrow, overgrown lane.  Her name, Amy, felt strangely incongruous amidst the decay, a whisper of vibrancy in a neighborhood consumed by neglect.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with the polished professionalism of a seasoned diplomat, was less at ease in this part of Willow Creek. This wasn't the meticulously landscaped, family-friendly districts she was accustomed to.  This was the "fixer-upper" frontier, a frontier she was tasked with conquering, one dilapidated property at a time.  Today, the objective was 347 Willowbend, a three-story Victorian that had been vacant for three years, rumored to harbor a history as scandalous as its overgrown garden.  The front door, painted a sickly lime green that seemed to mock the surrounding gloom, hung askew on its hinges, a testament to the property's neglect.  A single, tattered, yellowed rose bush clinging to life near the entrance offered a pathetic and fragile resistance to the oppressive silence of the street.
