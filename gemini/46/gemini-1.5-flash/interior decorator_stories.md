The chipped paint on the windowsill was the first thing Seraphina “Sera” Willowbrook noticed, a detail most people would overlook.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime, cast sickly yellow stripes across the opulent Persian rug, a rug that, frankly, screamed "nouveau riche" in a way that was utterly offensive to her refined sensibilities.  Sera, however, wasn't here to judge the aesthetic choices of her client, Mr. Alistair Finch, a man whose wealth was apparently inversely proportional to his taste. She was here to transform this cavernous, yet somehow claustrophobic, drawing-room in Finch Manor – a sprawling Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the tempestuous North Sea – into a space reflecting quiet sophistication.  The salt-laced wind howled outside, a mournful counterpoint to the silent, expectant dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light.  This was going to be a challenge.
